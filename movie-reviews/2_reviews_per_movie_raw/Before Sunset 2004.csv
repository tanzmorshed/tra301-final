"FilmBuff77","10","398","425","19 November 2004"," Absolutely fantastic. Easily the best film of the year.
","There are four scenes that I will treasure forever:<br/><br/>1) The ferry ride, and the subtle ways you can tell they're both heartbroken, lonely, frustrated and angry. The way she discusses the ""little details"" that compose a person, and what she missed most in him. ""Like I remember the way your beard has a bit of red it in, and how the sun was making it glow that...that morning right before you left.""<br/><br/>2) The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen on celluloid. The way she reaches out to touch him, but holds back at the last second. Much different in tone from the way Hawke reached out to brush her hair aside in the first film.<br/><br/>3) Celine's song. So simple yet so endearing. The way her voice fades to a whisper as she sings, ""My heart will be yours until I die.""<br/><br/>4) The ending, which is in all ways **PERFECT**. The slow fade, the utter charm of her Nina Simone impression, the ambiguity, and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth, hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching Celine dancing and singing (foreshadowed in the opening scene). This is, perhaps, one of the ten best endings in the cinema.<br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy are sublime, of course. This film requires incredibly subtle acting, and these are Oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy. Much of this film, like life, is acted with the eyes. Witness how Hawke stares at Delpy as she discusses her failed relationships on the ferry, or the sadness and longing in Delpy's eyes as she sings her love song. <br/><br/>As in the first film, the chemistry between them is indelible. My candidate for best on-screen couple ever.<br/><br/>This film is better than the first, because it provides a more unique perspective. In Sunset, we see the sobering effects of age and disappointment etched in their faces and clouding their lives. There is more at stake here, for they are nine years older, have made their share of mistakes, feel imprisoned by responsibilities, and must confront their shortcomings and problems. It's comforting to believe that hope and love will prevail in their case."
"ivko","10","541","592","13 December 2004"," The only problem...
","...is that it ends. This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says ""nothing that is complete breathes"", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.<br/><br/>The dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren't quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don't miss this film."
"johnnyb-16","10","221","243","29 October 2004"," How do you make a sequel to ""Before Sunrise""? This is how.
","I'd been longing to see this one as I'd always thought 'Before Sunrise' was one of the most honest, most real films I'd ever seen, but at the same time I held off seeing the sequel from fear of disappointment. For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backExquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks."

","Before Sunset is one of those movies, you either love, or you hate.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved it.<br/><br/>Now, I recommend watching ""Before Sunrise"" first, however it isn't necessary. Before Sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened, therefore if you decide to watch it Before watching ""Sunrise"" you have nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>Some scenes are extremely well done. The characters are picture perfect, and the movie itself, is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular, that it will inspire young directors out there, to pick up their video cameras are start filming.<br/><br/>An 80 minute movie, about two lovable characters and what they have to say, may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset, will sweep this impression right off your feet. <br/><br/>Julie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen, they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves, you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.<br/><br/>Julie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely, has potential. <br/><br/>Ethan is also very very honest, he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie, and not a home-made video.<br/><br/>Both play with such honest expression, and such trueness, that they are so natural, Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment, that you never want to leave.<br/><br/>Before Sunset... 9.901/10*****"
"Pantdino","Null","72","77","7 December 2004"," issues Before Sunset brings up
","I suspect that Before Sunset is getting such mixed reviews because it will mean very little to viewers who have not reached the stage of life portrayed in it. To my mind, this is not a romance. Rather, it's a very frank look at how we end up with life partners.<br/><br/>For that reason, it is an important film for twentysomethings to see and is a gift to them from Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy. <br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: <br/><br/>The death of Celine's grandmother brings up two issues: the role of chance and that of our responsibilities to ourselves. Jesse knows Celine missed their planned meeting in Vienna because her grandmother died. But this does not prevent his pained question on the boat, something to the effect of 'Why weren't you there?' He is referring to rotten luck, the dark side of fate that is capable of robbing us of what we most desire. What were the odds that her grandmother would have died within those few days? Tiny. But it led to them not meeting again.<br/><br/>However, Celine still chose to not meet Jesse. Yes, her family may not have understood had she skipped the funeral. But life is for the living, and her grandmother wouldn't have known if she hadn't been there. So Celine must take responsibility for the fact that their lives didn't include each other.<br/><br/>Another precious dialog occurs when they discuss why they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers nine years ago. Celine says it was because they were young and overly optimistic and assumed they'd meet plenty of people with whom they would connect equally well. Are the twentysomethings listening?<br/><br/>Celine expresses a problem many face when she explains why she prefers to have a boyfriend who is away much of the time: she feels suffocated when he is around too long. But she has been depressed since reading Jesse's book because she misses the kind of total intimacy they briefly shared and realizes there is no easy solution to this dilemma. One cannot simultaneously be intimate and distant, and all relationships involve finding a compromise.<br/><br/>Jesse's marriage is an ordinary one. He married his wife because she was smart, pretty, and pregnant, and marriage is about commitment. But even on his way to the church he was thinking of Celine. Are we being warned of the danger of staying in a mediocre relationship? <br/><br/>He says his wife and he are now like coworkers in a preschool, a description that will ring true with many viewers. <br/><br/>So is the lesson that you should throw caution to the wind and sacrifice all for someone who thrills your heart for a day? Before Sunset offers no such easy solution, as Jesse and Celine admit they may have discovered they didn't like each other after all. <br/><br/>As I see it, the primary role of film is to give voice to emotions and aspects of life we all know to be true but are not acceptable to discuss in polite society. In this regard Before Sunset excels. I can't help but think that when Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy decided to do this brief film it was not about profit at all-they simply had some things they thought people should hear, and this was their gift to the public."
"Superunknovvn","8","166","186","19 June 2004"," Linklater, Delpy & Hawke make an impossible sequel work (including minor SPOILERS)
","""Before Sunrise"" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.<br/><br/>Here it is now, the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen, ""Before Sunset"" - made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed, but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. ""Before Sunset"" takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that ""Before Sunset"" might give answers to questions that shouldn't be answered in the first place. If ""Before Sunrise"" was a dream that two young people had, then this movie could only be the rude awakening, the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It's a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see, however, is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday, they have jobs and their future is more or less decided, but they're still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other, it's there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true: their feelings for each other. While they're talking it's like they turn back time and become the young, hopeful people they once were again. I'm getting a bit carried away, but that's the beauty of these two movies, ""Sunrise"" and ""Sunset"". The story sucks you in and you're not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.<br/><br/>Another thing ""Before Sunset"" did, it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously, I have gotten more cynical, because at times I was irritated by Celine's talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to ""bond"" with her character this time around.<br/><br/>Anyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be, and thinking of Hawke's recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene - a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one, ""Before Sunset"" doesn't have a definite ending, though.<br/><br/>It's sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. ""Before Sunset"" has convinced me that it could work."
"film-critic","10","298","340","20 November 2004"," I'm designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!
","I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldn't see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment. In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.<br/><br/>They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own. They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human. From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation. I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did. I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage. It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives. Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked. I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other. It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing. <br/><br/>What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years. His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine. His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love. He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened. You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again. It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see. The same goes for Delpy. At the beginning of this film, I didn't like her character. She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know. As her character grew in this film, I understood why. She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did. While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on. She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity. I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing. Did she remember their night together? Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna? Was the song just for Jesse? So many questions left me wanting more and more and more. <br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him. He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original. He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city. The language in this film is intense. Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives. There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a brilliant film. Linklater captured the essence of these two heart-struck people and proved that it could be filmed. This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over. The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie. This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year. If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out. It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could. I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year. Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris. <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"
"Bob Pr.","10","135","153","14 August 2004"," Wow! Satisfying at so many levels
","I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.<br/><br/>In many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, ""My Dinner with André,"" in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, André Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. ""Before Sunset"" is parallel in many ways.<br/><br/>At one level we have a romantic story -- two people who'd briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they'd started? <br/><br/>At another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.<br/><br/>While Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the ""not-perfect-but-good-enough.""<br/><br/>There are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, ""what would have happened if I'd pursued that relation?"" but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.<br/><br/>The film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.<br/><br/>Delpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must've contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.<br/><br/>GREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it's a great film."
"Chris Knipp","Null","97","112","30 July 2004"," Suave sequel: a new genre is born
","""Before Sunset"" is one of those movies that look superficial, romantic, weepy, crowd-pleasing, but really is original, smart, analytical, and challenging. It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to ""Before Sunrise,"" made nine years earlier, of which it is the sequel, and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. The characters and the actors are older, more experienced and more sophisticated. It's got a documentary element, reminiscent of Michael Apted's wonderful ""7 Up,"" ""14 Up,"" series. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who also stared in ""Before Sunrise,"" don't have to pretend to be nine years older in this sequel; they are. They're only thirty-three now, but Hawke has the ravaged gauntness his breakup with Uma Thurman seems to have imposed on him. Delpy is more mature, less angelic, more businesslike, but still beautiful. <br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is a leaner film than ""Before Sunrise."" It's real-time, and without frills. Venues or backgrounds are simpler. Jesse and Céline largely just walk and talk. <br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy are more accomplished actors; less self-conscious people. The talk flows more effortlessly. The continuity of the scenes is a seamless tour de fource almost as if this were all a single take like Sokorov's ""Russian Ark."" <br/><br/>There isn't flirting or a developing attraction, a growing physical intimacy, as in ""Before Sunset,"" because Jesse and Céline spend most of the film talking about that earlier meeting and how it has haunted them and dominated their lives. Gradually it comes out (particularly during the car ride that leads to where Céline lives) that her current relationship is limited and his marriage is largely sexless, redeemed only by his adoration of his four-year-old son. <br/><br/>She pretends not to remember that they made love that night in Vienna nine years before. Maybe that means their sudden passion never really was consummated, because their affinity wasn't something one night's sex could fulfill. <br/><br/>The premise is this: Jesse has published a novel that's a bestseller in the US and he's doing a signing in Paris. (Hawke's real life identity fits here, since he's published several books.) Suddenly as he's coming to the end of his talk, Céline appears outside the window of the bookstore (which is one every American in Paris knows: Shakespeare & Company). He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours, but his bags are packed and a car is ready, and he and Céline agree to go and talk. She leads him to a café called Le Pure. (This is real time, but not real space: the places where they go are far apart.) Then they take a boat ride on the Seine; finally they get in the car and wind up at Céline's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party.<br/><br/>A movie in real time consisting mostly of conversation is impossible to summarize: it would take twenty pages. But it does emerge that both still think about each other a lot; that meeting nine years before has remained important. The flame still burns bright. Jesse did go back to Vienna six months later in the station to meet Céline as they'd promised, but her grandmother was buried on that day and she couldn't be there. Later he says that perhaps his dream of romantic love was shattered forever by her failure to appear. They rue the fact that they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers. <br/><br/>There's little touching or kissing but there doesn't have to be. It's obvious that this is a climactic reunion for both of them and the attraction is as strong as ever, probably stronger  except that there are obstacles. They're not young and free any more. They have lives, commitments, involvements. . . <br/><br/>What will happen? As the film ends, its obvious Jessie is quite happily going to miss his plane. But while Linklater & Company keep us guessing, the partial answer that comes is quite charming. <br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is a superb sequel. It's touching but surprisingly unsentimental. And it's as graceful a piece of film-making as you could ever see, with the gracefulness of art that conceals artifice. Richard Linklater is one of the most interesting younger American directors. His work is authentic and personal, but has real range, from the slacker movies through the romantic encounters of Delpy and Hawke and the tight theatrical drama ""Tape"" to the inspired philosophical musings and fresh use of animation of ""Waking Life,"" and Hawke has been involved in four of Linklater's movies. Linklater and Hawke are soulmates and brothers, and Delpy is the other essential collaborator in the ""Sunset""/""Sunrise"" sequence, because she too is a writer and wrote her own dialogue and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is too obvious to mention. It's obvious also the audience would like another sequel, and so would the actors. It's only a question of when. The inventive Richard Linklater has created a new genre: the real time sequel."
"agoodfella","Null","33","37","22 December 2004"," A Beautiful Sunset
","The first question I had before seeing Sunset (in fact ever since I heard that Sunset was coming) was: ""Why?""... Why mess with Sunrise given that it was such a great stand alone film... Would they live up to answering the ""what ifs?"" would the chemistry still be there? etc. etc. ... needless to say, I think the answer is a resounding ""yes"".<br/><br/>The film picks up nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine's (Julie Delpy) magical chance encounter in Vienna. This time around we find them in Paris where Jesse is wrapping up a European roadshow to promote his newly published bestseller about (what else?) that one special night. We find them now older (and Ethan looks a bit more worse for wear than Julie), more experienced, more cynical with hearts that have hardened a bit over time in spite of -- or perhaps due to -- the whimsical possibilities of that fateful night nine years prior.<br/><br/>From the outset of the film, the director does a sublime job of drawing the viewer in with long easy takes as Jesse and Celine embark on a stroll from the bookstore to the café - almost seems as if the first exchange is captured by one long uninterrupted take with no cuts (though there are a couple). They ease into their exchange very comfortably. The questions and dialogue have the same, familiar natural feel and tone, and Hawke and Delpy both do an incredible job slipping into their earlier roles - the chemistry has not been lost. The playful sarcasm, the sexual tension, the flirting, the wit, the insecurities. All there.<br/><br/>You can sense the longing that Jesse has (has always had) for Celine from the get-go. In fact, my take even from Sunrise was that Jesse's attraction to Celine was always more stronger - almost as if he ""needed"" her. His vulnerability and ability to ""put it all out there"" - things that guys, in general, have such a hard time doing.<br/><br/>The film moves on to the boat which echoes the scene from Sunrise where Jesse convinces her to take a ride with him. The journey symbolizes a trip to the past where Celine realizes that Jesse's life isn't the picture perfect life that she imagined (i.e. the successful author, the wife and the kid). She almost seems to want to know  needs to have - the affirmation that Jesse still carries a torch for her, even though she (and the viewer) already should KNOW this - because WE know Jesse and his book about ""that one night"" is a tangible testament to that (this is the one plot element which I found a bit annoying).<br/><br/>The car scene is symbolic as well as they are in an enclosed space and need to deal with the things that are bottled up inside - claustrophobic yet no escaping it. They both reveal what they have both always wanted to hear from one another (albeit in different ways and different circumstances), that they have both been truly alone since they last left each other that fateful night in Vienna. The raw emotion, the honesty - incredible moments.<br/><br/>The culmination is the walk up the staircase to Celine's apartment, in relative silence, some things are better left unsaid  the choices, the reasoning, left unsaid. And then Celine's song which symbolizes a lot of things and demonstrates how much Jesse has meant to her even though she has a difficult time saying it in words.<br/><br/>Nine years later, they have of course grown into full adults with all the superficial trappings that come with that  a career, relationships, etc. But, still, they are both drawn to ""that one fateful night"", and the redemption for both people is that it was just as meaningful to each person as it was for the other, for different reasons and for similar ones. The bittersweet anguish of having those memories and carrying that emotional baggage over that time echoes even deeper in the respective voids in their lives; as Celine puts it: ""memories are a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past""  almost sums up that anguish. When people are young they worry about not becoming ""someone"" - but as they get older - everyone worries about not being WITH ""someone"".<br/><br/>In Sunset, they are both vindicated in realizing that they did not ""waste"" the last nine years living as damaged emotionless zombies - that their chance encounter was a truly magical moment changing both of their lives, that they were both ""incomplete"" without each other (ok, cue the corny music), that they really do ""complete each other"". <br/><br/>The true beauty of Sunset is that it allows them to indulge in the luxury of what many people do not get: the opportunity for a second chance, at best, and, at worst, an opportunity for some measure of closure.<br/><br/>And so it fittingly ends with the viewer pondering yet again ""what happens now?"" which, in retrospect, is a much more hopeful and infinitely more enviable question to answer than: ""what if?"" <br/><br/>In sum, a wonderful film - bravo.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"FreddyShoop","10","41","47","30 November 2004"," A great movie, and a nice break from most Hollywood trash.
","This is simply one of the best movies I've seen, with very few qualifications. Maybe I should say that this is one of the best ""simple"" movies I've seen. Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.<br/><br/>In any event, this is one of the few sequels that matches the intensity and integrity of the original. First, it has many simple, yet stylish and honest shots. Perhaps the Scorcese shot is used too much (i.e. following the actors on a long walk without cutting a la Goodfellas kitchen scene), but I don't think so because it makes sense in the context of the movie. Second, many of the shots have interesting emotive effect. For instance, towards the end of the movie, after these ""lovers"" are fighting the clock (because Ethan Hawke's character needs to catch a flight) and are cruising down the river, they are so engrossed in their conversation and the fact that they are trying to get so much out of the last few minutes they don't notice their ride is coming to an end. However, we the viewer can see what the characters either don't see or don't want to see, that the boat is crossing over the river to its destination and the departure no one wants to deal with. The viewer is given a wonderful sense of dread as the bank approaches in the background, because we know what is going to happen when the ride ends, and like the characters, we don't want it to end either. Even if the film borrows heavily from other great movies (e.g. My Dinner with Andre) it is independent of those influences.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke were great per usual. Making the dialogue ring true is difficult, but they pull it off. As before, they completely capture the nature of the intimate and friendly conversational style of friends or lovers that is normally edited out of most movies. When people talk, things are not always sequential or rationale, and unlike most movies this movie doesn't try and correct that. Not for a moment does the audience find themselves thinking that this is some sort of charade and no one would ever talk like that. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful, but that is because the characters are intelligent and have a knack for being brutally honest with their thoughts and feelings.<br/><br/>This is movie excellence, and I'm glad some film makers are still trying to make art. Despite the romantic themes this isn't a date flick, so be prepare to deal with the difficult and often unresolved issues of love and relationships that arise."

A script never touched real life like this one so effortlessly. I'm in love with these characters - and with the ending... This is how European Cinema used to be - and Hollywood, too for that matter. Naturally real and magical in the details."

","This film is one of my favorites from last year, along with ""Sideways"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own. It is so perfect, so simple, so sublime, so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.<br/><br/>Who would think that watching two people talking may be that fascinating? That's what the power of great dialog does. As much as I loved dialogs in ""Before Sunrise"", in this film they are even better - the characters are older, wiser, more interesting, I'd say. Ten years is a long period in a human life - our characters are still young and attractive but they've gone through losses and changes, disappointments and some sad realizations about life. It is privilege of the young age to hope that ""there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times."" If we only knew how to cherish and keep these unique and unforgettable connections. If we only knew that they were unique...<br/><br/>Julie Delpy along with Ethan Hawke, contributed to the screenplay; and there is no doubt that their contributions made the characters interacting on the screen absolutely honest and believable.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine. She is amazing in showing mystery, charm, disappointments, dreams, and the dark sides of this woman. Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of ""Before Sunset"" are among the most charming and seductive ever - oh yes, baby you will miss that plane. 9.5/10"

","A sequel to the 1995 film ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended."

","I'm a movie lover. That first thing said, i have to recognize that i'm really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with ""Before Sunset"" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It's just a construction. It's just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn't felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It's the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.<br/><br/>So, i really recommend it, even if you didn't saw the first one."
"sm22281-1","10","77","98","12 September 2004"," Lovely romantic story
","I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, ""Before Sunrise"", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of ""a certain age"", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment. <br/><br/>I am 48 years old and have a wonderful romantic relationship with my husband. We are each other's first and only love. Even so, we have worked very hard to keep our marriage alive and mutually passionate. Over the past 25-30 years, both of us have noticed that satisfying relationships are very difficult once people hit their thirties and forties. We have noticed that many older couples never work out their differences and end up bitter and disappointed with life. Many acquaintances of our generation are divorced or still single, never having experienced the sweetness and stability of a true romantic and committed relationship. Romance can be found all the time, from fleeting moments to short-term relationships. One sees it all over the place nowadays, in TV shows and movies, as well as in most modern relationships. However, I would like to emphasize the lasting contentment that a loving commitment brings to one's soul. This is a rare and unique blessing that is missing from too many relationships nowadays, and I find this immeasurably sad. This is a classic movie (excellent story line and top of the line acting) which goes into my list of top romantic movies of all times."
"libri","10","24","28","8 March 2005"," A perfect sequel to Before Sunrise
","When I saw Before Sunrise I really enjoyed it. It was the essence of every romantic travel fantasy and, lets face it, Ethan Hawke was the stuff that fantasies are made of. Having enjoyed the first movie so much I was really looking forward to the sequel but was also feeling some trepidation. What if they made a mess of it? Fortunately when I finally got to see the film any concern was put to rest. Before Sunset is everything I wanted in a sequel. The characters had matured in a way that made sense. You could see how the young Jessie and Celine had come to be these thirty-something people. There was no sickly sweet romantic perfection. These characters were clearly the product of real life, effected by their decisions good or bad, making compromises, sometimes insecure, a little scarred, but still holding on to memories and dreams of perfect moments. They are still on a journey but no longer sure that their destination is the right one. Unsure whether they can change direction, or even if they should, but afraid of what will happen if they don't.<br/><br/>While an obvious link to the first movie the title adds to that grown up feeling of fear that time might be running out. ""Before Sunset"" emphasises that feeling of something needing to be done before it its too late. Most people have a ""What if""? somewhere in their past. You might not think about them/it often but on some level you have a question. This movie lets the characters of Jessie and Celine explore their ""What if"" nine years later, something most of us will never get to do. That that exploration is so satisfying for me as a movie goer taking a second look into their lives is a tribute to the Director and the two stars. It was obviously a great collaboration.<br/><br/>I think the fact that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy wrote with the Director makes this a wonderfully organic script. Both of the actors seem comfortable in the skins of their characters. They carry their baggage around Paris with them and the audience isn't insulted with the fantasy that their lives stopped when they parted. There were moments of casual lightness in the dialogue and also moments that left you raw with their honesty.<br/><br/>Sometimes the ending of a movie is a foregone conclusion. You can mentally hear the romantic music rise before the opening credits have even finished. This movie was different. In the beginning I didn't know how the movie would end or how I wanted it to end. The romantic and the realist in me couldn't quite reconcile. When the end came it surprised me with its suddenness then stunned me with its perfection. I cannot remember seeing a movie whose ending so perfectly fit its story and its characters. The moment when ""Jessie"" laughed and acknowledged, (as much to himself as to Celine), that he wouldn't be catching that plane, was the perfect place to leave, not finish, their story. A moment more would have been too much, a step towards schmaltz, a compromise to the conventional. A moment less would have left us wandering forever in the ""What If"". I am so grateful that having found the perfect moment they had the vision to stay with it."
"tieman64","Null","15","18","26 September 2007"," Linklater brings a tired genre to life
","This is a review of ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Midnight"", three films by Richard Linklater.<br/><br/>Released in 1995, ""Before Sunrise"" finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse, a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal, savouring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.<br/><br/>Like most of Linklater's films, ""Sunrise"" is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly, touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringe-worthy, but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual, natural, lacking in artifice, and we at times feel like voyeurs, eavesdropping on the sort of ""unimportant"" dialogue that most films shy away from. <br/><br/>But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity, and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes, Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales, as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend ""Sunrise"" an ""energy"" and intimacy that many of his other films lack.<br/><br/>Released in 2004, Linklater's ""Before Sunset"" is a sequel to 1995's ""Sunrise"". Equally good, the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart, it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met, fell in love, and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel (he's now a writer), and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat, the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hang-man's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.<br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy so easily re-inhabit these characters, you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent, their conversations cycle through hilarity, pain and misery. On the downside, both characters are obviously the product of an artist; Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.<br/><br/>Once again Linklater utilises long, uninterrupted takes, his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film, but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater, cinema's chief slacker-philosopher (at least since the death of Hal Ashby), Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths, placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way, Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything, and at times represent more than themselves.<br/><br/>Released in 2013, ""Before Mightnight"" finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them, and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly, the puppy-love of the first two films has given way to middle-aged weariness, parental responsibility, regret and pragmatism. The film is somber, even pessimistic, and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages, most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. <br/><br/>If ""Sunset"" and ""Sunrise"" evoked Eric Rohmer, or Bresson's ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"", ""Midnight"" recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's ""Journey to Italy"". Again dialogue heavy, and again reliant on long takes, the film is colder, harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism, and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death, career disappointment, transience, the world ending or technology's negative influences; the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future, in which society devolves into ""masturbation and death"". In another, Jesse insists that man is ""99 percent automated"" and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of self-hood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments, and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are ""never one person, always two"". <br/><br/>Unlike its predecessors, ""Midnight's"" sceptical of romance and even soul-mates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room, a forced segment designed to set up another sequel, our duo then seem to patch up their problems, though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.<br/><br/>Early in ""Midnight"", Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending, wondrous present (the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago), whilst another views all experiences as being ""second hand"". Jesse later talks about being ""lost in perception"" and introduces us to the ""patron saint of eyesight"", moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different, better futures, and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.<br/><br/>9/10 – Whilst as good as its predecessor, ""Sunset"" may rub people the wrong way. The idea of successful, self-reflexive, middle class hipsters incessantly yapping, will prove irksome to many."
"The_Void","10","12","14","11 February 2005"," A magnificent follow up to a beautiful picture
","This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.<br/><br/>The tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance, and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion, this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end, but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into well-rounded adults, on the contrary in fact; the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains, and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>Amazingly enough, in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse; both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters, and have once again achieved a glove-like fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pent-up emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around, and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful, that's elementary, but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk, people chat away on mobile phones, walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.<br/><br/>You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course, you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing; so what are you waiting for?"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","11","13","11 February 2009"," 'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane...I know'
","Very few films can match up to the original first movies. 'Before Sunset' is one such. This time Linklater has co-written the screenplay with Hawke and Delpy. Jesse and Celine reunite after nine years. Things haven't turned out the way they had expected but here's a chance. 'Before Sunset' follows pretty much the same style as 'Before Sunrise'. This one too is very much a conversational piece. Here the score is used to a minimal. During the end we hear some songs including Julie Delpy's beautiful 'My Waltz'. The cinematography consists of more long shots than in the first movie. The film has a very mature feel to it. Of course Jesse and Celine are a lot more mature today and less idealistic than they were nine years ago. Linklater beautifully captures the love between these two characters as he walks us through the streets of Paris. Here too the dialogues are just as magical as in the first movie except that this time there's a melancholy about the things that could have been, the years that they could have been together. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are terrific as ever and they deserve additional praise for the writing and Ms. Delpy for her singing. Overall, 'Before Sunset' has everything that made 'Before Sunrise' a phenomenal movie experience."
"dasalinas","10","8","10","24 July 2006"," Beautiful in its simplicity
","I saw both movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, at home as DVD's and was amazed at the effect these movies had on me. I was mesmerized and entranced by the utter simplicity and beauty of the love story. The Sunrise movie takes us through a magical night in Vienna where two young (23 year old) adults fall in love. The sequel Sunset movie re-unites them nine years later in Paris. During the nine year interval, much of the idealism they had as young adults has been been overtaken by the realism that comes with life disappointments experienced in the intervening years. The dialog in both movies is so compellingly real and so natural it borders on surreal. Its like being a fly on the wall. It doesn't seem like they're acting at all. The script was written by Director Linklater, and actors Delpy and Hawke. Any guy will fall in love with Celine. Thank you, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke for creating these two small movie masterpieces. Its a must see for all romantic souls. Best movie I've seen in years. 10 out of 10."
"tedg","Null","40","66","26 December 2004"," Reluctance
","Finally, Linklater does something with his talent. His strength in the past has been to shape the form of his films to match the subject. At least that's been true when the subject is the tentativeness of existence.<br/><br/>He's done well enough in the past, but since his characters were aimless his projects inherited a meaninglessness. Where he tried to impart introspective layers with ""Waking Life,"" those layers were trite threads of fake profundities. Well, never mind. Artists aren't required to be particularly smart  even about who they are and what they do.<br/><br/>What is required is the ability to discover and convey something that resonates. Usually in films the resonance is a sort of nervous recognition in the characters and situation. Sometimes, the manner of the film, the nature of the world presented is enough to engage. Such is the value of Kieslowski  and how he managed Delpy.<br/><br/>This film tries something different, something commonly attempted and almost never achieved: the direct drama of discovery between two people. This hosts the construction not in any story or setting or even situation, though they are all employed in the service of the goals. Instead, the whole thing revolves around the tentative motions toward intimacy between two people.<br/><br/>Why this usually fails is because of the unwieldy mechanics. In order to seem real (most reviewers call this film ""veristic"") the dramatic projection has to be hyperreal, but not so much that it appears artificial. So how do you dramatically amplify lightly probing intimacies? Its all in the most subtle hesitations of the actors, in that range beyond what ""really"" might happen and them forthrightly telling us what's happening.<br/><br/>The construction is perfect: all movies are about other movies. In this case, we literally have the last chapter of the romance as a movie with movie values and memories. More, those are romantically captured in a book that one character carries from the previous movie into this one. Thus, all their discussion, all their reluctances are about having the present film approach the previous one.<br/><br/>I'm astonished at the perfection of the idea, as astonished as I am about how well the two, especially Delpy, support it. This is delicate stuff.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Quinoa1984","10","9","12","19 March 2007"," what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here
","Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Like Bergman's films, in particular Scenes From a Marriage (if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here), Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind, in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit, and Celine with her opinions on the world at large, family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection, it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy, to be certain, there would be no movie, but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna, and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened, and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart, functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres- Jessie is married and with a kid, but not very happy in it, and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship- but the singular, glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.<br/><br/>Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties, even if it doesn't feel totally complete; I want to see how their story might end, however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life, aside from the practical-side of it all, yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This, plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors, as Hawke and Delpy, as to be expected, seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon, and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance, since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered, however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one, I still loved being around these two, who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about, almost shockingly similar (one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland), and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.<br/><br/>It ends ambiguous, maybe too ambiguous, as I found myself saying 'huh, what', but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film: one may take away something from this tale, or someone else another, but there it is, clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance, and proud of it, being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best."

","There are almost no words to describe this film.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>I saw Before Sunrise last spring, and I remember being taken with the characters and the way the movie was filmed--almost entirely in real time, line after line of amazing and honest dialogue. I really liked it, and made a resolution to see Before Sunset as soon as I could. It came on TV one day a few weeks later, and soon after became one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>To start, these are two of the best, most human characters ever portrayed in a film. However, it doesn't hurt that they have all the dialogue they do to develop. For anyone wishing to see a movie that breaks outside Hollywood stereotypes (as well as crosses international borders), this is the best film for you to see. Every sentence Celine and Jesse speak makes you laugh or think. Also, the lack of music is very interesting. The only musical tidbits in the movie are Celine singing Jesse her song and the two of them listening to Nina Simone in Celine's apartment at the end.<br/><br/>Ah, the end. Just one more reason to love this movie. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (who collaboratively wrote the screenplay) left on an ambiguous note (just like the end of Jesse's book), a true test of whether the audience is a cynic, romantic or just not sure. After revealing their characters' naked beliefs, hopes and fears, they turn to the audience in the end for a beautiful twist.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are so many people who will think this film is boring, but all I ask is that you open your mind and just listen to the two of them speak.

","What an utter piece of clap-trap. This is another example of a pseudo-intellectual cinematech art-house experiment that has gone tragically wrong. Unfortunately, it has now claimed the lives of many viewers who too spineless to say they hated it because expressing an honest opinion might cause them to be scorned by those who feel that this movie is a work of art. This movie was no ""Dinner with Andre"" nor was it in the league of other great script intensive movies. This was simply a bad movie. The characters were self-absorbed and terribly uninteresting. The script was stuffed with cookie-cutter philosophical quotes and paraphrases and I wanted to vomit after hearing each utterance. The city of Paris could have been used a distinct character in this movie, in the way that Tokyo was used in ""Lost in Translation"". However, the city of lights was relegated to being a cheap background as if it was on the backstage lot at Universal. Please, please, please, do not make ""Before Moonrise"". Just let the sun set on this steaming pile of tripe."

","A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.<br/><br/>What really sickens me is the distorted view of reality depicted by these characters, who are obviously well thought of by the author and movie-makers. The way in which Celine and Jesse view the world is the view of spoiled Westerners who have no actual clue of reality, and criticize everyone else from their safe bubbles. Aside from the token concern for polluters, aren't they essentially mainly concerned with their own gratification?"
"DICK STEEL","10","7","10","3 January 2007"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Before Sunset (2004)
","Thanks goodness I'm watching this on DVD (though missing out on the chance of experiencing this on the big screen) and can almost watch it immediately after watching the original. Well I could have, but I'd like to let Before Sunrise sink it a bit, before finding out how my favourite lovebirds continue with their next encounter in this sequel, filmed some nine years later, which is a very, very long time to wait for a sequel to be made.<br/><br/>I guess the length of time in between the making of the movies helped to bring about certain gravitas to the characters played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, in that they truly age physically, no two ways about that, and along with the physical age, come the emotional baggage and history they have built over the years. You can see it in their eyes, no longer the optimistic young adults, full of enthusiasm and hope, and all those replaced by a weary sense of worldliness, with chiseled looks and skinnier frames. I think Celine was more beautiful nine years ago, and am ruing the loss of baby fat, haha!<br/><br/>Anyway I digress. For those who are left at the cliffhanger from Before Sunrise, you'll be pleased that what happened after, and what specifically happened that night, will be revealed in this movie, though the story teases you in not having it revealed in its entirety, toying with you with coy and playfulness, just as how the characters interact then and now. In Before Sunset, we are nine years from the last meeting of Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke, with a last name to his character) and Celine (Julie Delpy), and he's now a published writer making his whirlwind book promotion in Europe. They meet in a bookstore in Paris, which takes over Vienna, and now have to spend, in almost real time, a very limited late afternoon evening together reminiscing and catching up, before Jesse's scheduled flight home to the USofA.<br/><br/>The narrative style has also matured together with the ease with which the actors play their respective characters. You''ll notice the increase in the number of long, uninterrupted takes and dialogues, and sometimes wonder, it'll be a pain to flub your lines. Perhaps it's also because having Hawke and Delpy co-write the screenplay, they were able to inject material drawn from personal experiences to breathe life into their roles. Therefore their lines come across so naturally, you can't help but to start casting this voyeuristic look upon Jesse and Celine as you eagerly await their sharing of their lives from that moment in time, until now - their careers, their families, and the perennial what ifs, and there are many.<br/><br/>I don't have a particular moment which I loved, unlike the previous movie, but there are certain dialogue discussed, especially during the limo ride, which struck a chord in me. Perhaps even made me understand my past relationships a little more, though regretting certain things I sure have. It made me wonder, if that was exactly how another felt, and if so, how stupid I was to have not understood, Then again, if I had, then things would be different now, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>I'd say it again, that the movie was made enjoyable by the two main leads portrayal of lovers who can be exactly you or me, and of the fantastic conversational pieces that they have, be it flirting with each other, or discussion of serious issues. Wonderful, wonderful chemistry between them, and for fans of Delpy, you'll be glad to know that she composed and contributed 3 songs to the movie, one of which is worked into the plot, and performed on screen. I like.<br/><br/>I liked the way it started, as if what happened in Before Sunrise was something from memory, from imagination, from the past retold in a novel. And depending on your mood, I'd like the way it ended - in a manner which could swing either way, depending on your personality, and the degree of romanticism which you have at that point. In the end, I too was made to reminisce about the one who got away, and regretting it big time. And it does make me wonder, what will happen if I chance upon her some years down the road too (I think it has now been 5?), how exactly we would react, and how we would have a conversation, if ever, during that chance meeting.<br/><br/>To truly appreciate this movie, watch Before Sunrise first. Better yet, watch both movies back to back, it'll clock in about 181 minutes, which should breeze by given the compelling dialogue and excellent chemistry. I know I will, sometime soon!<br/><br/>There's a slight improvement in the WB Code 3 DVD in that it contains a making-of feature called On The Set of Before Sunset. There are interviews with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, as well as director Richard Linklater. You can see how many crew were needed to film the seemingly simplest of scenes, and listen to how they collaborated across continents before finally getting together to shoot the movie. One gripe though, is that this segment lasts only 9 minutes and 40 secs long, and ends so abruptly, you'll not believe that it had finished.<br/><br/>As usual, the audio and visual transfers are great, and you have a choice of languages in English Dolby Surround 5.1, or Portugese Dolby Surround Stereo. Another extra is the theatrical trailer, and a host of subtitles available in many languages."

Acting by Hawke and Delpy is so artificial, these people couldn't have been lovers in a million years. you can feel 0 chemistry between them and the whole movie you just have a feeling of 2 bad actors pretending they once meant something to each other, with an attempt to cover it with a series of really, really boring stories and ""oh were having so much fun together laughing to our silly jokes"" type of talk.<br/><br/>i again, do not know how is it possible for a movie so shitty to get so many good reviews. something ain't right here."

","(Just mild spoiler at the end) At first I thought ""Before Sunrise"" is best to never have a sequel and left the ending open to audience's imagination. However, the director, his cast, and his team prove that they can do it. ""Before Sunset"" is simply the perfect sequel to one of the most beautiful film I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The characters that I love so much are still themselves. They've grown, gone through good and bad times in life, but they are still the same two people we saw in Before Sunrise. The acting and the dialog is so real. It even makes you think of your own life, think of the love that has come and gone, the opportunities you've blown. However, love is still there. This film shows very well that no matter how you've blown your chances, the love in your heart doesn't go anywhere. It's just there.<br/><br/>I like the heartbreak moment in this film. It makes you feel sadder than watching the first one, when the two were just young, honest, and romantic people that fell in love. I think Before Sunset makes it more real to life that the two people become more bitter by age and life experience.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit too abrupt, but I like it anyway. I like the way it doesn't give you a conclusion. You can think for yourself about how this two will turn out.<br/><br/>Now I will go and buy the DVD. This is definitely something to treasure."
"classyBlue","9","4","5","23 April 2005"," everyone has grown up or become a better being
","Of course I saw Before Sunrise first. If I didn't see Sunrise and jumped to this one, Before Sunset, would I still love Sunset? Maybe not. So please, if you haven't seen Before Sunrise, do not watch Before Sunset.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is so powerful, in the movie, and between the movie and me. Sometimes I felt like I knew Jesse and Celine in person, but more often I felt I was one of them. It's not about whether I am a guy or a gal or a European or an American or any identity. The characters somehow caught a part of me, a deep part. I could almost feel what they felt. This is the most successful component of this movie.<br/><br/>They were young and less experienced. They, I mean all of them, on the screen, behind the screen. Now, after 9 years, they came back together and produced a much richer film. Before Sunrise was a bit like a traveling movie for me. They walked from place to place. It was like that the director wanted to introduce Vienna to viewers. Jesse and Celine talked about their values of life and love on the basis of their ideals. In Before Sunset, they talked about similar issues again but on the basis of their own personal histories. It was so touching! This time, they didn't walk as many places as 9 years ago. They were not tourists anymore. They were much more certain about their journey.<br/><br/>The performances of both actors were excellent! I mean, it was like they were talking to me. They acted with their eyes and body. It was so attractive that I didn't care where they walked. I was really into their conversation and their reaction to each other. The story went along with the words they said. Because of their great acting, I did not feel any dryness of this movie.<br/><br/>""Everyone is independent. Nothing is forever.""----This is what I got out of Before Sunrise. And I think it also is the ideal of the young Jesse and Celine.---- They went on their own life without each other and realized something could be forever and they were not as independent as they thought they were. People can live by themselves, feeding themselves and entertaining themselves. However, people cannot just live like that. People depend on others in terms of caring and love, even though the person who loves you is physically far away from you. Jesse and Celine were independent of each other during the past 9 years but also dependent on each other mentally. Apparently, memory is the most reliable thing you can hold on to and deeply dwell in. Beautiful, isn't it? <br/><br/>I also love the endings of both movies. The story still goes on in my head. There is no ""the end"". I wish them happy as a way to wish myself happy."
"katydid4819","9","4","5","21 February 2005"," Intimate Sequel
","I didn't see Before Sunrise. I think I should just come out and say that. I have been told that it adds an extra layer to the sequel and I have no doubts. It almost seems unfair for me to judge a movie this intimate without having seen its prequel. But on that note, it is impressive that the second half of this story could move me so. It's nothing more than one long conversation, probably a kin to ones that I have myself everyday. Yet there is something else here. There is something that is entirely relatable here yet still far enough out of our reach that we are sucked into the film because we want to know that magic that exists only in movies.<br/><br/>The story starts with a book signing. Jesse (Ethan Hawke), the author of a novel about a women he met once upon a yesterday and never saw again, is at the final stop of his tour of Europe here in Paris. This is the only part of the movie where he is alone and he sets the stage for what is about to come. He delivers a monologue to the press about a story he wishes to write about a moment that turns into another moment and that morphs into yet another and so on. He is basically describing what is to take place for the next hour. He spys a woman in the corner. He spys Celine (Julie Delpy) in the corner. After he wraps it up, they begin to talk. And they don't stop. Occasionally they travel to a new location be it a café or a park. Topics flow into each other  just as Jesse told us they would.<br/><br/>How do you write a conversation specific to two people yet understandable to anyone? Even after seeing the film I honestly cannot tell you. There is something beyond chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. That has been transformed from life to the page by these two. The co-authored the film. In a time of adaptations from every medium possible, it is hard to pick out original screenplays that stand strong and defend their category. Before Sunset is one of those rare scripts that does. The writing is the strongest part here.<br/><br/>This is essentially Delpy and Hawke's two man show. There is no one else of importance. They are rarely separate, even sharing the shot most of the time. They wrote the film, they star in it and for all anyone can tell, they were the only ones involved. The direction is so minimal that it is virtually non-existent. And there in lies the genius but it's funny how one simplicity can overshadow another.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is emotional provocative in the most subtle way. Were the sun to actually set in the background, you would never notice the difference. The film is shot in real time and so the sunset would sneak up on you the way the film does. One minute there's a sun and then before you know it the sky is pink and you realize you care whether or not they end up together when it seems only minutes ago they were just two people talking about whether or not they had sex nine years ago. ****/*****"

","Those months of craving, just to have a glimpse of Before Sunset is over. I finally managed to watch the movie. Though I wont discuss any technical details about the video or audio quality of the video I got. What I will be discussing is a about how did they manage to fuse Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Those nine long years of stillness. An open ending that we just wished that someone knew how it ended. That's what kept me clinging on to Before Sunrise. It ended not with a happy nor sad ending. But it made some of us empty in some way making us want to know more about them. So what we did was to watch it all over for so many times over and over and over. And with every end of the movie we learned more about them. A hundred and five minutes of pure conversation with one another. Their glances and stares. The empty streets they've walked. The topics they discussed. Even though we watch the film for so many times we can never end this movie. They never exchanged phone numbers, never gave their address to one another. What they only have was just a promise to meet again after six months at the train station. If ever one of them gave away their phone number. We could just probably generate a happy ending, because either one of them can call the other to meet sometime. And just because of those digits, we can be rest assured that they'll see each other again.<br/><br/>Finally after nine years of waiting we finally have a sequel. Though I hate the idea of having a sequel because it might spoil those special moments in the movie. But I just can't blame them to make one, because there are times that we should know about it. Because the movie moved us so much in a way that Jesse and Celine were more than just characters in a simple movie, but it slowly seeps into our minds often that they've became a part of ours. Before Sunset was seamlessly appended that those questions we used to ask ourselves were answered, like 'did they ever meet again?' or 'what happened after six months?' Just don't be surprised that a measly eighty minutes is short for a sequel. The film runs in real-time where Jesse has to board a plane to New York. Jesse or Jesse Wallace(they finally figured out a surname) attended a book signing of his first published book in Paris. And there she met Celine. Then the story continues where they just both walked on the streets of Paris on their way to the café. By just watching them together again made a feeling of joy and contentment within me that kept me glued to their dialogues. Again, the best thing about this movie is the simplicity. Before Sunset was just showcasing ordinary lives of two strangers who have met nine years ago on a train. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, even though you haven't seen Before Sunrise. And if you liked Before Sunset, without delay try to watch Before Sunrise to complete the picture. A+"
"civil__disobedient","10","4","5","28 September 2004"," The sequel I never wanted to see has exceeded my expectations
","Before Sunrise was a beautiful movie that catered to a romantic ideal: Jesse and Celine share a single day together, conversation flows like wine, and it all ends far to abruptly to ever know if the love was real, or merely a figment of their own hopes. Jesse is the heart-broken cynic, Celine the romantic in search of a pair. It is one of the best examples of young love ever put on screen. At the end of the first movie, you are left on your own to decide their fates.<br/><br/>This is precisely why I never wanted there to be a sequel. It was a perfectly ambiguous movie, and the way you interpreted their future was just a reflection of your own cynicism or romantic nature. Yet Linklater decided to answer the question for us in perhaps the most beautiful way possible. For anyone who saw Sunrise when it first came out, nine years of their own lives have now passed, along with the actors. How has the passage of time affected not only the viewers' interpretations, but also the actors?<br/><br/>This time around, Hawke plays the romantic. For nine years he has hoped and dreamed of meeting up with Celine. Conversely, for Delpy her romanticism was snuffed out the day she should have met up in Vienna. What Linklater has done is essentially recreate the entire first story all over again, only this time it's from the perspective of a 30-something. The details that got in the way of their first affair: distance, fear, uncertainty -- have been replaced with the more practical (but more serious) details of marriage, children, responsibility.<br/><br/>If they could just go back to that point in time knowing what they know now, it would be so simple -- of course they'd get together. But life isn't that easy. Linklater has again given them a chance at true, perfect love, this time with the complications of mature adults. They both recognize how special their relationship is, but the sacrifices they would have to make to be together now have far more serious consequences. Is it worth the risk? The ending is again ambiguous -- perhaps Linklater will fill us in on the details in another 9 years.<br/><br/>Note: while Before Sunset does reference Before Sunrise in occasional flashback blips, you really should see the original first. If you have the time, you might try waiting a few years before watching the sequel to truly appreciate it -- though this isn't completely necessary."

","Before Sunset is movie so genuine and true to the heart, where two people fall deeply in love without even expressing the words ""I love you"" or even sharing a mere kiss on screen.<br/><br/>I have never seen two people interact like those two in ""real life"" or in any other movie. The connection they shared was equally possible as it was unrealistic, but it was in simplest terms a miracle.<br/><br/>Even though I haven't witnessed such a miracle, I believe in it, as rare as it is.<br/><br/>But, in this life, there are no happy endings, and it's only the path we take to our miserable end which has potential for ""happiness."" Without any reference to statistics and with no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone who might be ""in love"", 99% of the world does not experience this kind of love. Unfortunately for many, the love in this movie is ""true love"", which in effect means if you are not experiencing this kind of love, you are not experiencing true love.<br/><br/>The characters do, suggestively, end in a miserable end. But the moments they share is when they experience the greatest happiness known to man.<br/><br/>Do yourself and the world a favour and watch and fall in love with this movie. Because I can guarantee that even if I don't find true love with a woman, I can be sure I felt it by witnessing the pure magic in the gem.<br/><br/>The only movie ever to bring me to tears! It had a profound affect on me when I watched it and still does. The original is almost as good, but this one had something extra in it to bring me to tears.<br/><br/>If you don't understand even one part of what I'm talking about after you watched this miracle, then unfortunately you have zero chance of experiencing true love.<br/><br/>This may me my favourite movie of all time!"

","Unfolding almost in real-time, this is a story about another chance for love that was once lost. Set nine years after they first met, Jesse and Celine find themselves older and wiser and still crazy about each other. They meet in a bookstore where Jesse is on tour for his best-selling novel which, incidentally, is a transcript of their magical night in Vienna long ago. He needs to leave for the airport soon and they have just about an hour to spend with each other in Paris. This film is going down in movie history for me as one in my all-time top ten favorite romantic films. It is even better than its 1995 prequel, which was already magnificent in itself. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their two characters are even more real than when they were first introduced all those years ago. Their love for each other just bounces off the screen. This is terribly remarkable film-making. The immediate sequences are a direct metaphor to the urgency of their situation, how little time they have. It is beautiful. I can't even spot the longest shot. It must have taken a real effort for those two actors to pull off these great performances, long dialogues and all. The best part about this film is that it can be seen as a stand-alone.

"erialc","10","5","7","10 March 2005"," Perfection
","Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just sublime in ""Before Sunset"", the sequel to their 1994's ""Before Sunrise"". Essentially, it's a movie about nothing -- the two of them see each other for the first time after nine years and just walk and talk; yet, at the same time, it's about everything and anything we truly care, desire, and hope for in life. It's about love, our perception of it, our yearning to attain it, and our disappointments for our inability to put a grasp on it. Nine years later, we see clearly the signs of dissatisfaction and disappointments on their faces. Frustrated with the banality of life, yet imprisoned by the vast responsibilities to themselves and the ones they love to endure its miseries, the two of them are no longer as hopeful, nor as romantic about life and love, like they were nine years ago. There is less dreaming this time, more about reality, more about the pains experienced and the compromises made in life. There are also regrets, regrets about this lost love, and tears, tears held back in their eyes wondering what could've been. But the sparks and longings they saw and felt long ago were still palpable, just like they were the night they first met. By the end of the film, it's clear that not all is lost, their love is buried some where deep down in their hearts, cherished by their memories of that one encounter almost a decade ago. And for us, it's always comforting to know that perhaps, just perhaps, their love could eventually prevail, for after all, we are all hopeless romantics struggling to live a life of love and dream."

","Hi everybody¡¡<br/><br/>I'm from Spain and my English is not very good, but I'll do my best.<br/><br/>This is my first review in IMDb on a movie. Here in Spain Before Sunset came out the last Friday. The first time that I heard about Before Sunset was in the Berlinale and I was really surprise and since then I've been looking for information (spoilers) on the net (I couldn't avoid it). I read great reviews about the movie and I was looking forward to see it, here in Spain great reviews too, by the way.<br/><br/>I took a friend of mine to see B. Sunset with me, but previously I let her see B. Sunrise and she liked it, but she was not as enthusiastic with Before Sunrise as I was, but she told me ""I will go with you to see B. Sunset, now that I saw the first one, I want to know what happens to Jesse and Celinne"", so the last Sunday we saw Before Sunset and at the end of the film my friend told me ""Don't tell me that this is the end, I want more!!"". Our verdict is : FANTASTIC, BEAUTIFUL, my friend liked it much more than Before Sunrise. She told me that when Celinne was singing the waltz, she almost burst into tears, we loved the movie.I already knew more or less what the movie was about, but of course one thing is reading spoilers and another seeing the movie. Anyhow I have some comments about:<br/><br/><ul><li>The duration: too short, probably because I enjoyed it so much, maybe 10 or 20 minutes more it would be fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending:Don't get me wrong I love the ending, but I don't know maybe deep inside I would love to know what happens to them, I must admit that I root for them and I want them together, so here is my last point...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The third movie: After seeing both movies, my friend and I agree that we need another one. In fact we think that Before Sunset needs a continuation more that Before Sunrise did. In my opinion, Before Sunrise's ending was more complete, a little bit more closer that Before Sunset's. In Before Sunset left us with many questions without answers and as I said before I need to know a little bit more.Like ¿Are they really in love? they have a great connection but love is a major word for me. They spent very shorts periods of time together, a night, and 1hour and 20 and nothing else, I'd love to see them together in a longer space of time, or maybe as celinne said they are good only in brief encounters in different cities of Europe. I don't know this is a beautiful movie but very very sad at the same time.</li></ul><br/><br/>I hope that Ethan, Julie and Richard make another great movie, but only as they say in many interviews that I read, if they have something more to say, and I hope that if they want to, they will surprise us with another great movie, even better.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","2","25 February 2013"," Manages to Improve on a Very Good First Film
","Before Sunset (2004) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Nine years after the events in BEFORE SUNRISE, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) returns to Paris to do a Q&A for his book, which just happens to talk about that night in Vienna. Celine (Julie Delpy) winds up coming to the event and afterwards they've got a little over a hour to catch up on what's been going on in their lives. BEFORE SUNSET is clearly an improvement over the already very good first film but what makes this one here even more special is that it captures the magic of the first picture while at the same time taking a look at the darker issues in their lives. As with the first film, it's really amazing how director Richard Linklater managed to make this feel like a documentary that you're watching and not once do you see Hawke and Delpy as actors but instead you see them as real people that are simply being filmed by an invisible camera. The film manages to really make you believe that the story is picking up nine years after the previous film and I must say that the explanation for the ending of the first movie is extremely well handled. I'm not going to spoil what happened six months later but it's perfectly handled here. Even the first appearance of Celine is extremely beautiful and perfectly done. I really liked the dialogue here but I also like the fact that it once again comes across so real. I say this because I viewed this at the same age of the characters and I thought their feelings on growing older are so true. Hearing Hawke talk about his son and relationships is just something one can connect with and like the previous film the situations make you feel as if you could be the one doing the talking or at least you know someone like these characters. Once again both Hawke and Delpy are terrific together and really fit back well in their characters. There are more emotional or dramatic moments here and both handle them well. Linklater, who wrote the script with the two stars, keeps the film moving at a great pace and really manages to make one fall for the situation that these two are in."

I feel that no person should suffer through this two hour torture. I had high expectations for this movie, it looked very entertaining. Looking forward to this movie was a colossal mistake. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.. it is a huge waste of time, money, an opportunity to watch something decent. The only positive thing about this is that I had a nice nap.<br/><br/>If you have any smarts at all you will not waste part of your life watching this overrated, senseless, boring, pathetic piece of garbage.

Terrible, soap opera over dramatized acting, way too many unnecessary sexual references, and none of the sweetness of the first film.

I simply do not see the attraction at all.<br/><br/>Hawke is unlikeable again, Delpy is devoid of the charm she had in the first and the whole film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first with yet another ambiguous finale.<br/><br/>I like the idea of the simplicity behind both films, I guess I just didn't appreciate the lines of conversation or the way they ended them both.<br/><br/>I believe the films would have been a lot more appealing if they'd both shut the hell up, strapped a go-pro camera on and just given us 90 minutes of of the wonderful country and it's architecture."
"noralee","Null","3","4","21 July 2004"," Hello Young Lovers - Part Deux
","I was surprised how many in the audience of ""Before Sunset"" had not seen the previous ""Before Sunrise"" as I didn't think it was possible to follow it, let alone appreciate the dialogue, stand-alone.  <br/><br/>This ""Part Deux,"" as it takes place in instantly recognizable Paris, contains less explanatory flashback material than the consequently essential trailer did, as the premise for the movie is a specific ""what if?"" portend of future potential regret that Ethan Hawke's Jesse used to seduce Julie Delpy's Celine for a night around Vienna almost ten years ago.  How can someone who hasn't seen the first film judge the tricks memory may be playing on each character if you don't know what you remember really happened?  <br/><br/>It is a wonderful premise and creative writing collaboration among director Richard Linklater and the stars to have the characters revisited in the real time of being older in a real time conversation that is filmed a la Eric Rohmer, like his ""Les Rendez-vous de Paris."" <br/><br/>The movie carries an additional subtext that shadows the characters and adds to the complexity.  Back in 1995, Hawke was at his most earnestly, shaggily adorable and Delpy was an up-and-coming starlet.  But now we've seen Hawke rise to an Oscar nomination, as well as a novelist like Jesse, while becoming tabloid fodder for the break-up of his family with Uma Thurman, and he bears a gaunt, haunted, shorn look.  <br/><br/>Delpy has during this time only surfaced occasionally to American audiences, so that her strong, luminous character here is particularly captivating and believable as a professional activist as well as a songwriter (quite sweet on the soundtrack and probably on her own CD, too) and you simply can't take your eyes off her.  She nicely counters the image of her delicate beauty with frank exchanges and well-kicked profanity. <br/><br/>Elements of the premise have been done to exaggerated comic effect in the Western satire ""From Noon Till Three"" Neil Simon's ""Same Time Next Year"" and ""The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares),"" but this feels natural.<br/><br/>
Where the earlier movie had the charm of a late night, dorm room bull session resonant of  the potentials of youth, this one is an amusing probing of protective defenses to honestly reveal thwarted, older and trying to be wiser expectations as they circle each other to consider once again grabbing what could be the brass ring amidst the complicated real lives they have built. <br/><br/>This ending is as deliciously open-ended as the first and I look forward to revisiting Jesse and Celine ten years hence."

","What chances would you give to an 80 minute film to hold your attention which has nothing but an American man Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and a Parisian woman Celine (Julie Delphy) talking? Not much I would imagine. Well, this film not only grabs and holds your attention but makes you fall in love with the characters like the prequel ""Before Sunrise"". Our young protagonists in their early 20s were in Vienna for the day. In ""Before Sunset"", they are in Paris, 9 years from their tryst in Vienna, having lost complete contact of each other during the time.<br/><br/>We follow these characters as they have grown from their previous romantic meeting, become more matured, responsible, more cynical and probably more regretful for their predicament to be apart. It is intriguing to listen to their delightful conversations to listen to as they walk through Paris and one of the reasons for that is, Julie and Ethan have written their own dialogs. Which makes the performances look so completely non-rehearsed and natural. It brings to life their characters which is all we remember of the film and it is most that as an actor and writer you can achieve.<br/><br/>Linklater has always been a master of conversations, although he has set a very high yardstick in terms of the quality of it. It has to be engaging, quirky, real, meaningful. He is a master director and the diversity of his filmography speaks for itself. There is always a sense of languid ease to his film, maybe reflective of his persona.<br/><br/>A great love story. One that will stand the test of time and will definitely touch your heart."

","When I watched the movie I did not know of 'Before Sunrise'. Now I would like to watch that also!! What a great movie!! I never thought how much importance conversation holds in a human being's life. Hats off to director,actors, dialog writer and all involved in the movie. The movie reminded me of meeting a long-lost friend after a long time and how you catch up. Though the movie speaks of lovers it can be applied to any relationship. The flow of the movie was of calm river undisturbed by external things. I felt a sense of relaxation while I watched the movie. We get to see Paris and how when you spend more time with each other your inner feelings tumble out. Is it not strange one is able to connect to somebody 9 years later without much inhibitions?

"starring-1","10","4","6","27 June 2004"," A Caring and Thinking Wo/man's Movie - Good to the Last Drop
","Before I went to see Before Sunrise at its June 26, 2004 Austin Premiere last night I read the reviews written here at imdb.com to get an idea of what to expect. However none of the reviews prepared me for the excellence of this movie.<br/><br/>As you probably already know, the entire movie is basically of one conversation between two people who (at least seemed to) fall in love nine years previously but had not seen one another again until this day having relied on one date for another rendezvous in Venice -- and having failed to exchange phone numbers, addresses, etc.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting was nothing less than excellent, lacking self-consciousness and ""over the top"" theatricality. Much credit for this I'm sure goes to Rick Linklater, the Director, who told us last night after the screening that it was very important to him that it not ""get dramatic."" Ah...a fine director, is like fine wine, no?  Bravisimo!<br/><br/>By the way, I also learned at the Q&A last night -- which was with Richard Linklater and the two stars, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy -- and was fascinated to learn that ALL THREE OF THEM wrote this script. To me, that helps to explain how the script could have come out so profoundly well -- full of meaningful insights, questions that are asked by hearts with a bottom line of love and warmth. <br/><br/>What I am going to say next is something I have said before about BOOKS, but never about MOVIES -- not for the same reason. That is, I want to see this movie again -- and again -- and again so that I won't miss a line. There is so much to think about and care about among the topics discussed -- about love and life and the world we live in. Some of the things expressed were so interesting to me that I found my own mind running off with a thread of thought for a few moments after hearing what was said. It was just so stimulating. But then I would have to force myself to drop the thought in order to put my attention back to what they were saying lest I miss out on yet another pearl of humor, enjoyment, wisdom, riddle or profundity. I tried hard, but for me hearing ALL of it in one showing could just not be done. I will have to seen the movie again and again until I feel satisfied I have eeked the ""last drop."" And NO, I am not implying that the ending is a letdown; in my opinion it is a delightful ending and I hope-hope-hope that in another 7-8 years these collaborators will get together to write us another script. I want them to wait that long before writing it though, so that they can bring ever more wisdom and maturity to each sequel.<br/><br/>Thank you, Rick; thank you, Julie; thank you, Ethan! How REFRESHING and NEEDED it is in our world today to have MEANINGFUL entertainment where the bottom line is where it should be -- for and about thinking and caring human beings. And by the way, Julie and Ethan have noticeably aged; Julie is (indeed) thinner and more mature, a fascinating natural beauty with that sexy French accent; Ethan's resemblance to Tom Cruise startles me. Yet there is another dimension to Ethan and I hope I don't make anyone angry to say I also prefer his acting over the former's. I very, very, very rarely pay full retail price for my own VHS or DVD of a film. I can't wait to buy this one and I look forward to watching it again with happy anticipation.<br/><br/>
10 Stars!"
"Metacognizant","1","12","26","2 February 2013"," In one word: trite.
","This film lacked all the charm of the first. In Before Sunrise we have this intriguing & alluring physical attraction and intellectual interest between two characters that ""destiny"" has united on a train. We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking. <br/><br/>In the second this is all replaced with dialogue that feels contrived and scripted, and which reeks of pseudo-intellectualism. Let's just set aside the fact that the endearing young love of the first is replaced with a pent up lust in the second, so that we can focus on the fact that Hawke's character is married during this little escapade, which renders the whole attraction categorically repugnant. Maybe things won't to work out in his marriage anyway, but people with integrity honor their marriage until it is over. Are we suppose to identify with and/or sympathize with this character?!? Get a divorce and fool around, or exercise the most minimal amount of self-respect & dignity and follow through with your own commitment. <br/><br/>Moving the promenade to the streets of Paris felt predictable and petty to me, it didn't save the movie, and finally, the film itself felt low-budget. I don't recommend Before Sunset to anyone who isn't middle-aged, divorced, and looking for consolation in a story of unscrupulous mediocrity. I do say that reluctantly, and apologize for its harshness, but that is the brutal truth. It's a middle aged, unaccountably cynical, and trite remake of the first, but 10 years later in Paris."

Well, have I got a surprise for you. This movie contains little more than A and B long shots, which to you non-film uber-nerd folks means person A talking and then person B talking for long takes with few or no cuts. There are also very few ellipses, which means that the story is in real time. Therefore, all this movie contains is talking between the two characters for about an hour an a half on any mundane subject from religion to love to world pollution to politics and on and on and on and on.

","First of all, let me state that I'm a sucker for romantic movies. Romeo & Juliet, The Notebook, Titanic... you name them! But this movie, wow. How can you NOT be disappointed ? The worst thing is seeing it having a high rating here on IMDb and being on the ""Best Movies"" list. Something HAS to be wrong here. The people who give it a 10 out of 10 obviously have some issues.<br/><br/>Since I've never heard of a first movie based upon these 2 characters, I did not see it (Before sunrise) so maybe this didn't help. But how on earth do people appreciate or waste money on this ? This is by far, the most awful movie I have ever seen in my life. The only thing they do is talk talk talk and NOTHING happens. I thought it was going to be like this for 15 or 20 minutes ? No, for 80 minutes ! How on earth can you make a movie out of 2 people having a boring conversation ? I didn't even ""feel"" the chemistry between these two.<br/><br/>A total waste of time and money, for the people who MADE this movie and for the people (who like me) wanted to see this.

The movie lasts a little over an hour and most of the time I spent trying to keep my eyes open. My fiancé didn't even like this movie and she likes all romantic movies. I would only recommend this movie to maybe a 13 year old girl cause thats about how creative the storyline is. I'm still not sure of the plot. All in all I thought it really sucked."
"bob the moo","Null","9","19","30 July 2004"," Slight and fleeting but well written, sweet, natural and left me with a slight smile on my face even if it is all a bit idyllic and cheesy at times
","Six months after they originally met traveling around Europe, Jesse went to the place that Celine had agreed to meet him only to be left by himself. Almost a decade later Jesse has written a book based on this one night meeting and is on an European tour. At the Paris location, Celine arrives to meet up with him. Overjoyed to see her again but pressured to leave for the airport in an hour and a half, Jesse goes for coffee and a walk with her in order to talk and catch up.<br/><br/>Its been almost 10 years since I saw the original movie and had a vague recollection of it but I wanted to go to the cinema to see a film. I was left with a choice of Spiderman 2 or this film and I plumped for Before Sunset (although I will see Spidy another time). The film opens with some flashbacks and a rather pretentious Jesse talking about his book before the film proper starts with the pair taking yet another walk. From here on in you need to be in at least a semi-romantic mood or the pace and tone of this film will just grate on you. For me, I was open to see where it went and, although some of it was a bit cheesy at times, generally I was carried along with it. The tone is quite natural and the romance is not forced, in fact it isn't really that much for a love story for the majority. The long conversations are enjoyable and engaging and it is these that gets us into these people's lives just enough to care about them. The wandering film continues to a conclusion that may frustrate some but was perfect for my needs. For my money it was the sheer amiable mood of this film that made it enjoyable. At the end of the film I had a little smile on my face and, although it was only a fleeting feeling from a film that won't stick in my head long, I did feel a little warm thanks to the film.<br/><br/>Of course it isn't perfect and it will be easy for the 'real men' in the world to just dismiss it as nonsense and, partly, they are correct. The dialogue at times is very natural and seems to fit the characters but at other times it is very close to being part of a fondue set. Likewise the characters are not as 'real' as I would have liked  she's an environmental saviour and is pretty and friendly; he's a sensitive author type who has youthful good looks etc. At the start of the film the two actors played the characters very eager and all smiles and I hoped that they were doing this in the way we all do when meeting someone  putting on the pleasantries. But I hope that this would fade as hurt etc came out; it came but it was left very late in the film and the material was kept just a bit too sweet. Delpy is still good despite her rather self-righteous character but it took me longer to warm to Hawke who, although likable, was unconvincing as the man that the script told us Jesse had become. The two have a good chemistry though, and it is fun to walk through Paris with them listening to their conversations that are interesting, pretentious, flirting, funny and cheesy  but still enjoyable to sit through.<br/><br/>Director Linklater does a good job using Paris as a backdrop without going for the really obvious locations or landmarks in a touristy film type of way. More than that though, I was impressed by the technical aspect of the film  long tracking shots in one take and an impressive moment where the camera follows them (from the side) up two flights of stairs. As writer he did OK and, if you're not able to accept a little bit of romantic dialogue and warm chat then you're in the wrong movie.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie but, had I been in the mood for action then I would have been less patient with it. At 80 minutes it is brief and sweet and left me feeling a little warm inside for a while afterwards. It is not the type of film that will stick in my memory for months to come but it did the trick for 80 minutes  I wandered round Paris listening to friends chatting. It's not all perfect  far from it, but it is fun if you're in the mood. As the final shot faded, the audience got up to leave with little smiles on their faces and everyone was polite and friendly as we left  I came out into the corridor as an earlier Spiderman 2 had just finished in the other screen and the place was packed with running teenagers, hyper kids, hassled parents  all a bit hyped up and bustling; in other words  for a calm, peaceful and warm Sunday afternoon I had picked the right movie to go to and, if that's what you want then try Before Sunset."

","Hitchcock's aphorism, ""Film is life with the boring bits cut out"" has been contradicted by ""Before Sunset"" - a film with the dramatic bits cut out and nothing left but tedious blathering.<br/><br/>The premise seems promising enough:  two characters - amazingly reunited after a one night stand nine years earlier - talk for 95 minutes.  They are clearly drawn to one another but have moved on in their :lives.  We hang on wondering whether or not they will leave their current lives and partners and remain together, or go their separate ways once again.<br/><br/>The film feels like an extended improvised acting exercise or a really bad soap opera scene that doesn't know when to stop.  The characters blather on and on but their conversation is flat; it lacks wit or charm.  We're left to stare at these two young actors jabbering about getting old:  Julie Delpy looks self-consciously coy - the years have given her face a bit more interest but she's lost some of her girlish sensualness; Ethan Hawke. looks more and more like Tom Cruise, flashing his eyes and baring his enormous white teeth.  Probably a master like Woody Allen could have sustained this situation with wit and intelligence.  But here the actors are left to direct the show themselves; wallow in horrible, self indulgent, shallow, vacuous conversation.  It's downright painful and even embarrassing to watch."

I thought that the one on-going scene was annoying and that the characters were so completely self-absorbed that it ultimately turned me off. Ethan Hawke's answers at the beginning did not feel like real answers to me (""Isn't everything autobiographical?"" - What does that mean?), and Julie Delpy's role didn't seem personable or that deep. The dialog to me seemed so stilted that I got uncomfortable just watching the movie. The neat thing about this movie is that it really is centered on just those two characters. When that is done well, it can be riveting. But that makes it high risk - if you don't like the characters, there is nothing else in the movie.

But that is the price of pushing the envelope and I don't want to discourage that. I too thought that Before Sunrise was a warm and wonderful film. I'm a huge Julie Delpy fan. I think the idea of having the actors from the original film contribute to the screenplay of the sequel is inspired. Bravo Richard, Bravo! I love that about you. What I didn't love was the result. Basically it didn't go anywhere. Flat beginning, middle and end. No magic. Maybe that is what it was trying to convey, the loss of magic, inability to recapture the magic.

(would that be the best!) <br/><br/>True to form Linklater has once again produced a trite, over-indulgent, ego-tripping, contrived piece of crap. It's said nothing, it never wanted to say anything, so what was the f***king point?! You are banned from my life Linklater. Never again. <br/><br/>No, I didn't go to Vienna with that guy, and on the basis of this garbage, never will."
"Don Muvo","2","7","16","19 October 2007"," About the Gap Between Commitment and Fullfillment
","The resolution of this movie is simply about the fact that feelings may trump commitment. Now that that's over, I can go on to say why I think this move is such a bad movie.<br/><br/>This movie has a theme, but that's all it has. The acting is atrocious. Ethan Hawke isn't capable, and because this movie is meant to be an improvisational tour de force, his character's lines are constantly jarring our belief. His lines and delivery throughout cause us to doubt that he is really a writer (even though we see him signing books), that he is really a parent, even that he is really a married man. I guess if you buy the bit about his being a writer, you'll buy the family stuff. The scene at the end with Julie Delpy mimics the deceased bebop singer/pianist referred to only as ""she"", is psychologically the coup de gras, since so much of the movie before seemed so disingenuous. Finally nothing is said for the ""feelings"" he has for his son, ""I don't want to ever be without him for even a minute!"", nor what it is he is unable to give his wife that she ""needs"".<br/><br/>Besides the theme, which is a good one, the only other mixed feeling I have is about Julie Delpy who turns in a reasonable performance, and some of the photography."

","I liked the fluidity of the dialog, although I don't consider its content as deep as everyone does. It was just a simple dialog, and as simple I also imply boring. I think it lacks passion and truly connection between the two. The last scene on her apartment seems so fake. At the end of the movie I felt like the director wanted to show simpleness and coolness, but it seemed so forced that I just couldn't buy it. The continuity of the film was something new and helps to maintain attention at all times, as if you were there with them. The actor 's performance was also very good, and both good looking. But what I like most of movies is the script, and in this case was disappointing, I expected more."

","Damn it! I felt they cut short this film. Whenever we hear the word SEQUEL, it feels like a recipe for disaster...there are very few instances in this world where sequel was as good or better than the first movie.This movie is one of those few instances. Two words that describe this movie are- JUST GREAT. It was a pleasure to watch both the movies simultaneously one after the other.The Ending was truly fantastic, keeps the viewer guessing & gasping for more. I loved it & wanted to see more of the chemistry between Jesse and Celine. One more fact that is unbelievable is that there is no kissing scene.A romantic film without a single kiss & mostly based on the conversation between the actors makes you question how is it possible??...Well for the answer you have to see this movie. The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen.

"Cinexcellence","Null","3","5","29 June 2008"," Charming and Fun
","Before Sunset is the sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, and is equally amazing. The on-screen chemistry between Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) and Julie Delpy (as Celine) alone makes them worth watching. In the first installment, the two characters meet on a train in Europe and end up walking around Vienna together for the rest of the day. At the end of the film they decide to meet again in six months at the same train station. The second film is set nine years later. Jesse has written a book about their time in Vienna, and is on the last day of his tour in France. Celine meets him after the book signing, and they spend the remaining time together until his flight leaves. Before Sunset retains the casual banter and romance from the first film, but it's more serious and less fanciful. It shows how the two have grown up, which is shown through their many conversations throughout the film."

","This movie is for those diligent viewers who are looking for a serene and pacifying movie. I walked into the theater with 2 my friends and I was the only one to sit there till the end. <br/><br/>This movie runs on a slow note and is a perfect sequel to the part-1. Before you watch this movie, i would recommend you to watch the previous part. By the end of first part, the two characters decide to meet at a spot which they were expected to do by the beginning of the second part, but quite contrary (yet very realistic) to it, they couldn't. The way they find each other is awesome which is depicted in a very beautiful way. The movie then again runs on a smooth note and they start rediscovering each other again. Hawke and Delpy are the only two faces you are gonna find throughout the movie but you feel like witnessing two worlds walking languidly. <br/><br/>The climax of the movie is more than what one could ever expect. It ends at a note that's as sweet as a jack fruit and keeps revolving inside your mind for the next couple of days. This movie falls into the category of Sweet Land, Lost in Translation and Finding Neverland. <br/><br/>I would rate this movie a 10 upon 10 and highly recommend it for sensible viewers like me who know how deep an uttered word could go and how deeper an unuttered word could run."
"ChicaDificil","10","3","5","30 September 2006"," Romantic film that leaves you pensive and nostalgic
","I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. I remember seeing its predecessor, Before Sunrise, about nine years ago when it came out on video and being pleasantly surprised by that little gem of a movie. I was slightly younger than the main characters, Jessie and Celine, but their dreams and the questions they were struggling with at the time resonated very much with my own. When I heard that Before Sunset was being released, I was somewhat hesitant about seeing it, fearing that the follow-up would not measure up to its predecessor or that I would find the characters' conversations to be annoying and sophomoric. But Before Sunset turned out to be even better than Before Sunrise. Though just as idealistic and romantic, there is a stronger current of nostalgia in this follow-up. Celine and Jessie are more aware of their own limitations and of the sacrifices they had to make for their chosen paths in life. They are giddy to be around each other but also fearful about confronting the unrealized possibilities of the relationship they have so deeply idealized. Yes, the movie is very much conversation-driven, and the conversations sometimes veer into the realm of pretentiousnessbut then again, who hasn't come off as slightly pretentious when they are trying to impress someone they really like? I felt a strong compassion for these characters who are smart, idealistic, but flawed in ways that are endearing and human. There is a real urgency in their interactions as they try to make up for lost time. Richard Linklater is a talented director who has genuine interest in and empathy for people who are adjusting to the difficulties and demands of adulthood."
"GOWBTW","10","3","5","26 May 2006"," Enjoyable from the start!
","Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie ""Before Sunrise"". They show the flashbacks of ""Before Sunrise"" and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is ""tre magnifique"". She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."

","There isn't anything more that I can say about this masterpiece, deftly given to us (like a perfectly wrapped present) by the ""cerebral threesome"": Hawke, Delpy and Linklater.<br/><br/>So much has already been so eloquently said about this film, (particulary the very first two reviews on IMDb) that my verbiage would be redundant. But I just wanted to put some comments down to try to express the way this movie has profoundly affected me. I cannot count how many times I've seen it. And every single time that I do, the ending STILL makes me *gasp*. Sheer perfection. This movie is all about the connection between two extremely passionate, intelligent and visceral people, and NOTHING that has been churned out lately, can even come remotely CLOSE to this archetype of cinematic brilliance. And the ""real time"" aspect, just adds to its perfection.<br/><br/>This movie has so much SOUL; perhaps TOO much for those soulless saps in ""movie-land"" to comprehend.<br/><br/>It is simply, a masterpiece. 'Nuf said."
"csabarish","10","3","5","6 April 2006"," To be Treasured
","The two movies happened to me. I say happened to me because watching them was like going through an experience. Also because i chanced upon them each time. I had seen 'Before Sunrise' years ago when surfing through the channels i had stopped catching something interesting in the way Ethan Hawk was looking at July. It was the scene when they first meet on the train. I enjoyed the film and remembered it as one remembers distant but good memories. Years later in college a friend of mine saw Before Sunset and was raving about it. I said I had seen the film thinking that he was talking about Before Sunrise. It took me a while to realize that a sequel had been made of the film. And this time, it was a revelation.<br/><br/>Yes the film can stand alone as a story, but it would be a shame not to watch the prequel before watching this one. Brilliant acting and dialogs coupled with a most plausible situation that could be a day out of any body's life. Here I am talking about the start of the day. Unexpected meeting with a past. Something that had meant a lot. Which still probably means a lot. But would you acknowledge it immediately? Would you not want to find out if there was still any hope left? I would. And that is why I love this film. It gives you hope that chances missed due to bad luck, or pure bad judgment could still be had again. The idea is romantic and the presentation is probably the most mature presentation of it. This very fact saves the film from being sappy or overly romantic. The dialogs, the interplay, the advances are all so real and so well thought out that it must take a pair of extremely gifted actors to play well. Our actors do that and still manage to keep the proceedings interesting. It must require extraordinary skill and chemistry. Awards do not matter here i think as the film has been made out of pure creative urge. Just the fact that such a captivating yet subtle film exists must be a triumph for everyone involved. And a memorable experience for the viewer given he watches it at the right point in life."
"fernando-rebelo","10","3","5","20 January 2006"," Two of the greatest love movies ever
","I only discovered these two fantastic films this very last week altogether with my wife. I rented first the ""Before Sunrise"". As we instantly got in love with it, we ran to Blockbuster the next day to get the ""Before Sunset"". What i must say is that are few valuable words to rate these films. Because this is about feelings. About that ""one in a lifetime love passion"" we once had, or we luckily are having, or yet, we wish we had had. Everything is perfect, Julie Delpy as Celine, Ethan Hawke as Jesse, Richard Linklater the director, the cleverest dialogs in movie history, the less known sites of Viena first, Paris after, etc, etc. Everything so ""real live"", ""real people"" that we viewers, become Jesse and Celine! They are us! We are them! Or we wanted to be... There were great love movies and there will be made great movies in the future, that's for sure. But these two will remain forever in my short top ten ranking. If you miss ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" you will never forgive yourselves! We get to the end of the movies, seeing the credits with a big and happy smile in our face. Next days later we search on the net more stories about ""sunrise"" and ""sunset"", the complicity with that young and then, 9 years older nice couple, grows and grows. And then we are addicted with these movies, and then we watch them again, and again... ""Baby, you are gonna miss that plane"" says Celine to an enchanted Jesse in the end. Was really the end?..."
"citizen_conn","7","3","5","8 October 2005"," Probably one of the best sequels I have ever seen.
","The dialog is considerably more believable, the characters are deeper, the emotions are stronger and the viewer's connection with the characters is more intense. Ethan Hawke is better, Julie Delpy is better, Richard Linklater is at his best.<br/><br/>It is outstanding to watch both Jesse and Ethan Hawke grow as a normal guy on a quest for happiness and an actor who has improved a lot since the first part, respectively. Julie Delpy's performance left me in awe in scenes where she describes her frustration with her sub-par love life, whereas 10 years ago her lines seemed emotionless and routine. Richard Linklater takes themes he would only touch superficially in the first part, and dives into them in the second part, much like how the characters are more callous and realize they have nothing to lose anymore.<br/><br/>I must admit the first part did not impress me. I was enthralled by the excitement of the young adults' spontaneous romance in Vienna, but it all seemed so dreamy and stereotypical of how love should be. Well, I realize now that this is exactly what it was supposed to be. It was love in every meaning of the word: heightening, inspiring, and painful. It wasn't until I saw Before Sunset that all this dawned on me. The way Jesse and Celine look back at the time they shared 9 years ago, how beautiful their one night was together, how their lives have changed, and they contemplate what could have been, Linklater portrays not only a story of true love, but life in itself and it's never-ending series of ups and downs.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but try to walk in Jesse's shoes in my own life 9 years down the road and wonder if I will make the same decisions. Is it inevitable that you wish you would have done things differently? Will ever I connect with someone the way Jesse and Celine do? Is it fair to measure happiness circumstantially? All these are questions Linklater makes us think about while witnessing a love that just doesn't ""fizzle out""."
"manyanena","9","3","5","3 October 2005"," Love story for romantic adults -- a treat
","After reading poor/mixed reviews in 2004, I put off watching this sequel. What a waste..It's a great movie for romantics, especially those who believe in the endurance of old feelings regardless of how the romance ended.<br/><br/>Unlike other viewers I found no mystery to the ending -- they do get together.<br/><br/>Jesse's inability to leave her when he finds her again, and his positive response to her last question in which he states helplessly that he will miss the plane is a clear indicator that despite the complexity of their current lives (breakup and divorce with their current mates), they are together this time. It's also implied by their mutual revelation of how unsatisfied each is in their current relationships. Jesse cannot love his wife as she expects it and Julie has suppressed her romantic feelings so much that she is satisfied with an intermittent long-distance relationship. Neither mate stands a chance to Julie dancing to Nina Simone as she seduces Jesse to stay.<br/><br/>His acknowledgment that he will miss his plane is delivered with a smile that reminds me of certain scenes in two early Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward films (Paris Blues but especially The Long Hot Summer) in which Paul simply cannot stop grinning at his real love Joanne when they are flirting because he is so nuts about her.<br/><br/>This movie was a treat..."
"robbids","10","3","5","28 May 2005"," What a perfect sequel should be like
","I loved this film, as I loved the first one, possibly more. More because the characters are much more 'real' here. They grew up like we all did, they went through sorrow, disappointment, they learnt a lot, and still, for many things, they are the same people they were 9 years ago, because they still dream and they're still looking for their perfect love, that love they let go 9 years before. It's what Jesse says at some point - nobody really ever change. Being of the same age group of the characters, I could identify a lot with what they say and feel. Which means that Hawke and Delpy did a great job, both acting and writing this film. It's subtle, delicate, and it needs to be listened to very attentively, not to miss one word of the great, deep dialogue. Well done to all of them. And, it's so true, the only problem with this film is that it ends..."

","I just wrote about how Sideways could possibly be deemed a masterpiece (a rare element in American movies since the 70's) and for a lot of critics Sideways was the best movie of the year. I feel though, it falls second to Before Sunset. The difference between the two and what makes Before Sunset superior is the vehicle that drives the film. In Sideways, it is comedy. In Before Sunset, it is emotion-heartbreak, arrogance, hopelessness, and love. These by innate nature make it more powerful and haunting than the escapades of Payne's great film. Linklater, a great director that makes a Texan proud to be Texan again, directs like a great conductor letting a world-famous soloist take the vehicle where it needs to go but just keeping the headlights on. These two performances are deeply earnest. You can see the heartbreak coming from their own lives inch out of their mouths and glow from the building tears in their eyes. Whether or not they are bringing experiences from their own life is irrelevant. They are channeling what they know these characters need to feel into the sublime script. I hope and feel this will be remembered along with Sideways, Colllateral, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Closer as redeeming qualities making 2004 a movie year worth remembering."

","I have felt cheated at one time or another by a movie where the ending took all of the wind out a film. This film is brilliant.<br/><br/>I do not include any spoilers as I hope my review encourages people to rent this DVD.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Before Sunrise many of the subtleties of reference to the earlier film will be lost and that...that would be criminal if you truly enjoy a movie where ACTING not plot points are your film devour. After seeing it on the big screen I was waiting with baited breathe to rent both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset together for my fiancée who hadn't heard of either. He was truly moved by Before Sunrise and was anxious to see Before Sunset as the second,third and fourth course to this wonderful meal.<br/><br/>The movie was written by Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke and as you will see in the special features, it was a collaboration spanning 9 years. Now to the point.....<br/><br/>The lovers meet again by chance in Paris where Jesse (Ethan Hawke)is promoting his novel written about his passion for Celine (Julie Delpy) 9 years earlier that only spanned one day and night. It is that one day and night that sustains these characters and in the same way taints the way they look at love since they met years earlier.<br/><br/>The characters effortlessly connect again while taking in a coffee at a café'. You don't sense that this is anything but a lucky coincidence as they pick up with a Decalogue they so enjoyed years earlier as they walk through the Parisian streets. (So beautiful!!) Nothing too personal is mentioned until an hour into the film and that you will need to see, hear and feel for yourselves. To quote the movie would be giving away the secret that unlocks this extraordinary film.<br/><br/>While the characters have moved on since that morning they said goodbye, it is interesting to watch them discover what happened 6 months later that kept them apart.<br/><br/>It is romantic, funny, sad, touching and most of all...loyal to themselves, the respect of time gone by and most importantly, the movie's audience.<br/><br/>4 stars with a recommendation of buying the film."

How could he (Director Linklater) do this, to tantalize and torment in such a rueful, and a cruel way!? Don't watch this movie without watching the prequel (""Before Sunrise""), first; you will be playing an oft confusing game of catch-up, I believe, if you do (i.e., watch these movies out of chronological order). I watched this movie three times before returning it. It is a gem of a movie, and the actors and writers should consider a third installment when the time is right ... not in any prerequisite number of years (i.e., nine for example). Here is my unsolicited vote for J. Delpy for an Academy Award for Best Actress 2004 for her work in ""Before Sunset""! Her performance throughout was captivating, engaging, engrossing. Her display of anger while riding in the van was such that only a Frenchwoman can manifest and it was mesmerizing!!!

Before I watched it I read only good reviews - how does IMDb classify them? So I thought it would be worth dropping a few slightly more alternative thoughts on a film I so wanted to enjoy. 1. The main characters are soooo boring, honestly I cannot imagine spending any more than 10 minutes with them in real life. Gauche and self obsessed; not my cup of tea and definitely not people to care about. 2. The script is weak as water. It honestly sounds like they were making it up as they went along - badly. It was like watching Big Brother - boring people saying boring things. 3. There's no atmosphere to the film, no colour, no spark. I mean nothing - no characters, no character. It's great to see Hollywood drag itself out of its natural home - the west coast, and even better to attempt a film like this, but it never really works. Setting a film in Paris and employing a French actress doesn't make it worth watching, I would suggest trying one of the other 499."

","In the beginning this movie seemed to have had some promise, but all is lost within the first 45 minutes or so of the film. The basic premise is two past lovers chance to encounter each other again years later, but their lives, of course, are different now.<br/><br/>The movie is all dialog, save one musical performance. While this itself is not a turn-off for me it may be for some. I've enjoyed other movies of the format, but this wasn't one of them. The dialog is mainly between the two main characters. And the conversations, while many of us have experienced these dialogs with friends and lovers, past and present, and have probably enjoyed them and have fond memories of them, it's a completely different issue when one is not the participant and instead an involuntary voyeur. There's none of the same satisfaction or heightened emotion and instead I mostly wished I was somewhere else. After a while I'd pretty much heard all I want to hear and I'm thinking, ""Why don't they just sleep with each other already and be done with it?"" But instead the viewer is forced to witness, not though action but through talk, 80 minutes of the past and present lives of two individuals who still haven't given us reason to afford them any empathy.<br/><br/>The writing does nothing to save it. It's not particularly humorous, witty, or interesting and so basically comes of as if the camera picked a random couple in Paris and decided to follow them for a day, giving us the full unedited account. I understand that this is a sequel and I did not see the first in the series, so understand that my lack of empathy might be thrown off because of it. I can only hope the first one is not as painful to watch.<br/><br/>But if you play the movie with the sound muted you get a nice videography of Paris. Maybe then you could make up your own interesting dialog."

","The idea is good and so is the acting. What makes this film a supreme bore though, is the script. It is not that it is far-fetched and unrealistic, on the contrary, it is very realistic and many a viewer will immediately recognise the way the two protagonists, who may have lost sight of, but had not forgotten, one another, interact. From the tentative exploration of the emotional landscape in the Parisian café at the beginning of the film, to the more intimate open closing scene with its mixture of sexual tension and regret over missed opportunities and choices wrongly made, the script, filmed in apparent real time, stays very close to life. However, like some nineteenth-century realistic novels of which this film reminded me a little (e.g. George Gissing's New Grub Street), realism does not necessarily make for compelling viewing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the film, not even in the acting, that lifts the everyday story to a higher plane so as to invest it with more meaning. It would seem that just like its protagonists, the director failed to make good use of an opportunity."

","I appreciate Before Sunset for what it is -- a sequel made nine years after the original, set nine years after the original, starring the same two actors and following up on the events of the original -- but that does not mean I liked it. The conversations in this film were not as interesting as the first movie, and I did not want the two romantic leads to get together anymore. Yes, it feels very realistic, but who wants to listen to people complain about their life and their marriage for over an hour?"

","What a major disappointment...<br/><br/>This film is VERY contrived, taking all the magic from the first endeavour. I watched and loved ""Sunrise"" a few days ago and was thus very eager for this. I wonder how most people - well, here at least... - seem to find it so good. One word occurred to me throughout the whole experience: unnecessary. Plus, there's some real painful dialogue to go through this time around, namely from Celine's character. Lame, clichéd, ill-written. The location is once again a mere postcard, but even that works less good than Vienna did.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst thing though: this time it was virtually impossible to feel the attraction. Null chemistry. What I saw were two actors trying to rehash their old hit. Acting the whole time. And using ""right?"" at the end of every 3 sentences.<br/><br/>Now if I could just unsee this and stay with the magic of the original movie..."

","Before Sunrise was a date movie- a boy and a girl meets and talks about love, life, their experiences and their interpretations. They talk and talk. Both wary of love, but still falling for each other. It had those smart great dialogues that make for an absorbing patient watch. In their conversations I found my own philosophy, my own search for soulmate and my own dilemmas. But there was something amiss there. A proper narratively structured story was missing, yes, but what the movie was really deficient was in its aloofness. It muses about ideas of love and life and they even lay bare their personal lives to each other, but what was missing was the translation of that anguish, of that hurt, of that disappointment in the wordings of their dialogues and mannerisms. It is like they are trying to reach a diagnosis in that clinical detached sort of way and this may be an appropriate treatment given the circumstances of the movie, but that was very off putting for me. Now coming to Before Sunset, it is everything that its predecessor was and much more. It takes place nine years after their first encounter with each other. He is the author of a best selling novel on a book tour in Paris. She stays in Paris and works for a cause. They meet in the morning and he has a flight to catch in the evening. So starts their second date. It starts initially with their cool detachment to the growing love between them, more so as they are left bitter by their love lives though their professional lives are in a much better state, but you could see in their mannerisms and dialogues their anguish and their pain and their longing for each other. A look here and there. A word here and there. You could feel that. And then in the second half where this facade of coolness bursts open and they for the first time really talk their heart out, you really get to know them and feel them and care for them. These are two vulnerable people charred with their bitter and disappointing experiences in the matters of heart trying to come in terms with loneliness and their elusive search for 'the one' and their anger and frustration to keep up their appointment. The screenplay credit is shared by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke along with Richard Linklater. And since both Delpy and Hawke were going through tumultuous relationships, you could read their notes of sufferings and pain in the dialogues they deliver. That added to the movie that sort of realism that was missing in the predecessor. SPOILERS AHEAD. There are two things that I am dying to mention here. First is the look that Julie Delpy gives now and then and more frequently in the second half to Ethan Hawke when he is not conscious of them. That look is the most painful and beautiful thing ever. That look says it all. And the second is the ending. The ending is just wow. WOW!! He is there sitting on the sofa looking at her and smiling. She is right there in front of him but not facing him and dancing slowly to a beautiful song. He knows there is a flight to catch. She reminds him of that playfully. But he is still smiling and she is still dancing. What an ending. Wow. SPOILERS OVER. Before Sunset is a movie that is for everybody who has fallen in love, is about to or has always wondered about it. It speaks to the heart, expresses the dilemma, but does not answer the question. It is funny and sad how the protagonists are trying to be real in their expectations, but are actually craving that idealism. Don't we all want that perfect soulmate that we hear it in all the fairy tale ending stories? So who am I to blame them?! Keep hoping, Jesse and Celine. And that was what the ending was about-an instillation of optimism in our hearts for that fairy tale ending."

","While the hypnotic mist that engulfed me after watching the first movie 'Before Sunrise', of the trilogy by Richard Linklater, was yet to settle down, I had a chance to watch its sequel, 'Before Sunset', soon after. Two strangers, Jesse and Celine, who had spent a loquacious and romantic day together, exploring the streets of Vienna, were supposed to meet after 9 long years and I was very pretty curious and anxious to know what had happened before and what would happen now that they would be meeting again. Eventually, the movie turned out to be an awesome manifestation of strong emotions trapped within for years - as if a kind of low intensity volcano that doesn't erupt catastrophically but, never-the- less, changes the landscape of the minds of the protagonists and how they react to it. The movie, for most part, rests heavily on its strong script and powerful acting of the two lead characters (it's hard to believe that the protagonists themselves – Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy –had co-authored the script). So one needs to be all ears to fully immerse and enjoy their coming face to face with the reality and tackling it. This demanded a very judicious and effortless acting on the part of the lead pair and Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy had done an excellent job of it. Their acting is so natural that most times they seem to be playing for themselves rather than performing their roles. Also their body chemistry is extremely enjoyable. It seems the body chemistry they developed before, while playing their roles in the first movie of the trilogy, had come handy and they have improved upon it further in this movie. The director, Richard Linklater, and his cinematographer, had a formidable task at their hands of holding the audiences together till the very end since the movie solely depended upon the script & acting with not much of the scenic locations, visuals or twists & turns in the plot. But in the end, they had done a brilliant job of it. Intensely dramatic scenes are handled delicately without glycerin filled tears or nerve breaking sobs. Then they made judicious use of light highlighting happy, sad or tense situations, For instance, the lead pair glows in the sunlight when they ferry across the river Seine in Paris in a joyous mood while darker shades of light are used to depict tense situations. This thoughtful use of light elevates the given situation beyond measure and, at times, even communicates in absence of any dialogue from the actors. This variable display of light seems not merely coincidental but a meticulously planned creation of the director and so are the unusually long takes between the shots. Maybe not realized by less discerning viewer, many small but deft & creative directorial touches go on throughout the movie that keep the audience glued to their seats till it reaches its pinnacle - the concluding song- 'A waltz for the night'. The song (also written & performed on screen by Julie Delpy) is the real gem – a cherry on the top! Its sweet rendition echoes in your ears as you leave the auditorium and its sure to remain further with you for a very long time. So go watch it! The movie is a juxtaposition of art, music and crafty film-making which eventually sings a different tune of a celebration that an elite film-lover can't afford to miss."
"Arcturus1980","10","2","3","22 June 2013"," Actual intoxicating perfection
","Rarely do I watch Before Sunrise and not Before Sunset immediately afterward. The former insists on the latter. A divine three hours indeed. The original writing team of Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan get the story credit, while Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke join Linklater for the screenplay credit. Way cool to have actors writing their own sublime dialogue. Funding difficulties forced a minimalism congruous with the naturalism. Done in real time with long continuous shots, there is not a hint of contrivance. I really cannot imagine an improvement of any significance on this superlative film.<br/><br/>Before Sunrise ended with Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine looking forward to their reunion six months later in Vienna. Jesse borrowed $2,000 from his dad to be there, while Celine had to attend her dearly beloved grandmother's funeral that same day. Talk about bad timing, but this was the very grandmother whom Celine visited that summer of '94 and, therefore, without whom they would never have met. Then again, we could say the same for Jesse's ex-girlfriend in Madrid. The absurd interplay of fate and chance intrigues and frustrates. They could have been in different cars on that train from Budapest.<br/><br/>The film and trilogy being quintessentially character-driven, Linklater's directorial touch is just right. He begins Before Sunset with a reverse-order montage that beautifully calls to mind that of the first film's ending. Jesse, by this time unhappily married with a 4-year-old son, is in a Parisian bookstore wrapping up a tour for his novel This Time, based on their brief encounter nine years previous. Never connecting with someone so deeply theretofore nor in the intervening nine years, the struggle to remain alive to his experience of their time together compelled him to immortalize that night by sharing with the world the significance of really meeting someone. More than that, he knew it was his best shot at seeing Celine again. Celine, who is working for an environmental organization called Green Cross and in a relationship with an often-away war photojournalist, smiles at a wonder-struck Jesse as he is finishing his talk. So much to say and so little time (just over an hour) before Jesse is to leave for the airport.<br/><br/>The years have naturally rendered them more worldly-wise this time around, as is reflected throughout their humorous, incisive dialogue, but having to revert back to a shared sense of hope and meaning is something of a paradox. There is truth to be found in the perceived naiveté of youth. Jesse, emotionally ravaged by their years apart, is torn between an undying love for Celine and the inertia of a loveless marriage, wherefrom his son Hank is the only saving grace. Celine by comparison is more of a closed book: harboring the guilt of missing their rendezvous, she had contentedly resigned herself to a life less delightful, but reading his novel awakened her to how hopelessly starved for meaning and excitement she has since been. Jadedly guarded, she keeps an emotional distance despite the undeniable sparks they again get one on one. How is married Jesse to help her after all? <br/><br/>There is a very touching moment on the tourist boat where Celine is at her loquacious best--real salt of the earth stuff--and Jesse, having relived their night together over and over to write his book, is simply compelled to address their preposterous misconnection as the clock ticks away. This leads into ever more personal territory as they exchange sorrowful revelations in a cathartic purge of pent-up grief. Bantering again, Celine hugs him strongly--their first embrace since going their separate ways nine years before--and though playing it cool, she seems to know her waltz (Julie Delpy's wonderful ""A Waltz for a Night"") is about to do the trick. The clock be damned, Jesse selects Nina Simone's ""Just in Time"" to which Celine respectfully impersonates the iconic singer.<br/><br/>Before Sunrise ended on a particularly sad note, so the uplifting nature of this subtly executed ending is all the more satisfying."

","I think those of us in our thirties will really respond to BEFORE SUNSET as we did to BEFORE SUNRISE when we were twenty. I think those in my age group will have a special place for these two movies because they fell within our time, as if a voice speaking for us. But, ultimately, the idea of unrequited love is universal—how many of us truly loved this certain someone, that first true love, only to find ourselves married or linked to another, although we will forever remember that girl/boy who got away? My heart both melted and warmed as I revisited BEFORE SUNSET since I first watched it back when I was a little younger in 2005, still in my twenties, but approaching my thirties. However, in 1995, when BEFORE SUNRISE was made, I was so young, a teenager with the future ahead of me(in essence, two years later I'd be married, and the next 12 work in a factory, before losing that job gave way to a possible brighter future)and so the plot of two people, an American young man touring Europe, running into, by chance(or dare I say it—gulp—fate )a lovely Parisian woman, the two sparking conversation, before remaining together throughout the day and night, falling in love in the process. I secretly am a romantic at heart—although that side of me is often hidden away—and so BEFORE SUNRISE & BEFORE SUNSET have a way of really reaching me, holding me in their grip, and I hate when those movies end. It's nearly improbable, the idea that two people who would never meet in Vienna, find each other in Paris as Ethan Hawke has written his experiences with Julie Delpy in a novella which is a success. They pick up right where they left off, with relationship problems(he is unhappy in his marriage, probably because his wife is not Delpy, and she can not find a substitute for Hawke), discussing intimately details which have accumulated over the last nine years since the last time they saw each other. It starts with small talk and eventually both admit and confront the disappointments of being apart and never recovering from that moment in their lives which forever remains with them. And, Paris is the backdrop, the two walking and chatting, as if one 80 minute long take, quite an impressive feat for director Linklater who allows us to partake in their reunion.<br/><br/>I have equal feelings frustration, joy, and sadness, when I watch these two movies because I want them together and feel like life so often is like this..those who truly should be together aren't, while so many marriages are so unfulfilled because the love that is obvious between Hawke and Delpy so often doesn't exist in a formalized union, a format which is conducted and composed. I'm frustrated because I never communicated my love for the girl I deeply cared for and admired, never even having that moment that Hawke and Delpy have in spades. At least they had this one night, the pain of nothing more than that thrives during the entire running time for BEFORE SUNSET. I think the most telling and wonderful moment was Delpy's song, ""The Waltz"", succumbed to Hawke's pleas for her to sing to him with her guitar—it is about him and her feelings of that night and how it continues on, I could only smile, with tears, because it just reiterates to me how life is unfair and how love isn't always meant to be. Am I the only one who sympathizes with Hawke who stares at her forlornly, not wanting to leave her apartment even though his flight is upcoming? I think it's safe to say that he wants this time together, this day to never end. I'm glad Linklater doesn't allow us to see them separate. Delpy, I just adore her in this movie. When she hugs Hawke, I'm overcome with a sense of depression, mixed with comfort that at least she gets to embrace the man she will always love, her one true love that no other man will be able to replace, yet grieve in my very soul that for nine years they haven't been able to do so due to mistakes and missed opportunities. Both actors really give us rich characterizations, ad-libbing some of their dialogue, I figure, yet creating two very elaborate, distinct people. I remember thinking a few years ago that BEFORE SUNRISE as a whole is the equivalent of those scenes in average Hollywood rom-coms where music overlaps what two people are saying to each other as they hang out and spend time together, because of lazy writing and idea that the movie-going public might not actually enjoy a film that is ""talky"". I don't necessarily consider BEFORE SUNRISE/SUNSET as arty, although the two characters talk about everything that pops into their heads and what I think really works is that they fully enjoy each other's company. I think that's important. Often in rom-coms, it starts with two people who can't stand to be around each other—You've Got Mail—eventually, though, the couple fall in love. Not in the case of these two films where two people from polar opposite worlds find that they really have a chemistry viable, can agree—and in some cases disagree—about issues and beliefs, yet accept their differences and talk intently about them, share and take in the luxurious environs around them while they do so. You know, if anything, I can simply sit and watch Delpy for the running time, her smile just overwhelms me to my very core and I can reason why Hawke has never forgotten her, moved on past their night together, and has a degree of difficulty leaving her now that he has found her once again. To me, there's nothing like that smile, the kind of smile that softens you, grabs your heart in a clinched fist and squeezes you into submission. God, I heart that woman."

"webmaster-3017","8","2","3","5 July 2008"," HK Neo Reviews: Before Sunset
","Tagline: A genuine attempt at recapturing missed opportunities Review by Neo: Perhaps it is almost truism to say that it is human nature to desire what we cannot have. It is part life that people will have to endure through situations where it will leave them with the feeling of what if and what could have been. While, people may say that what has passed has already passed and there is no point pondering or going back to asking what could have been. That is why Before Sunset is such a good movie as it is able to depict all these underlying and deep emotions that we have all kept within ourselves and soul.<br/><br/>Life is never easy, meeting the right people requires the right timing and the right place, it may well be the right timing for you, but for someone else, the timing may not be right. The person may be still letting go out their past or may be the couple could be separated by distance. I remember a girl asking me, why we didn't meet earlier, at that moment, I just said that if we did, we might never be together. Thinking back, at this very moment, it makes you realised that while the timing was perfect for me personally, having just graduated, about to start a new job, and being able to let go of the past completely for the first time, but love is always a two way thing. Perhaps for the girl, we probably met 3 years too late.<br/><br/>9 years on after their fateful meeting in Before Sunrise, they meet again in a bookshop in Paris and what is so wonderful about this movie is definitely the realism and the underlying emotional core which coincides perfectly with the witty and thoughtful dialogue. Once again the Wong Kar Wai's theme is evident here, love is all about timing, and it is no good meeting a person too early or too late. For the case of this couple, it is more of a case of everything being right, except for fate playing a game on their love. All these lead to further feeling of regret and the ever lingering emotion along the lines of unfinished businesses.<br/><br/>Like Before Sunrise, the unfulfilling sudden ending gives hope to the audience to engage in their own sort of thinking. Perhaps, they won't be together, but at least their second meeting allowed them to give it a shot and finally a way to possibly put the regrets behind them. Then again, one needs to look no further than the current cinema running of Two Days in Paris for an answer.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as the guy and Julie Dephy has this undeniable likable nature about her that makes her character so believable. Their chemistry together is just radiating off screen and on screen. There are moments in the car that allows Julie to expresses her acting chops and director Richard Linklater wisely engages some memorable flash back to evoke further emotions.<br/><br/>All in all, Before Sunset is by all means a good little movie that goes only a little longer than 1 hour. Not unlike the situation within the movie, perhaps Julie was right, maybe their relationship is only good for short term meetings. It is a pity that they weren't together 9 years ago, but what made the movie better is the manner that Ethan realised that his love for her was not just single sided and knowing the fact that at the same time when he was lonely and thinking about that someone, the feelings are mutual. As we venture to the end of this review, it is now 2:17 pm, on the 25th of March 2008, a moment that will not come back again and with a brink of an eye it have already been exactly 3 months since that fateful meeting. We might meet again one day or perhaps not, but I guess no one really knows. Let's finish off with a beautiful quote from Julie: ""memory is a wonderful thing, if we do not have to deal with the past"" A quote that rings so true and real (Neo 2008) <br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"
"shaider1-3","10","2","3","11 June 2008"," Best movie of all time for me!
","Firstly i would like to express my disbelief about the rating this movie has received here: an 8.0/10, and the same as 'Before Sunrise'? You've have got to be kidding me!!!! And I cannot believe that it hasn't won an Oscar either, for me this is hands down the best movie ever made in Hollywood.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it has so many dimensions that are imperative; it is difficult to pinpoint one single aspect of the movie as the most overriding one. Yet, this movie conveys one simple message: the importance of youth. Life is only worth living when you are young at heart, it does not depend on age. Jesse and Celine are living miserably because they have forgotten what it means to be 'young', even though they are very successful in their lives. Youth is better understood by those who have passed (and lived through it)it than those who are living it. Love is better understood by people who have loved, and lost it. This is the simple reality, and this movie tells us that.<br/><br/>What makes this movie far superior to its predecessor is the fact that the actors have matured, and are understanding youth/love better than they did in the first movie. This is evident by every sentence Jesse says, every look Celine gives; simply stunning. I have loved before, and lost her: i feel myself not only compatible with Jesse but Jesse himself. Everything that comes out of Jesse's mouth is what i have said to my love.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the setting that it takes place in could not have been better: Paris. It is every person's fantasy to go there. The lighting is great, and everything else to. About the movie, the way it has connected the beginning to the finish is amazing. The way Celine dances in the end is exactly the same way Jesse described it in the beginning of the movie. I was extremely sad at the end of the movie, as to how little time Jesse had to capture the magic in Celine's apartment. The playing of the song was a brilliant idea, as well as how she dances in the end. Jesse's reactions in the end are precious (even though they hurt so much, when he's realizing what a life of misery he's lived in the past 9 years). He doesn't want to leave her, but life is not like that. He has a kid, wife, responsibility and everything else that he needs in his life; without the one thing he truly longs for: youth. Unfortunately, life is like that.<br/><br/>Each and every moment that Celine and Jesse had together in this movie was a moment to savor. Unfortunately, time is of the essence and not on their side."

Before Sunset (2004) is the result of three intelligent minds working together.Those three people are the director Richard Linklater and the actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.They all were also writing the movie.The dialogue between Jesse and Celine remains interesting all the time.They're at the same page with the interaction.That makes you believe these people belong together.The chemistry between the main actors hasn't faded at all.Not even the least bit.It's not impossible if the relationship of these two takes a further course and the movie series goes on in the future.Hawke has suggested such an idea.I wouldn't mind that if they succeed to keep it as interesting.These two movies certainly have worked.Both of them are kind of movies that make the world look a little less cynical."

The way that both actors were on the first film was as they were connected somehow making it so real that you could caught yourself thinking and hopping that there will be a classic -Hollywood made- happy ending to make sure that's just a movie and nothing more! But no, no compromise whatsoever! And now to ""Sunset"" which starts with both characters acting awkward, playing hide and seek. They are now older, 9 years older, which make every person change a lot and they are both afraid each other. You need less than 15 minutes in the movie and you realise that you feel like the first movie, but now is even better! You are sure that this is real life, you can easily be convinced that it's a home-made video or a movie based on a real life! As the minutes go by and you see them revealing themselves to each other once again after all this time you feel no acting but real feelings between them. The act of deception in all it's glory! Hawk and Delpy better than ever before and Linklater just brought reality in a way that no one could ever imagine as possible! If I had to chose a film to watch for full 24hours that would be it. Every time you see something more in it, something that makes it more real! One of the best films I've ever seen.... EVER!!!"

","""Before Sunset"" is so very simple. There are only two actors and only one simple story. But that story will crawl into your heart and stay there, sipping its camomile tea, listening to street musicians and wondering if true love really exists. Because the story knows it does, but it just wants to make you wonder too...<br/><br/>Basically the movie is about two people who meet again, both thinking the other had forgotten about what they shared a long time ago. They just walk and talk, discovering a lot, sharing a lot and probably deciding a lot. Might sound cheesy, but it's worth every penny and every minute spent on it. Don't miss it for the world.<br/><br/>Truly an unique movie experience."
"hankhanks12345","10","2","3","10 April 2007"," Great film. See ""Before Sunrise"" first, though
","Add me to the chorus of people who really enjoyed this film. I think that the two films - ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" - make for a wonderful experience. Both films are interesting enough to stand on their own, I guess, but this is truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.<br/><br/>The fact that the actors are themselves 9 years older is one of the reasons why the film feels genuine. At one point in the film the Hawke character says that people stay essentially the same throughout their whole lives, even if their circumstances and lifestyles change. I'd say that seems to be true of these characters, and is done in an interesting way: The two characters - and actors - are 9 years older and how are in a different phase in their life, but the same spark that made them interesting to watch in the first film is true here as well.<br/><br/>This is not a film to watch if you're interested in action, or even plot. Essentially all that happens is that two people meet up and talk for about 80 minutes, and that's it. But the conversation is so interesting - particularly since they have the first film to draw on - that it really holds your attention the whole time.<br/><br/>I've heard that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have toyed with the idea of making more movies about these characters every few years, and I hope they end up doing that.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film, and one that really makes you think."
"ierldan","10","2","3","23 February 2007"," Simplicity at Its Best
","I think a lot about the original and the sequel of the movie is said in the title. ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" are about this short period of time in everyone's life, when we are at our most conscious, most creative, most open to life and full of expectations. Hopes that each day will enrich us, present us with new and exciting opportunities, that it will bring us closer to that perfect image of us that we first had when we were five.<br/><br/>However, the sequel is more about the specific moment in life when we have already realized that we aren't anywhere closer to that perfect image; that life has already peaked for us without us properly understanding when and why and that it has began its inescapable decline.<br/><br/>What makes this film a masterpiece, like no other, is its simplicity. It is a multi-layered film, without layers-a simple idea (a long wished for reunion of two disillusioned souls), faultless acting and what's important in life dialogue."
"rds21","10","2","3","28 August 2006"," The most believable romance I've ever seen.
","Julie Delpy is perfectly beautiful in this intelligent and deeply affecting romance. The dialog speaks from the soul. The Parisian scenery is gorgeous, Delpy's music is moving, and the performances are pitch perfect. This is even better than Before Sunrise (1995), the film for which this is a sequel. The two protagonists are more complex. They have both suffered disappointments, yet - as Celine observes - their personalities are essentially unchanged, just more finely carved. The film's ending is inspired. The only mild criticism is that the characters are almost too eloquent. As a sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) this could not be bettered."
"Manuja","10","2","3","28 August 2006"," One Perfect Day In Paris
","I saw this film 4 weeks ago on a Cable channel in Australia. I just happened to watch it on an off chance, and within minutes of the movie starting,I got completely absorbed in it. The movie was simply told, but the story was anything but simple. It was one of the best films I have seen so far! The entire movie was shot in a few scenes, and with a moving camera. All the two characters do is talk to each other.<br/><br/>Jesse and Celine have met after a 9-year hiatus. Jesse is an American and Celine is French. They met in their early twenties in Italy. After a brief Romance, they agree to meet again in 6 months in the same place, but due to Celine's grandmother passing away she is unable to make it. But we find out that Jesse did come, and years later he writes a book about the incident. This compels Celine to come to his book signing in Paris,(which is where she lives),as she identify's that the story he wrote is about their liaison.<br/><br/>After they meet they start talking about their current lives and it is revealed that neither of them are blissfully happy in their respective circumstances. Jesse who is married, obviously is not in love with his wife anymore IF he ever was, and appears never to have got over Celine, and Celine, who never got married, appears never to have got over Jesse either. Neither of them where able to forget the romantic ideal that they had held for the other.<br/><br/>The day that they spend together walking around Paris gives us an insight into the characters and their mindsets. It also fills us in on their first meeting, and what happened consequently, and also their present lives and the dissatisfaction they have in the same. I just loved the way this story was told, one afternoon, two people, good conversation, and no embellishments. Some of the conversations where SO normal, that you didn't feel like they where constructed dialogue at all. As the day progresses their conversations become increasingly honest. Almost painfully so, and many things about their depth of feeling for each other is revealed.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was at his best in this film. His performance was honest and heartfelt. I loved it, and Julie Delpy's performance was equally good. They had a great on screen chemistry that added to the authenticity of the story.<br/><br/>The story basically ends ambiguously, and it is up to us to decide if they are going to get together this time or not? We are convinced by the end of this afternoon that Jesse and Celine are meant for each other. We are left hoping that they feel the same!"
"davidburndy","8","2","3","15 May 2006"," Sooo simple!
","It is a real good filmmaker that can turn the ordinary into extraordinary. Before Sunset does just that in a very simple and effective manner. I have become fond of Richard Linklater's ability and wisdom of seeming magic in what could have been meaningless in other hands. The growth of the relationship within the boundaries of time is as realistic as it can ever be, but unlike reality TV, this film possess an artistry filled with beauty. Bravo! The acting was very natural. Choices were made by the demand of the previous moment rather than for the mere Eggo. Both actors were very much into what they were doing. The listened to each other and really heard one another. Cinematography could have been easily sacrificed if it were not for the wisdom to let the actors do their thing and you just there to record. Great job everyone."

","Some movies take us far away from our lives, showing exciting action scenes and building up characters with dramatic violence. This is not one of those movies.<br/><br/>This is a movie for people who want to watch real life unfold on the screen. What makes this movie great is not the subject, reclaiming lost love/connection (I haven't seen Before Sunrise, I have to admit), but the honest and real way that the dialogue unfolds. Once you have seen the movie you want to go back and watch it again because it is like talking to an old girlfriend you have known more then half your life. You can tell when she is hiding something, tell when she is trying to block herself off emotionally, know that there are more feelings underneath her quiet charm then she will ever reveal. I haven't even seen the first movie but I feel as though I truly know these characters.<br/><br/>This is a highly intellectually, emotionally involved plot made for (and seemingly by) persons who know what its like to have lingering thoughts, doubts and fears about a person that could have been ""the one"". A must see for anyone who isn't the grinch and has read a book in the last year."

But then, on the boat, he asks the question again; 'where were you, that night, in Vienna, 9 years ago.' Then the movie just takes off. From then on, the movie has you at the edge of your seat, hanging on every word, listening to them describe that night, nine years ago, and wondering what are they going to do about it.<br/><br/>I think it ended just right. You go through the whole movie wondering whether he was going to go back home to his wife or stay with the love of his life. As the tag line says, ""What if you had a second chance with the one that got away?"" This way you are left wondering; does he stay or does he go. Letting you fill in the ending with what you would do if you had a second chance with the one that got away.<br/><br/>No I do not think there will be a sequel. I think leaving the ending up to your imagination is just perfect.<br/><br/>The two movies are an up-to-date, version of ""An Affair to Remember."" In ""An Affair to Remember's"" time, adults took cruises. In ""Before Sunrise's"" time, college students backpacked through Europe. The two movies are also similar as in both movies; two people meet, on a trip, they have romantic time, they promise to meet again, and the girl cannot make it. Thus altering the course of fate."

","A very sensitive but forward approach to take a lead on the prequel... but more than extending the story , its an extremely realistic treatment to the conflict of feelings and emotions which we may or might not deny to confront everyday.<br/><br/>If somebody touches you truly and deeply , time and space would never change the effect that person has on you. This is more pronounced by the evidence that the external changes(the shape of your life ,your deeds and the people added/deleted ) wouldn't deviate the line of sight somebody has for your true self!!! High five to the makers again for bringing this out so subtly! <br/><br/>Again , its commendable that the dialogues , making noise through the streets of Paris would so beautifully keep you digging to the screen. The curiosity element of the movie is alive all through and even after it.

","I saw BEFORE SUNSET as soon as it was released but never had even heard of BEFORE SUNRISE. But SUNSET stands alone and works alone. Having now seen SUNRISE - SUNSET is sublime in its even greater simplicity and its profundity. Linklater's even greater restraint in part 2 shows his total confidence in his creation and his astonishing actors. The frisson of engagement where all is in the subtext is just thrilling in both films, and, no, not everyone will get it, but for those that do, these movies affirm life and the power and subtlety of human love.<br/><br/>Someone in the postings said that the movie is unrealistic! Yep! It's a movie! Yep, the ""real"" characters (whoever they might be!) wouldn't say fascinating things every second together but this is a movie capturing the essence of the invisible electricity between two ordinary people. Listen to how we actually speak in ""real"" life.... We bumble and rarely stick to the point. To allow Linklater to edit their story (in the writing and in the cutting room) to the essence is called film-making and it does not represent a lack of truth but a heightening and intensifying of the experience of the two characters - akin to their own memory of what happened to them.<br/><br/>Thank God films like this get made, and for those that don't like them - go see the latest blockbuster of which there is an endless stream. The choice is between a bistro and McDonalds; a family run pensione or the Marriott. The vast majority choose the latter out of laziness, a lack of imagination and avoidance of risk. (Just the predictable story elements that Hollywood sticks to, to get the right demographics to get mass bums on seats.) Good luck to them."
"Danusha_Goska","9","2","3","21 October 2005"," Unabashed Romance; Real; I Loved This Movie
","""Before Sunset"" is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Even in our age of full disclosure and no privacy there remain moments that this viewer, anyway, has never seen captured on film before.<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" captures some of those moments.<br/><br/>Two adult characters converse. Watching them, you wonder -- and you know that these two characters are wondering the same thing -- where will this conversation go? Is it just an exchange of banal, prepackaged rants and scripts? But, the two characters keep talking, keep talking past rough moments, and awkward discomfort, and strange anecdotes.<br/><br/>After a while of this, they come to say shockingly open and intimate things to each other.<br/><br/>Before you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.<br/><br/>These two characters are using mere words to reveal hopes, and pains, and vulnerabilities, that we usually sweep from our consciousness, because the world has no room for them ... except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.<br/><br/>There was one aspect of ""Before Sunset"" that didn't work for me. Ethan Hawke, especially, gives a poignantly visual performance. He says things with his eyes and face that he does not convey in words.<br/><br/>Otherwise, though, this film is not visual enough to be fully satisfying as a film. Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script. That being the case, ""Before Sunset"" would perhaps have been better as a radio play.<br/><br/>The director cheats his audience; he doesn't care about using his camera to allow his audience to view Hawke, Delpy, their powerful and magic interaction, or Paris in a new and high impact way.<br/><br/>But that's a minor complaint. ""Before Sunset"" swept this viewer off her feet. Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell. It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language. What language does here is truly magic."

","This may be the most romantic movie I've ever seen. It's not a romantic comedy; Meg Ryan would have no place in this film. It's about how taking a chance on someone, setting yourself up for embarrassment, and throwing caution to the wind can lead to a fulfilling interaction, regardless of how brief that interaction may be. Jessie and Celine are riding a train through Europe, but they are sitting in different parts of the train and have never met. An argument between a middle-aged couple causes Celine to leave her seat and take the one across the aisle from Jessie. They share an uncomfortable smile when the fighting couple rushes past the two of them. This leads to a few words, which leads to a trip to the dining car and one of those good conversations that can appear from nowhere when two people are open and ready to have such a conversation with a stranger, even if both of these strangers are twenty something and attractive."

","Before Sunset is an excellent movie on the very basics of that feeling we have been searching for. It is a beautiful mixture of optimism and pessimism at the same time presented you in 80 unforgettable minutes. The dialogs will take you back on time and force you to question the past relationships. It is about hope, it is about despair. It is about not giving up when you most feel like to. This is a type of a movie that could encourage you to make a change in your life first time you get up in the morning. Or gives you the feeling to call that certain someone that you have been seeing in your dreams for a long time time now.

","I can't express how brave it is to make a movie with no action, no sex scene, not even a kiss, and trust that it can still be appealing and even a masterpiece. This entire movie is a one hour and twenty minute long conversation -- that's IT. And yet it's entrancing; I was never bored or impatient, I felt like I knew the characters myself by the end of the film. It's not perfect; nine years is a long, long time to maintain an attraction, however deep, that only had one night to develop. But, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of watching these two characters reveal themselves with such subtlety and grace. The ending was absolutely perfect for the tone of the film -- if it had ended in the expected way, I would have liked the film far less. As it is, I can only once again emphasize how daring it was for the people involved in this film to make it exactly as it is in a time when movies increasingly rely on car chases, guns, bombs, and ever more explicit sex to attract their audiences."

","Michael Apted has made a series of movies every 7 years, showing us how children from different British classes have grown up from age 7. This year, 2005, he presumably will give us ""49 Up."" In an analogous sense, in 1995 we saw Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and talk all night in ""Before Sunrise"", and now in 2004 we see them meet and talk all afternoon in Paris in ""Before Sunset."" Maybe in 2013 we will see them in ""All Day and Night."" A good movie, but I did not enjoy it as much as the 1995 movie.<br/><br/>Jessie is on a brisk world tour to publicize his new book, and Celine shows up unannounced. He is taken aback when he sees her, but finishes up his press gig and book signing, to tell her hello. He only has an hour or two before he has to leave to catch a flight back home, so they agree to make the best of it, go get coffee and talk. The screenplay was written by Hawke, Delpy, and director Linklater. Much of the filming was done with a steady cam following them through the streets of Paris.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow. The book Jessie had written was the story of his and Celine's meeting in 1995. She recognized that, and realized it was him, so looked him up. After the usual small talk, they begin to exchange superficial information, but eventually get personal. Jessie had gone back to Vienna 6 months later as they had agreed, Celine planned to but a relative died. They both wondered what would have happened if they had re-connected. Jessie is married with two children, but does not seem in love with his wife. Celine has a boyfriend, but that too doesn't appear to have the right passion. They find out they both lived in New York at the same time in the late 1990s. They begin to realize they are soul mates. At the end, he is having tea in her apartment, she has sung him a song she wrote about them, he asks for another, she says ""You'll miss your flight"", he smiles and responds, ""I know"", and the credits roll.<br/><br/>Perhaps it ended that way to set the stage for the next installment. It is implied that he stayed with her for at least an extra day, and who knows what might follow. Since this movie deals with disappointment and failed loves, it is not as pleasant a movie as the earlier, more ideal one. And, there is something about Ethan Hawk that I don't like, not sure what. And his character here seemed a bit juvenile for a successful author. The first time he made an absurd comment, quickly followed by ""I'm just kidding"", it was OK. After about the 5th time, it had become annoying."

","Well once u have seen Before Sunrise there is an innate curiosity to find out what happened in Dec in Vienna and Before Sunset not only answers the curiosity but creates one of its own through carefully well written dialogs and great screenplay. The movie is about coming together of two people who met each other a long time ago and fell in love but circumstances did not allow them to, they talk about politics, environment, love, sex, relationships but the feelings that evolve after meeting one another is what I feel is the USP of Before Sunset. If u see Before Sunrise and u come to know that there is a sequel to it u will go for Before Sunrise before too long. Before Sunset goes well beyond weaving the emotional drama then its predecessor, and the question it asks of viewers towards the end is quite sentimental. Through an answer from Ethan at the start of Before Sunset the director seems to make his point of view of why keep the viewers in dilemma. The chemistry between the lead pair is superb and no wonder Julie and Ethan were actively involved in dialog writing for the movie. The ten yr gap between the two movies seem to be well thought out in the script as well as well as the makeup of the artists. The movie is not for those who cannot stand the marathon dialogs between same two characters for a continuous period of one and a half hours. After seeing the movie you seem to be looking for the next sequel and whether we will get another romantic fiesta from Ethan, Julie and company is a question that remains in mind for the viewers"

Can you imagine that none of them is not even nominated for an Oscar? Speaks volumes about the Academy once more.<br/><br/>This is a very difficult movie to make.

","The best way to describe this movie is by the following comments of a film critic<br/><br/>quote: -------- ""Sunset"" plays out in real time -- in 81 minutes of unfolding getting-to-know-you-(again) conversation -- and its tug of suspense comes not only from that waiting plane but from the need to grab at chance and from the larger looming deadline of age.<br/><br/>It's a movie about how people woo each other with words, looks and glances. And though some will complain that ""Before Sunset"" is all talk, it struck me as real, highly diverting talk--beautifully staged, acted and visualized.<br/><br/>Delpy and Hawke co-wrote the script with Linklater, and they keep Jesse and Celine iridescent and fresh, one of the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples. A lot of that charm comes from the speed of their patter, the way they keep the words spinning between them like two great tennis players on an endless, brilliant rally. And since they both show so well how the characters have grown, they can believably break into anger or anguish at their current frustrations and the memory of desire.<br/><br/>All three of the film's primary collaborators take advantage of their own opportunities with this one, layering Jesse and Celine's 80-minute conversation with a freshness, a surprising urgency, and two characters full of desire, faults, and - still - hope.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>The movie has a brilliant script and dialogues.<br/><br/>I just love the conversations between the two lead actors (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) in the movie. The chemistry between them is electric.<br/><br/>The best moment of the movie is undoubtedly the climax of the movie where Julie Delpy sings a song. She sings an improvised little nonsense song about lost love that keeps skidding into pain.<br/><br/>quote: -------- Celine: (Celine's song) Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts / Let me sing you a waltz / About this one night stand / You were, for me, that night / Everything I always dreamt of in life / But now you're gone / You are far gone / All the way to your island of rain / It was for you just a one night thing / But you were much more to me, just so you know / I don't care what they say / I know what you meant for me that day / I just want another try, I just want another night / Even if it doesn't seem quite right / You meant for me much more than anyone I've met before / One single night with you, little Jesse, is worth a thousand with anybody / I have no bitterness, my sweet / I'll never forget this one night thing / Even tomorrow in other arms, my heart will stay yours until I die / Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my blues / Let me sing you a waltz / About this lovely one night stand <br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>I thought 'Lost in Translation' was the best Romantic movie I had seen in the recent past. <br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is a few notches better.... :)<br/><br/>So, What's your favorite movie of 2004? :)<br/><br/>~Nirjhar"

","This riveting film ""works"". Who could not fail to relate to, or aspire to, connecting with someone at a spiritual level that transcends mere physical reality. Herein lies the strength of this film, for in abandoning the screen writing convention of ""show don't tell"" for exquisitely crafted dialogue in which the characters actually share ""real"" experience and emotion the film conveys what pictures alone cannot, the interior of the characters, and humanity in its ""natural"" state. The documentary style and intimacy generated by the dialogue leave the viewer feeling like they are right alongside the characters and actually sharing a real time experience. Who could not fail to be moved by the notion of deeply connecting with someone years previously, tearfully parting, suffering the pain of separated souls yearning to be re-united, and the self torture of wondering what might have been. Imagine years of being unable to remove the indelible imprint of a twin soul from the psyche, and the shock and exhilaration of meeting again years later. This 70 minute microcosm, packed with intervening life experience, personal development, emotions, blame, recriminations, and love that goes beyond the physical, undimmed by the passing years, induces alternating laughter and tears in the viewer. This is achieved by what is said, and also by what is not said but untuitively known by the viewer because they are drawn so integrally into the film, and by skillfully ""underplayed"" performances that generate empathy. The spellbinding performances subtly depict nervous and uncertain actions reminiscent of innocent and naive teenagers not knowing what to do for the best. For anyone interested in the human condition this film is quite simply unmissable, and worthy of multiple viewing."

You don't have much of the action and fun we are used to from romantic comedies. It's a realistic and touching mirror of two excited and unsure people meeting after 9 years of no-contact. There's no background music (like in the Dogma movies) and the scenes are simple. For example there's this scene in a cafe (a great, old french cafe with fantastic athmosphere). They sit there and talk .. for about 20 minutes of the movie. and it's not even boring for the viewer. I mean, it's so ""real"", and so exciting to watch them getting in touch again.

I liked the feeling of being right there with them as they spoke. Although the camera angles were simple, it was still portrayed in a way that really got me involved as not only a viewer, but more of as a participant.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: I never really felt much of a connection between the characters. Although the director did well in getting me involved in the movie, I never felt that characters had much of a connection. Some of the dialogue was trying to show how a conversation between two people who haven't seen each other for a long time would really go, but it came across to me as a bit cheesy. <br/><br/>Overall: If your looking for a romantic film I would say skip this one. To me it was simply an hour long conversation between two old friends that never quite got anywhere."
"diane-34","Null","2","3","15 August 2004"," Dialogue delivery beyond excellent!
","I watched this wonderful movie yesterday afternoon and both my wife and I are still more than a little stunned by the beautiful manner in which Paris was laid before our eyes and the realism of the dialogue and delivery  by Hawke and Delpy.<br/><br/>I was completely taken by the naturalness of Delpy's delivery-I would have bet that it wasn't a film if I had just heard her speaking and not known that it had been scripted.  Dare I say that it could have been Reality TV in that the dialogue was written so accurately and delivered so well; I have never watched a fictional movie that was so realistic before-it was so natural.<br/><br/>Having given these fulsome praises to Before Sunset I must also say that the director, Linklater, made an extraordinarily courageous film-a film that I would have bet would never be made because Hollywood does not make movies with only dialogue and no action.  Nothing outwardly happens in this film-why would you ever believe that two people walking through quiet Parisian streets and setting in old cafe's could make a movie that would hold it's audience.  Maybe the new generation creating movies in Hollywood has decided that people don't always want to watch talking robots and moving plasma-maybe the French have known all along what makes a movie. <br/><br/>
In any event-I thought this film was a film maker's film and it is a pearl among coal lumps."
"wcdleung","10","2","3","6 August 2004"," Astounding
","I saw the ad for Before Sunset on a trip, and had to wait for 12 days before being able to see the movie. That 12 days seemed like ages. I felt that I was waiting to see an important friend after losing contact for 9 years, with all the curiosity what happened to him/her (here, for both Celine and Jesse). I felt fortunate to have seen Before Sunrise exactly 9 years ago without seeing it again so that I have exactly the faint 9-year-old impressions while watching Before Sunset.<br/><br/>I was astound after seeing Before Sunset.<br/><br/>What I did not expect was how much more serious Before Sunset is, compared to Before Sunrise. That 80 min conversation echoed so many things in life, e.g. why/how one stays in dissatisfied relations, our responsibilities and compromises, our occasional fall-back into feeling sad about life, while keeping our eyes on things still worth our effort and hope. The indirect allusions are so effective.<br/><br/>While some has complained about a relative slow pace, I found the pace very powerful. I was practically grilled by those moments of suspense or uneasiness or hesitation. I was also surprised and shocked when the pace was fast at certain points. I don't know whether they are intended or or, but such emotions engaged me like no other movie.<br/><br/>It is a very good movie even without hitting anyone's ""soft pots"" though a lot of the reviewers reported being ""badly hit."" The movie itself, the acting, and the story itself are all extremely charming. It definitely surpasses Before Sunrise, which has lent from scenery and is a little too sentimental at the very end. The atmosphere in Before Sunset is created entirely internal, which is amazing. It is also fortunate to have all the natural 9-year change in appearance and maturity in the cast. I cannot help suspecting that the makeup was made intentionally to feature a kind of aging into 32-33. I believe most actors and actresses at 32-33 look much younger on the screen.<br/><br/>The technique to have a continuous flow was also used in ""Rope,"" which also delivers to the audience a good deal of emotional engagement for reasons described above.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is really for an extreme minority, but it is nice to hear from others from within that minority group!"
"legend-13","10","2","3","23 July 2004"," Awesome and not letting it slip away
","Nine years ago, I watched the first movie ""Before Sunrise"" in Singapore and it became my all time favourite movie. I always wonder what have happened to Celine (Delpy) and Jesse (Hawke), and all the questions about whether they had met up six months later and one night stand still lingered. I could not forget the dynamic relationship between these characters and their thoughts about life, death, their friends and their relationships, although mundane but brings out the extraordinary side in everyone of us. <br/><br/>Nine years later, I am now living in UK. Whenever I screened the DVD for this movie, the college room was always full. I found a lot of friends who loved this movie. By the time when I was told that the sequel is out and it's entitled ""Before Sunset"". I could not believe it, and it's like the Tolkien fans waiting to watch the trilogy. <br/><br/>I have just watched the movie today, and realized that the characters have evolved. The way which they viewed their relationships. There is still the magic between them. As most of the issues that came to my mind from the movie are resolved elegantly in ""Before Sunset"", I cannot help but feel the same way on how this movie gave me the idealism to believe in romance. I felt that Celine and Jesse have shown us that how important beautiful moments are to our lives. The conversation they had about the environment, the politics of the world and things in the movie, is so much like what I would experience being in their age.<br/><br/>Although the ending is not what I expected, I still think that the maturity and chemistry between these characters will live with me as I grow. I hope to hear from them when we all reached 40s. This is a movie which grows up with the audience, and every time you revisit it with a different notion of what life is all about.<br/><br/>Definitely without doubt 10/10."
"sundeeiris","10","2","3","23 July 2004"," Romance for the realists...
","I must admit that I went to see this movie without any expectation of how good or how awful it may be. All I knew was the Times (NYT) recommended it and the plot appealed to me so I went to a matineé show and was extremely pleased with the result. The picture began with Jesse wrapping up his book tour in Paris, and was blushing red while answering questions about his work which I found out as the movie goes along, was the romanticized version of his and Celine's love affair that did not happen. She came and saw him at the bookstore that he was in and went on from there. They reacquaint themselves with each other, spawning endless conversations from every conceivable topic. They also can't help but look back from that day in Vienna and wondered what if. I just recently saw Before Sunrise, the prequel to this film, and must say that I enjoy this one more, only because the topics of conversations were more mature, and the romantic notions were more realistic. Their connection is so palpable, it made me wish I knew someone with whom I can speak candidly without fear of being judged. The film is shot in location in Paris, and it certainly contributes to the aura of the film."
"bjones749","9","2","3","19 July 2004"," I was involved with them immediately. Again.
","This movie is about two people talking. When I saw the same premise with a Broadway director and a semi-employed actor, I was bored to tears. With these two, I was right there with them, fascinated and caught up with them and their lives. I'm not like them, and I wouldn't want to be their age again, but I enjoyed every second of watching and listening. I really remember very little about the first movie except that I also enjoyed it. I don't remember details about the characters or even their promise to meet again. That didn't matter. My companion didn't see the first movie at all, but that didn't lessen her enjoyment. Hawke and Delpy proved themselves to be good writers before this movie. They have created full, complex, interesting characters. My only complaint is this visit could have been about 15-20 minutes longer."
"sjmcollins-1","10","2","3","19 July 2004"," A small masterpiece--OK, just a flat out masterpiece
","(Spoilers) Beautiful European scenery, captivating dialogue, and two great characters help to make Before Sunset an all-time classic in my book.  Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linklater have created two extraordinary people with ordinary lives, but their ability to articulate their thoughts and emotions to each other puts them way above any movie couple I have ever seen.  10 years after they parted ways, Jesse (Hawke)and Celine (Delpy) feel each other out and then lay it all on the line after hearing one another's story.  This sequel surpasses the original, as Jesse and Celine have grown up, and now they have grown-up problems to boot, but their connection hasn't gone anywhere.  The open ending was perfect as well.  I hate to think we'll have to wait another 9 years for another sequel, but this story is worth the wait---10/10."
"edelwais","9","2","3","13 July 2004"," why it doesn't matter how it ends
","It is interesting that most of the critics like this one better than Before Sunrise because the characters are ""more mature"". My take on this is: most of the critics are closer and above this age range (early 30s) and it is simply more difficult for them to relate to the first movie. However, these two movies are even more worthwhile considered together especially from the point of view of the audience that were 20 when the first one came out and are almost 30 now. Back in 95 Before Sunrise resonated with me because it was very relevant to the way I and my friends looked at the world, we had similar dreams, concerns, it was the way we talked. And of course we imagined meeting this one soul-mate with whom you understand each other without having to finish sentences, and you have exactly the same doubts and look forward your life ahead and are reluctant to commit right then because who know what else may come your way. Today Before sunset has exactly the same effect, I am almost 30 and I have changed just like the characters and I have similar problems and again this the way I would talk and the themes I would discuss in a conversation. I am sure this is roughly true for this whole generation. I don't think the open ending is intended for us to guess what happened in either of the two movies, although Jesse says in the beginning of Sunset: well it depends, if you are an optimist they meet in 6 months and if not.... I think the open ending in both movies emphasizes the fact that it does not matter whether they end up together or not. The point is that they are both enriched by meeting and spending a few hours together and by having a good conversation. Sometimes we choose not to be with someone that we feel is our soul-mate, simply because it would cost too much (kids, other people getting hurt) and that is fine, we still have experienced this connection and we will treasure it for the rest of our lives. It is not about letting your true love slip away, we don't know for sure if this is true love, what we know is that we made a connection. I find the brief episode when Jesse tells the journalists the topic of his next book very descriptive of what the movie(s) is all about. This connection that makes our lives richer and better may happen in a night, or in a few hours or in a few moments."
"movieguy1021","10","2","3","18 July 2004"," Before Sunset: 10/10
","Most of the time, sequels are for big budget summer blockbusters when studios realize they can double their profits by releasing a movie that's basically the same. So I assume most people were surprised that Before Sunrise, a small romance that only made about $5.5 million would warrant a sequel. But it did. I haven't seen the first one, which was released in 1995, but that didn't stop me from seeing its sequel, Before Sunset. I have learned that you usually don't need to see the first movie in series to understand it. Some enjoyment may fall out of it, but it's still coherent nonetheless. Before Sunset is a sequel where you don't need to see the first. In fact, I think I probably benifited from not seeing the first.<br/><br/>Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is promoting his book, which is largely based on the events of the evening in Before Sunrise, where he had met Celeste (Julie Delpy) in Vienna and spent an unforgettable night. They had agreed to meet up again in six months in Vienna. Celeste finds Jesse after the book signing and they talk. They walk around Paris and talk. And talk. And talk.<br/><br/>It's movie like this that you recognize as being great, yet you can't really explain it. It could be how much I seemed to get to know and like these characters just by hearing them talk. The camera never leaves them, which makes us seem like intruders and eavesdroppers to their life. It could be the simplicity of their lives that we find fascinating, and how we can relate to both of them in more ways than one. It could be the sophistication of the dialogue (which was written by director Richard Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy). The spontaneity of the dialogue makes the movie feel more real. And it's all in real time, which adds a sense of urgency to the movie.<br/><br/>Both Hawke and Delpy, who are basically the only characters in the film, put in good acting jobs here. They exhibit the normal characteristics of life-they aren't over the top or caricatures. They seem just like average people, and that adds to the charm and the overall real feel to the movie. They have forgotten some of the events of the evening nine years ago (as would the viewer). The constant barrage of dialogue doesn't hurt it; actually, it's very entertaining and interesting. They talk about various subjects, and you never feel time dragging or anything of the like. Before Sunset is simply a beautiful film. It's simplistic and down to earth. You may not like my lack of words to describe it, but once you see it, you'll be at a loss for words, also.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language and sexual references."

","It isn't just the incredible dialogue, it isn't just the wonderful acting from both Ethan and Julie, it isn't just the amazing scenery and cinematography and it isn't just the astonishing direction from Linklater.. it's all of those combined that produced perhaps my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>The two scenes which sealed the deal for me are right at the end of the movie.. SPOILER COMING...<br/><br/>Firstly the scene with Celine walking Jesse up the stairs to her apartment, nothing is said and the scene lasts a while.. what's so wonderful about just that is that it allows the viewer to fill in the blanks. In my mind I could tell that Celine had imagined this moment over and over since leaving Jesse in Prague and the fact that it is finally happening must be surreal.<br/><br/>Secondly the scene where Celine is making tea and she watches Jesse walk around her apartment, looking at her possessions looking at her life, finally they aren't just two strangers. He is right there in her world and just watching him react to her pictures, music again must have been something she had imagined over the years.<br/><br/>I can't fault this film, I really can't.

It just feels right and not contrived at all to have the two meeting again. It feels like this is just how it must have happened. Both films definitely stand on their own. Jessie and Celine are adults now, wise, mature but still, you can´t help feeling like a teenager while watching them because you root for them as much as for anyone who you have been friends with your entire life.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy is one of the most amazing living creatures on earth, she may actually be an elf. the material is not what you may call typical cinema stuff as there is indeed much talking going on, however, the ending is pure movie magic."

","A sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and a true testament to the virtue of patience. Filmed nine years after the first film, with the trilogy's third installment Before Midnight again jumping nine years into the future. And like in real life, nine years have also passed since the events of Sunrise.<br/><br/>Jesse and Céline, played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have not seen each other since the events of the first film, but now Jesse is finishing his book tour in Paris and runs into Céline in a bookstore. The whole film is simply their conversation from beginning to end as they walk the streets and parks of Paris. And it is fascinating.<br/><br/>Before Sunrise was already a good film. Especially in how it portrayed the age of its main characters. They were adults, if only barely, but not yet old enough to be comfortable in their skins, in their world views. I also truly appreciated how they were mostly attracted to each other's personalities and not just their respective looks.<br/><br/>That is present here, as well, but once again their age is reflected really well. These two have lived, have learned, have grown, but they still connect very easily with one another. There is earning to be with one another, because they get each other so well, but there's also caution brought on by live experience and past mistakes.<br/><br/>And perhaps it's because I'm closer in age to the characters of this film, but I felt much more in tune with these two than I did when they were still in their very late teens. It's also fascinating that my favourite character has changed from Céline to Jesse. This time it's Céline that has views and attitudes that slightly annoy me, whereas before it was Jesse that was a bit too full of himself for my liking. Not that they're at all unlikable in either of the films, but they have clearly changed. And that feels real.<br/><br/>Whereas Sunrise gave us a vision of perfection, of day dreams and hopes for the future, Sunset shows what might really be possible. Sure its plot and events are a bit movie-like in their sheer serendipity, but they still end up feeling more grounded. Very good romance film, no matter how you measure it."

She reveals that she didn't make their planned meeting due to her grandmother's funeral. He reveals that he did return for the meeting. He's married with a son. She has a photojournalist boyfriend who is away. The conversation fluctuates between breezy and deeper material until personal truths start to be spilled.<br/><br/>Richard Linklater has hit on something compelling by returning to the same characters years later. It's casual and improvisational-like. Hawke and Delpy still have the same chemistry but more adult. It's deeper. There is an addition to the material by being a sequel. It's more than repetition. It's a sweet return of old friends."

By replacing cranks with philosophizing adults, he was able to create ""Before Sunrise"". A brilliant film that relies almost entirely on a single conversation.

","Great movie, and more substantial than Before Sunrise. <br/><br/>I thought Before Sunrise was okay, but overrated. It was pretty much another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, it was very dialogue-intensive and some of the dialogue is just incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing stuff. <br/><br/>Before Sunset is still very dialogue-intensive. This is still an irritation in that you want some respite from this, some period of reflection and calm. However, in this case it does propel the story forward, unlike Before Sunrise where the dialogue seemed to go in circles and not really go anywhere.<br/><br/>That is where Before Sunset is so much better. By setting it nine years after the first movie, you get a a more complete story, more character development, more a sense of what they mean to each other, more genuine emotion.<br/><br/>For these reasons, making this sequel is a stroke of genius on Richard Linklater's part. Instead of a snapshot of these two people's lives, we have a timeline, a sense of lives progressing and changing, of memories and regrets. Not ships passing in the night (as the first movie made them out to be), but soulmates."

All this film is two people walking the streets of Paris and talking to each other, but we feel connected to these characters for the eighty minutes this film is on screen. The screenplay is very sharp and not once can we tell if the dialog is forced. This film is an example of how an excellent conversation should be, especially between people who haven't seen each other in ages.<br/><br/>Richard Linklater's sequel reintroduces us to the characters of Jesse and Celine. Jesse is now a bestseller author who has written a book based on the one night the two of them had nine years earlier. While promoting his book in a bookshop, Jesse runs into Celine. With Jesse returning to the states that evening, the two spend the afternoon together catching up and reminiscing on what could have been.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy continue to show such natural chemistry between each other. If I didn't know any better, they could have been two ordinary people having such an engrossing conversation on love, politics, and more ideology of that nature. This film doesn't need a large cast and I feel that both Hawke and Delpy were perfect in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, Before Sunset is an excellent sequel to one of the best original romantic films I have ever seen. Both of these films succeed without being sappy or forced. I liked the natural feel of this film and it's a shame Hollywood doesn't produce more films like these. They are the perfect compliment to the special-effects era of movies. This is a sweet, romantic modern-era romance film and a fitting sequel to Before Sunrise. I rate this film 9/10."
"GirishGowda","7","1","1","4 November 2013"," Subtle and Heartbreaking
","Nine years have passed since the events of Before Sunrise, when Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delphy) had met in Vienna. Since then, Jesse has written a novel, This Time, inspired by his time with Céline, and the book has become an American bestseller. To help sales in Europe, Jesse does a book tour. The last stop of the tour is Paris, and Jesse is doing a reading at the bookstore Shakespeare and Company. As Jesse talks with his audience, flashbacks are shown of him and Céline in Vienna; the memories of their night together have clearly remained with him despite nine years having elapsed. Three journalists are present at the bookstore, interviewing Jesse: a romantic who is convinced the book's main characters meet again, a cynic who is convinced that they do not, and a third one who, despite wanting them to meet again, remains doubtful they actually do. As he speaks with his audience his eyes wander to the side, and he can hardly believe it: Céline is smiling at him.<br/><br/>The film is short, precise and has several impossibly long takes that are just marvelous to behold. The innocence and naivety present in the first movie is gone and they're both mature and beautiful thirty-something adults living their own lives. Yet, that one night nine years ago has been an integral part of their lives. The movie is great just to see these two people interacting again. The dialogues are more precise, the sexual tension is less, and their instinct to trust each other implicitly, like in Sunrise, is a bit held back this time around. As charming as it is, I just couldn't connect to this as much as I hoped for. Its all very subtle and heartbreaking as the movie moves forward, especially when they finally pour out their hearts and minds in the car, but - people may snigger at this - but, I needed more melodrama. I needed them to burst out crying in at least one vital scene. Its quite good, but maybe in a decade, when I'm closer to their age, then this movie might have a higher position in my eyes.<br/><br/>7/10"

","This is quite an extraordinary movie. A single, long shot, running in real time, about life, love, regrets and hopes. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy take their characters and play with them in bittersweet ways - it's the only ""romantic"" movie where there's not a single kiss on screen, not a single touch, if I recall correctly; and still, it's so poignant, so melancholic, so sad, so brutal, so real... I can't think of any movie that can come close to the way this one portrays relationships.<br/><br/>Jessie and Celine are absolutely real - they are not characters, not actors, they are simply breathing, living persons. They have matured so much since the last time we saw together, and practically every question we as an audience had for them is answered. The way they both gently lead us towards an ending we are somewhat expecting, and then raising even more questions at the end than the first movie is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope Before Midnight is as good as this movie. I'm sure Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will make it happen. <br/><br/>This is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched."
"dylan-grieve","10","1","1","1 May 2012"," More than just a romance
","This movie was absolutely amazing. I think it might strike a chord with many of us who feel for 'one special experience', or who feel 'lost' or 'stuck' in life or relationships. This isn't a flaky/surface romance; it runs extremely deep, and it is every bit as good or better than the original, only with a different flavor. It's the same type of blunt honesty between the characters as in the first film, and the chemistry is tangible. <br/><br/>This film puts Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy back together about 10 years later, and the results are intriguing and incredible. The way these two interact is so genuine and pure; it sets the tone of realism laced with magic. The whole movie explores a build-up of feelings between them, with a sort of phony 'everything is fine' wall which slowly crumbles as the movie goes on, and with this journey, you see the cynicism and the experiences that have shaped them over time. There are some definite twists to the story, but they are realistic twists, and seem to be for realism's sake only, rather than for viewer appeasement. Whoever wrote this screenplay should receive an academy award, if they haven't. <br/><br/>This movie runs so deep, it helps me rekindle beliefs of love, and challenges me to trust so much more in what I know is true in my heart. It really addresses the issue of how so many people get stuck and caught up in what they think society expects of them. They forget that the heart knows; the heart is what you start with as a child- it's what makes you yearn, desire, hope, and burn for someone; it is the essence of a human being. <br/><br/>The characters demonstrate the cold logic that takes over with age, combined with a loss of the youthful hope from so many disappointments. You can really see these things in the characters, but there is a glimmer that really returns throughout their experience together. Julie Delpy truly threw herself into her role, and I can't help but think there is something more going on between her and Ethan Hawke; it almost seems too good to be true. Anyway, I gave this movie a 10. It deserves it."

The best moment of this film, actually while the lead characters, Jesse and Celine, meet again, their having conversation to each other so on. We know as viewer, they are attract each other, but something in their way. They are 'perfect match' but not in 'perfect time'. The director/writer do a great job for the shot and scripts.

Again the dialogue and acting are so naturalistic that one feels that one is listening in on a real exchange.<br/><br/>What's different? It's day not night. The city is Paris not Vienna. Most importantly, it's nine years later and Jesse and Celine have lived and loved in their own fashion and had time to think about what might have been. But can it still be? Most sequels fall short of the original; this one complements it beautifully."

","This is a composite review of both ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"". I suppose there will be some ""spoilers"". <br/><br/>The first movie introduces 2 characters Jesse and Celine who meet up in a train en-route to Vienna. They feel a connection and decide to take a tour of the city together. The movie chronicles their tour and ends with them going their separate ways. Throughout the movie, both Jesse and Celine talk & exchange viewpoints. As they see the world in very different ways, there are a lot of enlightening conversations about life, death, the state of the world at the time etc. <br/><br/>The second movie picks up nine years after Jesse and Celine's original trip to Vienna. Jesse is now married with a son and has authored a book based on his experiences with Celine. During a book tour ending in Paris, he meets Celine once again and once again they roam around the city sparking up a variety of conversations. The director leaves the ending deliberately ambiguous as to whether or not Jesse gets back together with her.<br/><br/>Overall, while they do tend to drag sometimes, these 2 movies are very original and worth watching at least once, especially if you're sick of the hundred odd rom coms beating around the bush but admittedly the second one is not as good as the first.<br/><br/>I would rate the movies individually Before Sunrise-8/10 Before Sunse-7.5/10"

","""Before Sunset"" is definitely one of those few select films which are great sequels to their predecessors. The funny thing is you don't ever feel inclined to critique such films, you just want to bask in its sunlit perfection, walk with the characters in the eternal city of Paris and get lost in a reverie. It's like a capsule of time taken out of the entangled lives of these two dislodged yet strangely connected souls, a page in their journal. You seem to project those unexplained emotions in your heart in the brilliantly portrayed characters, lose yourself in the meandering by- lanes of Paris and the words and repartee of the protagonists and you realize slowly with the characters the cost of missed opportunities and those painful could-have-beens. Despite the expected pragmatic, mature tones of the characters neither Jesse nor Celine could fully escape the effects of that intoxicating night at Vienna all those years back as we are left to imagine how it must have been in that original moment for it reverberate through the rest of their life leading up to Paris. And just like before, they set out to create another litany of vignettes that will surely go on to have repercussions in their lives. At the end you feel like it's the perfect sequel to ""Before Sunrise"", like you have always imagined Jesse and Celine to steal a few lost hours from the eternal flow of time and continue the conversation they had 10 years back in Vienna. The script, the walk and talk shoot, Nina Simone and that waltz song goes on to show the burgeoning brilliance of Linklater, ably assisted by Ethan and Julie. Echoing Jesse at the beginning of the movie here's the perfect test to examine if you are a romantic or a cynic - if you love Before Sunset you are bound to be a true romantic."
"kastellos","8","1","1","5 May 2010"," Great romance - much better than Before Sunrise
","When a move is a sequel it is hard for me to review the film without referring to the original, so here goes............<br/><br/>This is a very, very good film; although sequels rarely are better than the originals, this is clearly an exception. It is better than Before Sunrise. Whereas Sunrise bordered on pretentious, Sunset is very real and on the mark. The main characters in Sunset were somewhat annoying and we had a hard time liking them (which is not necessary in most films, but I prefer sympathetic characters in a romance), while in this sequel they are much more real and the audience can feel their unhappiness with what is, and understand that they may yet have a chance at greater happiness. In the first film most of us can't wait till they separate, while in the second we hope they remain together.<br/><br/>I think that this film is better directed, better paced and better acted. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys romantic films, especially when you are in the mood of remembering your first love and wondering what might have been."
"D_Burke","9","1","1","9 February 2010"," A Sequel That Compliments The Original
","I liked this film's predecessor, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), a lot because of its intriguing characters, the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy that never let up, and the dialogue that never felt written even though it was. The original movie could have easily done without the sequel, just as many films not based on comic book characters could. With that idea in mind, this film could have also brought the story of Jesse and Celine to a happy ending that felt like a cop out, which I expected it to do. However, director and writer Richard Linklater manages to bring these characters into full circle in ""Before Sunset"" without giving the romantic comedy fans what they want, which is why ""Before Sunset"" is just as good as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Taking place nine years from where the original film left off, Jesse (Hawk) is no longer a slacker, but an established author who wrote a bestselling account of his one night with a French woman he barely knew. Since he did not exchange contact information with Celine (Delpy) when departing Vienna, writing this book was more or less the best way of contacting her, which he does successfully as he visits Paris and attends a book signing. She meets him there, and they discuss their lives since their previous encounter, as well as where their lives are headed. Perhaps the most pressing question, at least by eager audience members, is if they are actually going to stay together this time.<br/><br/>Amazingly enough, its very easy to find this movie on DVD, and far more difficult to find ""Before Sunrise"". The latter film was released once on DVD in 1999 and, as of the date of this review, is out of print. It's surprising too, because I go to video stores and see the ""Two DVDs for One"" set of movies all the time. Sometimes the movies go together for obvious reasons, such as ""Cocoon"" (1985) and ""Cocoon: The Return"" (1988). Other times, I've seen ""Kids"" (1995) and ""The Rules of Attraction"" (2001) together in the same set for no apparent reason. ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" deserve to be watched in the order they were made, because I doubt moviegoers who had seen the former would not care about the characters in the latter. However, considering this film received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and its predecessor received no nominations (other than an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss), I could be wrong.<br/><br/>Again, though, this film is on par with the original in the excellent dialogue and the undeniable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. In this movie, there are longer shots of them walking and talking together. In the first movie, the cameras cut back and forth to show each one of them talking to the other. Here, they're in the same frame, so it's even more amazing that they engage in their conversations and never even come close to missing a beat.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the original film, part of me longed for Vienna over Paris. I know that's hard to believe, but the shots of the film in the original were so good, and the places Jesse and Celine visited were not touristy. In this film, they go around Paris, but they don't stop by the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre a.k.a the real touristy spots. They venture through the cobblestone streets and coffee shops, and eventually through gardens and aboard a ferry. All this great scenery, meanwhile, didn't distract from the characters' conversations.<br/><br/>And again, Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy gave reason for why you wanted or needed to care about these characters. Especially in the case of Jesse having a troubled marriage and Celine having relationship problems, the dialogue reflected situations you could sympathize with if not relate to. And this script had an upper hand on the original in that the characters were far more mature now with problems that went beyond finding themselves. The ending also had you guessing, will Jesse leave his wife for Celine after all? Will he make his flight out in the end? These questions are not even hinted at before the end of the film.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Julie Delpy's songs cemented this film's memorability for me, especially her song ""A Waltz For A Night"", which should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song that year. It was just one of the reasons I kept watching this film until the very end, not even stopping in between to use the restroom. It's all a testament to Linklater's ear for an intriguing film that does not necessarily tell a story. ""Before Sunset"" lives up to its hype, does not pander to unfamiliar audiences, and is just as good as the original."

","Two ever-so-brief lovers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) meet once again and wander around a European city trying to figure out what to do with their lives and each other. Before Sunset is one of the most beautifully realized love stories ever put together, featuring a pair of perfect performances by Hawke and Delpy. It is a movie that is achingly romantic, yet features not a single kiss, or even hand-holding. As Jesse and Celine step around years of expectations and anguish, Linklater reveals two startling realized souls longing for more, all coming to a head with an ending that can't be beat for its simplicity or effectiveness. An absolute masterpiece."

","She goes, ""Baby, you're going to miss your flight,"" and then it cuts to him and he says, ""I know,"" and starts laughing, but then it cuts to her dancing like she never heard him. Do you think she does? <br/><br/>There are a couple of instances in the movie too where the characters reveal something only to deny it was specifically about the other, for example, Ethan tells her about his dream only for her to say ""did you just say that to get in my pants,"" and he says yes jokingly, and later she plays the song with his name in it and later denies it's about him but any guy's name can be inserted. Do you think they just said that to break the tension? I like the open endedness of the ending. The director really made it less straightforward this time since the guy's married with a kid but by pointing out his marriage isn't that great you're led to believe that there is still hope for these 2. <br/><br/>My money is on a third film a few years down the road, although increasingly the ""romance"" aspect will be lacking, like it was in this film. If you noticed a lot of the romance and love in this film is framed in past-tense and memories, the two characters don't really share that much physical contact but there's a lot more subtext going on, which I suppose is a more accurate representation of what would happen in reality."

","In 1995,director Richard Linklater introduced movie audiences to Jesse(Ethan Hawke)and Celine(Julie Delpy),two strangers from America and France(respectively)who meet on a train,stop in Vienna,drift through the lovely,historic streets and architecture as they converse,bond and,ultimately connect,only to part ways,unsure(as was the viewers)as to whether they would ever see each other again.<br/><br/>Almost ten years later,Linklater,along with Delpy and Hawke,decided to continue the stories in real time,and this time an impromptu(and the script and story gives the viewer the right to doubt that)meeting during a book tour that Jesse is a part of to promote a novel he's written(regarding the fictionalized encounter he and Celine had)that stops in Paris,which just happens to be the home of Celine. They are elated to see each other at first,and then for the next(almost)two hours,proceed to take their conversation across the city. The mood changes in waves,as each examines their lives since their encounter and come to various philosophical realizations(or even un-realizations). Once again,as they both long for each other despite practically everything(i.e. he's married with a son,she's afraid of deep,ever-present relationships),and their closeness over this second bonding opens the door for perhaps another chance at romance that was kindled--and was extinguished just as quickly--and once again,you the viewer are left wondering: will they do it? Will it take this time? The possibilities.<br/><br/>I was very pleased to see these character brought back. I was very impressed with the first movie,which I saw for free as part of a studio promo when I was in college,and felt after I saw it that this merited another look-see. A script penned by Hawke,Delpy,Linklater and Kim Krizan is written and rehearsed with such sharpness that,like the first firm,the feel of the conversation is relaxed and almost improvised in feel. Thes characters have grown up--in fact,in some ways,it feels like they've grown up possibly TOO much--but they still hold their memories and feelings with some of the same passion they had when they were twenty-somethings. Being of nearly the same age,I feel like this was the closest of just about any movie I saw out of the 90s that had ANY relation to my generation IMHO. This was not a widely released,nor wildly popular movie and that surprises me none.This is,like the last one,a purely conversational film and many people just simply have the patience for a film like that. I had been somewhat lazy about getting around to see this(on DVD,no less!)and maybe that came from subconsciously was afraid that a follow-up to the first movie might blow some of my theories or desires for the characters would not get realized or abused. I am happy to say after seeing this that none of that really happened. If anything,it actually carried along these characters in a natural arc that made them even MORE likable and real to me than previous.<br/><br/>Personally,I'd love to see an Act III of Jesse and Celine,maybe this time in the states. And like before,there should be no rush,since these characters had plenty of time to develop for a largely satisfying Act II."

","Paris, 2003. Jesse, an American writer in his early 30s, is signing books and giving a talk at Shakespeare & Company, the famed Parisian bookseller that first printed ""Ulysses"" in 1922. The book chronicles a one-night stand nearly a decade earlier that he just can't get out of his mind. As he is about to finish, he locks eyes for a moment on a particular face in the stacks: Celine, the woman he met nine years before on a summer night in Vienna. For anyone who has seen and loved ""Before Sunrise"", the film chronicling that meeting, the moment of recognition in this sequel comes as an all-time great moment in cinema...five minutes in, and I knew I was in the presence of greatness.<br/><br/>Celine and Jesse go for a cup of coffee at a café, traversing a half-dozen windy, ancient Parisian streets, and they talk about careers and education, what has led them to this place. Interestingly enough, the dialog was largely scripted by the actors, and they both express (non-acting) interests that mirror the real lives of Hawke (a successful novelist) and Delpy (an environmental activist and musician who has recorded a couple of albums); they also play to their ages and they play characters that are reasonably successful in the outward sense, so a great aura of realism is maintained with little effort. This allows the dialog to ebb and flow, to continue easily for the 80 minute duration of this real-time walk through the streets and gardens of Paris, through life, career, love, lust, politics.<br/><br/>And it all may seem very boring to you, if what you expect is ""drama"" and ""event""; if you expect your romances to be full of sex and unbelievable situations and jealousy and hysteria. ""Before Sunset"" is 80 minutes of two very intelligent, articulate people reacquainting themselves with each other, reawakening to youthful aspirations and romantic hopes that they assumed were withering. It's a paean to French ideals and American excesses, to Paris and to music and to architecture and literature, all conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.<br/><br/>I'm going on a bit perhaps, but I cannot think of a more ""real"", knowing film about love, about the lost past and the hopeful future than this minimalist tour through the eyes of a brazen Texan and a talkative Parisian. It's easy for me to fall in love with actresses, but Julie Delpy is simply unbelievable here and I've rarely felt more jealous in a movie than I did of Ethan Hawke (who I rarely like, but seems perfect here).<br/><br/>There are many wonderful allusions to film history in this hour and a third but the most potent is the short cruise down the Seine near the end, which brings to mind most obviously two of the most romantic and expressionist films in French history, Vigo's ""L'Atalante"" (1934) and Carax' ""Les Amants du Pont Neuf"" (1991). I was wondering if this film would end there, but instead the couple detours to Celine's apartment for the stunning, very appropriate finale."

He's now a published author and Celine finds him at a stop in Paris. They spend an afternoon together and their old chemistry is undeniable. This installment is even more closely tied just to the two main characters. There are no guys on a bridge or wandering gypsies this time.

It is just so authentic. How we slowly become numb, maybe don't even realize it. Love turns out not to be what we expected but we never really stop hoping somewhere deep inside. We have dreams and we wish them to come true but reality drags us down. Having a dream, a strong wish, desire can be extremely hard and emotionally painful if it does not come true. It is just a burden, a perspective by which we weigh our experiences.<br/><br/>But then again when we have our dreams come true, after a while,don't we just find ourselves wanting more ?

","You would think an entire film consisting of just dialogue could bore the heck out of you, and if you are a action-craving Hollywood blockbuster guy, you would probably be better off watching ""Die Hard."" But if you're up for a film with top quality acting and a solid script, you will probably remember this film as one of your favorite love stories. Richard Linklater pulls our attention throughout the entire film by allowing the audience to experience the emotional and psychological drama through each character's eyes while leaving enough distance to witness the events from a neutral perspective. With his accessible plot he creates much emotional and dramatic sequences within the small time-frame: former two lovers walking down the streets of Paris. By the time you realize this film purely consists of dialogue, you'd most probably want it to stay that way. The two major elements in this film are reminiscent emotions of a previous relationship and the little time in which two ex-lovers can share these emotions. Much of the talking seems to be a means of observation, while most of the communication seems to take place at a more subtle level. The physical expressions in can be observed with the fine acting of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who seem to be playing real-life lovers, especially for those who have seen ""Before Sunrise."" I haven't seen such a satisfying love story in a long time; it was quite refreshing to watch a love story that didn't make me feel mellow nor optimistic: this film, was neither."

And their conversation is just full of compelling thoughts and ideas; it raises to the surface large and latent feelingsI am not referring to their desires to solve world issues, but rather to the more personal thoughts that come out suddenly and wake some sleeping impression in methey spend long stretches in moderately stimulating discussion, and then, he or she will say something that they've been thinking about all along, this constitutes the ebb and flow of the film's energy, it's what makes it dynamicif the world was ending tomorrow and I knew it, ""I probably wouldn't want to talk about the environment, or my bookI'd still want to talk about magic in the universeonly I'd want to do it in a bed in between intense love making sessions with you."""

","What can I say about Before Sunset? Haunting, Entrancing, every bit as wonderful as its already cult status (only one year old now) indicates. Ethan Hawke, gaunt, hunched and withered, and Julie Delpy, wiser and better, accidentally (or did fate set it up?) meet up a decade after their previous single day together to spend another day reliving it, and catching up with a decade that they eventually realize was all about that one day. What a love story this is! No love-making, but intelligent conversation that is orgasmic, covering the environment, Buddhism, the modern self, psychotherapy, relationships, America and Americans, sex and gender, God  pretty much everything that young people care about in ones and share about in twos. This is an even better film than the first one, sharper and tighter, and benefiting from the ground laid down by it, so that we now care so much more deeply for this couple that were essentially strangers to us the first time around. America meets Europe again here, as the couple walk around talking over Parisian backdrops that are not at all hard to look at. This is a must see, but only after you've seen Before Sunrise. I loved these two films with only a day in between viewing them. What would it have been to have seen Before Sunrise when it first came out and to then see Before Sunset a decade later? The heart aches at the thought."
"meeza","10","1","1","16 February 2005"," A Beautiful Cinematic Sunset View!
","It dawned at me many years ago that the 1995 Richard Linklater film ""Before Sunrise"" was one of the supreme bang-up romantic narratives in cinematic history; even though the main characters are not showed banging. ""Before Sunrise"" tells the story of Jessie & Celine's one-day romance in Vienna. Jessie is the American and Celine is the Frenchie. They were young, vulnerable, and adventurous. The film's open-ended finale left us pondering if they would reunite in 6 months. Before you know it, 9 years have passed. So you know what that means, Sequel Heaven! Jessie & Celine are now Sunset People! Doing it right! Night after night! OK, Summer's over! Donna Summer, that is. ""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever! I know some of you think that my brain is fried by getting too much sun with this overstatement. However, you have to experience this breathtaking sunset to believe it. In ""Sunset"", Jessie & Celine unexpectedly reunite in Paris nine years later. They're older, wiser, and more experienced in the game of love. Will they recapture the magic in this ""Sunset Place""? If you are an avid fan of ""Sunrise"", then you will adore the ""Sunset"" even more. The film's poetic masterful screenplay is quite deserving of its Academy Award nomination; which by the way was scribed by Linklater, Jessie, and Celine. Yes! Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their acting was also not too shabby. Ethan Hawke as Jessie and Julie Delpy as Celine were commanding thespian performances that were definitely on the sunny-side up category. Without a doubt, the best acting duet of the year! Reunited and it felt so good to see Hawke and Delpy on screen together again. I announce in my delpysition that Delpy's work might very well be the best female acting of 2004. So much so, that I desperately wish I had ""Jessie's Girl"". Writer-Director Linklater's work never ceases to surprise me. He is one of the genius directors of our generation. ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on You"", go see this beautiful sunset today! ***** Excellent"
"ReevesBeckett","10","1","1","15 November 2004"," What a sequel should be.
","Before Sunset is what a sequel should be. The actors and director got together because they wanted to continue with the story and there was more of a story to tell. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy show great dramatic range. Lest we forget that they also helped write the movie and that too provides another level to enjoy the film on. It doesn't drift into conventions, it makes its own rules. This film is what romantic movies should always be: true to life. It doesn't shy away from the fact that these two may not get together, it doesn't provide a simple answer. It asks the audience to take the journey with them. The last 20 minutes of this movie is some of the most honest, heartfelt, and emotionally draining moments I have seen in film. Looking forward to Before Sunrise 3 in 2013. 10/10"
"cashun","Null","1","1","23 August 2004"," An Absolute Delight
","I just saw this movie yesterday at the independent movie house in my city, I paid a six dollar matinée fee and nine dollars and seventy-five cents for a large soda/large tub of popcorn combo (it's to help support independent films so I went for it). So basically, I shelled out sixteen dollars to see a movie. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY! I was a huge fan of Before Sunrise, and was practically hyperventilating at the thought of a sequel that I heard by chance while dozing on the couch at 3 in the morning with the Entertainment Network playing on the TV. I woke up suddenly when I heard the Before Sunrise title mentioned, and just about danced for joy when they said that Before Sunset would be coming out in July. I had to wait for it to make it's debut in my town over a month later. I refuse to give away any spoilers on this movie, because it's such a wonderful treat watching the movie unfold over the conversations that this couple have, revealing themselves to each other and talking about their lives. Believe me, I was tempted to read as much as I could about the movie before seeing it, but swore off anything other than time and date of the movie. I think it my patience was more than rewarded, however even if I had read the spoilers, I would have still enjoyed this movie immensely. The dialogue is just sublime. I have a special affinity for this movie, and sequel. Maybe it's become I was the same age as Celine in both movies when the movies came out, and the idea of connecting with someone at such a young age and being hopeful about love, then to get to the point where it's almost 10 years later, how those attitudes about love and commitment change...it's just strikes such a cord with me. This is just such a beautiful movie, and Ethan And Julie do such an amazing job portraying Jessie and Celine. This movie at times doesn't even seem like a movie, but like were in on a most intimate and private conversation. No special effects, no huge car chases or animated monsters, just an amazing performance in a beautiful touching story."

","Being that this starred Ethan Hawke, it wasn't hard to convince me to see this. I had heard some ""rumor"" of this being a follow up to another film but I paid little attention.<br/><br/>Truth be told, this is a brilliant film. I'm not quite sure which part is the best - the subtle acting or the casual conversation in which this film is written. From the very first instant, the audience is drawn into the story as a sort of ""fly"" who happens to be listening to two long lost friends and lovers. Both Hawke and Delpy are so comfortable and casual with each other that you feel as though this really happened and is not just some movie. <br/><br/>Hilariously witty dialogue and true to life observations, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. There is a definite passion that emits from both actors, creating an even stronger sense of belief in the possibility of this happening. Absolutely brilliant, this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Brilliant acting is only the beginning of the greatness of this film.<br/><br/>10/10 A MUST see!"
"bobberens","10","1","1","5 July 2004"," The Best Movie I've Seen in Years
","I honestly can't remember the last time I was so affected by a movie. This is simply the most beautiful movie I've seen in years. What's more, it affected me very personally. It really forces you to reflect on your own life. Even with movies I love, my enjoyment is usually of a very abstract, aesthetic kind...I admire this or that thing, this bit of dialogue, the way that scene was lit. With Before Sunset, I can't even comment on it so bloodlessly. I felt like I was face to face with my own joys and disappointments when I was watching it. A masterpiece. Richard Linklater is probably the most gifted and humanistic director alive...which is strange, because he's so unprepossessing, and has no particular aura of auteurist holiness. (Bully for him). Film students are probably still more influenced by Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorcese than Linklater, which is a shame."
"lavalante","Null","1","1","3 July 2004"," The Question of Character
","Nine years after Before Sunrise, director Richard Linklater lets us drop in once more on the chance meeting of his two characters, Jesse and Celine. What we know is that they did not rendezvous 6 months later as planned in Vienna. For the next 80 minutes, Jesse and Celine retread the past and analyze their present circumstances.<br/><br/>As with its prequel, Before Sunrise consists almost entirely of non-stop dialogue. But in many ways, the movie trumps its predecessor. Instead of a full day, the film occupies the real time of less than 2 hours. The tension is stronger, as they are constantly reminded that Jesse must reach the airport in time for his flight. The stakes are higher as they try to uncover why they are both possessed by the one night stand almost a decade ago. They are both in relationships (indeed, Jesse is married with a 4 year old son) but can't find the same connection with their significant others that they found with each other. There are near misses of meetings, recollections of longing that begs questions of their own incompetencies... as lovers, as good human beings. Thankfully, Linklater makes the questions (or, that they are brave enough to ask them) more important than the answers. His affection for these characters is enough to yield them privacy; once again he opts not for the soft landing of a determined ending, but an open question."
"inman50","10","1","1","3 July 2004"," A Magical, Elegiac Continuation Of ""Before Sunrise""
","Notice that I said ""continuation"", as opposed to ""sequel"", which is mostly a Hollywood term applied to cashing in on the success of an original film. There is nothing ""commercial"" about Richard Linklater's inventive, playful, wistful, and ultimately piercing story of two people many of us felt a deep cinematic bond with in the first film. For everyone who was content and beguiled by the aching ambiguity of the ending of ""Before Sunrise"", who felt no need to explore what became of Jesse and Celine, I think it's safe to say that our hearts still yearned to see them together. What ""Before Sunset"" does so beautifully is to show the effect of time on these two soul mates, how young love and youthful idealism have given way to life's weary compromises and bittersweet memories of what might have been. The torrent of glorious dialogue is back, only this time it's as remarkable for what is not said as much as what should be said. Jesse and Celine circle around each other with small talk, a rudimentary update of their lives in the intervening 9 years that slowly, irrevocably, and anxiously builds up to confessional regret. To see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy again 9 years later is like running into two dear old friends we haven't seen in a long time. Their rapport and chemistry together is extraordinary. To those who feared this film would somehow diminish the specialness of the original, it feels like an unequivocal homecoming. And the true miracle is it leaves you wanting more. Something tells me that many of us will never get enough of Jesse and Celine, and in that creative spirit, I'm sure Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have Truffaut's ""Antoine Doinel"" films with Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Michael Apted's ""7-up"" series well in mind. For the time being, we have this wondrous little film to be thankful for."

It touches us in the heart, grabs our undivided attention and attempt to give us an answer, while in the process watch two people fall for one another. Thus they don't truly understand it,even though they have been separated for 9 years, there are pieces of their lives that are unresolved, that they can only answer with each other. I was amazed by the boat trip, the car trip and toward the end! All while in the process felt as if I was watching Paris, France itself.

","I felt like an intruder on a very very long and very boring personal conversation. Neither Ethan Hawke (Jesse) nor Julie Delpy (Celine)were able to portray any real interest in their own conversation let alone bring the conversation alive and draw the viewer into their lives. These two young people who had met 6 years earlier in a ""passonate"" fleeting moment (The subject of an earlier film)seemed intent on destroying any pleasant memories that they had each carried of the other! This was the longest stupidest movie I believe I have ever watched! The use of brief ""flash-backs"" from the movie filmed in 1995 was unique and interesting because the characters had changed (matured in appearance) but not unrecognizably so. The Movie set was very nice (maybe it was really Paris?). But the streets of Paris and the ""flash-back"" technique could be put to much better use elsewhere! The Movie contained a lot of unnecessarily nasty language - maybe in an attempt to make the conversation provocative? Don't waste you time watching this movie!"

It's like spending 90 minutes listening to two people talk about nothing, absolutely nothing. Oh, and they just had to spend 10 of these minutes bashing everything about America and Americans.

She's an environmental activist and still single he's married and is oh merely a best-selling novelist on a publicity tour promoting his book based on the one night these two spent together in the first flick. So it all gets very self-reflexive real quick, and annoying and not hot. She says that she's romantically numb and he describes his married life as running a nursery with a woman he used to date and has had sex < 10 times in 4 years. They don't kiss or make any promise to meet again and it's all ambiguous and noncommittal and forgettable. The screenplay was co-written by the two stars and a lot of the dialogue is humorless and chilly. I'm pretty annoyed by the whole thing and I think I've loved every other movie directed by my man Linklater, from School of Rock to Dazed & Confused to Waking Life to Slacker.

I have never watched a movie with so little plot, there were no twists nothing is accomplished except for rehashing the first film and giving un-unique insight towards current events and love life.

There's so much to praise here, not least the performances in what is  virtually a two-hander, if there are a brace of more natural-seeming performances out there than these two then I'm ready to show my ass in Macey's window.

The film lacks the jolt of electric eye contacts or embraces. Not even a dot of a plot line exists. I couldn't even appreciate this droning attempt at cinema for it's unique camera angles or mesmerizing backgrounds. Naturally, filming in Paris adds volumes to a films reputation but the focus was not the sites of Paris but rather the intrusive eavesdropping on an estranged couple. Perhaps if I had viewed Before Sunrise prior to buying my ticket to Before Sunset, I would have had a better understanding of the direction of the continuation. My recommendations would be to drop a few dollars on the beginning of this video diary and view it in the comfort of your home so at the very minimum, if it lulls like it's sequel, you would have the luxury of telemarketer as a welcomed distraction."

","BEFORE SUNSET (2004) ***1/2 Filmmaker Richard Linklater reunites with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in this follow-up to their romantic comedy/drama 'Before Sunrise' nine years later where the one-night standers are inevitably reunited when Hawke is in France for a book-reading of a thinly-veiled account of their wonderful day and night together. Picking up almost immediately from their last encounter the two chatty and intelligently pleasant lovers try to rekindle a lost flame but more importantly self-discover just where they are in life with some very funny and poignant almost improvised dialogue (the three artists collaborated on the script and storytelling at hand) which runs breezily thanks in large part to the exquisitely beautiful French locations in an effortless non-stop walk between the two (Lee Daniel's documentary-like cinematography gets the job done). Once again love triumphs for even the most cynical valentine wannabes."

","Because if you didn't, you'll like this one even less.  While the dialog is not quite as spontaneous as the original, this is still a VERY worthy successor to a movie nearly all it's fans thought should NEVER have a sequel.  The characters aren't quite a genuine as they were in the first film, but that's one of the things that keeps it so real.  If these two characters were less cynical and more open like their 1995 counterparts, it just wouldn't be believable.<br/><br/>This isn't a film for the masses.  A fiend of mine in her early 30's watched the original on DVD the night before we saw this one at SXSW, and she thought the sequel superior, but after considering them both, said that had she still been in her mid 20's, she probably would have enjoyed the original more.  It speaks to a certain age of viewer with a certain level of intelligence and maturity.  Most other people just won't get it, and will think it's a waste of time.  That's ok though, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes."

"drhoads-93743","10","0","0","4 May 2020"," My favorite of the three films
","This is a film that many people relate to, but most who relate to it will be ashamed to admit it. It's unconventionally romantic, emotionally complex, and much too real at times.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I love this film is it's difficult to deal with. You find yourself wanting what they want, yet you know you shouldn't. It's as if we all become the characters the moment the film starts and we are taken on a journey of deep existential and moral questions. We know the answer to the moral questions, but we pretend we don't know. We pretend Jesse and Celine are the heroes we are rooting for to win, but we know they are the villains of the story.<br/><br/>While Before Sunrise was an innocent movie about two young people with innocent and pure intentions, Before Sunset is about how the same people are now impure and not innocent. They are manipulative from the very beginning, manipulating themselves and the whole situation, but their passion and love is the same as in the first movie.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly sexy movie about two people; one is up to no good and she knows it deep down, and the other is a dirtbag who pretends to be an innocent good guy. But Linklater lets us pretend that they are both innocent for our own selfish benefit, then at the end we are left secretly shameful of what we've done. It's almost like we ourselves directed the story where it went and we are left feeling guilty that we did such a thing. However, it couldn't have happened any other way.<br/><br/>Jesse and Celine are good representations of humanity. Maybe once in a lifetime will someone have a passionate love like this, and Before Sunset shows us how we are often slaves to that passion. It's appeals to the 15-year-old in us even though we are now 30 years old.<br/><br/>It sounds like I'm down on the film, but all of these complexities are why I love it."

Therefore, when you watch sunset, you literally cry in many scenes, just because of one word, one smile or one look which means so much implications behind it.The most touching part of love is that when you realize the person you keep thinking of is experiencing the same feeling and missing you that much."

","Before Sunset exceeded my expectations for a sequel. In my opinion it lives up to its predecessor but with its own unique tone,
with each offering a unique experience that the characters go through in different stages in their lives.<br/><br/>The excitement and youth of the first, stays in that very moment locked away. A moment they refer to often, as maybe their most memorable or fondest night ever shared with another individual, while here in the present, we find a slew of new emotions evolved from the first experience, but now with more mature and worn out individuals, that find themselves going through a similar scenario.<br/><br/>I watch these incredible performances where practically, all they are doing is walking around and catching up, yet I find myself captivated.<br/><br/>When I think about it on a technical aspect, most of the scenes, are shot in one shots. Personally, I can't help but feel as if it's a live performance that was all done in single takes. This footage feels so real to me, more like a play than a movie.<br/><br/>Yet another thing that helped me connect so well with these characters, is the feeling that I've had almost identical conversations or thoughts myself, and to see them be played out feels so personal.<br/><br/>In the end of the movie, we are still left wondering, how does it work out for Celine and Jesse? It ends as ambiguously as the first did, and in a way, it's even more ambiguous if we take in consideration what happened the last time they were in a similar situation.<br/><br/>It really can all boil down to our own outlook on life and love. With everyone having their own experiences and finding themselves at different stages in life.<br/><br/>For now, I consider myself somewhat hopeful. I guess we'll find out in Before Midnight."

Clearly, Linklater is a raw filmmaker and all involved are practising what they preach, they aren't proselytising, but they are making films about people who are segments of themselves.<br/><br/>Stylistically and tonally, it's a totally different film, it feels like it's grown, it's radical in just flowing almost in real-time, it follows from behind or infront, just watching them as they snatch just a little more time, something movies can rarely show well.<br/><br/>It has the most exquisite ending I've ever seen. A soft and generous compliment to the cab ride moment where we see the deep empathetic sadness of two people somewhere they never dreamed they would be.<br/><br/>I found it really cathartic and emotional at the end.

"vjnambu","7","0","0","11 December 2019"," An underwhelming reunion
","9 years after the events of before sunrise, Celine meets Jesse at his book launch in France. In the end of before sunrise they promised that they will meet in Vienna again after 6 months. But Celine doesn't show up because of her grandma's demise. So after they meet we find out that Jesse is married with a son and Celine is dating a photo journalist. They then travel around France sharing their past experiences until Jesse has to catch his return flight in evening.
I loved before sunrise as I feel its a best love story I have ever seen. In sunrise they spent a whole day together and part ways the next day. So as a audience we also feel like we have spent a memorable day with them. But in sunset we get a feeling of an unsatisfied one day picnic we have on Sundays because they spend very less time together. Another drawback I felt was with its abrupt ending without any proper conclusion. And last thing I felt disappointed was that Jesse and Celine don't have the same chemistry which they had in sunrise. But there are some great scenes. My favorite scene was in the cab where Celine shows her frustration of not being in a committed relationship and in return Jesse talks about his failing marriage and both wanting but unable to touch each other. On the whole, before sunset falls on those category of sequels which only partially captures the magic of its predecessor."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","0","0","26 September 2019"," The space between words.
","As with its predecessor, 'Before Sunset (2004)' is at its most successful when it focuses on the relationship between its two core characters, this time painting it as a painfully accurate reunion. This focus on 'what could've been' and 'what may be yet to come' is where the piece really shines, crafting a palpable dynamic between its two long-lost lovers and giving the story a strange sense of suspense. Of course, a seventy-five-minute conversation is going to meander. This is especially noticeable when the topics of conversation turn to philosophising, with changes in direction sometimes being as drastic as going straight from ""how are you?"" to ""do you believe in god?"". When this is the case, the dialogue reflects the writers far more than the characters - I mean, you can practically hear Linklater saying some of this stuff - and the experience is worse for it. Still, it's all remarkably compelling for what it is. Despite being slightly theatrical, it feels incredibly 'real' as compared to others in the genre. There are no grand gestures or arbitrary break-ups, there's just an excellently evolving relationship. It's also great how the space in-between words is sometimes as important as the words themselves, indicative of subtle writing that really knows what it's doing. Overall, it's about as good as it's predecessor. As an experiment, it works rather well. It's not always the most engaging affair but it often makes you smile and it has a decent pace considering it's a constant 'talk-fest'. The core relationship is what really keeps you watching and it really is one of the best in its genre. 6/10"
"TheOny13","8","0","0","18 July 2019"," An enjoyable movie without any purpose
","That's how I would describe the first movie too: as a very enjoyable and sweet movie that ultimately had no goal, no purpose. It just ends and it leaves without any sense of catharsis. After watching the first movie I felt I didn't have to watch it in the first place.<br/><br/>Now having watched the sequel and hoping this would bring something to the trilogy, I can honestly say that this is part 2 of ""The movie without purpose"".<br/><br/>Usually great movies have a plot that by the end pays off in a way or another (either good like The Dark Knight either bad like The Last Jedi), but they all pay off. That's part of why people watch them and other movies. Because by the end the movie has somewhat of a finality that makes you look back on the movie and say ""it was worth it to watch this movie"". Here on the other hand, there is no finality, there is no ultimate purpose of the movie with the characters or with the story. I never felt relieved or inspired or with a sense of catharsis when I watched either of the two movies (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset). Sure it's enjoyable and lovely to see these two guys walk around a street talking about different things from life and making you question how do you relate to those things, but ultimately this movie has no deep meaning or a main theme runing throughout the movie so that by the end you could feel moved or inspired or feel that movie was worth it.<br/><br/>I don't understand who would consider this movie a masterpiece or the best movie of the year since there are way more movies that have also a realistic feel to them but above all have purpose and a message. This one does not!"
"josephrygaard","6","0","0","14 July 2019"," Before Watching: Before Sunset (2004)
","""Before Sunset"" (2004) is the sequel to ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and follows Jesse and Celine as they meet nine years after their first encounter. Like its predecessor, Before Sunset a romantic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>As with Before Sunrise, the emotional impact and reward from this movie comes from the level of resonance one experience with the characters - more dialogue will hit home, train of thoughts will be relatable, and they will undoubtedly be more sympathetic. Audiences younger or older risk losing a lot of value and emotional satisfaction because of this very reason.<br/><br/>An important thing to be aware about is the tone in the dialogue. Before Sunset is cruder than its the prequel, and there are frequent gags and talk about sexual subjects which can risk upsetting conservative or sensitive people, or at least detract from the overall viewing experience. The moral grounds in itself is also quite loose, as it becomes more and more apparent throughout the runtime that Jesse and Celine are tempted by the thought of leaving their current partners for each other, which doesn't feel entirely in line with the people we got to meet in the prequel. This can be perceived as quite questionable.<br/><br/>Finally, the resolution to this movie can also by some be perceived as unrewarding, as consequences are not really dealt with as consequences, or at least one in the same way as one would expect from the prequel. It is hard to say more before giving away the plot, but before watching Before Sunset, one could benefit more from being less conservatively consequential here than in Before Sunrise. Do remember, however, that this movie impacts you depending on how much you can relate with the life situation Jesse and Celine are in, and that nothing in this review thereby can be taken as a final say.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a disappointing 6/10.

","In the beginning, it could be a little difficult to follow the storyline for those not having watched the first sequel, but if you pay enough attention to the way Jesse and Celine kissed their cheeks and started talking, you know there is a special connection, subtly showed, between them. Not like many other cliched romantic movies, 'Before Sunset' portrays a relationship of ex-lovers in a very unique way as the whole scenes just follow the relentless conversation between the two without making it any boring, which is highly-appreciated.<br/><br/>The ex-couple showed great chemistry in their conversation just like the day they first met 9 years before and the things they talk about closely reflect what real-life happy couples should be conversing about - career, opinions, others' relationship, and trivial stuff. It is gripping and holds your attention the whole duration as it makes you expect a happy ending for this harmonious but unwillingly separated couple. In addition, I also admire their philosophies about life and love like 'memories are wonderful things, if you don't have to deal with the past' or 'even being alone is better than being with a lover and feeling lonely'. The great and warm-hearted song at the end may make people feel sorry for the couple, but in my opinion, it acts as an open ending."

","The way this movie starts is very interesting and without wasting any time it makes them meet so effortlessly in a way that we feel like there is no time gap between the movies. Or it is may be I am binge watching the trilogy. The question of whether they meet after 6 months is answered in a very minimalistic and beautiful way. And this brings them to find comfort again talking to each other. That is really brilliant and pure poetry.<br/><br/>And there is no conflict or up and downs in story arc. Just the time constraint. This is really not proforma of any usual story. I have not seen this kind of story telling before. Usually movies that leave some impact on you are mostly confined to a genre and some conflict - victory scenario. This script is not limited to those things and requires not much from actors but makes a large impact that too in a pleasant way.<br/><br/>One thing is clear now atleast is that they have had sex that night and that too twice. But this time ambiguity lies in the question of will they ever meet? or will there be any closure for them?<br/><br/>Wow!!! Kudos to the director for both films. I have yet to watch the third part. I don't know if it gives me the same feel as the first two, which is why I'm writing my review here itself. Just enjoying the moment and sharing my love."

","""Before Sunset"" is genuinely a modern masterpiece in every aspect. Once again the great trio / dream team that consists of Ethan Hawke, Richard Linklater, and Julie Delpy showcase their magic on-screen so sweetly, that you will never want this movie to end. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have co-written the story/ screenplay of this great flick with director Richard Linklater.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke said in one of his interviews that ""Before Sunset is a romance for realists"". This statement basically summarises the movie in a capsule form. This movie continues the story of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after their first romantic interaction. The movie opens with Jesse giving an interview to journalists in Paris about a book that he recently wrote and had it published. The book features the romantic adventure of Jesse and Celine during their one night stay in Vienna.<br/><br/>As Jesse is answering the various questions by journalists, he notices that Celine is standing nearby. He quickly ends the interview and goes to meet Celine. Viewers soon get to know the fact that Jesse did come to Vienna six months after their first meeting (just as they had planned and promised). However, Celine could not reach Vienna because she had to attend her grandmother's funeral. The two had not given each other their phone contact, address , etc - so Jesse never knew the reason for her absence in Vienna until now.<br/><br/>As Jesse and Celine continue their conversation along the streets of Paris, we find out that a lot has happened in their lives within these nine years - Jesse is married and has a son, but he is still in love with Celine. Celine has had, in her own words, "" a lot of blah relationships"", but she is also still in love with Jesse.<br/><br/>They continue talking about a lot of issues. Finally, when Jesse is about to go to the airport with his designated driver, he offers to drop Celine at her home. When they arrive at Celine's home, Jesse walks with her inside, and asks her to sing one song. As Celine sings the ""waltz"" song (Julie Delpy really sang this herself), it becomes very clear that she is still madly in love with Jesse, and vice versa. When Celine reminds Jesse that he will be late and miss the plane, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) smiles and says "" I know"". The movie ends with Celine freely dancing to music being played and Jesse still sitting there and smiling and admiring her.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have once again given such natural performances, that viewers will simply fall in love with them , and their romantic yet very realistic interaction with each other. The director, Mr Richard Linklater, once again proves the fact that he is one of the best movie-directors in the history of cinema."

The relationship between Jesse and CÃ©line feels so authentic. This film basically just encompasses their conversation in Paris before Jesse flies back to the U.S., and we as an audience realize how human these characters are. Their personal lives are in a corrosive state, they have never felt for another human being the way they did when they saw each other for the first and only time 9 years prior, and they ultimately realize they are not complete without one another.

","Before Sunrise follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who is now a bestselling author and reconnects with Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris as Jesse is having a book tour as he's become a bestselling author. It follows similar territory as the first film but in my opinion, it is better and might be my favorite film out of the three films.
You can just feel the vibe of Paris and the characters wonderment even just watching their back 
 The biggest improvement that this sequel does than its predecessor is the pacing. It is about 20 minutes shorter than the first film giving it a brisk 80 minute run time. Another reason why this film works better is how mature the main characters are. In the first film, Jesse and Celine, although way more mature and intelligent than anybody typically is their age, they were still young and didn't have as much life experience to have even more thought-provoking conversations about life itself.<br/><br/>The film is all dialogue and what I loved and admired about this film so much is how much this film depended on the two main leads. There isn't any action sequences or even supporting cast that can steal the show. It is focused squarely on these two performances and its just AMAZING and yes I had to capitalize that because that's how much praise they deserve. They achive what other actors strive to achieve, when watching the film, you don't notice the actor but instead feel as though you are watching real characters and eavesdropping on their daily life.<br/><br/>The camera work is impressive as well as there are many long takes usually through a whole conversation of the two leads walking through Paris. Speaking of Paris, it is absolutely gorgeous and with the camerawork you can see the beauty of Paris as you are walking with Jesse and Celine.<br/><br/>The problem is I can't really talk about what specific conversations these two share in the film without spoiling the experience for you. You find out where they've been during the past nine years, why they never met again, where they've been, what they are doing, in the past and maybe even in the future. Although I can't talk about the many philosophical conversations the film has here's a little taste of it!- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwEo1B2ypk<br/><br/>Before Sunset isn't just my favorite film in the franchise but one of my favorite films of all time. Its a film about how something so small such as conversing can turn into something bigger, more thought provoking, and ultimately life changing. The ending is one of the most perfect endings to a film that I have seen. Its so simple yet hit me so deeply, and I could not recommend this film enough it is a true masterpiece that I hope you love too. :) <br/><br/>Well that went deep. <br/><br/>Score 10/10"

","At the conclusion of my review for ""Before Sunrise"", I practically vowed I wouldn't be catching any of the sequels, but IMDb beckons with it's Top #250 list (this one from #2015), so here I am again. I thought there might be a more mature handling of the now adult Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), but it seems like they're still stuck in that awkward teenage stage of their lives. At least that's the case with the dialog that consumes most of the picture.<br/><br/>I think Celine probably bothered me more this time around. She's rather neurotic, and keeps asking Jesse if HE thinks she's neurotic, and she won't take 'no' for an answer because she's like..., neurotic. She's the first one again to insert the 'F' word into their conversation, this time by way of the middle finger, and isn't it just perfect that she works for the Green Cross. And oh yes, she can't take Jesse's compliment about her looks. Because he thinks her face looks 'skinnier', she launches into a self recriminating 'fatty' diatribe. This kind of stuff wears me down, folks.<br/><br/>And then the topper to blow Jesse out of the water - she can't even agree on whether they made love that night nine years ago. Turns out Celine laid that trip on Jesse because of her own insecurities, and wound up correcting her version later on, but it's those kind of mind games that mess a guy up. And all the while it's pretty transparent that Jesse's not going to catch that plane because he keeps diverting his attention to the next step of the plan to get back together with her.<br/><br/>I thought that long, long walk up the stairs pretty much captured the desire each was hoping for, the inevitable that would happen once they got to Celine's apartment. The story ended in just the right way for me, with that ambiguity hanging out there even though Jesse telegraphed what was going to happen by stating he didn't much care about taking his plane home. And so it comes to the point where I have to implore IMDb reviewers, please, please don't make me watch ""Before Midnight"" with a rating that makes it a top movie favorite. One more time would be just too much, I have no desire to find out what happened with these two star crossed lovebirds."
"alxunderkouts","8","0","0","29 November 2017"," A perfect example of a ROMANTIC movie THAT THE Characters DON'T EVEN KISS Each other OR HAVE SEX, and yet remains one of the most romantic films!!
","...Another masterpiece from Richard Linklater.I recently learned that the first movie (before sunrise) was made by him because he wanted to find a girl that he had met and spent a night like that of the movie.He believed that if the girl would have seen the movie she could have tried to contact with him.In before sunset, he parallels his action of doing this film with the action of Jesse to write a book about the night with Celine, in order to find her...In this movie, indeed Jesse and Celine meet again each other, but this time they have continued their lives.Celine realizes that when we are young we believe that we will have the chance ,plenty of times, to connect with people, but in reality it only happens a few times.That in my opinion is the main message of this film.The biggest mistake that we can do, is to say that we will find another one in the future...NOOO, THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE ONE!!! Another and last point that I would like to emphasize is when Celine says that many couples think that after a few years of living together, they would be in the same state of excitement,in the same passion and the consuming desire to be the same than in the beginning.And continues that this is impossible, because they would have ended up doing nothing at all with their lives, because of the constant heartbeat and desire for sex.Young couples must understand that this is natural and not lack of love.But, of course,in Jesse's situation there is also another important factor for his unhappiness, Celine!!And now fits perfectly the first observation that I made,THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE ONE!!"

","Before Sunset follows Jesse and Celine 9 years after they first met as they meet up once more and hang out for the hour or so before Jesse has to catch a plane. <br/><br/>Similar to 'Before Sunrise', this is a movie about the same two people talking. And that's it. No real plot or anything, it's just a reunion. And it still works. These characters haven't lost their flair quite yet, it's still interesting to watch them interact with one another. <br/><br/>Once again, the acting is all pretty solid as well, with both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy pulling off great performances. And as per usual, they play off of each other very well. <br/><br/>And yet again, the writing is good. The characters have realistic, yet semi important, conversations that are rarely boring or uninteresting. <br/><br/>Still, with a movie like this the pacing does suffer. There are scenes in this movie that dragged more than they should have, and they were noticeable. It was noticeable when they picked up again, and they were noticeable when they started, for no particular reason really. It's just how the movie is structured. <br/><br/>This review has been a rehash of the one I wrote for 'Before Sunrise', although I do have one new thing to say. There's a scene towards the 1 hour mark where one of the characters has a sudden outburst and it's kind of out of place. Everything's going well and their conversations are wrapping up and suddenly one of them just gets super mad and starts ranting. While it wasn't totally out of nowhere, it noticeably changed the tone so quickly that it was hard to ignore. <br/><br/>Overall Before Sunset is, while good, not as good as it's predecessor. Everything good about the first one is good in the second one, but tonally this sequel has some challenges. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you liked the first one. There's really nothing new here from the first one."

","Reviewed November 2011<br/><br/>This is more like a romantic version of earlier Kevin Smith's comedies. Very well written and it's quite mandatory that it is as the entire movie is just one conversation. I would've rated it a bit higher had it not dragged a bit somewhere in the middle. <br/><br/>Jesse (Ethen Hawke) has a one day encounter with a French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) during his college days and has a wonderful time. They decide to meet again on a set date in the future when Celine doesn't show up. After 9 years, Jessi writes a book on the incident and gets quite famous. On the Paris leg of his book tour he meets Celine again and strikes conversation which is the content for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>For a wafer thin story like this, it requires excellent screenplay and a tremendous chemistry between the leads. The talent behind this movie sure delivers the required goods and a special mention should go to Julie Delpy for her excellent presence and contribution to writing. Only problem is that, it feels a little long to reach what it wants to show. There is a little drag just before they both get on the cab which spoiled my mood though it picks up soon after and ends fantastically. It operates on a shoe string budget and never deviates from the core of what it wants to show. <br/><br/>It is extremely enjoyable and a good opportunity to showcase the writer's prowess and they do it with great panache."

","It's a film about two people that once spend some time together and it was maybe one of the best days in their lives. Now 9 years later they meet again and have another wonderful date together. I liked the first film Before Sunrise for it's romantic story and this film while also great and similar to that one it is not so outstanding.<br/><br/>We can know what both of the main characters Jesse and Celine went through during this long 9 years and it's revealed that they didn't meet in Vienna 6 months later as they agreed. Most of the film Jesse and Celine talk with each other about many things and they walk by the streets of Paris. 9 years later they still like each other and there is a sparkle between them. The ending is open and unclear, but it has its charm. Overall it's a nice romantic melodrama in some way unique and everybody can recall his or her own first love and try to get in touch after all those years."

","Before Sunset is the sequel to the romantic movie Before Sunrise. Like its predecessor, it takes place strictly in real time. Again, there is no action or any other elements that are supposed to be present in a typical movie. The movie just focuses on the meeting of the two lead characters after a gap of 9 years since they met on the train. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return and in addition to acting they also helped with the screenplay and are credited for the effort. The acting is effortless and the fact that the characters as well as the actors have aged exactly the same way adds to the realism that this movie aims for. Richard Linklater does not disappoint with the sequel that manages to stand as a great film on its own without comparing it to Before Sunrise. My only grievance for this movie is that it tends to get overdramatic in certain moments like when Julie Delpy breaks down while explaining that she always fails at relationships. The ambiguous ending keeps us wanting more which is just brilliant."

","In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed."

","I have seen the Before trilogy in the wrong order. Before Sunrise saw Jesse and Celine as two young travellers who meet on a train during a trip to Vienna and bond. They exchange little details about themselves and agree to meet up at the same place on a particular date.<br/><br/>Before Midnight released in 2013 is set almost 20 years after they have first met. They are now married, vacationing in Greece and have entered middle life and their relationships now show some cracks.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is therefore the filling of the sandwich. After 9 years, Jesse is travelling in Europe as part of a book tour. He again encounters Celine who has come looking for him in a Paris bookshop.<br/><br/>We find out that Jesse did turn up in Vienna but Celine could not has it was her grandmother's funeral. That event has somehow thrown both their fate in a different direction.<br/><br/>Older, wiser, with both having a career established. They still have much to look forward to but there is also now past regrets. Celine has had relationship failures and Jesse is married with a child but its not a happy marriage. Its clear that both carry a torch for each other and their initial encounter left deep marks.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is the couple walking in Paris or on a boat on the River Seine. We get to know a bit more about these characters as they fill the gap in between the years we last saw them.<br/><br/>Its clear that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have a nice chemistry and comfortable with each other. They look like long lost lovers and of course they co-wrote the screenplay. Just look at Jesse's face when he finds out that Celine had lived in New York and worse he was also there at the same time.<br/><br/>I do think that director Richard Linklater could had done more to show the beauty of Paris and to be honest the touristic element of Paris apart from Notre Dame. I have walked a similar route and taken a boat ride on the River Seine and the film could had done with the picture postcard scenes to break up the monotony of these two people walking and talking. Its kind of natural for Jesse who is after all a visitor to the city.<br/><br/>The conversation is interesting but not riveting. Its natural but does not flow again because the screenplay wants to unwrap its layers slowly and methodically.<br/><br/>Jesse is on a tight schedule as he has a plane to catch but its clear he does not want to leave her. We now know that there is more to their story and shall re-visit them again."

Now, where will this brief encounter lead to, where ever it would end p, the path is for sure gonna be beautiful and that's how it is. <br/><br/>With a beautiful romantic work already done, the director ups the ante this time and how? By making it more time bound and more mature. Jesse and Celine have grown up now, what they thought as everything beautiful is not so as it turns out. They feel imprisoned in their own lives, they have learnt to embrace the shortcomings of what we call is an imperfect world, they speak more fluidly and are more comfortable with each other s they already had a meeting earlier. <br/><br/>Richard Linklater seems to be a master in telling what he would like to tell and in his own inimitable style. He has got aides in Ethan Hawke as Jesse and Julie Delpy as Celine who have added so much to dialog in what is primarily a conversational movie. Can you believe that the whole movie is shot the way the characters speak out, that is as they speak for an hour long, the movie is precisely that much duration only.

","It's nice to see this movie, a sequel to the great story presented in Before Sunrise (1995) about nine years apart. Having the sequel parted by so long of a distance, the movie adapted the circumstance and created a nice twist to continue on from Before Sunrise's ending. I like how the location is now in Paris, that most of the movie's length features the great sights of the great city; it's walkways and alleys between tall old buildings, the cruise on the river, and also of course the famous Parisian garden walkways. I also like how this time the movie ends more in conformity to what the audience will prefer more when they see how Before Sunrise ended. Yet I score this movie lower than its predecessor because the whole thing only feature a faster time than the former.

There are long uncut scenes that must have been quite difficult for the Steadicam crew, but the results are quietly amazing.

The first part of the story is about two people who just meet on a train in Vienna. They meet after 10 years in a Paris library in this movie. Some profane lines in between, as the movie is wholly a conversation between two opposite sex adults. I felt there wasn't much of back-ground music in this. Still there are number of songs which are nice. The movie too gets boring after a while, still happy it is just for 80 minutes.

Actually I wasn't fully paying attention when I watched it the first time, but starting with Jessie (Ethan Hawke's character) fielding questions about whether his novel is autobiographical, it got me good, and never let go for one second; up till the very last scene where Jessie said ""I know"". Fade- out. One of the most remarkable thing about this movie is the continuity. The whole movie felt like it was just one take, lending it such authenticity and immediacy. Of course, I had to see Before Sunrise afterwards; and I must say that I like this second installment a whole lot more. Before Sunrise is much more ""ordinary"", and I don't know whether it is because I watched Before Sunset first. In fact, I might end up thinking Before Sunrise is superfluous. In other words, in a way I wish I had not gone ahead and watched Before Sunrise. <br/><br/>This is not so much a love story. To me, a love story can only be told, in whole, afterwards, with a definitive ending. This film is more about romance, and feelings. It may yet develop into a love story, if there are more installments to come.<br/><br/>The film should not be compared with epic love stories like Doctor Zhivago, but surely can stand on its own merits as an example of a ""perfect"" movie.<br/><br/>Finally, as I was brought up in a ""gentler"" age, the few instances of the f-word did jar my sensibilities, but I can put all that down to context, given the world we are living in now."

","Before Sunset is a sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise & is set 9 years after the events of the first film. Jesse has published an autobiographical book about the events we witnessed in the previous chapter and is out on a promotion tour to help its sale in Europe. While promoting the book in Paris, the last destination after which he should head back to New York, he happens to meet Céline again and thus, we embark on another single day adventure with these two people which is once again constrained by time and just like the original, it is all about conversations shaping up the film's story, plot & presents an all new dimensions of the now older characters.<br/><br/>The direction by Linklater is as good as the previous film, the screenplay may not have the freshness of Before Sunrise but it sure is more mature & wiser and also incorporates writing credits from its lead actors. The cinematography nicely captures few beautiful locations of Paris but the most impressive thing about the camera this time is that the entire story from start to finish gives an appearance of being shot in real time and is expertly edited. The performances from Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy as Jesse & Celine, respectively, is fantastic once again and their chitchat about the past 9 years, jobs & relationships feels absolutely natural while also bringing on surface their maturity & still existing feelings for one another.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Before Sunset turns out to be a sequel that in the end was very much worth its nine years wait and just like its predecessor is one of the finest films of the its genre. Plus the script, which references the previous film to some extent, still has enough strength to succeed as a standalone product and even if you see it without seeing Before Sunrise, you will most probably still end up loving it. But it's better to follow the pattern, in my opinion, as that gives Before Sunset a broader, much evolved look, thus making it an ingenious successor. Before Sunrise is one of the best films there is in the romance genre. And Before Sunset joins it as another equally heartwarming chapter covering another day in the lives of Jesse & Celine. Don't miss it."

They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Before Sunset (2004)<br/><br/>The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Before Sunrise (1995)<br/><br/>The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. <br/><br/>Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do."

","Nine years have passed, but Jesse and Céline are as talkative as ever when they reunite in ""Before Sunset"". He's written a (partly fictional) book about the night that he shared with Céline in Vienna, and she comes to see him on his book tour in Paris. They only have 80 minutes together until he has to catch a plane back, so they continue where they left off – they walk and talk. Having re-watched ""Midnight in Paris"" so recently, it's easy to see differences in Allen and Linklater's styles. Allen is so much more focused on showing the audience Paris and the great things in it, while Linklater focuses on what he considers to be more important – the endless conversation of Jesse and Céline. This doesn't mean that we don't get a small glimpse of the city, and the backgrounds to their walk are frequently stunning. They even get on a riverboat at one point, so we get even more of the city through this.<br/><br/>The film is slightly shorter than the first one, but feels like the perfect length, because it's done entirely in real time. Their walk around Paris is unabridged for the viewer, so we never feel like we've missed anything. It's as sharp and funny as ever, but this time with more emotions. They didn't end up meeting 6 months after ""Before Sunrise"", and there's some pain between them. To change matters even more, Jesse is now married and has a child. We're never really sure what this means for the two of them, but desperately want them to end up together. Once again, the two of them only have a limited amount of time together, and both know it, so they don't hold back at all, discussing everything under the sun. In the end, just before Jesse must leave, they go up to Céline's apartment. This final scene is one of the greatest endings to any film I know, and has an even more infuriating cliffhanger than the end of the first film. Julie Delpy's Nina Simone impression is fantastic, and the final line and fade out is done so perfectly.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are perhaps even stronger than in ""Before Sunrise"", as we are given more of a view into the emotional ranges of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. They're occasionally angry and sad now, not just happy and in love. The two are credited in this film as co-writers with Richard Linklater, which helps the film so much, as they know their characters inside out. Linklater's style continues in this film, with more long shots, and the use of real time allows him just to follow them. The cinematography feels passive to the idle viewer, but lots of the angles and shots are done very beautifully. It's the perfect continuation of the love story, and one of the few sequels that is as good as the first film."

","Before I get down with the review, I want to specify why I picked the second of the Before trilogies instead of the other two. The first film was made out of a simple and exciting journey of two free, passionate young minds, whereas this film is set into a scenario where both the protagonists are engaged, in fact one of them is married with a kid. So it was relatively more challenging to continue from where the last film left off and maintain the same plot, like they meet, they have a chit- chat until one of them have to leave for a flight. There has been a change in mentality and lifestyle for both of them, and it was necessary for the movie to depict the same, which the director has done incredibly well! The whole film basically revolves around a continuing conversation just like the first film, only this time around the director didn't have plenty of choices for the environment, like a pub, or riverside, or rooftop as it was in the previous version. What amazed me the most is the way the story unfolds, how they initially appear really happy about current life, but as the movie progressed we gradually get to know how they are actually not fully satisfied with their current relations, and how they try to forget that night, but can't...for obvious reasons. There is so much conflict throughout the dialog sequence, that even though it was just two people walking and talking, you never feel awkward, or bored for a moment. Truly an outstanding piece of direction by Richard Linklater."

","What an experiment. Nine literal years following the event(s) of Before Sunrise, inside and out of the fictional continuation, came the very well done follow-up, Before Sunset.<br/><br/>I adore original sequels. Especially since there are so few of them. Now, I might lose some credibility for this one, but Before Sunset and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 share something in common with me. Both had probably thee most original concepts for a second chapter.<br/><br/>Now, granted, Blair Witch 2 wasn't an overall great film, and nowhere near it's predecessor, but the idea of a sequel based on the idea the first was a movie was truly original. (Sadly, it went nowhere near it could've gone with that initial premise.) Here, with Before Sunrise, we get to literally see where these characters AND actors changed in nine years.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie does take place almost a decade after the events of the first movie explaining a ton of what happened following that fateful day for our two lovebirds: Jesse and Celine. They meet again after some time has passed and it's like no time had passed. Again, the camera follows these two soul mates through, now, Paris, and they talk and walk and learn about each other's new lives and loves.<br/><br/>As if no time had passed (and it helps seeing these movies back to back,) these two feel just as comfortable with each other as they did when they first met. Only nowthere's tension because they did grow up, apart and with someone else.<br/><br/>While, I liked the movie as a whole and absolutely loved the concept of the 9-year gap of both fiction and nonfiction, it wasn't as fresh after awhile as the original. That doesn't take from the fun I did have with this; it was still very nice to follow these two around and how much they understand each other.<br/><br/>(Spoiler comingif you don't like those, just skip the next paragraph.)<br/><br/>The absolute best part of this movie, when you get past the premise, was the 100% ambiguous finale. The first movie, did give direction where the future was headed, and, yet, you still could draw your own conclusion. This one abruptly ended, which, while I was a little puzzled at first, made me fall in love with the decision of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>I did take a Sunday and watch the entire trilogy and I marveled on what it would've been like had I been a fan of this series and had to wait to see what happens next. I can't imagine what it was like for those who fell in love with these characters and had to wait yet another nine years to find out what the ending of this movie meant.<br/><br/>I guess I cheated, but nonetheless, I enormously loved this climax.<br/><br/>It's a bridge movie, but it's still definitely worth viewing."

","So it took them a few years to make this happen. But it was worth the wait (if you waited that is). The script is exceptional once again, with dialog that doesn't feel like it is scripted. Some might even argue that this is slightly (or a lot) better than the original film this is based on. Whatever the case, we have one of the rare occasions, where a sequel does not fall off quality wise.<br/><br/>You have to like romantic drama or stories about life in general to really get into this of course. But with the trilogy and this being the second part of it, you should know what you are getting yourself into. Good acting and a scenario that takes the characters and the time that has passed and gives us a spin on it. Watch chronological!"

","""Life's hard. It's supposed to be. If we didn't suffer, we'd never learn anything.""<br/><br/>Before Sunrise felt like such a perfect romantic movie that many people had doubts about reuniting these characters nine years later and making a sequel, but fear not because Richard Linklater gives us another perfect story and both Delpy and Hawke are magnificent together. I imagine that everyone that had seen the film back in 1995 made their own conclusions of whether or not these two lovers met six months later like they planned, but now Linklater decides to tell us what happened exactly. I didn't have to think too much about it because I saw Sunrise yesterday, watched Sunset today, and now will get to watch Midnight. I thought this was a perfect sequel to Sunrise and pretty much follows a similar plot line, but with more mature conversations now that the characters have aged. I imagine that those people that had to wait nine years between each sequel probably had a much richer experience than those of us who simply got to see these films in one week, especially those viewers who were about 23 years old in 1995 and matured at sort of the same rate these characters did. In Before Sunset the characters are in their 30's which is the age I'm at now so I related much more to what they were saying this time around. The first film was nostalgic, reminding me how I thought when I was their age, but this time I could identify with them in the present. Looking back and remembering those connections you made with someone and realizing that those connections are hard to come across now that you are older. I guess in a way you value things more now that perhaps in the past you wouldn't. Linklater succeeds once again at bringing a really romantic tale to the big screen.<br/><br/>In Before Sunrise Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met as strangers in a train and spent a night together wandering the streets of Vienna. Before Sunset takes place nine years later as Jesse is at the end of his European book tour in Paris. He has written an autobiographical book about his encounter with Celine although he never admits that the events are true. When he finishes talking about his book he is surprised to see Celine there waiting for him. She lives in Paris and had heard he was going to be speaking at that book store so she decided to go see him. Jesse has to be back at the airport in an hour, but the two get together once again for a cup of coffee and a walk through the streets of Paris while they talk about their life, work, and relationships. They also let us know what happened that day they were supposed to reunite in Vienna. <br/><br/>If there's something negative I could say about Before Sunset it's that it is way too short and you wish the characters could have spent at least half an hour longer together. This time the film and the events that take place are in real time so you have several long shots (the longest one is 11 minutes long) and few editing going on. The film isn't as brilliant to look at, but it is a great conversation to eavesdrop. The chemistry is strong again and this time there is more conversation and less passion, but it works really well. Before Sunset never felt like a forced sequel; it was more of a continuation of that movie and hopefully I will feel the same way about Before Midnight. Linklater was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay and deservingly so with the contribution of Hawke and Delpy who also co-wrote this film. Before Sunset is a beautiful and romantic film that is well worth your time."

","The Before trilogy is a unique piece of cinema that is one of the most enchanted stories I've ever seen, yet I've probably never seen a fictional depiction of love ever expressed so genuinely or realistically. Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film.<br/><br/>""Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas."" This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.<br/><br/>Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.<br/><br/>Before Sunset<br/><br/>The series does mature with its characters. Before Sunset entirely takes place in the matter of an hour and half, almost told in real-time, making the experience even more fulfilling. The characters begin to see the darkness of the world and the mess of their lives is deep territory the romance series dives into, but it only makes them and their brilliantly written conversations feel more real. The poetry in Before Sunset is arresting within each shot, each word, each moment is ravishing. This is the most visually alluring film to watch and the most abstract to think about. The conversations are probably at their deepest analytically covering failures of life, regret, and the possibility of love that never dies.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>Watching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built: through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness."

","It's a story that sounds great on paper, I thought, when I first read about ""Before Sunrise"", the prequel to ""Before Sunset"". It was a simple romance of a boy who meets a girl on a train and both of them take a walk around Vienna. What unfolded in ""Before Sunrise"" made me bite down my initial cynical view of it and extol its greatness. ""Before Sunset"", on the other hand, is a story of a boy who meets a girl again. I always wanted to find out what happened to the characters of Jesse and Celine after the abstruse ending in the first part. Understandably, ""Before Sunset"" was like a breath of fresh air and, like the characters it involves, it was like catching up with old friends.<br/><br/>Nine years after they parted in Vienna, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet again, this time in Paris, when Jesse, who is a bestselling author, is doing a book- tour. Jesse, who had based his book on the night they spent strolling around Vienna, tells her that he wrote it only so that he can meet her again. Celine walks in when he is doing an interview in a bookstore and both of them, initially awkward, decide to take a walk around Paris.<br/><br/>In sequels, I always find an eagerness in directors which is quite discernible when it comes to handling a significant moment, the eagerness to express the importance of that particular moment and make the audience take notice of it. In case of ""Before Sunset"", the most crucial moment presents itself in the meeting between Jesse and Celine. Thankfully, director Richard Linklater handles it wonderfully well, melding the awkwardness, excitement and nervousness and polishing it off with a nice touch of brevity. Though we expect the characters to go straight into discussing their lives and loves, it's fascinating and equally frustrating to watch the gaucheness between the two. Linklater prefers pragmatism over drama and it's such a comfort because the experience is much more homely that way. Once again, we find a bit of ourselves in the discussions between Jesse and Celine, the conversations becoming more personal, bleak and melancholic. While romance guided the first part, it's missing here as the characters we meet this time again have settled themselves in their lives and their thoughts have matured with them. Though the discussions brush on a lot of topics, I found the one in the café particularly invigorating. The magic lies in how gloriously extemporized they sound, casual and vivifying at the same time.<br/><br/>Though the film is talky, and unapologetically so, the conversations are supremely well-written. They are honest, funny and familiar, rich and charming, illustrative of the issues they touch upon. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy, who contributed to the screenplay, manage to effortlessly express their notions through the writing. ""Before Sunset"" is one of those rare films that work solely because of its prodigious writing, and this is truly a script for the ages.<br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy give remarkable performances, a certain betterment of the ones they gave in the prequel. Though the romance angle is sadly absent this time around, their intuitive chemistry is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I can't say if ""Before Sunset"" is an improvement on its prequel or not but it's definitely more empirical and assured. But like ""Before Sunrise"", it leaves you with the same euphoric feeling, impelling you to invest in the characters and their lives."

He was doing a book tour in Europe and the last stop happened to be Paris. It just so happened that the book signing was a bookshop which was also Celine's favorite. Of course they meet, and then went around Paris the rest of the afternoon until Jesse's plane will be leaving at sunset. As with the first film, we see them talking about how their lives went since that fateful day in Vienna years back. <br/><br/>Julie Delpy (as Celine) did not age too much, but Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) looked significantly older. But the years did not diminish their chemistry with each other. The script by Richard Linklater this time was shorter, more sober, with deeper issues and mature emotion now, compared to the first one which was generally lighter, whimsical, with palpable youthful vibrancy. The transition over the years was perfectly reflected in the words they spoke. Again, we are drawn into their conversation, until that open and puzzling final scene.<br/><br/>OK that is it. I will definitely go watch ""Before Midnight"" when it opens in local theaters next week."

","It's hard for a sequel to live up to it's predecessor. Many times it doesn't manage to capture the essence nor the feelings of the previous movie. But this time, director Richard Linklater, with the help of these two incredible actors (Hawke and Delpy), manage to do the impossible. This movie is as good as, or maybe even better, than Before Sunrise. I don't think it's better because I can't even see one dissociated from the other. Both are needed for a complete experience and one without the other is like bread without peanut butter.<br/><br/>First of, the writing is perfect. It flows naturally between dialogues, and it keeps you interested in the destiny of this couple from start to finish - which is hard in a movie that depends only on the conversation and interactions between two people.<br/><br/>Second, the acting of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their chemistry is almost scary. You feel for them and you relate with them in a certain way that is very rare is movies. In ""Sunrise"", it was palpable that feeling of falling in love.

They are able to portray such longing for true emotional happiness and you can tell throughout that they are not totally content with their current situations. Their first meeting and the circumstances following took a lot out of both of them and hearing them discuss that is both emotional and frustrating. I say frustrating because the first movie makes you root for them so hard that it is tough to see them struggle. The fact that you emotionally feel for the characters is a testament to the brilliant writing, acting, and directing.<br/><br/>Both characters are developed further and we see that they are both searching for more then what they have, they both have images of themselves in their heads that are what they really truly want but are afraid to show, its riveting to see and wondrous to think about.<br/><br/>One thing this installment lacks that the first one had was the magical quality that came along with the fact that these two characters were meeting for the first time. However there are still qualities to this movie that make it unique and enthralling.<br/><br/>The film ends on a note, much like the first one, where you aren't sure what to think and just have to root for the best for the both of them.

I read other reviews about this movie here on IMDb and i must say, they all are matured audiences and who know how to appreciate the class from the mass. The main reason of me liking these movies is because they are not glamorized by the Hollywood (like twilight and many others) aura. This is just just story about a guy and girl who meet for a very brief time and are running out of it.

","How can such a minimalistic story be overflowing with so much emotional connection? I almost find it impossible to comprehend. In 1995, Richard Linklater made Before Sunrise, and it was about how two random people met each other on a train and spent one fantastic night together, knowing that after they parted, they might never see each other again. It's such a harrowing thought. And the characters that the movie focused on—Jesse and Celine—were so natural with each other, so intrigued by every little thing the other said, and so genuinely happy to be in each other's company, that it pained me just as much as it pained them to not know what the future would bring. In many ways they are the perfect couple, and I suppose that's where the connection is. Nine years later, and that connection has only gotten stronger. Much stronger.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is just as much a reintroduction as it is a continuation of its predecessor. Yes, the characters are the same, but after nine years, how similar can they truly be? They've both changed for sure. The question is: how much have they changed? We are now in Paris; Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has published a bestselling book, and it's no surprise what it's about: that one night he spent with Celine (Julie Delpy). He's promoting it in a small, tucked away little bookshop when he spots Celine standing off to one side watching him with longing eyes. He almost stumbles in his speech. At the mere sight of her, he is immediately taken back nine years to that night in Vienna. They decide to meet up after the promotion, and yes, from there they walk and talk, not as young lovers, but as new acquaintances with a history of love.<br/><br/>But they talk about different things. Don't forget, they're nine years older than when they first met. Topics like childhoods and ambitions are no longer important; they are adults now, deep in the working world. And so their conversations match their maturity. We learn that Celine is an activist and that she's deeply passionate about it, and for most of the movie's first half, we are listening to her, just as Jesse is. He's the quiet one; his silence impatiently concealing the euphoria within. We know he's been longing for this moment (he actually made the rendezvous they had planned just before they parted ways in Sunrise; Celine did not). But it's not till the entire movie has run its course that we fully understand just what has happened with our lovebirds over the last nine years.<br/><br/>When I watch Jesse and Celine, it immediately occurs to me how lucky they both are. They're lucky not because they happened upon each other in a train, but because they are both uninhibited in expressing themselves. They have a lot to say. Even when there's silence, their silence is speaking. How often do we yearn for a partner who can talk as much as we'd like them to? Most people are not fond of awkward silences, and so it's almost a miracle that Jesse and Celine have so much to talk about.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke looks older. He doesn't have the long flowing hair and the goatee of nine years ago. His face has wrinkled, but his outlook on life hasn't. His character is still outgoing, but being in Celine's presence again has filled him with a childlike quality. He jokes a lot more and seems to be glued to her side. Julie Delpy, in all honesty (and much to her credit), looks pretty much the same. She's still cute and cheerful, but she seems a bit more serious now. There's a scene in Jesse's chauffeured car where Celine confesses how she truly feels, and we are told that her one night with Jesse didn't have a positive effect on her. She says she's become more empty, and that the past nine years have hollowed out any idea of love and reality that she used to have. Little does she know how crumbled Jesse has been too.<br/><br/>Before Sunset has the same structure as its predecessor, but its characters venture on a different journey. Their motives are different. They are not driven by the blossom of new love, they're driven by the memory of what they once briefly had. It's both a happy and a sad situation. Happy because they are wonderfully happy together. Sad because they can never seem to be with each other for more than a day. And I so want them to be. I want them to be married, and to have children, and to see them converse with their kids as effortlessly as they do with each other. Who knows what would've happened if they had both made their rendezvous. Fate comes into play now. Should, could, would. No one will ever know. All I know is that Before Sunset is a glorious movie, filled with real emotion, real characters, real conversations, real nostalgia, and a really frustrating ending (which ironically almost brought me to tears). Before Midnight, I am waiting for you."

","Just before writing this review, I took a quick look at the Board where people discussed this film's ending. There are so many interesting theories about what might have happened afterwards, and you can see how people are intrigued with the openness of all the questions left unanswered, when the screen turns black. It is not so much about the mystery, but rather provoking people's imaginations and more importantly arousing their own romanticism. I think that, in a way, the people were actually describing what they would do if they were Jesse or Celine. This is what I like the most about this movie (actually both movies), it kind of makes any viewer recognize him or herself in one of the two main characters. Because these characters really can be any one of us. And this concept, in my opinion, is what makes this film a winner - two ordinary people meet in a random place and fall in love. They are not your typical Hollywood love story characters, and that's a good thing as well, because if they were, this film would be as boring as hell. As Celine says when commenting on how long it took Jesse to write the book: ""Wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night."" Both movies are quite uneventful and ordinary, but it's not about events anyway, the characters and the mood alone keep viewers in suspense throughout the picture. In its raw simplicity, both films evade tiring or confusing the viewer, thus making it a lot easier to just give in to the overwhelming emotions.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone (or more precisely, these films; they cannot go one without the other), especially to all romantics out there. And to some others who perhaps don't fancy romance movies, I would say - watch this one anyway, this is not another cheesy love story, but rather a realistic venture that could really represent the life story of any of us. I, for one, know I wouldn't mind if it were mine!"

","Much less of a sequel and much more of a continuation of two people's lives and the trajectories they lead towards each other, Before Sunset is that rarest of films where all the drama occurs not in kinetic action or extravagant sets, but rather in quiet, calm moments on small side streets of Paris through some of the best dialogue ever put on screen.<br/><br/>Indeed, at times it is hard to believe this dialogue was written since it feels so realistic and is delivered so fluently it comes off as real speak as opposed to staged words. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy sparkle as never before, cementing themselves as one of the best screen couples in the history of cinema. The romantic tension is palatable but so are the truths they thrust upon each other. They reveal their deepest of emotions and turmoils, establishing again that connection they found between themselves in one night in Vienna. <br/><br/>Over the course of just over an hour, they do the same again, this time showing how nine years has aged them both physically and emotionally. They seem more relaxed, at ease in one another's presence. Jesse seems to joke a lot more than before, showing a vulnerable side he tried to hide before. By the end, which comes altogether way too fast, they are as connected and in tune as never before, realizing the fate of their paths and the importance of their relationship. Director Richard Linklater marvelously paces the film and the screenplay touches on so many truths and understandings about being a human in the modern world that it is worth watching just for the subjects Jesse and Celine talk about. However, the added bonus is the heart-tugging romance between these two that will stay with audiences forever."

","This movie, Until Sunset is incredible. The way the characters interact, really makes you feel a connection between the characters and hope they find a way to stay together. The chemistry, conversation (and the background scenery) really creates a magical atmosphere. I enjoyed this much more that the first movie, Until Sunrise. It feels much more ""real"" and the bond between the characters comes through much stronger, more emotional and more authenticly. After watchilng Until Sunset, The first movie Until Sunrise feels really ""blah"" compareed to the intenisity of the Until Sunset. You can feel throughout the movie how the characters are still holding themselves back, and not trusting themselves or the other person to express their true emotions, but through the way they speak and body language, you feel that the strong emotions are right below the surface, yearning to be expressed."

","Richard Linklater presents Before Sunset (2004), which is the continuation of the talks that began in his film Before Sunrise (1995).<br/><br/>This time has been nine years since Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met, both now meet again in Paris and talk until the time comes when he must take the plane back home.<br/><br/>The film is narrated in a linear fashion, we follow the two characters as they tour the city and talk, much of this is based on long sequence shots, which makes the film look like it is happening in real time. It is a simple story that is constructed from dialogue with the two characters. This is about second chances, in this case both begin to question themselves if they love to fantasize about the possibility of being together and lament about how fate has separated.<br/><br/>Both the plot and the characters are very human, we handle something as normal as it is a reunion, and through that we have a history.<br/><br/>The two main actors relied on the script, which shows in his performances, then, both know their characters and naturally react to everything and anything that helps the film feel forced and dialogues are very spontaneous.<br/><br/>It's a film that ultimately leaves us wanting more, and that could be frustrating. Shows how the first love never forgets and leaves a big footprint. The fact that long after you return to be with the person you fell in love and know that you only have a few hours before separating again is what affects them the two characters and the richness of the film is to see them bring that situation through almost pure dialogue."

Sometimes, especially in the car, I found Julie Delpy's acting not so good, actually it's as I saw her acting, the movements of her eyes and hands didn't always seem natural. And when she asks for Jesse to not touch her, it seems as if Ethan Hawke waited for this moment in the script to put his right hand next to her for her to push it away. But I never ever felt like Ethan Hawke was not playing well. He's a TaLeNtUoUs actor (and maybe I'm less objective with him because I'm a woman who loves men... :) and I loved every every every mimic he made, every thing was so real, and in tune. Like the way he loses it a bit, he makes that sound of surprise and he's nervous with his hands, when he gets out of the bookshop in the beginning of the movie,... <br/><br/>Maïe, Maïe, Maïe, was it well played!<br/><br/>I can't believe there will be a Before Midnight.

","Quite an engaging gab fest - loved the long dialogue scenes, loved the to and fro, and loved some of the acting. But I think I preferred the first meeting. Sure they were young and naive then, but that gave them an excuse for spouting optimism and romance. Here they're a bit older and wiser and the conversation feels less natural and more forced. The randomly deep insights, while impressive, clash a bit with the other insecurities and awkward jokes. Their current relationship is possibly too stuck in romanticising the original, therefore giving them false expectations of what they have now, but this doubt can probably go down as a plus for the film. A definite minus was some of the occasionally excessive false smiling, which I have to mark up against Ethan."

","What this movie basically is, is a conversation between two character, one guy and a woman talking about life in general, there dreams, society and what they faced etc...But the movie is very interesting and is just entertaining to watch two character just ramble on. The movie is believable and realistic to the point you can't help but buy into it. Although few times I felt it was actors and actresses on screen but most of the way through it felt like real people not characters having real conversations with each other. And that is one of the elements that drives this movie besides the topic of the conversations which is another key element that made this movie good. What other thing that impressed me is the long one take scenes during the conversations since if they screwed up they would have to start that whole long take over again. Sometimes it seems like it compacted a bunch of interesting thoughts about certain stuff into one movie as much as possible but for the most part it's alright. And it also didn't seem all that forced and seemed natural most of the way through to the point it felt like a improv or they winged it. Some of the stuff the characters cover some audiences might agree with and some might not, but it's still interesting conversations that you won't mind listening to. Like how sometimes you might eavesdrop into other people's conversation and be interested in it, this movie is the epitome of that. The chemistry between the two characters was also really good. The ""what if"" aspect to this movie is also very well integrated into this movie. Even if this movie is about two people having conversations you will probably appreciate this movie even more the second time you watch it.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

","The other day I wanted to kill some time and decided to watch a few clips of Before Sunrise and as always ended up watching not only the whole of before sunrise but also before sunset. Before sunrise is the story of Jesse and Celine who meet on a train in Europe. He's nursing a broken heart, she's just on her way back home, he convinces her to get down and spend one day with him in Vienna and they spend the rest of their time together walking and talking. They decide to meet again after six months in Vienna and the movie ends with us feeling exactly like the protagonists, hopeful and that life is full of possibilities.<br/><br/>Cut to nine years later and we meet them again in Before sunset a little older and maybe a little wiser. At the surface it looks like they've both moved on to very successful lives both personally and professionally. He's married and has a little boy and is the author of a bestseller (curiously about a boy and a girl and a day in Vienna), she's moved on to a job in the Greencross and they've both managed to convert their passions into careers. But as they start talking again we see how unhappy they really are. He had turned up in Vienna and she hadn't, he's now stuck in an unhappy marriage and she's having trouble committing emotionally in any relationship. The movie ends with Jesse in Celine's apartment and we're left wondering whether he let her leave his life one more time or did he end up staying this time. I find myself going back to these movies time and again because Richard Linklater, the director, has managed to do something completely magical with these movies. There's nothing majorly dramatic in either film, the most dramatic scene is probably the scene in the car when Jesse is dropping Celine off and their real feelings come to the surface but even that scene is so heart wrenchingly beautiful that you believe every minute of it. It's two days in the lives of two people and thats exactly what it feels like, like looking into someone else's life. I could easily be Celine you could easily be Jesse and you never question what either of them are saying. The movies though no travelogue made me want to go to Paris and Vienna, a feat that I managed to achieve on my recent trip to Europe. Of course my before sunrise didn't quite happen all I got was a very drunk Chinese gentleman on the train who was incredibly happy to be sitting next to me.<br/><br/>But as Celine says it is so difficult to find anyone that you make any real connection with, that you can hold a conversation with that may not change the world but may change you. It's easy to take our relationships for granted, be it friends, a significant other or family. We all do it because it's so difficult to be in the moment and realise that this person, this relationship is significant. I don't know if Jesse and Celine were soul-mates, whether they were supposed to end up together, but I really really hope they did."
"FSfilmblog","10","0","0","15 August 2011"," A worthy Sequel that improves on the original
","The second feature in Richard Linklater's exploration at romantic love in which we are re-united with the characters we were first introduced to, back in 1995, in Before Sunrise. Reprising their respective roles are Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine). We are invited to catch up on their lives 9 years later and straight away we feel like we're catching up with old friends.<br/><br/>For those of you who have not seen the first feature, at the end of that film, both promised to meet each 6 months later but the meeting never took place. Almost a decade later we find Jesse (an author now,who's written a book based on his experiences in Vienna) on the launch of his book in a bookstore in Paris. The film opens up with Jesse explaining his theory and his ideas of his own book. By coincidence Celine happens to be in the very same book store. What follows is a brief encounter where they go to have coffee and converse over matters and topics like their lives and the reasoning why they never got to meet up.<br/><br/>As they wander through the streets of Paris they talk about what had happened, the camera slowly follows them as they talk and catch up on events. This one, like the previous effort, the dialogue and performance is main focal point and drive in the narrative. Issues which both character have passions for, are vocal discussed in an expressive and devoted manner like the environment. In the little time Jesse has before he his flight leaves, they connect like they did before as they come to realise that this sort of connection is a rare thing in life. The way in which they talk is so relaxed and comfortable in feels so effortless and never contrived.<br/><br/>With this film being set almost a decade later it differs from the fact they have moved on and their lives have changed but they realise that there is some chemistry and undeniable attraction towards each other. Gone are the ideals of young love and blossoming relationship, here we see two people reconnecting and finding nothing has changed in what they found so attractive about each other.<br/><br/>What is technical, a remarkable achievement, is the way the film unfolds in very long shots which captures the naturalist and authentic performances in the streets of Paris. The dialogue is as ever, free flowing, witty, entertaining, funny and never feels like they're reading from a script. The writing duties on this film is credited to both leads (and director) which shows their acting never feels like acting, past experiences and events in their real lives seem interwoven into the story. With the ever setting sunset, the film captures an illuminating yellow tint which gives the overall tone and feel a glowing radiant beautiful shine. It feels like a metaphor on their relationship. The sun maybe setting but there is a beautiful glow like the heart beating on and love still resonating.<br/><br/>A journey which unfolds in real time and with two likable actors who portray two people in a very honest and romantic way in picturesque setting of Paris. Little nuances from unspoken words to glances and physical touches all adds to the depth of realism. And in the way in which the film ends, well... maybe there's more to their relationship to discover and more to their journey but when it ends, we left with ""what ifs"" and ""what now"". A tantalising ending, full of promise and hope."

","As online film critic James Berardinelli puts it, Before Sunset is ""one of those exceedingly rare instances in which the motivation for a sequel is creative, not financial."" There, he summarizes in a single, meaningful statement the value this Richard Linklater film has for viewers sophisticated enough to appreciate the artistry of its concept. The sequel to the critically acclaimed Before Sunrise (1995), the aptly- titled Before Sunset may not have the allure and magic of the first film, but it still manages to be fresh in its own unique way.<br/><br/>In Before Sunset, the characters Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet by chance at a Paris bookstore where the former is holding a book-signing session with the press. They take a spontaneous walk down the streets of Paris, enjoy coffee at a café, and take a boat ride before Jesse has to take a flight back home. Unlike in the first film in which they spent an entire day and night together, both characters have only about an hour now to interact and catch up after nine whole years not knowing whether they would meet again.<br/><br/>Before Sunset's story unfolds in real-time. The film's runtime is literally the amount of time that they have together. With the beautiful, and at times, historical backdrop of Paris in the background, we follow the two characters in a number of long takes as we are brought up to speed on the major events that have occurred in their lives for the last decade. While Jesse looks scruffier and Celine more aged, their chemistry with each other remains undeniably strong, though this is characterized by natural awkwardness in the first half-hour.<br/><br/>As shown from their screen writing credit, Hawke and Delpy have apparently worked very closely with Linklater on the crafting of their characters and dialogue. Their naturalistic acting punctuated by moments of improvisation gives the film a-slice-of-reality feeling that remains true to the essence of the director's conceptual vision. Youthful, starry-eyed love as explored in the first film now makes way for themes about responsibility, commitment, marriage, and regrets. In a way, Before Sunset is more pessimistic in outlook, not only seen through the world-weary eyes of its two leads, but its constraint of time also limits the possibility of a second chance at love with ""the one that got away"".<br/><br/>There is a quite potent scene in a car that sees Celine angrily airing her grievances at Jesse, who appears taken aback by her uncharacteristic behavior. It shows that while innately we stay roughly the same, we do change with time, often with a more mature but more cynical lens to view things. Shot at a leisurely pace with dialogue that admittedly does not engage as much as in the first film, Before Sunset is still a quite remarkable document of two highly identifiable characters at the crossroads of their lives, pondering what could have been if circumstances had unfolded differently for them.<br/><br/>If Linklater considers to do another sequel in the next couple of years, it would be more welcomed than not. Otherwise, this two-part filmed romance is enough food for thought for a good night's contemplation of the meaning of love, and all the complexities and subtleties that come with it.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","If someone asked me to give a one-line review of Before Sunset, i would say ""Maximum use of minimum resources."" All praise to Richard Linklater for bringing out a better sequel to his high-critically-acclaimed Before Sunrise. Keeping the essence intact, he brings his brain-children Jesse and Celine to the City of Love, Paris. The dialogs catch the viewers' attention and its a smooth glide from start to end. The performance of the two stalwarts stand out. Ethan Hawke as Jesse Wallace is flawless, but what takes this movie to another height is the bravura performance of Julie Delpy. The sensitive, sometimes erratic woman, Celine, she portrays comes to life and it is like she is giving you a tour of Paris. The screenplay is one of the best of the decade. Richard Linklater, along with his two character leads, Ethan and Julie, wrote the screenplay together that adds the edge. The songs are soothing, especially ""A Waltz For A Night"" and ""An Ocean Apart"". Nina Simone is also paid homage by a mesmerizing mimicry by Julie Delpy. The editing work could have been better. There are a few gaping flaws, or goofs as we know them. I have enjoyed the movie all the three times I watched it. The scenes remain in your head long after it is over."

And then at 10:30 tonight, I'm surfing through cable no-man's land, and -- there it is, at 11:00. On Encore Love.

As he remarks in a conversation in a café, she is skinnier, and not as a criticism of how she was 9 years earlier.

","It would be interesting to know the gestation of this sequel to Before Sunrise, which itself was a lovely film about young love in Europe...why nine years later? Was it partly because director Richard Linklater realized how unsatisfying the ending to the first was? I have to agree with other reviewers that Before Sunset was the better of the two films largely because of the mature emotion involved. Yet, almost like the first film, Linklater leaves a question mark at the end.<br/><br/>Will there be another episode such as After Sunset....in the mood of the Age of Innocence? The only real flaw I found in the first film was it's unrealistic ending. And, I think Linklater must have realized this, too. That's why in Before Sunset he makes reference to it a couple of time: No phone number or address.<br/><br/>But Sunset reveals, especially in Julie Delphy's performance, a depth of emotion about lost love and redemption, seldom seen in American films. This depth is best exhibited in the SUV cab ride they share.<br/><br/>Both Ethan Hawke and Delphy act out of their shoes in this film, a film about two life's loves, lost and then found.

","Ethan Hawke is Richard Linklater. That may sound sort of weird but let's see: Richard Linklater's personal experiences were the inspiration for Before Sunrise (apparently he met a woman at a toy shop in 1989, from the IMDb trivia: the idea for the movie came from a night Richard Linklater spent walking around Philadelphia with Amy, a woman he met). Of course the fictionalized version ended being the film so we can say Hawke, as Jesse, is Linklater but also, and this take us to Before Sunset, Jesse will do or better said did just what Linklater did that is fictionalize a personal experience. I love the way Before Sunset begins: Jesse is in Paris at a book store talking about his book, a fictionalized version of a personal experience, when he met a French woman on a train and spent the night with her. Linklater may had to answer the same questions the journalists asks to Jesse, they wonder if the book is based on personal experiences, they wonder about what happened to its characters so when Jesse confirms the fact that his book is based on a personal experience the question is ""Jesse, did you see her again?"". So in the film there are characters that wonder the same that us the people who is seeing the film, and we only see few but Jesse's bock is actually is best- seller yet we are the only ones who will know everything yet this sequel ain't any kind of conclusion, actually here we don't see plans, there's nothing like a ""how about six months?"" thing.<br/><br/>Some weeks ago I finally saw one of the most acclaimed films from Linklater, ""Sunrise"" certainly, and as I wrote in my IMDb comment of it took me a lot to finally check it out since I always had the feeling it was not going to be really my cup of tea but after seeing it I was mostly glad, it isn't really a masterpiece for me or one of my favourites from Linklater but I sure like it. Its sequel, released back in 2004, on the contrary was an instant ""wanted film"", and in the end I liked more this one, not really much more but overall if someday I watch again just a half of the 3 or so hours romance from Linklater I would like to watch again this half, however I don't see that day in a near future."

","Before Sunset is the absolutely beautiful sequel to Before Sunrise, two films by Richard Linklater starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both movies focus on two very interesting characters, an American (Hawke) and a French woman, when they meet at junctures in their lives.<br/><br/>In the first movie they meet for the very first time on a train and take a whimsical walk around the streets of Vienna. It's about discovering a place, memories, love and relationships, all of which are pieced together with beautiful dialogue and a fantastic story.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is the sequel, set and filmed nine years after original. This time it follows the couple around the streets of Paris, and amazingly the dialogue surpasses the beauty of the previous movie. The cinematography is passive, yet intensive, which only enhances the stunningly crafted monologues. The couple meander, discussing what happened on that night all those years ago and how their lives have been influenced by their encounter.<br/><br/>The dialogue is mesmerising - a real insight to both sides of emotion and love. I recommend watching 'Before Sunrise' before watching 'Before Sunset' to fully appreciate the magical journey of this romantic masterpiece."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","8 May 2007"," An impressive addition to Before Sunrise as Linklater proves once again that he has what it takes when a script is needed to carry a film.
","I purposely waited over a space of about 11 months in-between viewing Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (they were after all made nine years apart) in order to create some sort of feeling; some sort of atmosphere; some sort of reaction. Although this tactic required patience and tolerance, I feel it actually worked in a way. What made it a reality is when you first get a glimpse of the character of Celine (Delpy) and then Jesse's (Hawke) hilarious reaction. I myself recently met up with someone who means rather a lot to me; I hadn't seen her for the best part of a year and although our rendezvous was actually planned; Before Sunset's encounter really was all about the girl seeking out the guy and surprising him in the shop so although I can't relate to Jesse's surprise as he wasn't expecting her; I can relate to his emotions of reunion.<br/><br/>I mentioned in my review of Before Sunrise the feeling of luck and chance that was evident (and pretty much acted as the theme for the film) and also the atmosphere of 'fly on the wall' film-making  it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in an English speaking film before but Before Sunset feels more cinematic; it feels more like it's a film with a setting, characters and a script but I do not mean this as criticism it merely proves what a good director Linklater is when it comes to his own universe of films. If he had done what he did before with Before Sunset, he would have pretty much made the same film as he did nine years ago and that wouldn't have been good.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film more than its elder brother is the feeling that we know the characters and I felt more settled with the exchanges flying to and fro. The characters repeat to one another what they've done in the nine years in-between films without actually showing it meaning you have to listen to catch up. This happens quite early on and thus; draws you in immediately as a film that's dialogue driven like this one has to have the audience hooked from the start and the back stories are a great piece of nostalgia; not only for the characters but also for us: the viewers who also want to know what's happened to them.<br/><br/>When these two people talk, they deal with issues only people who know each other or have shared something very special together can talk about. In the first film; these issues that revolve around first loves, what you look for in a partner, etc. were dealt with in a rather colloquial manner that I found a little odd as they'd only really known each other for half an hour and had only met on a train through a chance encounter, but here it fits perfectly since they actually know, remember and probably love each other.<br/><br/>The film makes good use of its location in Paris as it did in Before Sunrise with Vienna and it really doesn't seem like its only 77 minutes short. The long takes and nothing-ness dialogue make it so that it feels like the whole day goes past but again, this isn't a bad thing as it's 'this kind of film'. If you can look past the way the characters overreact nearer the end and some of the 'filla' in the script at various times; you'll find a film that comes close to adding a new definition to the genre of 'Romantic/Comedy'."

What makes this movie interesting is that these two characters just simply discuss about everything, something which is just normal for people to talk about and they don't hold onto one subject, as the subject of their conversations changes all the time. It just makes the movie so real and you forget about all the acting, it's like that those two characters would in fact be real persons and not made up ones. This brings me to the dialog, which is by far one of the best ones I've seen on screen, it just feels so real. The flow between the conversations, the whole dialog, is just fantastic.<br/><br/>The movie lasts for 1 hour and 20 minutes, which feels like the whole plot is based on that lenght, it's just so flowing. I mean it's like the two characters would actually hang around for just one hour and those 20 minutes. They just move from one place to another and there is no other characters interrupting their conversations or anything, the whole movie just focuses on the two characters which have this certain tension between them. There is no other essential characters, which is kinda intelligent, or at least for me. I like to think that Jesse is more of an aggressive type between the conversations of the characters, though they're both are feeling a bit ashamed in a certain level, because of what happened 9 years before. Jesse's making these references to for example sex and the night which they spent together 9 years ago and so is Celine, but not as much as Jesse, who quickly changes the references to fooling around and joking, using it as a certain self-defense. Or at least that is what I think of it.<br/><br/>There isn't one single unnecessary scene in this movie, every scene is there for a reason, which brings me to the conclusion that the screenplay's just excellent. Though the movie is a romantic drama, it isn't cliché at all, so I can recommend this movie to everyone. It's original, interesting and entertaining in its own way and it is a surprisingly pleasant movie to watch although there isn't actually anything mind breaking happening, just a movie about normal people in normal circumstances and it just does it so realistically. Just great."

","Being 40 I was surprised to still have the ability to be a hopeless romantic. This is always welcome. If you do have this ability you will love the film. If you like an intelligent script with great acting skills you will also like this film. Julie played superb and she closed the film in such great style that you simply couldn't avoid to enjoy happiness with Ethans character. Ethan, if you ever read this, please find more films of this kind. You give us a nice break for us seeing you in a strong character role instead of having some form of FBI agent character. One other actor has that affinity and funny enough he is said to be a close friend of yours.<br/><br/>I see this film like a tribute to simple nostalgia (especially in this high running lifestyle we all live in), a tribute to the ability for us, no matter how old we are, to pick up a lifeline we have left and more importantly, a tribute to the kind of film making which I almost though was disappeared. Bravo.<br/><br/>I do find myself as an emotional film critic because very few films do get my respect and result afterward in a personal session analyzing it. Wonderful not to see all the special effects, irritating one liners and simply use the intense conversation between two strong individuals. A conversation which is following the course of nature. You could almost use the famous film quote: ""You got me at hello"". When these two people meet, the question was more when then if. Being so obvious this didn't by any means destroy the true plot of the film. The plot to follow the unavoidable fact that when we encounter something so right for us, we do grab it and seize it without having any scruples and success in our life's.<br/><br/>Great film.

","This movie came as a pleasant surprise to me as I had never seen Before Sunsrise and did not know what to expect. It is nothing at all like the romantic comedies that are coming out of Hollywood these days. After seeing this i went straight out and both the DVDs for both the films.<br/><br/>It is a movie about relationships and the talks you have with your girlfriend but it never once felt like you were watching a movie. It seemed just like a video of days that I spent with my girlfriend... unfortunately not in the beautiful locales of Paris.<br/><br/>I thought the actors were so natural... it did not look as if they were acting at all strolling around the locales of Paris conversing as if they have been together for years rather than meeting for the first time in years. Julie Delpy was especially good with that French lilt to her English. Excellent chemistry between the lead pair, i guess the history they had with the previous movie helped.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER : Many standout scenes but I don't want to spoil it so do watch the movie. I loved the ending as well... some may find it ambiguous with no closure but it leaves it all to the imagination.<br/><br/>A wonderful little movie .... do watch it if you get the chance."

","Like its predecessor, Before Sunrise is one of those movies full of commentary on everyday life. Nothing heavy handed, just line after line of brilliant observation put into simple terms. If you're the kind of person with strong memories and consider yourself a product of your own mind this movie will appeal to you. Some won't care for the lack of apparent action but they're missing the point. There is plenty going on here. Though the dialogue is rich it only serves as an undercurrent. It casts no light on what's really going on here yet through it you see its shadow. Short and sweet. It even ended exactly when I thought ""it should end right now."" What happens next? Who knows? I like that it answers almost nothing, just like in the first film (except for all the big unknowns from the first film!)"

","Finally got around to seeing this, as I usually have an aversion to sequels. Where the original ended in Wien in 1994 this picks up in Paris 2003. Celine (Julie Delpy) still has the quirkiness, beauty, and naive honesty of nine years before as well as the non-stop articulate rapport and repartee with Jesse (Ethan Hawke).<br/><br/>Because of the depth of conversation there is no sense of soap opera about it. They still philosophize about life and circumstance. Jesse is back in Paris promoting a book about meeting Celine (a touch of post-modern self-consciousness), and has a few hours with her as she explains why she never showed up in Wien for the date. What bothers me about it is not simply that they didn't get each others' numbers in ""Before Sunrise"", but if she was that serious and couldn't make it she could have had a messenger or someone in Wien meet him or SOMETHING.<br/><br/>Anyway it starts out predictable, but quickly takes some interesting emotional turns. Though the ending is technically open, you can easily guess the rest.<br/><br/>I know they made a sequel to ""A Man and a Woman"" which I never saw, but no way could it live up to the original as this one does to its original."

","One of the most charming films in many years, Before Sunset gives love a second chance with two enormously believable actors in their original roles. Reprising the roles of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), the story takes up 9 years after they parted in Vienna after a one night stand, and the failed plans to meet again in 6 months, a semi-broken promise. But, for the couple, their paths cross again when author, Jesse winds up his publicity tour in Paris, and Celine, the environmental activist, attends his reading at Shakespeare and Co.<br/><br/>If Paris is for lovers, the city is the stage for the duo to cruise its afternoon haunts and river as they catch up with their lives that have gone in diverse successful but unfulfilled directions. Celine follows her career to help environmental causes, but her heart remains closed and unwilling to open to another failed relationship. Jesse married his college girlfriend and has a child, but his dreams of something more still bring the memory of his unresolved relationship with Celine to his sleeping hours. What if is always seductive and so the reunited couple discuss what seems least important and hurtful in an effort to avoid the regret that seems to envelop them at every sentence. <br/><br/>The notion of a second chance with the one who got away is every middle age and older individual's daydream, yet so few adults get an opportunity to have their dream come back in their life. <br/><br/>With an abandonment of youthful pretext, the mature Celine and Jesse admit how the other was the innocent and most intriguing moment for them. However, they failed to act with foresight beyond youthful exuberance. In hindsight, they are both wounded or unfulfilled having failed to achieve what they held as the most personal goals -- that of meeting again with the lost love. Richard Linklater creates an enjoyable and mature film of resolution and renewal as the story of Celine and Jesse begins and ends at the exact right moment to leave audiences satisfied. <br/><br/>Using both the on screen chemistry of his actors and the perfect timing of their storyline to resume the characters next move, Before Sunset is perhaps one of those rare films that is a better film than the first installment. It picks up right where it should with characters who have grown as individuals and through life's adventures, might grow more as their story continues to unfold.<br/><br/>One need not view Before Sunrise to enjoy Before Sunset and the aging of its actors is both right and enjoyable. Hawke is not a boyish student, and Delpy is seductive with a French confidence that exudes sexy. The film's locations, dialogue, and music is just right for anyone who wants to step in the shoes of Jesse and Celine, and perhaps, take the next steps along their crossed new path."

","I only discovered Before Sunrise quite a few years after it first came out, and absolutely loved it - the dialogue is superb, and you get so attached to Celine and Jesse that it's hard to let go at the end of the movie, without knowing what will happen...but after a while you realise that the frustrating ending allows you to imagine whatever future you wish for them - so it's a beautiful gift from the writers, the actors and the director, that you get to ""own"" the characters for a while longer once the credits roll....<br/><br/>Which is why I was petrified when I found out there would be a sequel - it seemed the first movie was perfect as a stand-alone piece...Out of curiosity - OK, and also because of a minor crush on Ethan Hawke - I watched Before Sunset after all and was pleasantly surprised. Sure, you have to give up on your own romantic notions of ""what happened next"" - but it's lovely to meet the characters again and find out about their stories...It's a very honest account of what happens in real life and in that way, it makes the first movie even more special as well, because it stops being about the fantasy of a chance encounter, and becomes even more credible.<br/><br/>In the end, both romantics and cynics can find something to like about Before Sunset - and fans of Before Sunrise cannot be disappointed by this sequel."

","I really liked this movie. It was like being present in a two old friends reunion. It is mandatory to watch the first movie before this one because this is kind of an epilogue of their first encounter. Of course, this film does not stand up to the first one, but for those who loved the characters of Before Sunrise, it is like rediscover old friends and actually know what life has brought them to. Also, it has a connection with my life, as I watched the first movie when it was released several years ago, and I have grown up as a person as the characters in the film, so the basic topics they chatter about, growing older and becoming more cynical and skeptical about relationships and love, are familiar to me. I do not usually like open endings, but, in this case, I think it was justified, I really like the idea of them getting together and living happily ever after, but as the film shows us, there are many discrepancies between these two that it is very unlikely that this might happen. Maybe we will know what happened, in a future movie."

","So, here's my take on what happens next after this movie ends: Jesse and Celine make love, passionately, in every corner of her apartment, until the following morning at about five-thirty. Jesse writes Celine a tortured, ""we both knew we couldn't be together"" note on her telephone message pad, pins it to the 'fridge with a magnet, and disappears out into the damp Paris pre-dawn to call the valet and get a lift to the airport for a later flight. Why do I feel all of this so strongly? Well, it works on the same logic as Helen Hunt's character not getting back together with Chuck at the end of Cast Away: Clearly Jessee loved, has loved, loves, and will always love Celine -- but the movie makes it equally clear that, as much as they are mourning the missed opportunity in Vienna, they are also mourning the loss of their own youth; and one of the hallmarks of losing one's youth is that you start to choose responsibilities over passions. If the next sequel doesn't open with them having another chance meeting after having not seen each other for another nine years, I'm going to cry foul. I mean, come on: they're in their thirties now -- they know better than to start permanently mucking-up each others' lives."

Yet that one message interprets into so many different forms to each audience. But if we all came together, we'll realize love exists in so many forms but there's only one love.<br/><br/>That's what I felt after the film.

","Well, isn't this what life and love are all about? Consider the dynamics of two characters with an obvious untold passion for one another and you have the makings of a dynamic and intimate exchange of the heart. This movie is not big on special effects and mundane for those who desire visual excitement, but therein is the essence of a human drama which takes place on the streets of Paris, a coffeshop, a tourist's boat, and a chauffeured vehicle ride to a quaint apartment.<br/><br/>My first play of this movie was less than interesting; on re-play, I paid closerattention to the dialog between the two persons played by Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy .. and hence was almost bored on the first viewing; but the second time around I finally watched closely the conversation between two people ... it so reminded me of my dating relationship .. that I began to identify with the character .. it could have been my story, and, perhaps it is all of ""our"" stories as we pursue that special person in love and life.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy pulls off a strikingly warm and witty performance, very much in control of the conversation and the dialog. A good use of camera-close ups pulls the viewer into her eyes and smile and ... soon she's your girl .. the one you desire, the one who erases the stresses and deadlines of the day.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke depicts a character who is the faithful husband, father and an accomplished author/romance novel writer .. his first encounter with Delpy is but nine years before and they have gone separate ways .. experienced different loves .. and yet the chemistry of their relationship is about to ignite in this touching and heart-felt exchange of commentary. <br/><br/>One quickly sees an arresting chemistry between two ordinary and yet complicated people who have learned that life is never simple; and love is fleeting .. the honesty with which they exchange their world views .. and more importantly their personal desires is what draws the viewer into the dialog. We learn, sometimes in Griffie language, of hurt, pain, and wantings of the heart ... <br/><br/>This is a movie that warrants a close inspection of the dialog; and while the clues are all there ... it is not until the ending that you see the pieces come together. Adult situations without Griffie sex -- a thinking person's movie. Those who have lived and lost in love will appreciate how the message is articulated; those who've never loved, probably won't get it .. but are destined to learn the lesson another way."

It's the simplicity of a sudden friendship, the development on spontaneity is making' characters. The development of these characters are good, it's a joy seeing them, 'cause Jesse en Celine together match the character dialog, the subjects in the story. When they're sad or happy, the spectator's mood changes depending on their aura.<br/><br/>An action movie is much easier than this, but this is pure dialog, not even a psychological game play. The dialog is fluently and it changes believable.

The movie is very talky and sometimes wanders dangerously into pretension, but nevertheless reaches beauty and profundity frequently against a stunning Parisian backdrop. What could be better? Before Sunrise was a bit too wide eyed and romantic for me, but Before Sunset hits melancholy notes that ring true with every bittersweet insight. The screenplay, written by the director and the two leads, is a gem and is realized with conviction and sensitivity by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who have never been better in my opinion. Love is all too evident between Jesse and Celine, and we are privileged to share the experience."

","After reading a number of the negative reviews, I was expecting a real stinker, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the naysayers are, in my opinion, off the mark. ""Before Sunset"" is a fairly good movie, if not as absorbing as ""Before Sunrise."" The first flick had one thing going for it and that was the young Julie Delpy as Celine. In the sequel, she is older, thinner, and (if possible) sexier, adding a degree of sophistication and a greater sense of style to her youthful beauty and innocence. Despite having become rather cynical and pessimistic, she carries herself with more confidence and has developed her talents, which she illustrates at the conclusion of the film when she sings the song she wrote for Jessie about their night in Vienna. After hearing that, he wasn't going anywhere, at least, not for awhile longer. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke as Jessie has matured and perhaps become slightly less annoying, but the last decade has definitely taken its inevitable toll. The long wavy locks of his youth are gone, replaced by a sort of unkempt, quasi-butch haircut that doesn't suit him very well. Otherwise, he has neatened up his appearance considerably. Older and presumably wiser, he is still arrogant, yet is now more pretentious and has become rather flip and deceptive, while both he and Celine are cigarette smokers. That's something of a turnoff, especially in her case. The dialog is occasionally interesting when they are not shoveling a complete load, yet the tension of their meeting after so many years apart is palpable. The scene in the car, in particular, is a catharsis, at least for Celine. Finally, she gets good and angry with Jesse (the dope), then almost crying, reveals how much she is hurt by the way he has gone on with his life, suddenly showing up as if he could squeeze her love into his busy itinerary (a second time) without any commitment to their future. His answer, designed to temporarily unburden himself of the baggage he has brought along, I found to be slickly self-serving and somewhat cloying. How that young fool could have been absent as the lovely Celine lived out her twenties and lost the edge of her youth is utterly beyond me, but (we are to believe) that's life. The ending, as such, is somewhat more hopeful than the conclusion of the first movie. At least Jessie is willing to miss his plane in order to sleep with Celine one more time, but one suspects that is all he will do, even considering her beautiful song, in which she confesses that he will own her heart until she dies. I suspect it is wasted on Jessie, who remains a self-absorbed jerk. Hopefully, there will be another flick concluding the series and somehow resolving the dilemma in which they now find themselves, if that is possible."

However, a second glance will prove all first impressions wrong.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are natural before the camera - they slip into the lives of Jesse and Celine so essentially that you can't see the boundaries between actor and character.<br/><br/>The music, with three songs performed by the talented Julie Deply, is equally astounding. I found myself re-watching the movie just to listen to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The script, written by the director and the lead actors, is amazing. I love the fact that the actors, the closest people to the characters, had great parts in the composing of their own text. In this way, the words are more natural, closer to the personalities of the characters themselves. Jesse and Celine are ordinary people, and yet they aren't. They're normal, in the sense that they lead lives and discuss utter randomness that becomes meaningful in the manner that it is spoken. They are extraordinary because they have each other, two chance encounters that can be played out only on film. But that's what movies do - they capture the extraordinary. And that's what sets this one apart from the rest - the sprinkle of surreal in a sea of the ordinary. And what a beautiful sea it is!<br/><br/>Needless to say, one of my favourites."

","I liked Before Sunrise a lot. It spoke to me, at the time, of recently remembered times in my youth, when travelling in Europe, I met, and spent time with someone and then parted never to see them again. The important thing is, it spoke to me. Most movies don't. I've never taken part in a mission to deflect a comet from a collision course with Earth. I've never battled zombies while besieged in a deserted shopping mall... you get the picture. Movies are very often about escapism, but Before Sunrise was about real life.<br/><br/>These fond memories of Before Sunrise kept me from seeing Before Sunset for a long time. I didn't want to spoil a happy memory. But now I've seen it, I regret waiting.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is a masterwork, as its IMDb rating (8.4 at time of writing) affirms. The acting is so natural it is impossible at times to believe that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are acting. While both of these actors are perfectly acceptable, in these two movies they shine. And the near ten-year gap between the movies brings out a new assuredness and maturity in their performances. <br/><br/>But it is the dialogue that really sets this movies apart, not least because that's all there is really. OK, there is a pleasant meander through the streets of Paris, but the camera rarely wanders from the action. And the action is the words, the expressions and the body language of the two leads. Tarantino is celebrated for his dialogue, but to my ears it is clichéd, bombastic and comic-book in style. Here the dialogue flows like a real conversation, it is almost impossible to believe that it is not really the excited outpourings of re-united lovers. Never do they put a foot wrong, never is it awkward, or forced, or unbelievable.<br/><br/>The movie tells a story of a tentative re-union, each afraid the other will have forgotten their past tryst, each afraid that it will have meant less to the other than to them. Slowly, gently, they discover that each holds it dearly, they also discover that the special connection between them is still there. They recriminate tenderly over past mistakes, and then they reveal the very core of themselves to each other... the gaping chasm of yearning below their seemingly content exterior facades. <br/><br/>If there is a single person in whom this movie does not strike a resonance, I think that person still has some living to do."

","Julie and Ethan do a great job of pulling off long scenes with intricate dialog while still legitimately being in the moment. After seeing this DVD several times, I can see the work they did as actors slowly building towards the end.<br/><br/>Take a look at the movie with the sound low if you'd like to see how they evolve in their more ""animal"" selves -- as actors they do great work with flashes of mood in their faces and in their body language. <br/><br/>It's interesting also to see scenes from the original movie in flashback. Before my wife and I saw Before Sunset, we rented Before Sunrise. I'd recommend that to anyone interested in seeing this movie.<br/><br/>One final comment: Notice how little music is in the movie. The lack of a score allows you to actually experience the movie the way you want to, without a director/composer suggesting how you ought to be feeling about it. That's a brave move for any movie."

","To finish up the story 10 years ago, it's not easy to play it beautifully. This film certainly has done it.<br/><br/>One of the best film ever. Romantic yet so touching. So easy going but real. People can relate to the characters, the story so easily. That's why it touches me so much. Feels like it describing my last ten years or the ten years ahead. It is amazing! Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are great in the movie. They have played the feeling of odd when first met again and the 'can't miss this again' at the end so well. <br/><br/>I also love the last song of the film by Nina Simone. Takes a genius to put that song on the ending. Just brilliant!"

Where would I have gone that I haven't? Would I have turned out healthier or happier? Would that obscure object of my desire turned out to be a dream or a nightmare?

","I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I didn't expect very much, I had only heard good things this movie but not enough to know what I was going into. This movie surprised me a lot. It's a beautiful film with excellent acting. The film is brilliant crafted, the moving camera just follows them walking in the city. Very simpel. But so effectful, because you just begins to follow them too. And that is the actors fault, they play their characters so heartfelt. It just seems like we're looking at Ethan and Julie. The story is again very simple. They meet again.<br/><br/>This film makes you in a good mood. Because it's so subtle and sweet and loving. It's easy to love and easy to hate. People that hates this film might think it's boring. I don't think so because it's a fascinating film because of it's simple approach to filming the film. Only when the characters are sitting or standing still the camera is steady. That is what the film do so great. Because it let's the viewer be the camera. You are camera, you just follow them..<br/><br/>Personal I got inspiration from this to make with this kind of moving camera effect. Not exactly the same way but I hope it has the same effect.<br/><br/>To people that haven't seen film yet, see it and enjoy it, let yourself follow these two characters talking and walking in the city of Paris. I really people should see this film..."

","There are a lot of sequels out right now, and normally the major concern is, will this one hold a candle to the original? In this particular case, ""Before Sunset"" does not hold a candle to the original. It does not have to, since it IS the original. If I have never seen the first on, and only saw this, I would still think it is one of the most masterfully movies ever made. Yet, it is hard not compare the two in the context of the change of the characters. And even though the ""younger"" version was maybe more about romantic, this one has more of a sense of urgency. The whole movie, they had a lot less time to catch up than the last time, so they have to get more out in the open in shorter time, being more cautious adults this time. This is probably one of the few films your don't really have to see the original before. I know many people will disagree, but I compare it to listening a foreign opera with no subtitles: enjoy the emotion, understanding will come later. And as a side note, both the director and the stars (Delpy and Hawke) are producers and writers, which is yet another reason to see this film."

The characters grew old but they are still the same persons we met nine years ago. They made a great job with the dialogs and the background. It's like meet two old friends after a long time.

","This movie has had more of an impact on me personally than any other movie Ihave ever scene. Having said that, I believe that objectively, this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. I don't know if I would consider this a sequel, but if so, this is truly one of those rare gems that is benefited from the original, and in my opinion, overshadows the original.<br/><br/>First, the story works so well because of the genuine chemistry between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). This can be attributed not only to the genuine performances of the two leads, but also to the fact that the back story is already established in the previous film. Before Sunrise, which tells the tale of how these two met, how they connected, and how they made a promise to reunite, essentially serves as a detailed and rich first act, and therefore no time was needed to be allotted to establishing their chemistry in the Sunset. We are already invested in their relationship from the opening frame.<br/><br/>Second, this movie serves as a testament to human nature, how people's views change, and the little inconsistencies that make us who we are. In the Sunrise, Celine establishes that she believes in reincarnation; in Sunset, she asserts that she does not. Is this inconsistency an oversight on the part of the writers. I think not. I think these writers know these characters, and their history, so well. Rather, I think that this change in thought reflects the change contemplated in the character-- and is consistent with her, ""I don't believe in anything anymore"" speech in the limo.<br/><br/>I can go on and on. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over, and pick up something new each time."

","I watched it last night straight after 'Before Sunrise' ... the first time I'd seen either. An excellent movie that celebrates life and love without the Hollywood treatment ... I thought it very real and believable, the characters, the conversations etc. and has been mentioned elsewhere, the obvious chemistry between the two. A refreshing change to see 'intelligent conversation' the centrepoint of a movie ... the desire to get to know another intimately thru questions and answers, and the toing and froing banter between them. I loved the duologue (except for a few crudities them seemed out of place and unnecessary), the observations about the big things and little things of life, and the way conversation flowed so naturally between them. The camera shots gave us plenty of time to observe the nuances in their facial expressions (and appreciate Julie Delpy's beauty). The enthusiastic awkwardness of their initial meeting ... the developing relationship with time as each other's lives are revealed ... very well handled. Hmmm ... think I preferred the first movie even more, for it's novelty etc., but this one was a pearler as well ... well done to all involved for coming up with another great script and performances."

It was last week I got to see ""Before Sunrise"" again and watched ""Before Sunset"" a week later. I enjoyed ""Before Sunrise"" even more and found the sequel so much better than expected. The skills in writing, directing and acting the story of an ""impossible love"" has never been done with as much perfection as these two films together and Richard Linklater has all of my respect and admiration. This is an incredibly deep, philosophical story about Life and Love, excellently portrayed by Jesse and Celine. It is certainly not a film to everybody's taste, depending on life experience and age, and ten yrs ago I cannot say for certain I would have appreciated these films as much.

"rbhands","9","0","0","15 April 2005"," Simplistically Original
","First to begin with , I was personally enthralled with the role Ethan Hawke played in the award winning film 'Training Day'.I developed a certain penchant for his character in that very film and his method of acting in general.And so as soon as I heard about this movie (mind you i never heard of the first one in 1995) i immediately got it. <br/><br/>Amidst all the chocolaty romantic bull which usually hits the screen this movie was by far THE BEST ROMANTIC FILM i have seen i.e. even if you can categorise the film as a romantic one. In my opinion Richard Linklater (Director) has done a beautiful job in maintaining a parody with 'Unity of Time and Place ', which is usually a parameter in theatre.The film more than elaborating romance between the two characters explores the helplessness of them both . Separated by time and distance the conversations between Hawke and Deply are a glaring reality of society today. Over the past 9 odd years both seemed to have moved poles apart in terms of lifestyles as Hawke is married (rather unhappily i feel) while Deply is more freelancing than anything else. But what connects the two of them on screen so well is their underlying hate for a 'submissive relationship'. Much more than the meandering conversations the location chosen and shot is PERFECT. The stereotypical characters of Jesse and Celine have give original performances, free of any acting guidelines. At the end of the movie a feeling of nostalgia, hits you whether of the past you have already experienced , or the future which may very soon be your past!.<br/><br/>Brilliant script and memorable acting makes this movie a must watch."

","I was way too young to see Before Sunrise when it was originally released in 1995, but I rented it about a year ago and was blown away by it, bought it and proceeded to get my friends obsessed with it. So when I heard that Richard Linklater was making a follow-up to it, I was extremely excited and anxious (and I didn't even have to wait for 10 years between movies!). As much as I liked Before Sunrise, I think I like Before Sunset even more...the characters are so real-life it's almost scary and Delpy, Hawke and Linklater deserved their Oscar nomination for best screenplay, the dialog was so natural and realistic it didn't even seem scripted (and that's a huge compliment). The acting was phenomenal, for a film, shot in real time, involving only 2 characters walking through Paris talking about nothing and everything it held my attention and I think that was due in large part to Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who I forgot were acting and almost believed were really their characters. This movie isn't flashy or loud or anything like that, it doesn't try to convey some huge philosophical message, it's just two people who met each other once and are now trying to make up for all the things in their lives they couldn't do with each other...so normal and sad and hopeful. If you enjoy dialog driven, character based films this movie comes highly recommended...definitely 10 out of 10."
"DarrenHorne","10","0","0","6 April 2005"," Before Sunset and Sunrise are Masterpieces and reviewed together here.
","Before Sunrise is one of those films you stumble across by accident, and it this unexpected confrontation with excellence that causes the audience to experience that shakabookoo moment; that Swift Spiritual Kick to the Head That Alters Your Reality Forever. Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they ""kind of like"" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away. In this film a guy meets a girl on a train, they talk about nonsense as is the norm, but instead of saying goodbye and obsessing about what might have been the guy takes the leap of faith and convinces the girl to spend the next 14 hours exploring Vienna with him. <br/><br/>Already we see perfection; already this movie is a masterpiece. Is it Ethan Hawke's scruffy American backpacker Jesse that reels us in, or the sexy Celine played by Julie Delpy? I say ""played by"" but there is no ""play"" in this film, there is no performance or representation. In this film the actors achieve such a level that this is nothing other than the ""real"", the dialogue is of a couple exploring one another, the action is the terrified adolescent that hides in every adult, terrified of saying the wrong thing that may cause a loved one to disappear out of their life forever. <br/><br/>The beauty of this enchanting film is how the actors communicate what is often unsaid, suggesting that they are about to say something, or make a joke, but think better of it. Vulnerable glances are exchanged; tentative gestures of affection are made. This is the truest representation of a couple meeting, and through conversation realising that they have met their soul mate, ever committed to film. <br/><br/>It is heartbreaking to watch the impetuousness of youth dictate that the exchanging of phone numbers is a waste of time, for in youth we wrongly feel that their will be many that we connect with on such a spiritual level. The final moments of the film leave the audience perplexed, with an overwhelming desire to KNOW what happens next. It is a stroke of luck to come across this film after the sequel has been released, for to wait the nine years for Before Sunset to be released would be an exquisite form of torture. <br/><br/>In the sequel we see the couple bump onto each other once more, and quite rightly we soon see that both carry scars from their original encounter. The memories of that one perfect night have been encased in crystal and romanticised, so that no future encounter would ever live up to that experience. There is but one option for these playthings of Cupid, they have to explore a complete relationship with one another. <br/><br/>As each scene unfolds we look to our watch, counting down the time in which these obvious soul mates have to discover they are made for one another. Early on we feel safe, they are re-acquainting themselves with what once was, playing poker for lovers, in which cards are held close to their chest. But this cannot be maintained, and it is in Jesses company limo that we are truly dragged back into the narrative, fully committed to their relationship when Celine breaks down, screaming about the repercussions that evening had for her; when you have experienced that true connection with another person, everything else is dull in comparison. <br/><br/>Again we check our watch, what will happen? Can we endure another departure as in Before Sunrise? The characters are now more mature and world weary; life is taking its toll. Now in their thirties they have an appreciation for each other that was lost in Venice. They have seen more of the world and realised no comparison can be made to that one night they shared together. Priorities are quickly re-arranged. What is life for? What is important? The sequel is snatched moments, fighting against a clock that continuously haunts them. Sometimes we scream for them to be truly honest with each other, to throw off their responsibilities and engulf themselves in their love, other times we fear that their lives will pull them apart, locked into an existence of wondering what could have been. <br/><br/>The ending of Before Sunset is perfection, and should be held up as a pinnacle of film making. A scene that is so unexpected and yet so correct, that if your reaction is a cheer, a tear or a jeer, you will know in your heart that it was right, and sit looking at the screen analysing and exploring all of the ""what ifs?"" that the characters will now face. <br/><br/>The true charm of the film is not what the characters are experiencing, but the level to which every viewer will project their own life onto the screen, contemplating whether they are with the right partner, or whether at some point in the past they should have spoke up, or allowed time for that special someone. The universal response on viewing this film will be a deep down, soul aching desire to watch yet another sequel in another nine years time. Any film that can haunt its audience in this way is deserving of its title of Masterpiece."

","The one thing that struck me about this movie was that it relied solely on the characters to drive it along. There was no real plot (accept for that of the lurking flight home). However this did not affect the movie at all because the characters were so strong. The two actors, Hawke and Delpy, played the characters magnificently. There was such a real sense of longing to be together, but a knowledge that it could never be. They seemed to have been holding back with each other throughout the film, as if they didn't want to truly share their feelings. <br/><br/>I wish to commend the director for his wonderful film. The camera seems to follow only the characters, and this centralizes the story around them. An example is when they see Notre Dame from the boat. The camera never leaves one of the characters, and the mighty Notre Dame seems weak in comparison to the characters.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone, even if they haven't seen the prequel, as of this posting neither have I. 9/10"

","Richard Linklater returns the characters of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in this sequel to 1995s ""Before Sunrise."" This time finds the two meeting in Paris during Jesse's book tour and their desire for each other is still ever present. In under an hour and a half, shot in real time, the two discuss the past nine years of their lives from the loss of Celine's grandmother, a profound influence in her life, to Jesse's marital problems. More importantly, the question of what would have been if they had had the chance to stay together beyond their one night of passion nine years before. It is a question they examine throughout the film and a desire for one another that cannot be denied. But the film does not get lost in sexuality. Rather, it focuses on their unique relationship: the moments they share from her singing, to his writing. There are profound truths in this film brought about by their discussions, some of which are practically existential and the questions that most naïve youths have. But that is the beauty of their relationshipthe naiveté they bring about. That willingness to drop everything in their world for each other."

That was a profound experience - these movies beautifully illustrate the power of timing, the stories we cherish in our minds and hearts for a lifetime and teaches us that every moment is precious.<br/><br/>I know the ending of Before Sunset does not actually tell us what happens, but what do all of you think about what happens? Do you think Celene and Jessie get together afterall? Is it hopeful or does the fade out tell us that he cherishes that moment and goes back to his life of a failed marriage? Thoughts?"

","I probably shouldn't be writing about ""Before Sunset,"" since I haven't seen ""Before Sunrise,"" and I don't even know much of its reputation. But I think even sequels should have stand-alone appeal, and I must confess I found this film to be a very pleasant surprise, even if it sometimes tried my patience. The idea of making a filmed version of a single conversation is sort of inherently uncinematic  I'm no great fan of ""My Dinner with André,"" which as a piece of talk was occasionally interesting, but which never achieved anything as a film that it wouldn't have as a play, or, indeed, as an actual real-life conversation. I anticipated the same kind of problems here, and they are here  having these two chatterboxes move their bodies in and out of cafés and along the Seine is better than having them sit at a table the whole time, but it still doesn't really use the medium to its best advantage. The whole concept has the feel of a gimmick about it  and yet there's something about the film that really comes alive by the end of it. Jesse and Celine are not particularly interesting characters (even they make fun of each other's shallowness and irresponsibility), but there's something almost magical about the big ""what if?"" that rests in the center of this confection. It's a common fantasy, the desire to know how life might have been different if one single day had gone the other way, and it's maybe a good thing that very few of us ever have the chance to find out. (For all the romance and warmth of the movie's resolution, the odds are even more stacked against ultimate togetherness for these characters than they would have been the first time.) But this uncertainty only adds to the substance, as these two ordinary but likable people romanticize their past and present (but not future). As I said, at times their catching up is a little tiresome, and yet the emotional payoff makes it worth the getting there, and the low-key performances from the two stars become a big part of the film's ultimate authenticity and success. ""Before Sunset"" is a movie with a heart that sneaks up on even the most jaded viewer, and it has to be recommended for just about anyone. 8.5 out of 10."

","This is one of the rare cases where a film based on another movie is better than the original. Way better. I watched ""Before Sunrise"" after I saw this one and was quite disappointed. The actors and the story are more mature in the sequel. Maybe I am too old to identify with the mid-twenty Jesse and Celine and feel more comfortable with the mid-thirties you see in ""Before Sunset"". If you watched ""Before Sunrise"" you can see what difference nine years make. They both have their lives, they both are less adventurous then they were back then. But as they wander through the beautiful set of Paris, talking about anything, the two remember and regret what they had back then and what decisions they made. What could've been? And what could be? The movie follows a slow pace, Celine and Jesse just walk through Paris, talking. But the movie is far from being boring. After it was over I couldn't believe over an hour had passed. I don't know if you have to be of a certain age to really like this movie. If you don't need action to enjoy a movie give this one a try."

","You really can't rate Before Sunset properly without including Before Sunrise.<br/><br/>Before Sunrise is actually the first part of a two part set, the second part being Before Sunset. I thought that movie might be a sequel, as sequels go. It is not. It is the other essential part of the whole. I will critique them as an essential pair.<br/><br/>The movies are difficult to rate. This is because if they mean something to you they should mean a lot. If they do not mean anything in particular, then you probably didn't like them at all - and probably didn't bother with the sequel. Without going into any details (I don't need to - you can get the official storyline from the general critic's reviews), here is how I rate them.<br/><br/>Before seeing Before Sunset, I gave Before Sunrise a 3 out of 4. But the two together rate a 4, or more precisely an 8.5 out of 10. I have to leave room for such masterpieces as Hotel Rwanda and films in that class - totally different. It is also interesting that these movies are played out in real time. But I won't elaborate in order not to spoil the plot of the movies as a pair. We are lucky that as of now, we can see them together, or even better, one night apart, as I did.<br/><br/>As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity to these movies and a nagging question which is resolved at the end (of Sunset).<br/><br/>What do you think?

Maybe it's a personal interest in interpersonal relationships, that made me enjoy this so, but I am inclined to feel that this is just a wonderful film. Not challenging, not thought provoking, just wonderful. By the end i felt such an attachment to the two characters that I hoped I didn't want to leave the theatre. As the camera follows them in real time through Paris, the Hawke and Delpy show, with such grace and percision, their characters thoughts and feelings that it's difficult to remember that you're not walking along with two real people. I recommend it to all."

","This movie (and its predecessor) might be the best character studies I have ever seen. There really is nothing but character development which may be a turn off to many (no effects, no big plot surprises, no stunts,,, really nothing but dialogue in both movies). I will say, you absolutely MUST see Before Sunrise first or this movie will be pointless. This is one of the most original movies I have seen in years, and is incredibly risky for the makers of the film. In today's short-attention-span society, a movie like this is really hard to pull off with most audiences. I was incredibly skeptical about a second movie when I heard it was coming out. I was afraid they would ""hollywood"" it a little and kill the magic of the first. Yhis, however was the perfect conclusion to the first. Everyone wanted to know if they re-met 6 months later, and that was answered, but the mystery of their future together (the best part of the first film) was retained. You need an open mind to watch these movies (and a bit of a romantic side) but they are well worth the couple of hours you put into them. This movie shows what 2 fantastic actors can do with a good script and incredible chemistry and not much else. I reserve 10 ratings for movies that define genres or change the way movie-making is done like the original Star Wars or Ben Hur, but I gave this movie a strong 9...maybe a 9.8 if they gave me decimals."

","""Before Sunset"", much like it's predecessor (or at least my memory of it), is a real refreshing sort of film geared toward and about adults having adult relationships and adult conversations. Actually, the entire film is an adult conversation. One of the things that Richard Linklater has shown through the writing in his films is that he has no qualms about being what can only be described as ""talky"". As a means to keep the boredom level to a minimum, there are transitions in location every ten minutes or so, that I found occasionally awkward, but considering the high quality of everything else going on, this is merely nitpicking. As surprising a place to find a sequel as it is, ""Before Sunset"" really holds up on its own merit. It's filmed in a cinema verite style, with very long takes. Much of the credit of its success must go to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who give outstanding, realistic, and moving performances. It's a highly engaging film, sparking activity in the heart as well as the mind, and bridging a gap between Linklater's philosophical ""Waking Life"" and his somewhat more romantic ""Before Sunrise""."

This film is an interesting and sometimes hard-to-swallow parallel of a generations' disappointments yet continuing romanticism. Before Sunrise, the original, was a movie that truly affected me in the same period of my life, 9yrs. past. To see the maturation of these characters, and the inevitable sadness that has grown within these two is sad yet honest.

So I guess that explains the sharp division in opinions about this piece.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple and you've probably read about it already. What makes this movie special is that its not standard ""Hollywood"". In real life, and to my experience - and believe me I am an expert by now - when you meet your ex after 10yrs sparks don't fly. There are no happy happy joy joy moments with violins playing. Time has changed you both and the pain and love have both dulled with time. There is however still something there no matter how much you hate to admit it. So I was surprised to see a movie that tries to tell it like it is. The dialog sounds like they went and recorded a real couple and just sneaked it off as a screenplay.<br/><br/>OK, so there are stretches where the dialog becomes trite. But then, just when you're about to lose all attention and go order a pizza, there is a scene that cuts close to the bone. The most memorable is a scene in the car where the two main characters stop side stepping how they feel and let it all out. The ending, is exactly right. I won't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>Finally, I am just happy there are still film makers out there like Richard Linklater and Alexander Payne who don't pander to the perceived common taste and try to create something special that feels real and touches you deep down."

I saw the first one (Before Sunrise) long time ago on TV and I was pretty impressed. It was very simple, yet sophisticated. The entire movie revolves around a never ending conversation between two strangers who met each other on a train in Europe. As the conversation flows along, two leads unravel their personalities.

As the movie went on, I grew to like both characters and was hoping they could get together at the end. However ......<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the first one slightly better, just because it's when the two character were first introduced and it seemed more complete as a movie. The second can't really stand alone. The ending of Before Sunset is a little abrupt to me. Not that I want to be spoon fed every little detail of their relationship, but a little most hints on where the future might lead would help the movie be more complete, in my opinion. I like the fact that they didn't use any background music at all throughout the entire movie, but the movie itself creates its own magic on different aspects, like the eye contacts, the recurring mannerisms of both characters, and the chemistry between them. It doesn't need music to modify itself. I dig that.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of either actor, or even big on romance movies myself. But I like the casualness of the movie. It makes me feel that if I could ever be a date with someone, either Vienna or Paris would be the perfect location. Romance just gets oozed out naturally without being reinforced in any way. Also, this movie is so intimate. I feel like I was eavesdropping two people's conversation the whole time, watching two of them dance around each other.

","Before Sunset picks up nine years later and, unbelievably, it is an even better film. Actually, I'm not sure which of the two films is really better, except that ""Before Sunset"" is more relevant at this stage of my life and ""Before Sunrise"" is now more nostalgic. They are both so perfect in every way, and I can't think of another film like them. I guess Linklater was influenced by that genre of French films in which ""a man and a woman have a conversation about life and love and not much else happens."" The difference is that so often in the French films the conversation is banal, pretentious or self-important, posing as something more profound. Linklater's dialog is so natural; it moves from the mundane to the intelligent without a single false note. Both films were written and directed by Richard Linklater who does this kind of talky, real-time, thoughtful and realistic slice of life better than anyone (his film, ""Slacker,"" was a masterpiece). The story of Before Sunrise/Sunset is about serendipitously finding one's soulmate (for lack of a better word) at the wrong time, and desperately trying to forget and move on, but utterly failing. In the case of the couple in the film, they discover each other when they are students traveling on a train through Europe; he's American, she's French. When they unexpectedly meet again nine years later they learn that, in the intervening years, neither had found anything remotely close to what they shared in their brief time together, and they reconnect so easily, it's as if only a couple of months had passed. Once again, as in the first film, their timing is off; neither are free to drop everything else in their lives to take the plunge and play out the romance. As the Ethan Hawke character puts it so well, ""It is a choice between being my best self or my honest self."""

","In 1995, director Richard Linklater released a little romantic comedy called Before Sunrise, which made only 5 million dollars, but became a cult favourite on VHS/DVD.  Nearly a decade later, Linklater reunites with the film's stars (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk) to produce this sequel.  The motive clearly wasn't financial, given the rather limited success of the original; this was a labour of love for all involved.  I haven't seen the original film, but having seen the sequel, it has now become a major priority.  I must see where this all began. The plot is minimalist.  Jesse (Hawk) is now a successful writer, and is touring Paris when he encounters Celine (Delpy).  Jesse and Celine wander around the city for an hour and a bit, with Jesse's imminent departure the film's ticking clock.  The plot is not the point; this film relies on dialogue and the strength of the two actors' performances.  French actress Julie Delpy is truly radiant as Celine, instantly becoming one of my favourite actresses.  Ethan Hawk, who has done little work seen by me since Dead Poets Society, is also great as Jesse.  No other actor has more then a couple of lines. The dialogue of Before Sunset is wonderful, all of it feeling natural, never forced. Like the first film, the ending of this film is open-ended, although there is a very obvious (and correct) direction for series to take.  Bring on Before_______."

","I happened to hit on 'Before Sunrise' about 5 years ago while zapping through the Telly, i was actually looking for the news but was caught by the movies atmosphere instantly. I had never seen a movie like that before; i really enjoyed it and i was inspired by the smart and interesting dialogs. Almost forgotten the movie, i now saw a poster for 'before sunset' and i started to remember the first part. I wasn't actually that eager to see the movie, because i thought that one couldn't top the first part anyway without copying it all in all. Furthermore, i thought the idea of it playing in Paris too much of a cliché and considered that the movie would probably be just normal bad Hollywood sequel of some low class director who bought the rights of 'Before Sunrise', trying to make some easy dollars. Eventually i did go see it ( on the last day it played ), and was a lot better than my expectations:The movie is far more focused on the dialogue between the main actors. There are virtually no other actors in the movie ( except for some journalists and a guy standing at a grill ). There are hardly no interactions with other characters and during the whole 90 min movie there is no time-cut or time-gap. And the movie is definitely something new. The characters seem far more mature and seem to have laid off there naiv sides. I wouldn't even consider the movie a romance story any more, the theme is far more dramatic and subtle than the first part. The topic includes a lot more of the characters dark and vulnerable sides. Some parts though didn't fit in the atmosphere of the movie at all. The choice of profession of the main characters didn't really fit. She turned out to be an environmentalist and Ethan Hawke became a famous Novel author. In The first scene, seeing him in front of journalists discussing his new book didn't really fit. Apart from those two scenes, the acting was still amazing: later on i read that the script was very exact and that the actors weren't allowed to improvise: but it sure does seem like it. Both played amazingly realistic and very natural. I still think it shouldn't have played in Paris even though it was very nicely put into picture, leaving out all the familiar touristy attractions. But why didn't they choose a not so popular and romance-clichéd city, like Barcelona or something like that.<br/><br/>All in all 'Before Sunset' is truly a worthy sequel to the original movie, so realistic and well written, that i now, couldn't even imagine the story of this couple to be complete with out the second part."

While its not necessary to have seen the first to enjoy this one, you owe it to yourself to know the entire story. Before Sunset picks up where Before Sunrise leaves off. Well, not quite. Its well after the six months agreed upon for the next meeting. Jesse has written a book about the fateful night he spent in Vienna, of all things. He's on the last leg of his book tour, which just happens to be Paris. As he's fielding his last question he catches a glimpse of a familiar face and somehow manages to wrap up the session w/o totally losing it. After a brief chat outside the bookstore, Jesse has the idea that Celine could show him around Paris before his plane leaves that evening, which she gladly agrees to. As the two learn more about the years that have passed they can't help but to be drawn closer. Closer to what is the only real question... Much like the first, this film is a great date movie, exploring the various insecurities we all have, the emotional baggage we accumulate over the years. It also goes into the whole ""what if"" factor of situations that don't receive the necessary closure and expands on how some moments really do stick w/us longer than we intend. Ultimately the film revolves around the many faces of love and the different roads that the search for it can lead us on. This movie provides tons of conversation material and is a must own once its finally released on DVD. I rated it a 9/10, but really could've given it a 10, I may change that shortly."

","This is an excellent movie. It tiptoes on the thread between logic and emotions and culminates as an ode to fate, achieving to present randomness as ultimate inevitability. Setting cynicism as the prevailing approach was most refreshing when one deals with the exploration of issues like love, experience and choice in a realistic manner for people in their 30s living in a modern western society. At the same time, conscious that it is dealing with the most fundamental of concepts it takes an aristophanic approach using regular swearing as an ideal means of the pervading cynicism. The combination of swearing and cynicism and the ultimate conclusion that love and choice can still be possible in todays cynical world has a massive impact; assisted by Nina Simone in the background it plays a tune of optimism to us all."

","Before Sunset outdoes its predecessor, Before Sunrise (a good film in its own right), because we are faced with the same characters in a more dramatic setting in their lives.  The idealized and rather immature notion of romance is gone, but parts of it is sought after by both Celine and Jesse, who face the all-too-familiar stage of loneliness and boredom in the mundane aspects of their days.  Powerful and heartbreaking, their conversations reach so much deeper than simply a declaration of love, but also encompasses confession and understanding of pain and loss.  It is a great movie through and through, right from the beginning to the end (especially the magnificent ending).

","This is a great film that I recommend to anyone - including those that might normally avoid 'romantic' films. Like the first (Before Sunrise) it's not slushy and manages to keep your attention throughout, despite the fact that the whole film centers on the dialogue between the two leads.<br/><br/>However, I would also recommend that anyone intending to watch this film tries to see Before Sunrise first. If you do, or if you have already, then I have an interesting question for you: did they sleep together? I have found that the answer is almost consistently the opposite depending on whether the person I ask is male or female (I'll leave you to decide which is which).<br/><br/>This question, which I remember discussing with the girl I saw the first film with, is played upon very well in the script of Before Sunset. They also managed to develop the characters in a completely believable way, with both revealing how complex their lives had become since their last encounter. In common with the first film there is some interesting social commentary and the film deals very well with the cultural subtleties between the two leads.<br/><br/>What disappoints me is how a quality US film like this seems to get such limited exposure in its country of origin.

With a rather cool start, this story progresses to the point when the 'one night lovers' realize that they have never stopped loving each other, and that a long separation could not change their feelings. Every moment spent together was and will always be precious. Filmed in beautiful Paris this movie is a delight, the acting is superb. It also opens the way to a sequel with a hopefully happy ending. Of course this is fiction, but it gives one a hope that love of this depth is imaginable, albeit not possible.

Unfortunately, as we were both poor college students and lived a long way from each other, we decided not to contact each other for the exact reasons that Jesse and Celine didn't in Before Sunrise.  People who have not had this situation may think the reasons are stupid.  When you are young,you have met the one, and have little time, you don't think too clearly.

","It's been nine years since Jesse and Celine kissed and parted ways at that train station in Vienna, vowing to meet again in six months.<br/><br/>
Director Richard Linklater's premise for the sequel to his delightful 1995 film, ""Before Sunrise,"" is simple: Jesse's now an author pimping his book in Europe, while Celine's making the world better in Paris. As chance would have it - or, is it truly chance? - Jesse's signing books at Celine's favorite Parisian bookstore.<br/><br/>Linklater and his actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, take us on an indisputably charming, funny and poignant journey as Jesse and Celine reconnect in the few moments Jesse has before flying home to the U.S.<br/><br/>
Hawke and Delpy are now nine years older and it shows. After Linklater lets us glimpse the younger Jesse and Celine in a few quick flashbacks from ""Before Sunrise,"" we realize Hawke's marital problems seem to have taken their toll and Delpy might have lost that celestial loveliness, but still looks beautiful.<br/><br/>And like Jesse and Celine, we, too, have grown older, though not necessarily wiser. Jesse's edgier; Celine's slightly more neurotic. These days, their views on life, love and the world might not be as Panglossian as before, but more rooted in reality.<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is all about the what-ifs in life, something most, if not all, of us can identify with. And about getting a second chance at correcting a mistake.<br/><br/>Linklater shoots Jesse and Celine's stroll through Paris in lengthy, unobtrusive takes. Hawke and Delpy are so relaxed in their roles and with each other that we easily believe they're two soul mates seeing other again for the first time in nine years.<br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy might have helped write the script, but several moments seem improvised. There's the initial awkwardness as Jesse and Celine skirt around what they really want to know about each other. Then, as they invade each other's personal space, the emotional walls come down. They chat about their lives, loves, coincidences that well might have led to something else for both of them. <br/><br/>Both actors are sensationally good in this picture. This might very well be Hawke's finest performance. He and Delpy have terrific chemistry; their emotions are genuine; they play off each other as if they're two old friends awfully comfortable in each other's presence. And the writing's authentic, especially during two scenes - on a water-taxi and, later, in a SUV. There's nothing about this film that rings false. <br/><br/>And just when we're wondering how Linklater will end the story this time, he produces a sublime conclusion to a masterful, magnificent movie."

","I consider myself particularly fortunate. While most people had to wait 9 years to see this sequel to Before Sunrise, and some misguided poor souls saw Before Sunset without even seeing Before Sunrise (which is an absolute misfortune, despite some dissentions), I was able to see the DVD for Sunrise (for the first time), enjoy a great dinner, and then carry on to see Sunset in the cinema. This was among the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. Thanks to those making it possible.<br/><br/>Consider the brilliance  picking up a conversation from where it was left off nine years ago (both in the context of the story in movie and the actual filming itself) and continue the enchanting dialogue in a sequel that is all at once both lighter and heavier. To be able to completely empathize with Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in their second encounter (in Paris), one needs to have gone through with them their one day (and night) together roaming Venice nine year ago, when they were at their early twenties. <br/><br/>Their initial relationship (in Sunrise) was simply the result of Jessie's urge to just continue talking with Celine after their chance meeting on a train. The entire movie was just one continuous conversation while the two roam Venice, but you'll be hard pressed to find anything more mesmerizing. It's not only the way they talk, but also the way they listen to each other. Throughout one's life, one may experience moments of joy when striking a chord of resonance in a conversation. For Jessie and Celine, it's more like an entire orchestra in a heart-warming harmony. It's such sheer joy watching them relating to each other. These two are meant to be together.<br/><br/>Nine years later (for me, just a few hours) the audience found out, in Sunset, that they were, after all, not together. They have both matured over the nine years, finding or trying to find their separate lives (or existences). Their conversation becomes more scintillating and carefree, liberated from tantalizing romantic possibilities. As they continue on, however, we gradually come to realize how that one night roaming Venice together had deeply affected them, throughout the ensuing nine year. A trace of sadness creeps in, but joy is also rekindled. Come what may, the sheer joy of watching them together not only continues, but is also deepened.<br/><br/>The ending is wickedly charming."

The premise of this sequel that he could then go on to write a best selling novel based on that, get media attention in the Shakespeare & Co bookshop in Paris etc., is rather far-fetched - and her showing up there is even more so.  Nevertheless it's the quasi-reality relationship thing which appeals.  What do they talk about, how do they interact, will they resume where they left off (well that's a safe guess) will they get passionate, have sex?  The setting of an amble through Paris, including a boat ride along the Seine, on a summer evening is also nice.  Julie Delpy is credited as one of the writers and you wonder how much is based on what she really thinks.  It's no surprise that it took only 15 days to film, but it is a surprise that $10 million was spent on it, given that much more complex films like ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" can be made for $1 million, but I guess those involved with this don't come cheap."

I felt elated and sad all at once while this film rolled before my eyes and I felt my brain working overtime trying to assimilate all the lucid dialogue that was bursting from the screen. This is one of those rare bits of cinema in which the simplistic directorial style that Linklater employed was entirely appropriate.<br/><br/>Several exquisitely composed establishing shots are made of Paris at the very beginning in order to prepare us for the traveling our main players will undertake. The story begins when Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is in a Paris bookstore answering questions in promotion of his novel that is based on the night portrayed in the previous cinematic installment of this story in 'Before Sunrise' (1995). An inquisitor is quite insistent on wanting to know whether or not the novel is based on an actual experience of the author's  he begrudgingly answers in the affirmative. Not soon after, he glances to the side the subject of his story, Celine  strangely looking both ravishing and child-like. Of course, after hastily excusing himself from the conference, he immediately meets up with her and they unplanningly set out on a mild excursion of the city  talking and emoting all the while.<br/><br/>And, basically, that's about it.<br/><br/>There are no special effects, no technical triumphs, no CGI (at least, none that I noticed). What we see and are enraptured by is the light, soulful and gliding talking and walking of these only two pieces to a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>A certain tension is built up as we become more and more aware that Jesse is soon going to have to go to the airport to catch his flight.

Nine Years Later...<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise the roles of Jessie and Celine, meeting again for the first time since a seemingly magical one night stand in Vienna nine years ago. Their reunion, literally, is a dream come true; Celine appears at the bookstore where Jessie reads from his first novel, which not coincidentally is based on the train trip where they first met.<br/><br/>
What if, Jessie muses, as they walk through the streets of Paris, he wrote the book for the sole reason that Celine might read it and find him again? ""Before Sunset"" is an unabashedly romantic film with an ending so perfect it took my breath away. <br/><br/>Jessie has only a few hours in Paris before he must catch a flight back home. In the brief time they have together, Celine and Jessie talk without cease, wildly making up for lost time. They discuss their careers, their love lives, their youthful idealism, their adult lack of hope, the state of the world, and the painfully persistent question: what if? Jesse and Celine fluidly move through the city, walking cobblestone streets, sitting in a typical Parisian café, passing through a lovely garden, and wandering down to the banks of the Seine, where they ride a tourist boat, Notre Dame luminous in the backdrop. The conversation never stops, but the talk is never dull. Unlike ""Before Sunrise,"" which covered fourteen hours, ""Before Sunset"" takes place in real time. Celine and Jessie frequently allude to the flight he must catch, and as they walk and talk, I, too, couldn't help but worry about the minutes dwindling away, the plane that must be caught, and when Jessie continues to steal extra minutes, the tension increases. Linklater did a marvelous job of investing the talky premise with suspense.<br/><br/>Delpy and Hawke co-wrote the script with the director. Jessie and Celine are characters they know well, inhabit fully, and their conversations (probably based on their own experiences) feel both spontaneous and true. The grown-up lovers are intelligent and politically aware -- a successful novelist and an environmental activist, after all -- and if they are perhaps more beautiful than most, they are extremely appealing and heart-breakingly real.<br/><br/>

","That 'Before Sunset' succeeds almost as well as its predecessor, 'Before Sunrise', gives me hope that a romantic movie doesn't have to be hackneyed tripe. That it's stepping in the same places as the original DOES keep it from greatness, though. The first movie was about how American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy) spend a day together in Vienna, talking about everything big & small and falling in love. They part and we didn't find out if they ever got back together. The sequel picks up 9 years later when Jesse is in Celine's French neighbourhood on the last leg of his book tour. See, he wrote a successful novel of their one night together, although he has trouble admitting just much she's really meant to him. She unexpectedly meets him in the book store and they conversationally pick up right where they left off.<br/><br/>Experimental indie radical Richard Linklater (who co-wrote the script with his stars and also produced & directed) doesn't waste any time on extraneous material. It's all about the 2 would-be lovers. Jesse might be a married father and Celine might be committed to another man, but they belong together. We know it and they seem to know it too, even though they spend a whole movie fighting their primal urges. They're likable and intelligent people, largely because they're also funny, self-deprecating, and rebellious. Hawke & Delpy invest a great deal of delicacy into their characters too. Not only do the actors have wonderful chemistry, they know when to pull back and be guarded about their feelings.<br/><br/>I recently saw 'My Dinner With Andre', which also sparked bolts of electricity in my brain. I desperately needed to debate someone after seeing that conversation-filled film and I wish I'd taken a date to each of the 'Before' movies. Both are sexy in the best sense. Who needs naked skin and moaning lust when you have white-hot passion of the mind? Since the story is essentially told in real time, these are two people who spend about 80 minutes holding something back. The ""will they/won't they"" question will not be answered in this review, but that sexual tension keeps the whole production together.<br/><br/>With the exception of his hugely popular ode to rock fun-fest, 'The School Of Rock', Linklater likes to leave loose ends. His pictures work because his characters do what smart people usually do with their free time---talk. And free thinkers usually come around to the subjects of literature and music. How fitting then that Jesse immortalizes Celine through writing, while we later she how she has immortalized him through music. If two characters have ever truly connected on the motion picture screen, it's these two. 'Before Sunset' isn't a perfect movie (partly because it's cribbing so much from the '95 film), but it's a glorious way for lovers and other strangers to connect within the confines of a movie theatre."

Thank you Richard, Ethan and Julie for wildly surpassing even my highest expectations for the continuation of Jesse and Celine's story. It was one of the most beautiful and well made movies I have ever seen. Beautiful, tender, honest, powerful. . . I can only hope there will be more chapters to follow!!!!"

","Does anybody want to really meet their soul mate? Before Sunset belongs together with Before Sunrise...in their own genre. Was there not something mystical here? The Nina Simone music at the end of Before Sunset with Celine working her magic...it put the hook in me. The two lovers dancing at the end in Before Sunrise to one of the Goldberg Variations; prelude and coda. The ending of Before Sunset is just grand. Truly. The dance of their language was really window dressing to a passion play for voyeurs. And we are all voyeurs for a love too deep, too rare for those who have lost faith in its possibility. I will be amazed if this ends as a trilogy of sorts. However, these two will suffice."
"nini_ten","Null","0","0","9 July 2004"," The reality of middle age romance
","I think I understood the difference between this and ""Sunrise"" is that ""Sunrise"" is meant to be a precious experience, a journey, but ""Sunset"" is more of an aftermath piece, it's less exciting, it's full of undermining dread because of the pathetic plane to catch and the regret. The 2 characters cannot escape their reality whereas in ""Sunrise"" all they want to do is escape it. I guess the only regret for the viewer is that you'd wish they at least kissed or made love, because they would've allowed themselves to escape and feel better, though they're obviously extremely cautious and scared of such consequences. With Jesse and Celine, I've always enjoyed their conversations about their relationships more than the other topics they talk about, especially with ""Sunset"", since they have serious unfinished business, and you'd wish they get to the romance quicker. A lot of things about their personal life are always really tragic but not that tragic, a kind of tragedy that too often renders with too much time feeling lonely, and that makes the most bittersweet characteristic of ""Sunset"". Jesse and Celine have really changed, believably. They're not the same and you can understand how they'd change from that night 9 years ago, and they're still resonant people to us. I think ""Sunrise"" works as a more significant film than ""Sunset"", but the most significant thing about ""Sunset"" is letting Jesse and Celine be truly real by showing their place in reality, not their ""best self"" nor their spontaneous ""young self"". Also, the reason why they didn't meet 6 months later in Vienna works out perfectly. In a way, that's kind of enough. I only wished they had that passionate soap opera moment."
"jmc4769","8","0","0","9 July 2004"," Great movie except for the ending
","OK, this is fair warning. Before Sunset is all talking. I would describe it as a romantic My Dinner with Andre or maybe an intellectual chick flick. The movie is one extended conversation between the two lead characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). They walk through the streets of Paris, they have coffee at a local café, they walk some more, they take a boat ride on the Seine, they are driven to her apartment, she invites him in, they talk a while in the apartment, movie over. That's it. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, forget it. You won't like the movie. People who don't like Julie Delpy or her character won't like the movie either because she has about two-thirds of the lines. Personally, I was fascinated by the conversation, and I thought Celine was mesmerizing. I did have one huge problem with Before Sunset. It ended too abruptly, before the end of the conversation. I wanted to see how things turned out, but the movie just leaves you hanging. At the screening I went to, there was a collective gasp from the audience at the end because we weren't expecting it to be over. My bottom line - great movie except for the ending (8 out of 10)."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","9 July 2004"," The urgency is real and surprisingly dramatic.
","`But at my back I always hear/ Time's winged chariot hurrying near.'<br/><br/>Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris 9 years after a one-night stand.  His book tour is over; he has only an hour before he goes to the airport, an hour before the sunset of their relationship.  As director Richard Linklater (`Before Sunrise') tracks them through Paris streets renewing their passion, we are constantly aware Jesse must return to the airport.  Marvel's `winged chariot' is ever present in `Before Sunset.'<br/><br/>The tension and the love are balanced in the screenplay by writer/director Linklater with Hawke and Delpy's collaboration. The real drama is in the talk, whether it be about reincarnation, cable TV, or sex.  The effortlessly natural conversation comes from the three's organic development of the material and the truth of the situation: These two loved each other for a brief moment and are capable of loving again even though he is married with a child and she has become cynical about love.  <br/><br/>Hawke plays Jesse as nervous but romantically inclined (His book is about their affair).  He shows discomfort at the beginning of their renewal just as any person would.  Delpy plays her caution behind her chatterbox surface until the real feelings emerge above that surface.  All the while the sun is ticking their time away.<br/><br/>Because the film is close to real time, the urgency is real and surprisingly dramatic. When Jesse tries to describe his frustrating marriage, he says, `I feel like I'm running a small nursery with someone I used to date.' That's also good writing.<br/><br/>""Baby, you are gonna miss that plane,"" Celine says. Fade to credits.<br/><br/>Make sure you rent `Before Sunrise' and also hope Jesse misses the plane so that, in the spirit of Michael Apted's 7-up series, we can see how it all plays out in another 9 years when they reach their 40's."

","I really loved the first movie when i first saw it when it came out nearly 10 years ago. It was one of those movies that no one has ever seen or heard of, or at least seemingly. So, when I saw the poster and then the trailer for the sequel, I was excited. You don't get the chance to see sequels to movies like this very often.<br/><br/>So, this was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year for me. I just saw a sneak preview of it yesterday and it works on exactly the same levels that the first one did. It is simply just these two people walking the streets of Paris (Before Sunrise was Vienna iirc) talking, talking about life, romance, people, love, relationships. The movie relies on acting and dialogue. Aside from the views of Paris, there isn't much more to it.<br/><br/>And I loved it. It was a wonderful movie. <br/><br/>And I love movies that rely on acting and dialog to make them work. I saw another Ethan Hawke movie recently, ""Tape"" which follows the same principles. ""Death and the Maiden"" was another one that I loved for the same reason. ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" yet another."

I mean, what genius wrote the script?! It must be coming from a personal experience: shockingly honest, very clever, and funny at times. I had a feeling that it was me who spent a day and a night with Celine. (Thank you, Julie.)<br/><br/>This movie started me thinking about what's important in life. What is worth talking about, sharing with a stranger or a loved one. Some of the ideas are totally usable: for example, the imaginary phone call to a friend. I think it also teaches about not being selfish (even though ""love is the most selfish thing"")."

","I've seen ""Before sunset"" (german title) on the ""Berlinale"" and was really overwhelmed because I didn't expect so much from that sequel. I've seen the first part in 1995 and I liked it. But I loved the sequel because the makers successfully satisfied the expectations of the audience and - in my case - did even better.<br/><br/>In the beginning there is a distance between Hawke and Delphy. Both are older now. They seem more reasonable, more secure. But after a while they approach each other step by step. And the more they talk, the more they reveal of their inner constitution, the more the audience is drawn into the films atmosphere.<br/><br/>In a way it turns 1995 again, but its not the same, its different because of the experiences they made since that time. The dialogues are intensive, realistic an very funny too, everything sounds natural and it could go on for hours. So the end turns out as a surprise, I would say a brilliant one.<br/><br/>9 of 10!"

","I watched this movie before checking out IMDb by simply pulling it off the video store shelf. After watching it, my initial thought was ""what a waste of my money, I should never rent a movie without checking IMDb"". However, I am now shocked to see that this movie is rated so highly.<br/><br/>I suspect, this is because of all the people that might have watched the first movie and were captivated enough by it that they do not judge this movie on its own merit but as a continuation of the previous movie.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the first movie and can't judge it based on that. Therefore, I can only judge this movie as it stands on its own, without depending on the previous movie: As such, this movie, by itself, is completely and utterly a waste of time. The chemistry between the two actors was awful; the dialogue was simple and artificial, the sexual words used here and there felt forced and out of place and the whole movie was pointless. I suspect it satisfies all those people who were curious about what happened after the first movie (I only realized there was a first movie after watching the add-on making of documentary). But, by itself this movie goes nowhere. The two characters start talking with each other 5 minutes into the movie, and talk through the rest of the movie by going here and there, into cafes, along the streets, and on a boat, ending up in the girl's house. My wife and I waited patiently until the end, hoping that something was going to happen, and nothing did. They talk, and talk, and talk, about nothing really, and then the movie ends... That's it...<br/><br/>If you were captivated by the first movie and was always curious what happened to these two, then by all means, go ahead and watch it. But, please, rate this movie on its own merit, and not because you liked the first one so much.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched the first movie, either make sure to watch that one first, or skip this all together."
"laurel21000","3","3","8","7 February 2007"," Sequel as demonstration of Peter Principle...
","Given that this movie was a sequel, the casting was a foregone conclusion. Unfortunately so, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Since so much of the sequel was obviously improvised, it required actors with a lot of juice. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy did not deliver it. Although Delpy fell far more short of the mark than did Hawke.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is an interesting screen presence. His body language, the way different expressions dart across his face. The range of what he can convey. To me, Julie Delpy is much less compelling.<br/><br/>Additionally, this film was very chatty. The scripted part seemed to be going for a Dinner with Andre type of feel. Some of the scripted chatter was thoughtful and engaging. A lot of it, though, was self-consciously delivered and pseudo profound or perhaps more accurately -- profoundly pseudo.<br/><br/>I think Ethan Hawke would have done much better in the improvised scenes if he had had someone other than Delpy off which to bounce. Though, perhaps she was at an unfair disadvantage because English is not her first language.<br/><br/>Even though it is merely far-fetched and fanciful speculation since again, logically, the casting here of Hawke and Delpy had to be a foregone conclusion, the improvised nature of this movie would have worked much better with another duo. Say, Hugh Laurie and Drew Barrymore, for example. Now that would have been some movie. Laurie would have come up with some great dialogue and Barrymore would have played off of it.<br/><br/>Another winning combination of actors here would have been Owen Wilson and Francis O'Connor. That would have been chemistry galore. And Wilson is known for his improvisational contributions to dialogue.<br/><br/>Another fact that hung over this movie was the contrast between its plot and the plot of Ethan Hawke's ""real"" life. The romantic melodrama Hawke lived through and which received so much coverage in the press far, far exceeded the romantic complications in this movie. And somehow made the movie seem banal in comparison."

","It seems like this movie was trying too hard to be another ""My Dinner with Andre"", but that aspect failed.

I found myself thinking, especially about the Celine character, ""When is she going to shut up?"" Because she was talking so much about so many uninteresting and superficial things, it also took away from the romantic aspect between the two characters.

As we find out how profound of an effect each of them had on the other, I would have thought they'd run out of small talk much sooner, faced with the reality of a life's obsession presenting itself in person.<br/><br/>At 80 minutes, including two sets of credits, there was time to delve much deeper into the possibilities. And the question looming large: ""If given a second chance at a past romance, would you do anything differently?"" is hinted at, but not played out. It felt like watching your sexy neighbors all through dinner, and just when they move towards the bedroom, the lights go out. Yeah, I have an imagination, but when I go to the movies, I suspend my own fantasies for awhile, and pay to see someone else's.

","(Yawn) This is totally unrealistic. No one can actually watch this film without getting sleepy. I've followed Ethan's acting career with enthusiasm and scrutiny, but I must say, taking this role did not suit him. The pace of it all was way too slow even for mediocre minds. This was worse than ""August"" or ""Junebug."" (see all my reviews; they are not all negative)! The guitar music was sappy along with the odd conversation between ONE man and ONE woman. Where is everyone else? Not many actors can pull off an entire film without support cast members. This was one step up from ""Castaway"" at least... (well Tom did have his coconut head), but lacks the variety of emotions needed for a class ""A"" film. I'm sorry, but this movie was just too under-acted and no one falls in love that fast at their (understood to be) characters' ages and implied intelligence level. Maybe teenagers fall in love that quickly, but real love takes time.

","This was actually a very interesting movie. The whole thing takes place in real time during a stroll, cup of coffee, short boat ride and short car ride through Paris. The couple does not stop talking once. Basically they are describing things that another director with a larger budget might have chosen to dramatize. Not that I don't like witty repertoire, but this was ridiculous. I mean it's clever enough, it is exactly the kind of conversation you might have if catching up with a one-night stand after 9 years. Though of course the ""man"" (Hawke) keeps somehow maneuvering the conversation back to jokes about getting the ""woman"" (Delpy) into the sack, which I found to be so juvenile. They skirt around touchy subjects like politics and religion and just when you think the conversation is going to turn into a debate they laugh and all is well (oh aren't they so cute). But I guess in real life that is what you would do with an acquaintance. The whole time we were watching we wondered what was going to happen. Something was going to happen. Nothing really does that isn't obvious. That's why I call this review a spoiler -- there is really nothing to spoil because nothing happens (and I don't mean nothing like Seinfeld's nothing which is really something, I mean NOTHING, just pleasant conversation). Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is very good. Ethan Hawke tends to pick very poetic touching movies. And any other night this would have made a good coffeehouse flick, but we were hoping for something with a little more meat. It was this or ""Defending Your Life"" and I really regret the decision we made! :) Best part of the movie: when Delpy sings the pretty waltz toward the end. Just lovely."

","Alright, shocking confess: I only heard of 'Before Sunrise' when this one came out. So I went out to see that a couple of weeks ago, so I could start with 'Sunset', as I believe it's pretty obligate to watch both movies to really know what's going on.<br/><br/>So, it's nine years later. Celine (Delpy) and Jesse (Hawke, who, even more than Delpy, looks like he hasn't changed at all) have grown up without ever seeing each other again after that 16th June they promised to see each other 6 months later. As it turns out, Jesse was there in Vienna, but Celine had to attend the funeral of her grandmother.<br/><br/>But fate, in a way, served them well. Jesse now is a somewhat famous writer (he wrote the story of 'Sunrise' down), and is on tour through Europe, signing books and answering questions. When he's about done in Paris, his last stop, Delpy walks in. That scene, by the way, is worth watching a second time.<br/><br/>So the two start talking while wandering through France, not unlike they did in Vienna in Sunrise, but you would expect the talks to be different, more adult. And they are. After some babbling about reincarnation, playing the guitar and anything else there might come up, the two get down to the core: what's your current relationship like? Up until then, the movie is pretty jolly. When Jesse confesses he was in Vienna on December 16th, all Celine can do is laugh out loud. There's a feeling there on both of: well, okay, too bad about that, but life goes on. When later, while driving in the back of the car that should take Jesse to the airport, both confess they just can't forget that night 9 years ago, the movie starts getting more serious.<br/><br/>You can't help comparing sequels to each other, and if I had to do that here, I'm afraid 'Sunrise' did more to me than this movie. The conversations seem more fabricated this time (I know a lot of people don't agree with me on that), the characters a bit less likable (maybe because in Sunrise they resembled my age more), and the ending far less satisfying than that of Sunrise.<br/><br/>Not in any way that Before Sunset is a bad movie, and anyone who saw Before Sunrise should really go see it, but I just felt more connected with the first movie.<br/><br/>6/10."

Eighty minutes of rather boring dialog with a plot line as repugnant. The characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), lacked chemistry and charisma. Ethan's forced diatribe left an uneasy feeling inside. The end was as bland as the beginning, a completely trite, over-used attempt at a cliffhanger. It is my understanding that in a romantic film, connection must be felt between the 'lovers'--obviously lacking in this flick. I have to say, any young lass would adore the bland commentary and lack of plot line, however. Even with the setback of being a sequel, this film doesn't come close to success. Nonetheless, Delpy and her cute French persona left the male viewer somewhat pleased--not enough to sit through with a date though. Linklater, Hawke, Krizan, and Delpy should give another shot at writing, just not a screenplay. Try a romance novel next time my friends. Not the best romantic film I've ever seen!"

","Am i the only one who doesn't find this movie ""one of the best ever filmed""?! ""Amazing acting, incredible story, perfect chemistry, true love..."" Did these people actually watch the movie? First of all, the acting was too artificial (though i'm a big fan of Ethan Hawke, who played in two true masterpieces: ""The dead poets society"" and ""Gattaca"") and i'm not sure if it's the actors or the director to blame for that.<br/><br/>About the story/plot. Two strangers meet in a foreign country, quickly develop a perfect chemistry and instantly fall in love with each other (all in 1 day)? Give me a break. There might be only some passion, and passion caused exclusively by a new romantic environment (Vienna, Paris, what's next - Venice?!). There is even a classical case in psychology when two people meet on an emotionally exciting and romantic vacation, madly ""fall in love"". But even if they manage to get their relationship on a different level, date and live together in one of their home countries, they soon realize they are not really so much connected, and that all the wonderful chemistry was only due to the exciting vacation and the temporary high emotional level. A true love is when two people really know each other, care about each other, work hard and long on their relationship, share many positive and negative moments of their life with each other. And not when two strangers talk only about themselves the whole movie (did you actually notice that?)! Let's be honest: what happens on a vacation can only be characterized ether as a ""one-night-stand"" or maximum some attraction. I really feel sorry for people who call THIS love, for they surely have never experienced true love in their lives.<br/><br/>And one more thing. People change over several years, and they change a lot. Those two characters could not simply remain the same and keep their mutual attraction over all those years at the same level. You have to be absolutely inexperienced in life to seriously consider this movie to be in any way a realistic love story. By the way, the same applies to the 1st movie - ""Before sunrise""."
"Whythorne","3","3","10","10 March 2009"," A modern romance story
","Yes, a modern romance, and I don't mean that in the best sense. If you like a movie that elevates romance to a higher level, you may want to skip this.<br/><br/>Enough has been said by other reviewers about the non-stop dialog, but it was other things that troubled me far more.<br/><br/>For a romance story to work, it is essential that you have likable characters that you want to end up together. Depending on where you are coming from philosophically, you may love the Jesse and Celine characters or they may drive you crazy. In my case, it was the latter, as Jesse is like a rudderless smart ass who smugly thinks he is so profound, but Celine is far worse as an annoying, stereotypical liberal flake.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the script takes romance and reduces it to a cheap, matter-of-fact mundaneness, especially with the amount of casual droppings of f-bombs to describe the act of love. Maybe it's just me, but I find nothing cute nor attractive about couples in a genre like this talking with a blase vulgarity to one another. Talk about destroying the mystique of romance and reducing it down to things that cats do to each other in the alley.<br/><br/>In the prequel, ""Before Sunrise,"" there was far less of this, and the characters had a little bit more charm and innocence. But now it's 9 years later: Jesse foolishly married someone he can't stand, and Celine comes off as extremely hard and cynical. If that vulgarity isn't enough to turn you off, there's plenty of politics and anti-Americanism to help you along.<br/><br/>It not only undermines the ""magic"" that supposedly occurred between them in the first film but will serve to cause a lot of viewers to not give a rip whether they end up together or not...which, of course, is the big question that the whole movie drags its way to answering.<br/><br/>Lacking charm, sweetness, innocence, and boiled down to gritty ""naturalism"" this film probably appeals to some for those very reasons, but if Jane Austen is your brand of romance, beware...""Pride and Prejudice"" this surely ain't!"
"hakapes","6","3","10","31 August 2004"," Came out hungry from the cinema
","I haven't seen the first part, Before Sunrise (1995), but many around me had and did not stop telling me how a beautiful movie it was. So I went after Before Sunset with the feeling that I will see a nice romantic movie. Well, I did not get it. This can be a nice movie for some, but for me, it is not something I would take my girlfriend with me to have a night out.<br/><br/>The film tells about Jesse and Celine meeting in Paris after their romantic night in Vienna 9 years ago. Jesse wrote a book on their romance and gives a small talk in a local bookshop where he meets Celine. They start talk and they go on talking.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about their conversation, which is very authentic. Jesse has the man type ""jump in where we left off"" style, immediately starting at the intimate level, while Celine starts from the distance and slowly warms up to the intimate level they had before. At the beginning they go along the more superficial themes, what has happened during the nine years, what is life about at the moment, then they pass on to tell their feelings, motivations, their memories of that night they passed together.<br/><br/>You see 90% of the movie Jesse and Celine talking to each other in premier and second frames (only the face or the face with upper body). The movie presents the story ""real time"", the 80 minutes you spend in the movie is actually the 80 minutes of their conversation in Paris. Therefore the camera never leaves them; you always see Jesse and Celine on screen. On the top of that, you are given very long runs between cuts. Like when you see them from the front talking to each other walking along a small street - you get it from entering the street to the corner, with the same fram, without any cut. For me, it was just too much of the same image - although they walk, so the background changes - and felt quite uncomfortable in my chair. It was not boring, but made me feel somehow anxious. In fact, after the first 30 minutes, I changed my place 2 rows back in the cinema, because I felt ""to close to the screen"".<br/><br/>The end of the movie was the major disappointment to me, as there was no end. In the middle of a special moment suddenly the music and the picture fades out and the black screen with the list of the actors come up. We all stayed silent in the hall looking at each other with the face ""what's up, is that a joke?"". But it was no joke, the lights turned on, so slowly we decided to get up and go as the film is really over. I came out from the cinema mentally still hungry, as the story did get neither a sad nor a happy - or whatever - end, it just stopped. I wanted to see a nice romantic movie with some happy end, but I did not get it.<br/><br/>If I consider this movie in itself, as it is, without any expectations, this is a great film, that breaks in something unusual to nowadays' action-romance-thriller movie with all the bells-and-whistles style pictures you get used to. Before Sunset gives conversations, feelings, situations and atmosphere, that you usually only get from independent European directors. It gives you time to digest and makes you consider whether you ever were in such a situation. <br/><br/>However, when you go to watch this movie, you do it after hearing how beautiful the first part was and how romantic it was. So you sit in ""I will see a beautiful romantic movie tonight"" in your mind, but this is not a romantic movie. This is an unusual film of an original idea. I think that editor Richard Linklater should have filmed this story on its own, not as a second part of ""Before Sunrise"". Like that, it would get a 9/10 from me. However, like this, I can only give a 6/10.<br/><br/>To answer your question, whether should you watch it or not, yes, you should, as I plan to watch it once again myself. However, you should do it without the romantic-movie expectations in mind."

The idea of making this film this way is alright but it lost it in the perfection of the making. So i do not understand that the rating is so high. I think it should be 6/10 instead of 8.5/10.

"segacs","5","2","6","23 December 2006"," Really regret seeing it!
","""Before Sunrise"" was one of my all-time favourite movies, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I was nervous. The open ending of the first installment was so note-perfect in leaving people free to draw their own conclusions about what happened that I didn't want it to be ruined. As such, I delayed seeing this as long as possible.<br/><br/>I should have delayed longer. Much longer. Like, forever.<br/><br/>Simply put, ""Before Sunset"" takes a couple of intriguing, interesting, fully-drawn characters and turns them into insufferable cads, caught up in their own memories and having achieved nothing of note in their lives in ten years. It takes a beautiful, sweet chance romantic encounter and turns it into the cornerstone of these characters' lives. And it tries to make us believe that there's nothing better out there to hope for, ever. What a thoroughly depressing message! What injustice to these characters, who deserved a whole lot better! Of all the scenarios I ever imagined for these two, this was not it.<br/><br/>The first movie was great because it was about two people meeting by chance and truly connecting. But in the second movie, we're led to believe that since then, neither of them has managed to connect with anyone else. Both are in unsatisfying relationships when they meet up again - that part is not that hard to believe. But what is depressing in a creepy stalker-ish sort of way is that Hawke's character has devoted years of his life to writing about Delpy's, and that Delpy's character has devoted a significant amount of time to seeking out Hawke's character for a reunion.<br/><br/>Too, the movie downplays the thorny issue of marital infidelity and home-wrecking; people rooting for Hawke and Delpy to get back together should stop romanticizing everything and take a good hard look at the fact that they're cheering for a guy to leave (or at least cheat on) his wife and ditch his kid for a girl he had a one-night stand with nine years earlier. As for Delpy, she's writing and recording songs about a guy SHE had a one-night stand with. And neither of them quite realize the irony - that they're throwing away everything real in their lives in order to chase a fantasy that never really existed.<br/><br/>The first movie was great precisely because the characters were practical about the circumstances of their meeting; they accepted the fact that their connection was strong but brief, and that long-distance relationships don't work, and that the future is unpredictable. But neither took their own advice - instead, it seems they have been living hollowed half-existences for the past nine years, just waiting to find each other again.<br/><br/>And when they do, what exactly do they find? Is it realistic to think that these two will get along once they try to spend more than a single day together? It's all too obvious that they have nothing in common - even from the first movie, it's obvious that they differ politically, philosophically and culturally, and that the only reason they have such a great relationship is because it only lasts a night. By the second movie, they have grown even further apart on all those issues, plus they each carry around idealized, imaginary versions of one another that they have invented over a nine-year period and that will be impossible to live up to. Relationships - real relationships - are hard work, full of ups and downs, but they're *real*. What these two have isn't real. What they have is, well, just plain sad.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you not to, because once you have seen it, there's no going back. These characters deserve so much better - just use your imagination."

","First of all, I'm just a little bit amazed that this movie is in the top 250 movies of IMDb.<br/><br/>'Before Sunset' continues the gabfest that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke had in 'Before Sunrise'. Of course, they're older now, they promised to meet up when they parted the first time, they didn't, and now Delpy marches in on Hawke when he's giving a book reading in Paris. Soon, they're walking around talking about Important Things and all of that yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>In all honestly, I had to stop this film because I was falling asleep. Although it significantly picked up when they were talking about their relationship, all the other mumbo-jumbo I could have did without. Although they both compliment how good they look, both look like hell here, and this was somewhat of a painful sit through."

","This one is not quite the same level as Before sunrise. That was the first part of the whole story. Where Part 1 was very real and realistic about emotions. Part 2 was very predictable and a little bit silly. I'ts a lot more difficult to feel one with either one of the characters. The love seems like gone after all those years. But they still love each other but they don't want to admit it. Then the end is really bad, I think. For me it was like worse it couldn't be. The movie itself turned me down yet. But the end drowned me in an ocean of predictability. I even cannot understand that no one of the actors felt that this story wasn't worth it to play. Or that they didn't realize after seeing it that it would be turning off a lot of fans of the first part."
"claudecat","6","2","6","27 January 2005"," pleasant, but not as good as ""Before Sunrise""
","This film has a lot of things going for it: the acting feels realistic, especially at the beginning, when the characters meet and feel awkward after so many years apart. The conversations they have are interesting and character-revealing, and you wish you could join in. Some of the transitions between topics are clumsy--I heard that the director and actors improvised the script, so I guess they weren't able to connect some of the ideas they had on different days. But the dialogue still has more depth than most, and if you liked ""Before Sunrise"", you'll enjoy finding out what happened to Céline and Jesse.<br/><br/>However, in spite of its virtues, I thought the film was really lacking something, and I think it was a topic outside of the two main characters. The first film always had as a subtext the idea of travel, and the transient experiences travelers have. This film behaves as though these two people are the most fascinating in the world, and the camera stays tightly on them, barely showing any of the Paris scenery. There are some interactions with other people at the beginning of the film, but that's it. It ended up making me feel that Celine and Jesse had become very self-involved--more so than when they were younger.<br/><br/>In pettier complaints, I kind of wish they hadn't explained some of the mysteries of the first movie, especially with the ""she says no when she means yes"" attitude. I also hated the part where Céline says ""it's a woman thing,"" to explain why she lied about something. Sorry, but I don't tell lies like that.<br/><br/>A nice bonus is getting to hear Julie Delpy play the guitar and sing--I just wish I had gotten to hear the song about her cat!"
"ilikeimdb","7","2","6","22 January 2005"," I Frankly Don't Understand All of the Fuss
","Maybe one needs to watch Before Sunrise prior to viewing Before Sunset, but I would consider that to be a fatal flaw of any sequel issued so long after the first installment. I found this movie fairly disappointing given its high ratings: The first two-thirds of the movie truly moves at a french glacial pace and the dialog just goes on and on...what's the purpose? Avoidance? Lite repartee a long nine years after their intense tryst? The build up happens far too slowly to sustain interest; it isn't until the limo ride to the airport (via her apartment) that the emotionally significant part of the movie finally kicks in...and when it does, it's very good. Despite the pacing problems, all the dialog is well written and delivered naturally as though the actors had written the lines themselves (which, as you know, they did). This movie would have been much better had they jumped from the book signing (which also dragged on for too long) to the cafe and then to its ultimate conclusion. I didn't mind the movie leaving the conclusion open ended...If I were Uma, I'd have dumped him, too."
"howard.schumann","7","2","6","22 November 2004"," Charming but sophomoric
","In Richard Linklater's charming Before Sunset, the highly praised sequel to his 1995 film Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), now married with a four-year old son, is in Paris on the last leg of a book tour. Celine (Julie Delpy), his partner from a short-lived romance nine years ago, shows up at a roundtable for his book signing and they pick up almost immediately where they left off. Jesse has eighty minutes before he has to leave to catch his plane and that is how long the movie lasts. They go for coffee and take a walk through Paris. They talk and talk, then talk some more. Without pausing to take a breath, as if fearful of a moment of silence, they engage in non-stop conversation about the world situation, the element of chance in their lives, the environment, relationships between men and women, and their memories of what actually occurred in Vienna. <br/><br/>Celine talks about how unfulfilling her life has been and there is a sad undertone of remorse and regret for the things that might have been. Jesse complains about his unrewarding marriage but does not take responsibility for his lack of satisfaction or consider the commitments he made to his wife and son. In a strange sequence in a restaurant, they both light up cigarettes and blow smoke in each other's faces, a scene that is incongruous in light of Celine's passion for the environment. Does Linklater want to send a message to young viewers that smoking is romantic? One would have thought that in the intervening years, Mr. Linklater's characters would have acquired a reasonable degree of emotional maturity but such is not the case and all the sexual banter and philosophical posturing feels sophomoric.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been made to another film that consisted mainly of conversation, My Dinner with André. That film was not only intellectually stimulating but emotionally satisfying, an experience that allowed us in the space of two hours to re-explore our own lives and rethink the way we see the universe. Before Sunset is not in the same league. Some are calling it ""breathless"", ""sweet"", ""smart"", and ""one of the supreme movie romances of the post-'80s era"", but to me it falls far short of those accolades. It is a well directed and well acted film with great picture-postcard shots of Paris (that carefully avoids the congestion and urban blight), some witty dialogue, and a very clever ending. What it lacks is an ability to communicate the unfathomable grace of love in a way that transcends banality."

","At first these two seem too successful and idealistic and cliché to care much about them. It's kind of sweet, but kind of naive too. So I said to myself, this whole thing needs pathos. Then the pathos came but I couldn't muster much emotion either, so I apportioned the blame to the director, the writers and the actors in equal shares, which are basically three shares , Linklater, Hawke and Delpy. And then, when I didn't expect anything else, came the magic: Julie Delpy sings a waltz, and it stays with the movie for the few minutes that are left. I don't know if that's worth the price of admission but it's kind of mean to regret having paid it."

","In Before Sunrise they were young twenty somethings who had not yet truly found 'the one', and through one night, experienced something fleeting and magical that almost seemed to fill that missing piece of the puzzle. They were strangers and there was nothing tricky or hidden to be surveyed, and their emotional baggage was light; it was a straightforward meet cute. Initially it seems to be again one of those chance encounters that happens only in movies. We are under the impression that Jesse is over the moon to once again see Celine, and that she also wants the chance to make up for not being there at the train station. They fall into the same conversational rhythms that seem so familiar, and then slowly, Linklater reveals their new lives.<br/><br/>9 years ago they were relatively unbroken, and innocent, and unburdened by life. And it was a truly magical moment too, but it was just that; a moment, constricted by time. Here, they are again constricted, but not in the same way, and they know it too; Jesse extends and extends the encounter beyond what they initially agree to, a coffee, and desperately grabs at any chance to rekindle that moment and feeling - he will not again leave her on that platform. In the back of their minds, obstructions linger: a broken marriage, a long distance boyfriend, career aspirations that are miles apart. <br/><br/>Jesse has not forgotten. In fact, he reveals, he has thought on it at just about any spare moment, and daringly, right before his wedding (this seems to be a rather careful treading of the waters, testing how receptive Celine will be). It is not immediately evident, but we notice (shots of the last encounter run through Jesse's mind as he dodges reporter's questions). The dialogue is timid and tentative, and hesitant of the topic on the audience's minds; they update each other on their lives, and seem to take an eternity to broach the all important question of relationship status. It is masterful how Linklater sets up their defenses - well Celine's, because Jesse is all but spilling by about halfway through. She acts forgetful; did they have sex, or didn't they? Where exactly did they visit again? Meanwhile Jesse puts on a cynical, jaded mask, and as they muse on the world's affairs, he criticises the modern sense of entitlement, but we and Celine see right through this; he is almost begging for another Vienna. When she jokingly proposes a scenario, he brushes clean a park bench and eagerly throws her onto his lap. That would have worked 9 years ago. <br/><br/>They muse that maybe they are only good at the brief encounters, the ones that seem to last a small eternity in the romance novels and movies. Jesse throws his head into his hands in regret, and glances sidewards to see if Celine has the same reaction. She does not betray it easily. He remembers every crystal clear detail of his memory, including thinking of her as he walks into a deli with an umbrella on his wedding day, and she counters that she lived only two streets away, as if she is slowly beginning to feel it too. And then she cracks in the car, and reveals that she too has been dwelling on it endlessly, and that she is just as vulnerable, and we begin to understand how that one night has shaped their romantic expectations ever since. She has written a song about it, performed so tenderly by Delphy, and though she jokes that she inserts different names into it depending on whom she is wooing, we know the truth. <br/><br/>Before Sunset asks more questions of Jesse and Celine. It offers the same feeling, and the same love, but now they are older, more cumbersome, and juggling real life obstacles that make a dreamy night in Vienna no longer possible. And yet, there is still something between them. At first, they put on a pretense that they have their lives together, and that they are not bothered by the missed opportunity. Then they confess this is not the case. And then slowly but gradually, in the same space of time as before, they fall for each other again. ""Baby, you are gonna miss that plane"", she croons, and Jesse responds that he knows. And we all know it too."
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","14 March 2015"," Man, it's great to be alive
","Initially, I had planned to watch Richard Linklater's Before trilogy in three days, watching one film after another. However, upon viewing Before Sunrise, along with writing the review, I took note that this trilogy was about time, time progression, and how people respond with being in company with one another for either an extended period of time or, in contrast, a relatively short period of time sporadically. I thought in order to make the trilogy bear a wee bit more relevance and realism for me, as a viewer, seeing as impatiently waiting nine years between each film to see them in theaters was an option I missed, I'd distance each film by about two weeks (and with the amount of films I watch in between, there would hopefully be little obsessing over what happens to the characters in between that time). My confession to you, the reader, is that it took all of my strength not to watch Before Sunset sooner than I had scheduled it; Before Sunrise is the kind of film that blindsides you so greatly, and tickles your human spirit so tenderly, that when it's over, knowing there's more films of the like makes you want to seek those others out immediately. Unfortunately, I had to exercise some restraint in the process to at least add some personal realism to this series; like I was impatiently waiting with these characters to see one another again.<br/><br/>Before Sunset picks up exactly nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, which focused on an American man named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a Frenchwoman named Céline (Julie Delpy) met aboard a train in Vienna and spent the entire day roaming and conversing through the city, agreeing to meet nine years later in the same place. Jesse is back overseas, however, this time in Paris, doing a book tour for the novel he wrote about his encounter with Céline and how it changed his life. During the book tour, he runs into Céline, shocked as can be, as he recalls how their original meeting didn't go as scheduled because she presumably forgot about their agreement to meet. It turns out, a personal tragedy occurred in Céline's life, making her unable to meet up with him. Now, however, they are together and spend a brief but glorious day in Paris together, again, roaming the streets talking about philosophy, personal happiness, their own lives, their own musings, and so forth, all captured under the beautiful streets and attractions that Paris has to offer.<br/><br/>Hawke and Delpy have officially made themselves comfortable in the roles of Jesse and Céline. In this effort, they seem more relaxed with one another, especially Hawke, who has made his character assume more of a pleasantly comic role, but never to any particular fault. Delpy's character, on the other hand, has grown more cynical to the idea of love and attraction, remarking how the past two guys she dated wound up breaking up with her and finding love immediately following the break up. ""Why couldn't they ask me to marry them?,"" she asks Jesse, in a crying fit in a taxi, ""I would've said 'no,' but the least they could've done was ask."" Jesse, on the other hand, is married with a kid, and breathlessly doing a handful of book tours. He's not happy, surprisingly enough, but just passively content with his life. He admits his marriage isn't provided with the romantic/fairy-tale idealism that he's madly in love with the person he sleeps with every day, but that he respects, cares for, and trusts his wife as a person, which, he believes, is what it comes down to ultimately. However, any thinking person can see what Jesse and Céline share is true love. After nine years of no contact, and not even knowing each others last names of full backgrounds, the two can assimilate back into a particular environment and pick up a conversation that's laid dormant for nine years as if it was just discussed on the previous day. On top of that, it's important to note how comfortable the two souls are around one another, sharing personal opinions and diving into past experiences in a way that only happens with one other person once in a blue moon. If you can recall one experience you've had with another person where you and them divulged personal details with one another because you felt explicitly comfortable and safe in their presence, you are an incredibly lucky soul. If you can hold on to that, you're an even more fortunate person.<br/><br/>Before Sunset, above all, is a continuation of Linklater's fascination and study of time and human interaction. He has constructed two very interesting and complex characters and has given them the ability to reconnect with one another every nine years. With that, he toys with settings, ideas, and philosophies, and essentially uses these two souls to communicate thoughts and ideas about how we interact and how times heals, impacts, and effects all of us, especially our relationships, in different ways. Before Sunset is a beautiful continuation; a love-letter and joyous appreciation for the human spirit, with two great actors even more adjusted and oriented to their roles than ever before, leaving for seventy-seven minutes of rich and potent dialog. If you don't extract something from this film, or feel something, I may need to check you for a pulse.<br/><br/>Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater."

","The writing and acting are once again remarkable. Julie Delpy is enchanting and phenomenal as Céline. The film takes place nine years after the events of ""Before Sunrise"" and begins with Jesse being interviewed about his novel ""This Time"", which was inspired by his encounter with Céline on 16 June 1994. A journalist asks him if the book was autobiographical. In this scene, Jesse was serving as a stand-in for the director and co-writer Richard Linklater since, as I mentioned in my review of the first film, it was based on his encounter with a woman in 1989. The line is also significant as Jesse's marital problems reflect those of Ethan Hawke, who was in the process of divorcing Uma Thurman at the time that the film was made.<br/><br/>Many of the things that I loved about this film are the same as those that I loved about ""Before Sunrise"" so I won't repeat myself. One thing that I loved about this film in particular was the brilliant exploration of how Jesse and Céline had changed over the course of the last nine years, for better and for worse, and the ways in which their experiences in the first film affected them, again for better and for worse. <br/><br/>In the first film, it was left ambiguous as to whether or not they had sex. In this film, that ambiguity was eliminated, which was my only disappointment with either film as I loved that. However, it is an incredibly minor thing and, given how much time they spend talking about sex in the film, it would have been farcical if they didn't discuss what happened that night."

What I saw was a woman constantly griping about everything, finding any way she could to turn every comment of her husband's into cause for an argument, and since the movie is little more than dialogue, this and the vulgarity made it difficult to endure. Having read Ms. Delpy's self-description, then seeing she was one of the primary writers, it all made sense. She simply played herself, no acting required. Now, I certainly can't tell anyone to forgo an 8.0 rated film, but if I could, I would. It really isn't worth spending 109 minutes hearing ""f""."

","The second half of a movie that started 10 years ago, the second half of a relationship with these people. Few things have changed since; so again we have a film worked in someone's typewriter; two actors of some talent brought in to improvise a chemistry and flesh a connection; a passive camera attached to these people, more or less the same medium shot tracking them down Paris.<br/><br/>We get to see that both have changed since we first met them. She has grown despondent in her spirited idealism, his cynicism has been mellowed by more experience inside of him. Both have been deeply shaken by an encounter with the emptiness of life. Otherwise it plays very much like that earlier film, except with anxieties that have matured along with them.<br/><br/>But this one has the additional benefit of layering in that first film, a second perspective that was missing there. The man has written a book from the events that we experienced as that film. It could have been very potent stuff, like 2046 is to In the Mood for Love. There is some effort to comment on fictions shaped from memory, but it is light-weight stuff at best.<br/><br/>The other thing that could have been potent is how the gap between these two films is handled, the part that went unfilmed and is actual life away from the camera. How they handle it in turn, between them. It is again a disappointment; we know within the first 15 minutes all that is to know, who showed up and who didn't. It's even more slight if you consider that we got a film like Certified Copy since.<br/><br/>What is left is that scene where Celine goes boating. She gets to see the Seine from a perspective hitherto unexplored, a touristy view. They bare their souls with a little less cuteness this time, but maybe these two were not worth getting to know in the first place, or this filmmaker to tell us about them."

I felt it was perfect in every way.<br/><br/>I don't remember how many times I've seen this movie by now but I find myself totally drawn into it each time. It's just that every line, every face expression seem incredibly real and the chemistry between the two is wonderful.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Before Sunset is about Jesse and Celine meeting again 9 years after their one night in Vienna and talking their hearts out on the streets of Paris. However , somehow , none of their words sounds boring. This is a movie with not much going on at the surface but so much hidden on an emotional level. The outcome is an 80 minute journey through the most intimate thoughts of two people, disappointed and matured by life, only through plain dialog and close camera shots.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie is how it manages to make everything feel so real, natural and unpretentious. The long camera shots work wonders in creating this feeling of shear reality, simply caught on tape by someone passing by. Just real life, bittersweet and intimate,folding out in front of you. Simple and brilliant, I think these two adjectives perfectly describe its acting, its dialogs, its manner of filming. <br/><br/>As actors, Ethan and Julie must be one of the most honest on screen couples I know. The way Jesse looks at Celine, their face expression, their words, it all seems incredibly true and natural. I think the fact both actors participated in the writing of the script made it possible to create a feeling of authenticity rarely seen before. <br/><br/>There are so many scenes I love in this movie...basically all are special in their own way, as each gradually reveals one more bit of the characters, their past, their frustrations, their regrets, their real thoughts and feelings for each other.<br/><br/>One of the strongest and most emotional scenes for me is their talk in the car, when they finally unburden themselves and reveal how each other's memory has haunted their lives. The way in which touching perfection for one moment in time can make you permanently long for another glimpse of it in everything around you but won't ever be found the same in somebody else.<br/><br/>Finally, my favorite scene, Julie's expression while singing the waltz...so painful and moving. And then denying everything: ""So do you plug in this name for each guy that comes by?"" ""Yes, of course... what do you think, are you nuts?""<br/><br/>The ending is intriguing but one of the best it could have been, leaving so many questions to be answered. Will it be possible that they stay together? Is it possible to find that perfection again after all the time lost? Maybe like Jesse said at the beginning in the library, it all depends if you're an optimist or a pessimist..."

","This film is one of the best romantic love stories ever told. Smart, funny, real life. amidst the bumps and bruises of everyday life hope springs eternal. I laughed out loud and cried like a baby. Too bad it had to end. Obviously you choose your own ending. I say Jessie stayed in Paris and they picked up where they left off in Before Sunrise. At least, that's what i hope they did. The songs Julie Delpy sings are enchanting and lets your mind drift in and out of the story. Well done. Unlike other films, this one grabs your attention with sensitive dialog, intrigue and poignant moments. A classic love story from start to finish. I would put this up there with To Catch A Thief, North By Northwest or An Affair To Remember. It leaves you wanting more. So much more..."
"mdewey","8","1","2","30 April 2007"," OK, it's just a romance movie!
","I'm the type of film-goer who normally indulges his video appetite with crime drama, intrigue and Cold War suspense flicks. However, I now find myself vicariously watching this momentarily reunited couple walk and talk through the streets of Paris. What's going on here? What kind of bourgeois sentimentality is this? Why am I watching a romance film?<br/><br/>I'll tell you why: it's a gas! I had been so amped up with Iraqi war fatalities, Va. Tech. shooting news analyses, etc., that I needed something to watch to chill me out just a little. And this was just what Dr. Feelgood ordered. At first, I wondered whether Ethan Hawke was going to be another phony self-serving existentialistic pseudo novelist or was he going to lighten up and go a little further into his character. Alas, he did lighten up, and he and Julie hit it off from that initial meeting onward. But, to me, the real carrier of the thespian torch was undeniably Julie Delpy: No holds barred emotional outpouring, but without any accompanying self-pity. She encapsulated modern day woman, with all the verve, intelligence, beauty and also, the vulnerability. No shame in her game in an outstanding performance!<br/><br/>The two of them continued along their Parisian stroll with soul searching dialog and the usual ""what have you been doing?"" stuff, but, more importantly, with so much free-flowing wit and zest for life. My bottom line proof of enjoyment is while watching this movie unfold, I had a constant grin on my face, eating up the sequences of events and enjoying the related inevitable tension that was building up along their soulful journey.<br/><br/>But in the end, Julie's gorgeous 3/4 time song with her own vocal and guitar accompaniment coupled with the Nina Simone song shortly thereafter was an ever so poignant conclusion to a most memorable movie. As Ethan said about the plane to catch in the final scene... well, you see it for yourself!"

Richard Linklater created a whole film about a few hours spent between two reunited lovers who reminisce of their past together. The whole entire movie is a just one giant conversation. It is just absolutely incredible in every way. Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect of film and is perfect in every way possible.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."
"rogue_85","10","1","2","21 August 2005"," so simple and amazing
","So I just saw Before Sunset. It is such beautiful movie! I can see why this ranks # 112 in the top # 250. I can't believe I didn't think to see it before. My mom and I just about always watch DVD's and video's together (we have the same taste most of the time), she'd probably think this one is boring because it's all talk and no actual action (in sense of fighting or running and stuff). I usually go for a little speed in movies as well, don't get me wrong I like movies like this but when I'm in a videostore I don't go out of my way to find a jewel like this. I tend to go look for a good action/comedy or a thriller, but I just loved this movie. The story has no elaborate scheme to it, it was just so simple, the whole concept and how everything played out. It was so serene and just calm but up beat (it's somewhat contradicting I know) and in a real sense. The movie has a pace but like real time, it's not like a day went by in several minutes. It was very romantic and I was just intrigued by their conversation. The whole movie revolves around these two characters Jesse (Ethan) and Celine (Julie). I just love the simplicity of the whole movie.<br/><br/>It's amazing how a night, nine years ago, can make you realize that have so much in common with each other. Its funny that they can strike up a conversation after nine years that actually has some context to their experience and feelings, they make each other laugh, almost cry. They're just a perfect match, after knowing each other one night that happened nine years ago, they still have so much to talk about. Yeah, sure some of it (the beginning) is pure superficial BS and just politics and such, but still their conversation had a lot of substance to it. I just find it incredible that someone is able to know another person like that and be able to 'pour' their heart out after one night. (sorry, I can't seem to get over the one night thing.) It is just so unlikely that 2 people that met each other nine years ago, spent one night together and still remember everything that happened, meet again to find that they still feel the same way about each other. That one person, one night, deciding to show up or not can make someone dismantle their whole believe system on what love should be like, what life should be like. To be able to have such an impact on another life is just amazing. (it is to me, I've never met someone who had such an affect on me) Everything that happened in those nine years makes them the people they are today, they've changed but still they find that they're just made for each other. That one night can make such a difference in you're life...<br/><br/>There was never a dull moment in the movie, no real awkward silences, every silent moment had a purpose. I was an absolute pleasure to see the interaction between Ethan and Julie on screen. I was on the tip of my seat and I didn't want to miss and word that was spoken. This basically never happens to me! I was just so amazed by the connection and conversation between the two characters. A while back I met a friend from grade school, we hadn't spoken in 6 years and we had absolutely nothing to talk about. It was so weird, 'cause we were friends back then and we got along fine, but now it's like there's nothing there. I guess that's why I was fascinated by these characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it is just, I don't know I can't explain, you just have to see it. And if you don't like it, well I don't know what to think of that but I'd definitely like to hear why not. <br/><br/>These are a couple of quotes from the movie that I really liked.<br/><br/>""Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past."" ""I guess a memory's never finished as long as you're alive."" ""If you don't believe in any kind of magic or mystery you're basically as good as dead."""
"abbutterflie","10","1","2","15 August 2005"," Brilliant brilliant film
","I love this film. I like it better than the first one. They're older, not so idealistic, so maybe it seems more realistic. And even more poignant, because now, second time round, you know they mustn't let the other get away, so throughout you sit holding your breath, waiting to see whether they do end up just talking again, just making the brief connection, or whether this time they really seize the moment and are prepared to risk allowing the connection to be permanent. I didn't realise how profoundly it had affected me, how many little bits of it have kept playing on in my subconscious since I saw it the first time round. And it's so subtle, like with the first one, the emotion is portrayed with just a glance or a gesture. A hand reaching out to touch the other but pulled back at the last moment, a look of longing or sadness, an angry outburst that you know is misdirected, but genuine nonetheless. It's harder to be as cynical about this one than it is about the first because they themselves aren't so naive, so even jaded people who don't believe true love happens outside of the movies, but still deep inside wish that the happy endings could be true if only life didn't get in the way, can find something to identify with."
"analyst12","9","1","2","11 July 2005"," Beautifully Imperfect
","What made ""Before Sunrise"" so wonderful was that the two primary characters were flawed like real people. They were occasionally vulgar, or rude, or annoying, but we never stopped liking them.<br/><br/>The truest accomplishment of ""Before Sunset"" is that these same flawed characters remain steadfast in their imperfections, but have gained an additional wordly-wise maturity. What's more important is that in the follow-up of the one night in Vienna, we see how profoundly the experience shaped the two characters in the same wonderfully eccentric, artful, and pensive ways.<br/><br/>The growth of these characters in the interim seems so natural, it literally feels like we're reunited with them, following this conversation with the same curiosity and shyness. What's more, is that the artistic spirit of the original film carries with emotional resonance through the picture's conclusion. There are no easy questions, and no easy answers, provided in the film.<br/><br/>Best of all, it sensuously exposes the audience's predisposition for ""canned"" plots - where we strive to see things neatly tied up and concluded. I must admit that more than anything else, the unanswered questions in the film are more interesting than the loose ends that they tie up. At one point early on in the film, Jesse remarks to three readers of his book that one is a romantic, one is a skeptic, and the other is neutral. The romantic fills in the ending in a way that holds true to romance, the skeptic toward realistic pragmatism, and the neutral simply accepts the ending at face value.<br/><br/>And I loved it. It's so atypical of any ""romance"" or ""drama"" film out there because it's so unabashedly human, imperfect, awkward, sensuous, ambiguous, and ultimately, perhaps even hopeful."

There isn't more romantic city than Paris. Congratulations to Julie and Ethan."

","""Before Sunset"" is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Watched is the wrong word - experienced is the correct word. With each scene I was drawn into the dynamics of these reunited lovers. I felt the nervous excitement that existed between the two. I could see myself in both of these characters and in their life situation. The complexity of emotions were wonderfully developed with each passing moment.<br/><br/>How many of us decide to pursue our best self instead of our honest self? How many of us don't understand that our best self comes from our honest self? How many of us live afraid of really loving? This movie explores the conundrum in which I believe the majority of us find ourselves;living lives that have caught our eyes instead of our hearts. In our cynical world most of us don't believe that love can or does occur in a matter of moments."

","For those who were thoroughly disappointed by Before Sunrise, I have this to say: everything which did not work out then will come into place in Before Sunset as if by magic.<br/><br/>I didn't even know what hit me.<br/><br/>But it wasn't simply magic. This film is the product of the daring in a director, the maturity in the script and the honesty in the actors. If you have lived life, you would have known the anguish, the pain, the bittersweet and the what-might-have-been wistfulness that comes with romance. Stripped of melodrama, a singular curse of most Hollywood movies these days, this is about the most feeling film you can get.<br/><br/>Now for the magical part. The ending was so sleek and such a tease. The crowd at the cinema I was watching erupted into rapturouos chuckles when everybody found out how they've allowed themselves to be had.

","This movie is nothing less than magic. How I look at this movie is, we should watch the movie keeping aside any conventions we believe in. For example we should not think or worry at all about the fact that Jesse is married or if Jesse and Celine get together at the end. It really does not matter. We should just focus on the magic they create when they are together. We should just live like them in that particular moment and periodically looking back to the past. The best part of the movie is it created the magic between them instantly as it did in Before Sunrise.<br/><br/>Awesome movie"

","This is a film that has an European look. Director Richard Linkletter has decided to continue the story in a way we can accept it. In Jesse and Celine, he has found an attractive couple who play well together and what's more important, they get our attention from the beginning.<br/><br/>
Jesse and Celine belong together, as it's obviously noted in the film. In spite of the movie being a continuous dialog, it never bores, but one can see that the picture is not for everybody. Mr. Linkletter's great achievement has been the fact that he kept it at 80 minutes long, anything more than that would had bored us, perhaps.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy has a radiant beauty. She seems to be more mature for her years. On the other hand, Ethan Hawke shows more chiseled features; he seems to be older. Delpy and Hawke play well together. As it happens when people that have a lot in common and where there's a real friendship, these two can stay away from one another, but the moment they meet, they pick up where they left off.<br/><br/>Since the director and his two stars collaborated with the screen play, it is easy to see they all were very attuned to the material and it shows on the screen."
"szsakall","9","1","2","24 June 2004"," A Memory is Never Finished
","We saw a sneak preview of Before Sunset last night and then rushed home to revisit its precursor--Before Sunrise--on video. I can sum up the appeal that Linklater's diptych holds for me in a few words, spoken by Julie Delpy's character in the first film, which both works live by:<br/><br/>    You know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something... I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
(you can read the whole script here, if you're in the mood--although I wouldn't recommend that; in general, it's not the matter of these conversations which is so compelling, but the manner in which they are conducted--and you've gotta watch the film to experience that!)<br/><br/>In keeping with my preference for revisiting the old, rather than scratching vainly at the scab of ""absolute originality"", I liked the second film even more than the first. Or perhaps I should say that the second has added lustre to the first. And a third, if made in the same spirit as these two, would undoubtedly have a similarly intensifying effect. This is, of course, why I love corporate comics so much--I truly do believe that, the more you think earnestly about anything you ever loved, the better it gets. These films stake out a philosophic/aesthetic position which is in direct opposition to the one that Charlie Kaufman puts into the mouth of ""wise fool"" Donald, in Adaptation:<br/><br/>    I loved Sarah. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want. You are what you love, not what loves you. <br/><br/><br/><br/>No way! A memory is never ""yours"". It must always be rebuilt through narrative. And a story is always told to someone else--even if that someone else is an idealized projection of your own mind. You aren't ""what you love"", you're a part of whatever you help bring to light through interaction with others. Implicit in Donald's statement is the idea that the artist's task is to nail down the way he/she feels about the world--capturing objects in the treacle of love like flies trapped in amber. I can't agree with this at all. I prefer to see art as the attempt to create ""a soundtrack, magnetized, out of sync, to the filmstrip of the (intersubjective) Sublime"".<br/><br/>Near the beginning of Before Sunset, Delpy asks Hawke why he wrote an entire novel about one night that happened nine years before the events in the sequel. After hemming and hawing his way through a bunch of stock responses, Hawke finally admits that he wrote the book in the hope that she would see it, read it, and show up to discuss it with him. In other words, it was an attempt, as Hawthorne would put it, ""to open up an intercourse with the world."" He gets his wish--and the discoveries that these two make about what ""really"" happened to them in the first film expose the proprietary theory of memory for the sham that it is. Our lives don't belong to us. We rent them to each other at sympathetic rates."
"lahdidah","10","1","2","22 March 2004"," Great movie completely dependent on dialogue
","Though not due out in theaters until July, I saw this film at a screening at the South By Southwest Film festival in Austin last week.  The movie is completely dialogue-based, and in order to pull a movie like that off, you must have an amazing script and amazing actors.  In this case, both are present.  The movie flows so well, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy interact so well, you would think that Linklater encouraged them to improvise practically the entire movie, but during the Q&A session after the screening he said that not one line was improvised.  It's rated 'R' for some language, but nothing is too shocking because it all fits together so well.<br/><br/>
I would strongly encourage everyone to see this movie - especially those true romantics out there.  Depending on the marketing of the movie, it might come across as a chick flick, but I saw it with a group of three guys and another girl, and the guys all loved it also.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that though this is a sequel, you don't need to see ""Before Sunrise"" to really get and enjoy this movie.  It stands alone quite well.<br/><br/>On a side note - As well as being the lead actress, Julie Delpy also was one of the screenwriters, and also wrote and performed much of the music in the movie.  She is amazing!"

","I never expected to see a sequel to Before Sunrise and had I heard that they would be making one, I would have simply asked why.  But having seen a screening of it, I profess that Linklater has managed to capture the magic again.<br/><br/>Linklater, et al, have successfully brought us another wonderful and intimate film with Hawke and Delphy.  Their characters have grown into adults in a way that you would have hoped and expected without being predictable.  Delphy and Hawke have a unique and pleasant chemistry that keeps you rooting for them the whole time.  I'm sure these two are very close in real life.<br/><br/>The setting and scenery are perfect and left me longing for a trip to Europe and lamenting the fact that I wasn't actually watching this in Europe.<br/><br/>One of the many things that impressed me the most about this film is the fact that you need not see the first one in order to understand this one. Another thing that impressed me is the perfect title, ""If Not Now"". I'm glad that this is the title.  It would cheat the whole charm of the film if they went with something like, ""Before...this"", or ""After...that"".  A title like that would only be pandering to the marketing department, not to mention the fact that it would make it sound like Ice Cube's ""Friday"" series.<br/><br/>Before I conclude I would also like to applaud the fantastic ending.  Not many filmmakers can pull and ending off like that without leaving an audience feeling cheated.  In this case the opposite is true and I left feeling rewarded and satisfied."

Anyway, the movie is again too long, the conversations too boring, the events too dull, the end too cringy ... Again, too overrated"

","Well, if you want to watch two unattractive 30-something smokers who talk a load of philosophical twaddle while attempting to intellectually crawl through the absurdity of the X Generation's philosophical pretense to , um, get laid or whatever, then you might actually force yourself to watch this tripe all the way through.<br/><br/>It's a silly and meaningless film, fatuous, but it will probably appeal to the armchair philosopher who undoubtedly believes he's watching something, like, um, really deep as he discusses it over the wrong wine with the crappy shrimp dinner  The acting is pretty good, in the sense that the actors are not self-conscious (unlike the film) and can at least remember their lines, but the script is simply a wordy pseudo-intellectual waste of time, flecked with the tell-tale anxiety that is always present when the superficial attempt to describe existence. I am sure the writers believe they're intellectuals, breaking barriers in dealing with ongoing male/female angst don't you know, throwing in a few French phrases to flatter the audience, who also think they're intellectuals but whose French is limited to ""oui"" and ""Coca Cola"", but who cares  In the end, no one cares. In the end it's a romance that's not romantic.<br/><br/>Some critics on this board have attempted to compare this to ""My Dinner with Andre"", which is truly a masterpiece of writing (and a 9/10). ""Before Sunset"" has only a pale semblance to that great film.<br/><br/>Four out of 10 only because the actors do a great job with a pretentious script."

","We pick up the lives of Jesse and Céline in mid-stride. When we left them at the end of Before Sunrise, they refused to exchange addresses and last names, but were going to meet in Vienna in six months. Nine years later, we glimpse their lives again. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has finished a book and is giving a reading/discussion and Shakespeare and Co. in Paris. At the end of the reading, he spies Céline (julie Delpy) watching from the wings. They go for a walk to catch up before he has to head to the airport. During this walk we learn that they did not meet up in Vienna, and have both attempted to move on in their lives. <br/><br/>There are several things that make this movie stand out. First, this is a movie of dialogue and discussion about live, living and one's views, beliefs and outlook. There are no explosions, chases, kisses, heists, plot twists, etc. This is just two people talking. What I loved about the two films is the easy and open way in which these two discuss trivial and deeply personal subjects and how they are intermixed. What else made this film engaging was the warts-and-all approach to life. These characters weren't glamorous or glamorized, they were just people. And the fact that they picked up and explored the people they had become from mid-20s to mid-30s, who had strayed quite a distance from the idealized vision of their future they had had nine years earlier really brought it home. I too, am different and worse than the me I had planned on being 9 years ago. The only problem I had with this film was the character of Céline, it didn't ring true to me, too much idealism left and until she wigged out in the taxi, I didn't buy into her life.<br/><br/>This movie is like crispy french fries and special fry sauce. In the west, fry sauce is a big deal. It is usually a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise with various spices and flavors added. Special fry sauce is a sauce the cooks (me included) used to whip up at Carousel Ice Cream Parlour in Provo, Utah in 1995 for ourselves and a few other employees. It had regular fry sauce, BBQ sauce and more mayo to make it a little tangier and better than the regular. Now this movie doesn't have much to do with the flavor or texture of special fry sauce and crispy French fries, but I only worked at Carousel in 95 and the experiential phenomena surrounding this dish (that I only ate during one year) overwhelm the taste in my mind . I was a different Poco back then, and thinking about the super fry sauce take me back to a more idealistic youth and the big plans I had for myself. 7/10<br/><br/>http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

","I saw and liked Before Sunrise when it first came out. It was a watchable romantic-comedy without being exceptional. I only saw it because of limited film choices at that time. I guess I had a broader range of films to see when the sequel Before Sunset came out and only saw it recently because the high IMDb user rating sparked my interest.<br/><br/>First off, it is better than the original. It's been the case with several movies that the sequel bettered the original e.g. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Spider-Man 2, LOTR: Return of the King and (I know I'm stirring up some controversy) The Godfather - 2.<br/><br/>Before Sunset starts out very well. We are given a short and sweet recap on the events of Before Sunrise. You can comfortably watch Sunset without having seen the original. We then have Celine and Jesse walking through Paris chatting and catching up on their lives. They also take a short boat ride on the Seine and eventually a car ride to Celine's flat while continuing their conversation.<br/><br/>The entire film is a conversation between two people with no action. What makes the film unique is that the conversation sounds very natural, the kind of conversation two normal, intelligent people who click would have. That, plus the beauty of Paris makes this very viewable and romantic. We have a bombshell or two dropped along the way about what the two have been up to in the past nine years. It adds to audience interest and the complexity of where they find themselves vis-a-vis each other.<br/><br/>Sunset comes badly undone in the last 10 minutes. The moment Celine starts singing ""Let me sing you a waltz"" and mimicking Nina Simone, the film nosedives. The conversation becomes unreal and forced where throughout the movie it had seemed so natural. The ending was a cop-out. The story needed to find an end and me being a noir fan, you can guess what end I would have preferred."

","move more quickly because they can tell the other person what they're thinking under the guise of telling a third person. They don't have time to mess around with each other's minds. If the attraction that they feel isn't mutual, it's not like the next day things will change. They won't even see each other the next day. It's a way to be sure that they're still on the same page romantically and the scene works perfectly.<br/><br/>There are others great tidbits--including a natural conversation about past lovers over a pinball machine, a guy playing a harpsichord, a ferris wheel ride, when they say 'goodbye' early in the evening to avoid it later--I mean, so many. Most of these scenes are edited in long, single takes, that can't help but feel realistic. There are no quick cuts in real life.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how everyone should see this. There is no big sex scene. At the end of the film, we're not sure what exactly happened between them and we don't know if they'll ever see each other again. There are arguments for every position. But for those few hours in Vienna, the couple do exactly what we all wish we had the courage to do.<br/><br/>This film gets better the older I get. It is so much smarter than the other boy-meets-girl films that we've been forced to sit through in the past ten years."

","I recently viewed Before Sunset in March. Coming into I had not seen ""Before Sunrise"" (you do NOT have to see it, Before Sunset gives you the back story). I was truly amazed at how Director Richard Linklater does with words. The whole movie is crafted upon conversation, often funny, sometimes sad, but always containing insight. Actress Julie Delpy gives an amazing performance as the neurotic Celine. Ethan Hawke, too, stands his ground as regretful Jesse. The actors were terribly denied any acting awards, which is a true shame. Another nice thing about the film is the lovely scenery. Taking place in gorgeous Paris, we get to see the inner city, parks, café's, and more. The soundtrack is also worth picking up. Actress Julie Delpy serves as chanteuse to the record with 3 of her lovely songs on there, including ""A Waltz For A Night"" which she performs in character at the end of the film. This is one of my favorite films and I hope this review makes it one of yours as well!"
"FilmOtaku","7","1","3","13 March 2005"," An interesting romance film
","I didn't remember seeing the first film of this series, ""Before Sunrise"" until some of the footage from that film was featured in its sequel, ""Before Sunset"", also directed by Richard Linklater. The premise of the story is that in 1995, Celine (Delpy), a young French woman and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are two young strangers that meet in Vienna and spend the kind of night together anyone with half of a brain and an ounce of romance in them would envy. They walk, they talk, they sit, they talk, they have sex, they talk. And throughout the evening, they realize that they are probably meant to be together forever. She has to leave, but they tell each other that they will meet in Vienna in six months. ""Before Sunset"" picks up 9 years later, and Jesse is on the last leg of a European book tour, in France. The book is based on his experiences that night, so it of course shocks and awes him when he looks over at the patrons of the bookstore and sees Celine. They proceed to spend the next 75 minutes or so walking, talking, sitting, talking, and figuring out what ""could have been"".<br/><br/>The story is so much deeper than I actually portray it, but the film is indeed a simple one. Essentially done in real time, the camera never leaves the two characters as they walk around Paris, sit in a coffee house and ride on a ferry boat. Because the film is so simple, the story has to be substantial, and it is. Even if one has not seen ""Before Sunrise"", it is easy to not only figure out the back story (thanks to the use of clips from that film) but to become emotionally invested in the characters of Celine and Jesse. The chemistry between these two actors is substantial, and the characters themselves are so likable that even though I normally have a complete disinterest in either actor separately, together I find them charming. The actual conversations (ranging from the regular ""catch-up"" stuff to existentialism) are really so natural; they did not seem forced or staged, an easy hole to slip in to with such a dialogue-heavy film. I'm sure that the incredible backdrop of Paris didn't hurt the romantic undertone of the film. There were a couple of conveniences that seemed to betray the otherwise intelligent feel of the film, namely the fact that Jesse's marriage story is a complete cliché, not unlike any number of stories someone hears at a cheesy pick-up joint. Fortunately in that instance, (though I can't completely forgive it) the connection between them is so obvious that it somehow (though not completely) seems a little less sleazy.<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is nominated for an Oscar for its screenplay, a choice that I find very interesting and agree with. It is worth of its nomination (though will doubtfully win), and it's also one of the few romance films made after 1968 that I actually enjoy  because it has a brain. 7/10 --Shelly"

I found the actors were able to maintain their chemistry mixed with anticipation of what each of them was going to do next. Both actors did a great job of appearing nervous yet natural. It was nice to see both characters had evolved, yet remained the same. I felt both ethan and julie did a fantastic job of recreating their connection.

"flor_silesky","10","1","3","24 November 2004"," A ""thanks"" to the writers of the movie... a very personal comment
","It's been such a long time, acting, pretending to be someone else - not one, but many- I no longer recognized myself. It sounds cheesy, and even normal, and that's what it is, completely normal. All human beings are supposed to belong, to adapt themselves. Even the criminals adapt themselves to a certain way of living, to a certain group, and they follow the description of their role in society like it was a prescription. I'm not implying to be different, or special, but the contrary, I am totally common, totally normal. Just another human being with an existential crisis, suddenly trapped in her comfort spot comfortable, but frustrated, adapted, but miserable fearing life, above all. Just recently I watched a film that made me feel like I had been raped. Like someone came and saw my naked mind, my naked soul, possessed it and wrote it down to shoot it later in ""before sunset"". I am nothing like the perfect beautiful blond actress, and certainly I am not a successful intellectual activist although I do like the ""wonder woman feeling"", helping here and there once in a while. And neurotic? maybe I am a little of that. One of the scene shots in that movie, named ""Dying inside"" told my love life story in less than 4 minutes. It's funny how insignificant you feel after such a thing happens. My concepts of love, romanticism, independence and frustration are there, in those 4 minutes along with the funny story of boyfriends that break up with me and get married, and call me later to thank me for showing them what love was. And that passive anger of not having been asked of not having deserved that honor While I am sure I would have said no, and I am sure none of them were the right oneif such a thing exists. I've been hiding for 5 years behind the wall of rationalism. Logic, strength, independence. And all these years I have longed for that experience of romantic love that was stolen once, or many times in my past. It's funny when it doesn't matter anymore to tell the truth out in the open, for anyone to see it grasp it and maybe get the courage to tell their own I am just another woman longing for her blue prince to pick her up on a white horse and take her to his castle well not that simple of course. In my long 5 years of single life, I have managed to put together the most ridiculous huge and complicated list of perfect attributes for that blue prince In the end though, I guess it would be enough to know someone that makes me shiver just by the encounter of sights, that threatens my rational arguments and with whom I can forget the bullshit and simply be myself but believe me that alone is too complex to even get close to reality It's funny how human beings love to complicate the beautiful simplicity of life and when it becomes a vice I doubt it has a way back. I have a confession to make, I am a weak daydreamer of romantic love, like any other cheesy woman And I am dying inside pretending all the time the strength and independence I don't have. I saw my self in that movie, like I dared to face a mirror for the first time in my life and found a tiny little creature too scared to even look straight into her eyes. I wish I could thank the writers... for ""stealing my story"", in the end maybe that's the story of everyone... and somehow, that's a relief. In the meantime, I'll keep on laughing at myself until I am too tired to continue my own acting role and decide to show the real one if that ever happens.<br/><br/>22/11/04"

","I saw the first movie ""before sunrise"" years back and it is the best romantic film I have ever seen. Maybe because I love traveling. I love traveling because anything can happen when you are in a place you have never been. The excitement of what you will do and who you will meet. The first movie really is a prerequisite to this film. You will be lost and probably bored with this film if you do not see the first one. I don't think it can stand on its own. <br/><br/>The major difference I see is that the first film was also at a slower pace.<br/><br/>All the scenes seemed rushed a bit too much in this film. The characters have very similar behaviors still from the first film. I thought there was no chance they would ever make a sequel to the first film since it was so odd, so I was thrilled to see they actually did.<br/><br/>I have to say that I feel a bit sad seeing the film though. Both characters seem to have spent the last 9 years without what they really wanted in life.<br/><br/>Neither makes any claim to be happy or really even close. The ending was pretty powerful with the scenes in the cab. The film really should have been longer and paced slower I think. It does end on a note that is sort of not a good possible solution - as if life has gotten more complicated now that they are older and they are now hopelessly lost since they didn't make it work the first time around.<br/><br/>I am glad they made the film, and it does show that maybe when you are young, you can be very romantic, but when you get older, you are forced into reality by the structure of life. I highly recommend seeing both films. I could not recommend just seeing this film on its own."

The best part in the entire movie is the end but not just because it's over, the last few minutes of the movie were actually fairly good. Too bad the rest of it was just a bunch of filler.

"saarvardi","6","1","4","24 December 2005"," Leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied...
","The sequel to the adorable and dreamy Before Sunrise from 1995, Before Sunset meets the original film's characters, American writer Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French social activist Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years in the future, in the year 2004. The turn of the century definitely made it's impact on our two heroes, as did the turns of time. Now being 32 years old (as opposed to 23, the character's age in the first film), they are both much more mature and much less naive about what life has to offer them. Sure, on the outside they both made it well: Jesse is married with a child he thinks the world of, and is just visiting France during a PR tour for his recent published best seller (loosely based on his night with Celine, by the way). Celine, on the other hand, is engaged in a meaningful relationship as well, and after living several years in the states, where she finished her second degree, she is now an active member in several environmental organizations. Alas, underneath the surface, they are both aching inside. Neither of them is happy with the life he or she is leading, and they both find themselves compromising in cozy relationships and careers, with the memory of that mid-90's night still very much alive in their hearts and minds.<br/><br/>This time around, Jesse and Celine stroll around Paris rather than Vienna, and as much as this city is beautiful and filled with inspiration perhaps even more then Vienna, it is something we have seen in many films as well, and the cinematography doesn't really indicate something new about the city. As opposed to Sunrise, the two lost souls now only have time until Sunset to catch up with each other, when Jesse's flight back to the states leaves. They spend their few hours together talking about their 1994 rendezvous and how it altered their lives, then exchanging their mutual disappointment from the twists and turns of life, touching numerous social ideals on the way.<br/><br/>Sunset deals with some interesting concepts of second chances and becoming sober from all sorts of promiscuous ideals one might have as a young individual. It is a mature, self-aware film, that meets our heroes now leading a much more realistic, yet extremely disappointing, life style. While all this might add up to a positive overall viewing of this feature film, I myself found it to be quite anti-climatic in comparison with Before Sunrise. Since I know real life is often depressing, and rarely leads one to his true calling of his heart, I often turn to movies in search of a more escapist experience, that'll shed some light on my life, rather than paint my future in very bleak colors. As a 25 year old young adult currently writing this review, I would like to think that life has more to offer than yearning for some old sweetheart while watching my years fade away. Whilst Jesse eventually gets his second chance to meet Celine in Before Sunset, the movie never really lets you know what happens with them afterward, and instead leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied for large periods of times. Being such a stubborn dreamer, you would have to excuse me for not buying into this perspective of life (yet?).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I could have been much more satisfied have I had only seen the first installment of this love story, being left with much hope and desire, rather than being faced with the biting reality in the second installment."
"k03prl","7","1","4","6 June 2005"," Not quite as good as I hoped for
","I think it was three or four years ago I accidentally came across ""Before sunrise"" while zapping through the channels on a slow TV-night. This was one of those rare movie experiences, where you are totally absorbed, almost drawn in to the movie, not for a single moment losing focus on whats happening on the screen. Being an 18 y-old guy, romantic movies weren't usually what I was looking for, but this one was different. It felt so real, but in the same time so magic. At the end of the day, I think the reason why I, and so many others, love this film, is that you think and hope that you someday will have a similar experience. It somewhat feels like the ultimate romantic situation, the two of them walking around in the beautiful city of Wienna, discussing everything between heaven on earth while the night slowly turns to morning.<br/><br/>Well, enough about ""Before sunrise"". The sequel, ""Before sunrise"" takes place in Paris when the two main characters meet again after 9 years of no contact. I guess you either have seen the movie, or somewhat knows the plot, so I'm gonna go straight to my thoughts on the film.<br/><br/>What first strikes me is the different tones of the two movies. Where the first one is impulsive, romantic and youthful, the second one is reflective, humorous and mature. Not until the last 30 minutes do the two films really meet. Maybe its a matter of age and life situation which one you like more, but for me ""sunset"" just don't really make it. This especially goes for the first half of the movie, which really disappointed me. I don't know what I expected really, but this wasn't it. Its just too much brain and not enough heart. Hearing them talk about the global situation really doesn't make it for me, and every time they get close to personal things, it ends up with some stupid sex joke. All the chemistry between them seemed gone, leaving only a boring charade to be seen. After the first half hour it just felt like they would drink their coffee, and then be like ""ok, nice to see you, have a nice life"", as it didn't seem they had any connection at all. The last half though, really improves, with the scene in the car as the highlight. This is what I wanna see, them talking about their life situations and how they feel about each other. The ending is also great, and really leaves a bit to the imagination. I just think the good parts are a little too few and the magic moments are too easily counted. Maybe thats the point, maybe the sequel is supposed to be more realistic and cynical, and some people probably love it for it. But for me, ""Before sunrise"" will still be the far better of the two movies."
"eshy76","6","1","4","28 February 2005"," Mature sequel, but lacks magic of Before Sunrise
","Having watched and loved Before Sunrise when it was first released, I looked forward to Before Sunset more than most movies. For me Before Sunrise is one of the most romantic movies ever made, encapsulating for all time young, idealistic love with two people really connecting at a deep emotional level. But watching Before Sunset eventually left me slightly underwhelmed, I have to say. It is not bad at all, neatly tying up the loose ends after the heart-rending ending of the first movie - what happened to obvious soul mates Celine and Jesse? Did they meet up six months later? Did they end up together? Before Sunset is set 10 years after the first film and we get the answers to those questions in a satisfactory manner, but without ever really touching the heights of the first film. But then again, how do you follow up such a diamond of a film? <br/><br/>There were a number of good points about this movie, first of which was that it is set in another beautiful location (Paris). I don't know about anyone else, but the first movie was a great advert for Vienna - I've been dying to go there ever since. Similarly in Before Sunset, Paris is endearing in each location, be it a quintessential French café, the back streets or on a boat over the river Seine. Another great feature is that the film takes place in real time, which gives a great continuity to the storytelling and ensures the audience does not miss a thing. Both Hawke and Delpy are back for the sequel, which was an absolute necessity - their undeniable chemistry once again captivates the audience to smouldering effect.<br/><br/>Despite all these riches, I just felt that the movie lacked the magic of the first. Personally, I think I will have forgotten Before Sunset before too long. Back in 1995, I only watched Before Sunrise once, but it has stayed with me as a memory of a magical movie ever since. Controversially, I do not see Before Sunset to really be a romantic movie (except perhaps for the end I guess) - it's a more cynical ""Before Sunrise was young idealism, this is real life"" take on the two characters, and quite a lot of the movie is spent with the two characters moaning about how their lives have turned out. There are also some rather crude sexual references in Before Sunset, which I thought were out of place, especially given Hawke's character is married with a child. The dialogue in the first movie was altogether more charming, with the characters learning each other's hopes and fears, gauging each other's personalities and gradually becoming closer in a wholly believable way. But even though the characters seem to have become a little bitter with life in Sunset, their chemistry ensures that their conversation never bores the audience.<br/><br/>I imagine that a lot of people have given this movie high scores as they can relate in some way to what these characters have gone through, and I think that is fair enough. The characters have grown and this is a certainly more mature film (crude sexual references aside). And to Linklater's credit, the ending was very strong. It is a very good movie, which is well worth watching (and I would advise strongly that you watch Before Sunrise beforehand to fully enjoy the second film).<br/><br/>But maybe Sunset is too ""real"" for me. Personally, I much preferred the touchingly romantic original movie and its bittersweet ending - and of the two, Before Sunrise is the film you should rent for a quiet night in with the one you love..."

This one leaves you with the idea that they are most likely going to commit adultery.

","This is one of those simple but honest films about two people that meet up after time has passed and even though they have a limited amount of time they use it to try and express their emotions for those lost years. Story takes place in Paris, France where an American author named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has just given his last interview on his book tour when he looks up and notices Celine (Julie Delpy) who he dated nine years earlier in Vienna. Jesse's book is loosely based on their relationship and even though he has to catch a flight back to the States fairly soon he decides to walk with Celine and talk.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>They continue to walk and talk about their lives for the last nine years and why they didn't meet again in Vienna six months after their meeting the first time. They go into a cafe and have coffee and later take a tour boat down the river and while this goes on Jesse mentions that he is married and has a son while Celine says that she just cannot keep a man. Their conversation ends up at her apartment where she announces that ""Honey, your going to miss that flight"".<br/><br/>This film is directed by Richard Linklater who specializes in small stories but with characters that usually come across as very honest and human. Linklater is a personal friend of Hawke's and they've worked together before so they must be very comfortable working on projects together. The dialogue is written with the collaboration of both Hawke and Delpy and there are several true references that are brought up such as Delpy being in New York during a span of time (Which she was) and Hawke mentioning that he was also which is of course true since he lives there. The film is just one continuous conversation and it doesn't seem contrived or forced, in fact the big asset is that we really do believe what they are saying to one another. Simple concept is honest in it's execution and really works on a romantic level with the beautiful location shooting in Paris and both Hawke and Delpy have a chemistry that seems to connect in an emotional sense."

Speaking of song, one of the film's highlights is Duply's sweetly sung love ballad with notes of dismay, which recaptures her essential beauty and charm in the nick of time before the film ends, (but doesn't really conclude).<br/><br/>Being a chick, I gulped down every moment of this frothy café latte made with skim milk, and would not change a bit of it, even the abrupt ending, except for one small detail. When Celine mistakes Jessie's ""merci"" for ""messy"", she sarcastically mocks his French. If I were writing the script, I would have given him a come-back bit, complimenting her improved English skills with, ""but you, your English is, how you say, 'tres bien!'""."

At the same time, the restaurant food wasn't that great and you were only ten bucks down.<br/><br/>Essentially, I've not seen a film with such little direction before. I'm sorry, let me be more specific - Derek Jarman's Blue - gets the title for least direction, and Batman & Robin gets the title for Most Appalling Direction of Global Movie History.

"Kallanta","Null","2","16","27 July 2004"," A Pleasantly Forgettable Treat
","Before Sunset is the indie sequel to the 1995 indie favorite, Before Sunrise. It's worth thinking about that statement for a moment or two. An indie sequel. That alone is something of note. That the sequel is quite good is also of note, but this is indie film-making where if a director is talented they tend to stay talented. It also was made for $10 million, which, despite it being significantly less than the $200 million blockbusters filling theaters recently, does still put its indie status in question. Regardless, what we have here is a pleasant movie, presented in a unique method, that largely maintains its integrity throughout to ultimately give you a warm squishy feeling that most of those uber-expensive blockbusters lack.<br/><br/>The film stars Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke as Celine and Jesse, respectively. Years ago, in another movie, Jesse and Celine met on their way to Vienna, fell in love, had a wonderful day, then said they'd meet back in Vienna six months later. 'Before Sunset' informs us that, for one reason or another, they never made it back to see each other again. Jesse has turned into an author in the intervening years and is on a book tour in Paris for a novel he wrote about the Vienna trip, and Celine, having read the book, comes to see him. After a brief press conference, the two get together and begin to catch up on how the other has been doing with the other's life in the eighty minutes that Jesse has between the conference and his flight back to the United States.<br/><br/>The eighty minutes is important because the entire movie plays out in real time, with not a single moment lost between the end of the opening credits and the start of the closing credits. The camera follows the two as they walk about Paris conversing about everything from career to sex to misconceptions about the last time they met up, generally following the ""we bought a steady-cam and by God we're going to use it"" school of photography.<br/><br/>This style, while offering excellent views and colors throughout the film, does grate during some of the longer shots, putting you in nervous anticipation for a cutaway to another shot--or maybe that was just me being impatient. It also gives ample opportunity for the occasional mistake, in this case a few instances of visible boom mikes, something the $10 million budget should have prevented getting into the final edit.<br/><br/>These few instances of perceived laziness, however, do nothing to detract from the generally excellent performances given by Hawke and Delpy. The two are conversationally frank and very believable, each delivering their dialogue in the kind of memory-drunk ways in which those types of meandering conversations tend to flow. In short, the performances are perfect for the material. If the material itself has any faults they are probably in the latter half of the film where the conversation goes from being happily non-committal to something of much more emotional depth. The transition between these two styles was realistic though given the feel of the film itself up to that point, it can be a bit jarring. Both sections of the movie are handled with equal aplomb, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed the first, happier, half to the second, more involved, half.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a filmic light snack. Something tasty, not too filling, very enjoyable, and in the end pleasantly forgettable. It is a window into eighty minutes of two lives intersecting years after a hopelessly romantic fling that stands apart from its prequel, looks beautiful, is well written, and is remarkably honest."

","if you're into listening to other people's life long conversations, then you might be into this movie, but if you're looking for anything more than a walk around Paris, then I wouldn't even consider watching this film. The characters were very interesting, which might make the story interesting to some people because it's usually the characters that make the story interesting. It doesn't obey by standard romantic drama films. It is simple and the action/conversation is more realistic. But, on the other hand, if you're looking for that standard of romance in which the two engage in a wild ride of romance, you are going to be disappointed because at this point in the story, that happened already...9 years ago. So I suggest renting something more of the standard persuasion."

","Man where do I begin other than to say this movie and the prequel sucked. I put the maximum number of stars since IMDb is hell bent on only giving the good reviews priority to the readers as opposed to giving priority on the first come first serve basis. Both movies were a french-wannabee flick using only dialog as its mechanism. The problem is that the characters are Americans and Americans talk about the stupidest things, as we see throughout the entire movie. We have a Joe Mangina douche bag who is smitten with this self entitled princess. He actually shows up to meet this bimbo at a place and time they agreed to meet 9 years ago and of course she is not there. The chick is a typical narcissistic American female, passed her prime at age 33, complete with her selfish attitude as she stated that she wished someone had proposed marriage to her and then turns around and says ""I would have said no, but it would have been nice to have been asked"" so really her desire is not to be married but rather to flush down the toilet a mans genuine affections of love. That's sick. This film clearly demonstrates that American women are selfish idiots and American men are desperate spineless wimps who cater to to them.

","The ""Before..."" series was never my favorite of all the works of Richard Linklater. Sure without the trilogy, we probably won't have ""Boyhood"". Those movies are not perfect. Except this one.<br/><br/>""Before Sunrise"" tries too much to appeal to a larger audience. Especially to the female part of it. It has cheesy dialogs, cutesy scenes, predictable ending, and overall it feels pretty tacky.<br/><br/>""Before Midnight"", in turn, might be the worst of the trilogy. The characters supposed to be married for 9 years, but it feels like that they are no better than a couple of friends. In the first two movies they were strangers and despite the over-romantised feel of the first one, their growing relationship felt credible. Either it's the writing or the acting, but they are more distant than ever. Overall it's an unnecessary movie, but it's an essential entry in the trilogy.<br/><br/>So what makes ""Before Sunset"" better than the other two movies? It feels like and looks like the classic Linklater. Visually it's the most simple one, yet narratively it's the most complex and subtle one. It consists mostly of few long shots following the main characters. They talk about anything without really talking about their feelings. They say a lot between the lines.<br/><br/>It has the nihilist atmosphere like in ""Slacker"" or ""Dazed and Confused"" . This movie doesn't tell a story, but shows the emotions. We could not be aware about what happened 9 year ago between them, but still we will be engaged in what's happening here now. The electricity between the actors is so intense so you can actually believe that they are actually in love in the real life.<br/><br/>It has an open ending. It could be the last of the series. The follow-up is not important. Heck it could be even a single movie with no prequel or sequel. It's almost like it doesn't have a beginning or ending. Just right now. The only moment that counts.

Art, movies, love, sex, dialogues, conversations, music and theater? Is that why society sometimes condemns art forms of sorts? To prevent a movement of unpredictable thought? An artist, like a person inlove with symptoms often operates in a dream world like a Henri Rouseau painting, this state is comforting and discomforting to the individual, and this discomfort often results in chaos which is artwork.

"ashi-lance","10","0","1","6 February 2013"," Before Sunset- Perfect way to explore your Love.
","I think most people will find this movie more interesting than Before Sunset (the prequel) because the characters are ""more mature"" in this movie. It plays out in real time as the characters spend one afternoon together in Paris.<br/><br/>It has been nine years since events of Before Sunrise happened. Now Jesse has written a novel named ""This Time"" accounting the happenings of his time with Celine as per the prequel of the movie. To promote his sales in Europe, Jesse on his last stop at Paris happens to met Celine, though this time it was not accidental and Jesse has to leave Before Sunset to catch his flight back home. Jesse is now married and has become a writer. Celine is there with boyfriend of hers ,who is a photojournalist. CONVERSATION continuing from the last movie has gone a level or two ahead and maturity is pretty much visible <br/><br/>First it appears that both leads are leading a pretty happy life. In fact it is not. It becomes clear in the course of their talk that both are dissatisfied to varying degrees with their lives. Jesse reveals that he only stays with his wife out of love for his son. Celine says that she does not see her boyfriend very much because of his commitment towards his work. A meaningful personal talk at wonderful locations of Paris and great shots of steadicam followed by awesome Screenplay says enough in itself. Life is unpredictable. If Jesse and Celine exchanged some contact information with each other, the story would be different. But there were not so many ""ifs"" in life. You must grasp the opportunity or regretting is unavoidable. The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime. Personally to me,Before Sunset is better than its prequel because the characters Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves inspired from their respective personal lives & conveys message of many unsaid things regarding LIFE in a pretty convincing way. My Rating -10/10"
"jboothmillard","6","0","1","7 October 2012"," Before Sunset
","I am pretty sure that I heard the title of this sequel before the title of the original, Sunrise, so having watched the fantastic original I was very interested to see how the follow up would fare, from writer / director Richard Linklater (Waking Life, School of Rock, A Scanner Darkly, Me and Orson Welles). Basically it has been nine years since Jesse (Ethan Hawke), now a writer from the United States, and Céline (Julie Delpy), now an environmental protection organisation worker, met on the train from Budapest to Vienna and spent a day, and a night, together. They ""coincidentally"" reconnect when Jesse is in France, Paris to promote his novel ""This Time"", inspired by his time with Céline, as he talks about the book, and a new one he is planning he has flashbacks about her, then he spots her outside smiling. The bookstore manager reminds him he will be catching a plane back to America within an hour or so, so when they decide to spend some time together just wandering the city their time together is again constrained. As before they talk about themselves, but mostly what has happened since they last met and what they have learned and changes in their circumstances, for example Jesse is married with a little boy, and Céline has a boyfriend, and obviously as they find all this out there are many personal questions and explanations. Jesse admits that he did show up in Vienna at the spot where they said they would meet again in six months, but Céline explains that she could not come because her grandmother died and the funeral happened to be that day, and they did not exchange addresses or phone numbers, so the chances of them meeting again were slim. As they talk and continue to stroll around Paris they express opinions of how life in general has changed, i.e. in the world, but mostly they clearly show dissatisfaction of the lives they have now, Jesse is only staying married for the sake of his son, and Céline hardly sees her boyfriend at all because he is always on assignment, and they talk about the fact that they had sex together, twice. They go through various venues, a coffee shop, a garden, a park, an open excursion boat, and in a hire car, their feelings for each other are slowly rekindled, but at the same time there is small frustration that they could not get together those nine years ago. Jesse admits that he was desperate to see Céline again so much that he wrote the book in the hope of her reading it and finding her, and she admits that she did read it, twice, and it brought back emotional memories of their time together. The concluding scene sees them go quickly into her apartment where Céline promised to play him a song on her guitar that she wrote herself, she plays him her waltz song (written by Delpy) which contains lyrics that clearly relate to their time together, and Jesse then puts on a Nina Simone CD that she dances to and imitates Simone's voice and attitude, and the last moment sees her say ""Baby... you are gonna miss that plane."", and he just smiles and says ""I know"", and the film ends. Once again Hawke and Delpy have great chemistry together, obviously being in their thirties their characteristics have changed slightly, but you can tell that the characters long to possibly show stronger affection than they may be expressing. The script is still witty enough, and the real time concept this time makes the film flow in a different style that is interesting, I will admit the fact that they already know each other makes their conversation not as much fun, but it certainly engages you enough to see what will happen next, whether they will reconnect, so overall a likable romantic drama sequel. Good!"

","There is a school of thought in drama in which, the theory goes, one should try for the most natural dialogue possible - it should be exactly like life. Of course, in real life, people rarely talk like what these works show - they are incessantly droning on about deep issues; they have a litany of complaints about life; and they always, always bemoan that others - usually parents or spouses - just don't get it. BUT THEY DO! Chekhov was, perhaps, the most famous advocate of this approach. Woody Allen is another. Critics and pseudo-intellectuals love the approach, because it's all about the cerebellum. They have plenty of phrases to parse. And they think the approach is so ""real."" (If audiences wanted reality, they'd stay home and look at each other, instead of going to the movies.) It appeals to their fantasies of sitting in cafes and talking for hours about their philosophies of life. Wanna buy a ticket to that?<br/><br/>Today, I watched ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset."" I will confess openly that, had Julie Delpy not been so hypnotically beautiful in the first film, I would not have watched the second. Both films are from the ""it will be great if we just ad-lib everything"" school, which is almost never the case. Both films are merely a series of duets between two actors who believe with all their hearts that they really have something to say about EVERYTHING. And they do. It doesn't matter where the scene is set, or what time of the day or year it is, every scene is going to be about one thing only: Two people talking. <br/><br/>In the race to see who the bigger pretentious ass is, Ethan Hawke wins hands down. He's so very, very sensitive. Of course, he's just that way because he wants to bed Delpy. He's not really sensitive to his wife. He reveals quickly to Celine (Delpy) that he only married her because he got her pregnant. But, he's devoted to his son - he openly expresses his longing to be with him ""every second,"" even though he's willing to miss his flight back home in order to hit the sack with his French fascination. He comes across as one of those guys who's afraid that, if he stops talking, she'll have a moment to tell him that he's a pompous jerk and run away. For her part, Delpy seems the poster-child for the discontented female and never seems to be that excited about their conversation. In the first film, she comes off as a girl looking for a thrill to write about in her journal. Jesse (Hawke) could have been anybody. In the second, she's still discontented and what better way to ease that then to see what her one-night stand is up to now.<br/><br/>From the moment they met in the first film to the moment the second film ends abruptly, these two talk about every possible subject in the deepest, most pretentious terms. This isn't a romance; it's a mock Mensa meeting. <br/><br/>What was most disappointing to me, however, was the utter lack of any real connection between these two people who can't stop talking to one another. <br/><br/>The acting, contrary to being as ""natural"" as the dialogue, is instead strained. I never had a moment's doubt that I was watching actor's act. The art of acting is not the art of writing. Actors take the words of others (in most cases) and breathe life and immediacy into them. That is so much harder than just making it up as you go along. And it is, ultimately, much more entertaining. A writer crafts characters for actors to play. Here, there are no real characters, just two people trying to impress each other with how interesting they are. Sadly, they are not. Empty words from empty people.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are many who have posted who enjoy this long road to nowhere - maybe it touches their memories in some way; maybe some just read that Ebert liked it, so they figure they have to, too, or they can't be considered intellectuals. But, for me, these films are shorts that have been stretched excruciatingly. If you're looking for a romance, you won't find it here. Just two people talking at each other. You can see the same thing at Denny's any night of the week."

","""Before Sunset"" is a very personal movie. Starting from there, you won't expect cheesy dialogs, nor action scenes but sincere conversations in the zenit of the beautiful Paris and discover how Love can be utterly talked and not physically demonstrated. That is basically it: Love is talked and debated to its best. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delply are helped by their sound chemistry and a perfect use of their hidden emotions to show profound love.<br/><br/>A very spontaneous script is softly produced as we travel over the charming settings on the french Riviera. This movie is recommended for quiet, peaceful moments in couples.

Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from café to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's ""My Dinner With Andre"" than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.<br/><br/>Looking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screen writing credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie."
"Inkle","7","0","1","12 February 2006"," The setting
","I love the film and personally I think Celine is much more brave than Jesse. It is very obviously that both of them cannot get away with the past, the time they experienced 9 years ago. <br/><br/>I feel Celine is more daring to face life. She did want to do something good to the world and to make herself feel worthy. The complexity and sophistication she encounters and obtain(or as she says, evolves), in my opinion, is more than Jesse does.<br/><br/>Jesse is a little coward, marrying a woman on a day that he was still haunted by the illusions of Celine. Even his book is reminiscence of the past. Does he ever try to experience other possibilities of life besides love? Celine knows that some part inside her might never regain but she still hopes to lead a life in which everyday is a brand new day. Jesse is indulged in the past, maybe he just doesn't want to move on. <br/><br/>Hope there will be no sequel again. In some way I feel that after trials and errors, Celine could finally rest in the arms of Jesse. But on the other hand, Celine would be aware that she will not walk in the way she walked nine years ago. <br/><br/>The ending is fine. I'm glad to see that none of them taking clothes off. :) But one thing bothers me--the setting of Celine's room. It never convinces me that Celine(or Julie) will live in such an colorful apartment. The sofa, the bed sheet, are so bright. And the stereo is not her style too. <br/><br/>Maybe she is still the girl 9 years ago.--That is the last thing that I hope"

","A guy, a girl and a plane to catch. That's how simple the plot is, yet there you are at the end wondering where all the time went  which of course is the theme of this story about two lovers reunited after a decade apart. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do something much greater than give performances  they give of themselves. They listen to each other, and when is the last time you watched a film and noticed that. Their sensitivity toward the material means they do not miss a note, or rather they miss many notes, just as two nervous people would. They play with each other, and every time a character says something that seems dishonest, the other character calls them on it. There is nothing fake about this picture: Linklater just lets two charismatic actors roam around Paris, and it is enough."

Jessie is on the last leg of his book tour - a book written about his brief brush with his true love 9 years ago. This movie follows the same format as the first, dedicated purely to dialogue and human interaction.<br/><br/>This time around though, Jesse has even less time before his flight back home. The film is simple, but wonderfully romantic. Two people so obviously this connected very rarely happens in real life, and this is a movie about taking your chances when you have them.

","I've never heard of 'Before Sunrise' and I'm not a fan of romantic movies at all. But 'Before Sunset' was excellent. It's hard to explain but I recommend this movie to everyone. This is what would really happen after a fleeting romance. And they did it right, and they did it in the positive way. There could have been an awkwardness in the movie, or there could have been suppressed lust that would have flown out the gates. But we see real adults in these characters, and for once in a movie. Everyone involved with 'Before Sunset' did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Set nine years after 'Before Sunrise,' Jesse and Celine meet each other again and catch up.<br/><br/>An amazing thing about intimacy is that it never has to be physical. Throughout this movie, Jesse and Celine talk. The fact that they talk to each other so openly and honestly is where the intimacy lies. You don't have to see them hold hands, or hug, or touch each other every five minutes to see that they contain a certain intimacy between the two of them. They let themselves go by just being themselves, and we see that unfold when they converse about how they see the world and what they feel. This movie is an accomplishment and success in itself. It deserved its nomination for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards and hopefully it will be a further success throughout the test of time."
"jpschapira","9","0","1","19 February 2005"," It all happens again...
","It's true that when we are watching a romantic movie we're always expecting something. I don't know how to call it. Maybe the name has been said sometimes. I mean endings like the ones in ""Nothing Hill"", ""How to loose a guy in ten days"". Cheesy maybe? I really can't tell. But there's a thing that people who make these films like to do (and it works). They manipulate a little bit things just to end them that way. It is lovely to see those endings. But what if they couldn't be, right? What if we could have the chance to watch something real? ""Before Sunset"" gives us that chance.<br/><br/>We know the story and what has happened to the characters. Even if we haven't seen it, we suppose it, because it is really obvious. They show it with their actions, with of course, are normal actions. What would someone do in the situation this two persons are involved? Not anything different to what they're doing. Sitting down on a ""café"", talking a little bit, maybe a lot. Nine years have since the last time they saw each other, and they were in love. The thing is that they could have not felt ""love"" again. They planned to see each other in Vienna after they said goodbye. Celine couldn't go: ""It was my grandmother's funeral"", she says. And asks Jesse if he was there. He says he wasn't, but five minutes later he takes it back. He was in Vienna, and put posters around the city, to find Celine, because she could have arrived later. These types of things are happening to them in their encounter. They don't say things because they don't want to offend, or be offended. But they know those things. They tell the truth, they lie. They don't know how to act because they have probably thought this would happen again and they are probably in love. Jesse has written a book that tells the night they spent together nine years before. Celine has read it and tells him: ""You idealized that night. We didn't make love"". Jesse can't believe it. He's sure they did: ""It was in the park, at night"". Celine says they didn't do it because they didn't use a condom. Jesse remembers the condom, and tells her. They feel embarrassed, but the truth right there is, that Celine remembers the night perfectly, and she was wrote a song. A waltz. She plays the song for Jesse in an occasion and he is convinced that she wrote it for him: ""Do you play that song for every guy that comes here and say his name?"", he asks. She says: ""Of course, did you think that I had written that song for you?"". The truth, again, is that she has really written it for him. Many of these situations occur as the day passes by, and they're walking and walking, and talking. Talking real words written on a real script about real people. They tell each other what they have been doing, their jobs, romances...Jesse is married, but he can't be sure of being in love. He sees the love he has for his wife as respect, admiration, and his kid. He has a son, and loves him, so? It doesn't really matter for him if he's in love with his wife or not. He even tells Celine in an occasion, the dreams he has every night, about her: ""In one there's a train. You're in there and you keep passing by. In the other one, we're lying in bed, you're pregnant, I want to touch you, you don't let me, but then I touch you and I wake up sweating"". Celine asks him later: ""Did you really dream that or you just said it to have sex with me?"". Jesse answers: ""No no, I just said to get into your pants"". But darn! He has really dreamed it! The truth is that they can't do much about these situations, there's little time, and Jesse's leaving.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke makes his character perfectly. It all comes naturally from him, he doesn't need to make an effort. Even the laughs, which can seem forced (or I wanted to see it that way), come off naturally also. He enjoys working with Delpy, they have chemistry. And Julie Delpy is one of those fighters. She wrote this script, and she really want it to do this film, she just acts with passion. It shows.<br/><br/>Then there's the passionate Richard Linlklater. I haven't seen all of his works, but the movies I have seen, well, are directed with that passion. The kind of passion that shows the director really wants to do what he's doing. This movie is so personal for him, that he makes it personal. His camera, in some occasions, seems to be following the characters from behind, when they are walking, joining them; as if it was walking too. Then the camera moves, not much, showing the characters from all the angles, and letting us see their emotions. They're two characters only. It's fantastic, and intimate.<br/><br/>In one occasion, Celine and Jesse are talking (because they're always talking, amazing) about what would they do if the day they're living was the last one of their lives. They should really think about it. Because it could be their last day. Or not."

Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy.<br/><br/>Director: Richard Linklater.<br/><br/>To start things off I usually hate romantic movies. I find them very predictable, the characters make me sick, and I usually feel depressed after i view them. I was lucky enough to see ""Before Sunrise"" when it came out to video and I was amazed to see that the guy who made ""Dazed and Confused"" was brave enough not to do another commercial film. Since then I have always been a huge fan of Linklater's work. I loved his Animated ""Waking Life"", and I enjoyed his family flick ""School of Rock"" Richard is the only director I know who can make both big mainstream movies and small independent films and not look like a sellout.<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" continues nine years after ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse wrote a book about his one night in Vienna with Celine and is in France at the end of his book tour. Celine shows up and the two of them decide to spend the afternoon together before his plane leaves.<br/><br/>What takes next is a series of conversations, and this is where the real gem of the screenplay comes into focus. Because this one does not use pop culture references to get you into the story. It's just normal people having a conversation, but I assure you that it's not boring. I was interested in everything these characters had to say. On their afternoon together they begin to let down their guard and tell each other just what that night really meant to them. Jesse and Celine are both currently in another relationship, but it's clear that these two should be together. It made a true love believer out of me when most films assure me that it's dead.<br/><br/>""Before Sunset"" is a perfect companion piece to ""Before Sunrise"", but you don't need to see the first one to enjoy this. It stands on it's own as a very good contemporary love story. I hope Oscar voters are wise and nominate Julie Delpy for best actress nods and one for best screenplay to Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, & Julie Delpy. More actors should take cues from them and write their own sequel."

","What happens when the opportunity to follow up on a brief romantic encounter years later presents itself? Ethan Hawke and Jule Delphy show us how it might go in ""Before Sunset"", and viewing their exploration of the emotional minefield that most of us seem to have picked through in our own lives we reap large rewards. Along the way we are able to see one of the finest pair of performances in recent memory.<br/><br/>Delphy (Celine) and Hawke (Jesse) meet in Paris when he is on a book promotion stop at a bookstore. They had met for one wild and fleeting evening years before; while they had vowed to meet again, it never happened and thus they wove their separate paths. Celine's appearance at the bookstore is so moving for Jesse (he spies her in a crowd as he speaks about the book) that he confronts her as soon as the opportunity arises when the interview is concluded.<br/><br/>What then ensues is the cat-and-mouse back-and-forth alternately teasing and serious game of catch-up and reacquainting. Long shots of the pair in semi-serious conversation are quite phenomenal. Maintaining lengthy animated and effortless (uncontrived) dialogs in long continuous takes demands incredible talent. Both actors carry the ball so well it is noticeable there is never a false moment. Save at the end. Celine's unfortunate song is a little more than we can take; it seems like the placement of a second cherry atop a sundae, ergo more than is required and too sweet for our palate.<br/><br/>You can either think of ""Before Sunset"" as a one-act play or a perhaps even as a pair of interwoven monologues. Either will do, as the art here is really the incredible acting and chemistry of the players.<br/><br/>In an interview with director Richard Linklater (he of ""Tape""  another play-like film, ""Slacker"" and ""Waking Life"") we hear him note that ""Before Sunset"" is ""My own cinema dreams of my characters' lives still intertwining with each other."" (http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf). And intertwine they do, capturing an exciting snapshot of a couple dancing moth-like around their mutually generated flames.<br/><br/>This is no action flit, and we are spared any real surprises. And there are only a few memorable lines by either character; this is love-exploration, mild dabbling in those areas left to lovers and those with life scars they slowly choose to expose. But this movie is testament to how that early encounter nine years before had shaped their lives and in the story's circularity we are satisfied in the end how things might now go.<br/><br/>Rating: Three and a quarter stars."

","Ultimately, a satisfying little movie; even for a late 50's non-romantic, such as myself. Congratulations to the two principals for carrying the entire movie on the strength of one nonstop dialogue....indeed, I have never seen a movie that even attempted such a premise. Hawke and Delpy actually carry it out. I was tired, and listened to much of the first half of the movie with my eyes closed. Yes, I might have even nodded-off for a few minutes. But the thread of dialogue kept my interest up enough that I had to start watching at about the same time the two were at Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now I know I don't need to see Paris - this movie was the ultimate travelogue of the River Sienne. The shoreline promenade evoked memories of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and it's dramatic end. Now that I think about it, I doubt they really had such elaborate concrete work in the days of the French Revolution, only in the Liam Neeson movie of it. Funny, how the setting had such a timeless aspect to it. Anyway, I digress....could they have pulled-off this eighty-five minute conversation (in real time: probably about three hours of relationship time) on a blank sound stage, without the beautiful backdrop of Paris to enhance their every word? Only with your eyes closed.<br/><br/>Strange, that the writers and principals would decide to reprise the original movie, nine years afterward. It works well, and has a very credible feel to it. I suspect that this one will be ""an all time favourite"" of many a young, sophisticated, and well-educated female; it's niche audience is most certainly in the female dormitories of many a college campus. For them, it is the ultimate ""chick flick"", for me....I'm just surprised I liked it as much as I did."

","Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year. <br/><br/>The movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.<br/><br/>Julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates a late famous singer's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space. <br/><br/>In the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference. <br/><br/>It's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation."

","Before Sunset, 3 out of 4 stars 80 minutes Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Directed by Richard Linklater<br/><br/>A Review by Jimmy Geurts<br/><br/>Before Sunset can be seen as movie-making in the moment- a film that requires the audience to focus their attention on the movie for a meager 80 minutes if they hope to find themselves swept away by this pleasant albeit fleeting piece of film. And those who let their minds wander from the amiable characters and their coincidental meeting may notice some of the script's shortcomings and as a result might not enjoy Before Sunset to its highest potential. Despite myself I found myself enjoying the sequel to 1995's indie favorite, Before Sunrise. One of Before Sunset's strengths is that it is not a sequel made for financial reasons, so it as a film does not need to be held by a need to satisfy commercial demands. (It was made on a budget of only $10 million). Rather, I like to think that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy, like many of us, wondered if Jesse and Celine ever met again in Vienna six months later like they promised each other to after that unforgettable night. When we see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy on screen, the two seem to be reuniting with the characters of Jesse and Celine just as much as they are acting them. <br/><br/>Before Sunset picks up nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) parted ways. It turns out for one reason or another, the two never did meet up in Vienna. Jesse is now married with a kid, and Celine, while not betrothed, is currently dating a photographer. Jesse has still not gotten over Celine, and has written a book about the trip to Vienna in the past few years. He is in Paris on a book tour when at a press conference Celine appears into his life again. The two make small talk, about everything from idealism to sex, and try to avoid bringing up the inevitable question: why they never met again after that one magical night in Vienna.<br/><br/>There is a sense of urgency to Before Sunset's proceedings because instead of sharing a day together, Jesse and Celine only have eighty minutes to reunite until Jesse must take his plane back to the United States. Hawke and Delpy play off each other very nicely, and share a chemistry that hides just below the surface. Hawke as usual does a very good job, and Julie Delpy is just radiant as Celine. The way Delpy plays Celine I could see how someone could become smitten with her.<br/><br/>For the most part I found Richard Linklater's script to be well done, but especially later in the movie, the conversation between Jesse and Celine does occasionally feel stilted and uneven. In addition, the transition between friendly chat and long-held feelings seems to be a little rough. I can appreciate that this probably intended on Linklater's behalf to emphasize the sudden shift of heart of the two characters, but for a director who I see as having such an ear for earnest truth in his films' dialogue, I would hope he could find a more natural way of changing the mood of the film. Only minor complaints but they did hurt the film for me nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film plays out as if we were right there with Jesse and Celine, being careful not to cut away from the conversation of the two. Before Sunset is shot with a steady camera and fairly successfully manages to balance both an intimate feel and a good sense of Paris' beauty. And while the movie does use transitions but not to the point where it becomes a distraction. In other independent movies like Running Time, it might've benefited the film's strengths more. Before Sunset is not of those movies.<br/><br/>Before Sunset is like a light meal: pleasing, light, and ultimately forgettable. Fans of the original who wondered what ever happened to the two after the credits rolled will probably enjoy the sequel. Anyone that disliked the first Before Sunrise aren't going to find much here that will change their minds. For everyone else, it provides a healthy alternative to the Hollywood action blockbusters of the summer."

","There are certain times (increasingly) when I seem to be the only person in a cinema audience who 'gets' the film we're watching. Who loves it to bits and wants to rush out at the end and paint five stars next to the title on the hoarding outside. It's a phenomena I can trace back to Wayne's World when Robert Patrick in full T-1000 mode pulls Mike Myers over, holds up a photo and asks him ""Have you seen this boy?"" Stoney faces all round apart from laughing my BCG scar off. It happened again at the end of Richard Linklater's new film Before Sunset. Everyone else offers a collective ""Huh?"" and I'm applauding and subsequently dancing out of the screen. It's the perfect ending to a frankly perfect film.<br/><br/>In the first movie Before Sunrise Jesse and Celine met randomly on a train in Vienna and decided to spend the night together. They were obviously in love, but deciding that their relative situations were too complicated they didn't swap details but promised to meet again six months later. In the sequel Before Sunset they bump into each other again in Paris and they again talk about how they're feeling about each other and this time what happened before. The little piece in the brochure at the cinema were I saw it advised that you didn't need to see the first film to enjoy this one. Hogwash. It's not that this film doesn't make any sense - it does - it's just without seeing what happened to them in Vienna, emotionally this simply doesn't have the same resonances - you needed to be there with them, because it's as much about your memories of what happened them as theirs. So if you can, get a copy of Sunrise if you haven't seen it already then go for this. It's important.<br/><br/>And now I'm in the utterly horrible position of trying to review it. The problem is that its 80 minutes of two people walking around talking. So anything I say about what I like or dislike will ruin some aspect of it. I've avoided other writer's opinions for months because I suspected this would be the case and going back to them having the 'been there', I'm glad I did. Most of them enthuse, enthuse about what they've seen but in doing so whole swathes of the surprises that are in there spirit away. Don't look here for a detailed synopsis because you're not going to get one. And whatever you do don't read anyone elses.<br/><br/>On a technical level though, it's amazing. Given the real time nature of the story you might expect Linklater, who has already had some experience working with digital video (see Tape) to follow the path of Mike Figgis in Timecode and record everything in one take or whatnot. Instead everything is in celluloid, just like the first film, but it all flows together beautifully - even though its mostly been photographed on single or two camera setups, it feels as though the characters walked around Paris and the film cameras just happened to be there at the right time (in fact I think principal photography took about nine or ten days). It's also a testament then to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, both highly underrated actors, that their performances also ebb and flow correctly and with great emotional precision. It feels improvised, but apparently every word was scripted by the director and these two actors, opening up some of the themes about autobiography which are apparent at times. But I'll talk about that when the dvd has comes out and I'm happy that enough of you have seen it.<br/><br/>What more can I say? I don't feel like I've said nearly enough to convince you to go find a showing, so tell you about the circumstances of how I saw the film. Since I realized it had been made, it's about the only film I've wanted to see this year (so I suppose the odds on me liking it were stacked in its favour). I assumed that on the first week of release it would turn up at the local Picturehouse @ FACT because its just the sort of thing they would carry amongst the more intelligent blockbusters, indies and international cinema (they had Neil LeBute's The Shape of Things for example). I checked their website last night and nothing. I looked at the cinemas across Liverpool and then Merseyside and it isn't on anywhere. So I went to Manchester tonight instead and saw it at The Cornerhouse. A whole other city, straight after work. Its 45 minutes each way by train so effectively I spent more time getting to and from the cinema than it took to watch the film. You know what? It was absolutely worth it. I fell in love again."

","The film is wonderful. If you saw the first, 'Before Sunrise', you'll definitely want to watch this sequel. I was very anxious about the prospect of a sequel to Sunrise which was a self- contained film that wasn't demanding a sequel. Although 'Before Sunrise' ended with an aching ambiguity I was dreading the prospect of a sequel because it would have been far too easy to screw it up and ruin the memory of the first. To their credit, they didn't. In fact, I found that Sunset surpasses Sunrise in depth and maturity. Both characters reappear now nine years later as more complex and with greater depth. The writing is spot-on and authentic, and it's clear that everyone involved has invested themselves into the film."
"river-12","7","0","1","13 August 2004"," A lesser reminder of the first
","I saw the movie along with people who hadn't seen the first movie and they enjoyed it. When ""Before Sunrise"" came out 9 years ago I went to it not knowing what to expect and loved it - it was a story about people like me, it was different than every other movie out there, almost no one saw it. I couldn't help but relate to the young (my age), somewhat naive couple. Now it seems rehashed, a little jaded and I couldn't help but feel that it was more like watching the DVD extras than a sequel - its only slightly longer than an hour and is just like the first, with less tension and uncertainty. If you haven't seen either movie, see ""Sunrise"" first. Any one who saw it will want to see ""Sunset"" as well, but the first is still better."

","This is more like reading the film rather than watching. It is very well made and Julie Delpy is superb, only if she and Hawke acted more.<br/><br/>Reminds me of My dinner with andre or some Godard work.<br/><br/>We are forced to listen to the lyrics of the song Delpy sings towards the end, which turns her art of singing into a monologue. The only scene where there is some study of character is during the Nina Simone track, where they both let go and become themselves, not bound by the text. Superb ending."
"veganflimgeek","7","0","1","11 August 2004"," Good but For Arthouse romance, Twilight Samurai all the way
","Before sunset<br/><br/>My wife and I basically cut this deal the other day. She picked a romantic movie and I picked one. Over two days we would watch them. With both picked films that either were playing at the art house or had played there at one time.  She had picked Before sunset and I picked Twilight Samurai. For that reason I will have sadly and unfairly compared the two films.<br/><br/>Before sunset is a romantic comedy that is basically an experiment. Two one night stand vet's reunite after 10 years and we watch there 80 minute conversation in real time. The direction and acting pull off this concept in a way that works. (Spoiler in the next paragraph) The conversation flows, and Julie d.'s character is worth falling in love with, imagine many people watching did as well. Ethan Hawke's character I am not so sure about, He loves his kid. Is it fair that he feels this way when he has wife back in New York. Maybe she is unhappy about the marriage maybe she is not.<br/><br/>For my indie romantic dime I would have to stay with Twilight Samurai. TS is a film whose love story is charming, sweet and more importantly Guilt free."
"andiam123","10","0","1","10 August 2004"," A Classic
","I've seen this film just once, but it's already one of my favorite films of all time. I was totally involved from the very beginning. I felt like a kid watching a Western; I wanted to yell at the screen, ""Don't let her get away again."" The dialogue is perfect and appears almost improvised. These are real people.<br/><br/>I have a fantasy--though I know it will never happen--that this film will get Oscar nominations for best film and best actors, male and female.<br/><br/>If you've ever wondered about the one who got away, you're bound to love this film."
"royaldrgn","10","0","2","1 August 2004"," my heart's still in my throat
","Such a lovely film! Of course, I should preface this by saying Before Sunrise (the ""first"" one) has always been a truly heart-wrenching guilty pleasure of mine. OOh, I'm so guilty of loving this film. But, as soon as I get to see Before Sunset again, I will be guilty of loving a sequel as well.<br/><br/>I love it. I love the divine simplicity of mid-nineties precocious pseudo-boho banter. I love it. I love semi-art house love stories that really cater to main stream audiences searching for film-junkie street cred. I love Ethan. ""Jesse"" defines the ""every boy"" American boy you wished every American boy you met was like. Nine years later, I still want one of them to be Jesse. ~sigh~ I can dream, can't I?<br/><br/>And while Julie Delpy may be the bane of my(or every other raging jealous loony of a girl's) existence, there is simply no other actress that could BE ""Celine"". Her character is so honestly portrayed in the ""sequel""(Ugh, I hate calling it that). Celine's songs will flatten you, period. And Ms. Delpy wrote them!!??!! GAH!! so jealous! You know what? I love Julie too. what a talent! <br/><br/>I have been known as a film snob and I can acknowledge that. Yet out of all the films that have fans salivating for a ""I-know-they-shouldn't-make-one-but-I-wish-they-would"" sequel, this one nearly made me pass out with pleasure. I didn't even realize I wanted a sequel. I don't normally like sequels. But thank a higher power this one was made. The characters actually developed. And they developed over the nine year span as the ""rest of us"" did as well. It's remarkably satisfying to have actors acting human.<br/><br/>Paris was shot so naturally. You'll love the look of the alley-ways and eye-level walking views. Makes you all wistful for the Vienna of the last decade(errmm..""first one""). A lot of the scenery really goes for a throw back of Before Sunrise. Which, yeah, is totally awesome. For a second, when I saw the boat on the River Seine, I thought it was part of a flash back. My heart was in my throat. Then, that ending. No spoilers, I promise. But. ..I've never been moved to near-tears by a -ugh- sequel in my entire life. Had I not been in public, I probably wouldn't have held 'em back. You CAN NOT ask for a more perfect ending. And this is coming from a girl that makes it a point to hate endings. Yeah, I'm pretentious. But You're reading a film comment, so you are too. ha ha. <br/><br/>Maybe my life was a bit too busy over the last decade to have been thinking about what was happening to Celine and Jesse, but ""milkshake!"", I should've. If you haven't seen Before Sunrise, please see that first. Then, I hope, you'll be able to understand why us ""fans"" actually held our hearts in our throats and tried to swallow down tears over this film's ""what might have been.""<br/><br/>on that note, anyone want to see this again with me?"
"keilenberg","10","0","1","5 July 2004"," Praise of the film and discussion of some reasons why it works so well
","""Before Sunset"" is one of the most exquisite romantic modern films I have ever seen. It is reminiscent of the following two movies: Claude Lelouch's ""Un homme et une femme"" (""A Man and a Woman"" 1966) and Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" (""Red"") in that it is a magnificent study of the inner workings of a relationship between two people who meet accidentally: a man and a woman. But their ages, nationalities, and successes (things often used to classify people) are not why the characters in these movies connect. These films are brief glimpses of details that make relationships so intense and so special. The backdrop of Paris adds a lushness to the film's beauty, and it is a comment on the themes of movement, transience, and touring or visiting a place as opposed to living there and it becoming fabric in one's day-to-day ""real life."" At first viewing, the conversation between the two characters feels so natural, making it surprising to learn that there is no adlib in this film. However, at second viewing, (We stayed for the very next showing of the film!) the brilliance of the construction of the conversation became obvious. Every word is fraught with risk and meaning, even in the beginning of the movie, as the characters talk around the subject of their relationship so masterfully, while using it as every referential point in their dialogue.<br/><br/>The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime.<br/><br/>The ending of this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It makes me think of the Woody Allen film ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" in that the viewer is tempted to leave his/her seat and walk into the movie itself. For, this movie portrays a world where the possibility of returning to pivotal people in our pasts and revisiting the most important moments in time, where our lives irrevocably change is possible. <br/><br/>Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke, and Richard Linklater are brilliant."
