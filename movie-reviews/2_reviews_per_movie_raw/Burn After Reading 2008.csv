"AvidClimber","9","15","17","2 June 2013"," Burn After Reading â€” What if you believed you were in a spy movie?
","Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun."
"UniqueParticle","9","11","12","21 August 2019"," John Malkovich is the best thing about this!
","This is one of the best dark comedies ever made! There is only one thing that rubs me the wrong way and I won't spoil that otherwise I love this Coen brothers quirky masterpiece. I originally saw this in the theater, that was fun, I still can't believe it's been 11 years now since 08. So beyond well written and very cool camera shots; Burn After Reading makes me feel so damn good! Also I absolutely love the music and excessive use of profanity!"
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","443","672","12 September 2008"," The Coens' funniest film since ""The Big Lebowski""
","I'm not the only one to notice the pattern in the Coens' filmography: ""Blood Simple."" was followed by ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"" by ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""No Country for Old Men"" by ""Burn After Reading"". The main concern one had about this film is whether it would be an ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or a ""Big Lebowski"" for the Coens. Let's put it this way: the reviews have been mixed, especially from major mainstream media critics. Guess what other Coen comedy received mixed reviews and was accused of being a somewhat tired mess? Yep, ""The Big Lebowski"".<br/><br/>The Coens' sense of humor is very distinctive, and I'm not talking about stuff like ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (this one the mainstream media liked, go figure) and ""The Ladykillers"", which featured numerous commercial concessions. I'm talking about the vicious, cruel, misanthropic farce that gets self-important critics' knickers in a twist. Describing ""Burn After Reading"" as a screwball spy farce makes it sound much more ""Austin Powers"" than it is. There is a lot of silliness, but the sort of silliness one finds in a Howard Hawks comedy, not in most comedies that have been made recently. It's a screwball comedy but a pretty dark one.<br/><br/>This is most certainly an acquired taste. It is not going to go down well with people who can't laugh at murder, things going terribly wrong for innocent people, or the Cones' trademark dialogue that pops up even in 'serious' movies like ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men"". However, ""Burn After Reading"" was seemingly tailor-made for my cruel sense of humor, as I found it to be easily the most inspired comedy script in a long time. It's a conspiracy espionage thriller with no stakes, nothing to fight over, a bunch of complete fools and idiots caught in the middle of it (""a league of morons"" if you listen to John Malkovich's character), and disastrous consequences for just about everyone. Take out the jokes and you could have a tragedy but as it stands this is the funniest movie the Coens have made since ""The Big Lebowski"", if not the best, and that includes ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"". <br/><br/>One really shouldn't know anything about the plot or how it unfolds prior to seeing it, as this is a film which is far more intricately-plotted than most critics are giving it credit for. The basic concept is that Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt's characters come across a disc they think contains top secret intelligence. What follows is, as described above, a thriller with no stakes and a bunch of idiots. It's one of those movies where you really shouldn't be laughing (for ethical reasons) but are, and it will have you laughing through your disapproval for basically the entirety of the film after the opening fifteen minutes or so, which are rough in comparison to the rest of the film, and to be honest the only thing that keeps this film from being absolutely brilliant and the Coens' best movie since ""Lebowski"". Just don't go in expecting a movie that looks as beautiful as many of their movies do- Lubezki is no Deakins, at least not based on his work here, and the Coens are very clearly attempting to emulate in many ways the look of the sort of thriller they're basing this on. It's functional, well-shot, and well-directed, but the writing and acting are the main attractions here.<br/><br/>Of course, ""Burn After Reading"" will be dismissed as having little worth and for being a disposable farce by many. Well, if only they knew how hard it is to do comedy well. I'd reckon this was harder to write than the (admittedly tremendous) ""No Country for Old Men"", which was adapted from a novel that might as well have been a screenplay if formatted correctly. The movie may not start brilliantly (not that it isn't good even early on), but once the Coens start firing on all cylinders they never stop, and the dream cast certainly doesn't either (Brad Pitt has a smaller role than most cast members here, but he is absolutely brilliant in the role), showing tremendous comic skill that few would have guessed most of them had. The final scene may very well be one of the best I have seen in a long, long time. <br/><br/>""What a clusterf-ck!"", indeed.<br/><br/>9/10"
"katiemeyer1979","8","311","473","13 September 2008"," A Bright American Farce
","Nobody is quite there in this new bright farce by the Coen brothers. The plot is a smart excuse for a movie about nothing but appearing to be about a lot of things. Going backwards and forwards at the same time. Talk about ""The Russians?"" or planning to write a memoir. Brad Pitt is priceless and the innocence of his character is so believable that I wondered how many more surprises this actor has up his sleeve. He is a joy. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. I was totally immerse in their universe even if I didn't quite care what was going on. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins and the unnerving Tilda Swinton complete the package of this movie that feels as if it was made for the sheer pleasure of it."
"massimo-pigliucci","7","11","13","16 September 2008"," not their best, but pleasurable nonetheless
","This is by far not the most interesting production by the Cohens, but it is worth watching on a variety of levels. First, there is the pleasure of seeing a bunch of good actors working together with great chemistry, some of them (like Pitt and Clooney) certainly not in their ""traditional"" roles. Second, the story is actually wacky enough to hold up in terms of internal logic, as strange as it may seem. As usual with the brothers, do expect some unexpected turns, of the violent variety. And yet, somehow, the movie retains the character of a light comedy. Pay particular attention to the very last words spoken in the film, they may be the best summary of the whole thing I've heard so far."
"tomrito","9","289","472","14 September 2008"," Very funny adult comedy
","The point here is that this movie is for adults, with adult themes and adult situations. As with all Coen brother movies, there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining, dark and very funny. I really liked ""No Country for Old Men"" but I have to say, ""Burn After Reading"" was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly, without any clear direction; well I have to disagree, if you are paying attention and you are an adult, you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the odd-ball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence, bad language, and everyone is sleeping with everyone else, especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material."
"sgtcupcake2","10","36","52","2 July 2009"," Great Movie, Full of Originality and Dark Humor
","I felt like I needed to review this movie because it has been largely misunderstood by many of the reviewers on this site. First off, this is not a movie that is going to show you everything and baby step you through the plot. (Children please leave now, this is an adult movie)<br/><br/>Part of the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is because it engages you as the viewer by forcing you to consider all the event that are happening. Trying to piece all the randomness together and make sense of all the events unfolding in front of you is one of the best aspects of the movie. (shocking as it may be we are forced to use our brains!). Even though the majority of the characters appear to have nothing in common and no real relationship with each other, their true connections lie in their actions. George Clooney's invisible threads for instance touch pretty much every single character in the movie even if there is no real interaction between them. There is a deep underlying theme of betrayal and a ""big brother"" complex which many of the characters develop or exhibit throughout the movie.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes each actor plays their role very well and I think that some viewers were disappointed because they were expecting a more developed Brad Pitt / George Clooney relationship as is the case with most of their movies. As for the humor, it lies in a darker corner underneath the character dialogue. This film makes best use of what I would like to call ""situational comedy"". (Like taking the ""classified information"" to the Russians (The embassy!) so that they could collect some sort of reward). The brief scenes with the CIA are quite amusing as they mostly sit on the sidelines throughout the movie and clean up after the mess which is left behind after the seemingly simple firing of one Mr. Cox.<br/><br/>I am always pleasantly surprised by how original this movie was and how it almost makes fun of all the stereotypical Hollywood bull**** that is filled with most movies today. One of the ways you can tell a movie is good is if you watch it multiple times and still find something new or amusing in the story each time.<br/><br/>Bottom-line: If you are looking for a story that is more than skin deep (which the Coen brother are notorious for) then you have come to the right place. For everyone else where thinking hurts your head, go watch the new Transformers Movie.<br/><br/>** On a side note** To the one reviewer who thinks Clooney shoots Brad out of no where, if you had actually bothered to pay attention during the movie you could see that when Clooney opens the closet the first thing he grabs for is his gun hanging on the wall. Then because of his yeeaars of service as an air marshal his training kicks in and out of instinct he shoots before he thinks. (This may be also partly due to his paranoia of being followed by spooks)"
"jackgdemoss","8","12","15","22 August 2019"," Maintained a dark comedy feel even through the darkest parts
","Burn After Reading is my first run in with the Coen brothers, so I am completely unfamiliar with their style. What they seemed to have on their side from the get go was a rockstar cast filling all lead and character roles. Even some of the unknowns gave fiery performances. This film felt most similar to Requiem for a Dream both in theme and story-telling. I look forward to catching up on more Coen films in the future."
"erica-224","Null","169","294","10 September 2008"," More ""Big Lebowski"" Than ""Intolerable Cruelty"" -- thankfully
","BURN AFTER READING is laugh-out-loud funny. It's more ""Big Lebowski"" than ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" though there are wisps of both, but ""Burn"" is not quite up to Lebowski's genius. Still, it is very, very funny and loads of fun.<br/><br/>From the opening moments, the Coens' latest movie -- a spy-thriller spoof -- hurls the viewer on a hilarious romp through Absurd-land. What better place to set such a story than Washington, DC?<br/><br/>The story involves a demoted government worker (John Malkovich) who finds himself the target of an extortion scheme by two gym workers, riotously played by Frances McDormand (a would-be gym bunny if only she could afford some plastic surgery) and Brad Pitt (a high-energy, arm-thrusting, hip-shaking fitness trainer-cum-""good Samaritan"" who lands himself way in over his head). The romp soon turns dark.<br/><br/>As usual, the Coens' dialog is a real treat. When a co-worker points to Malkovich's alcohol problems as a reason for his demotion, Malkovich retorts, ""You're a Mormon. Next to you we all have a drinking problem."" And as usual in Coen-land, there's a clash between high and low brow. Malkovich's pronunciations of ""mem-wahhh"" for ""memoir"" is a hoot, and his correction of Pitt's mistaken ""report"" for ""rapport"" propels a conflict between classes and types -- symbols of a society in trouble, whose priorities are askew.<br/><br/>As in the Coen brothers' 1987 box-office hit RAISING ARIZONA, obsessions fuel the plot, though this time it's body (not baby) obsession. McDormand is hellbent on getting expensive elective surgery to ""reinvent"" herself. Pitt is a workout addict, who can barely stop moving long enough to think straight. And George Clooney, who can only stop talking when it's time to go running or jump into bed with someone, plays a G-man fixated on sex. Notions of ""intelligence"" and all that the word connotes (along with its antonyms) mix into the film's dark comedic brew of unintended consequences.<br/><br/>Where does it go? I don't want to give away any of the twists to answer that question in depth. But I would disagree with the critics who claim it doesn't go anywhere. The movie and its over-the-top, needless violence show how secretive missions even by bumbling know-nothings (whose only knowledge of undercover ops seems to come from spy flicks) can have disastrous outcomes. Secrets in Washington? Sure sounds like a topic we should all be better versed in.<br/><br/><ul><li>Erica Rowell Author: The Brothers Grim: The Films of Ethan and Joel Coen http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Grim-Films-Ethan-Joel/dp/0810858509</li></ul>"
"gary-444","9","81","138","17 October 2008"," An Intelligent. Quirky, Surreal Delight
","This film will not be to everyones taste, and I wholly understand the polarised responses.A star studded cast enjoy a knowing, wordy script, where dialogue counts, a Coen brothers trademark.However not very much happens, and the narrative is disjointed, so the pace of the story is very staccato.But once again the result is something very wide of the Hollywood mainstream and is all the more satisfying for it.<br/><br/>A 95 minute running time,, and several separate but interwoven plots, mean that screen time for individual actors is limited. Consequently each shines in their given roles, relishing the word play and eking the maximum out of each situation.No scene is dwelled upon, and the occasional bloody outburst of violence, or titillating appearance of a Sybian machine , is shown then moved on from before you have time to work out exactly what is going on.<br/><br/>The script is littered with double entendres, ""running gags (pun intended)and lines aimed straight at the audience from the screen. No-one knows what is going on, or what has gone on, or what is going to happen, and is all the better for it.A mini-masterpiece."
"swlabr413","9","255","478","4 September 2008"," Another Hit from the genius of the Coens.
","There's a point in this movie that George Clooney's character, Harry Pfarrer shows Frances McDormand's character Linda Litzke something that we've seen him working on for about half the movie. It was so surprising when I first saw it, that at first, I didn't even know what it was.<br/><br/>Once again, the Coens have created wonderful characters, including Clooney, who is a womanizer and paranoid that people are following him, and McDormand, who just wants plastic surgery in order to look better. Also, there's John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, who ""doesn't have a drinking problem,"" and maybe the best in the movie, Brad Pitt as Chad, a clueless gym employee who is pushed along by McDormand.<br/><br/>The only character that isn't up to par with the rest is Tilda Swinton's character of Katie Cox, Osbourne's wife. She doesn't get as many laughs as the rest, and it seems like the Coens just needed her as a plot device rather than an actual character. However, she may not be funny, but she does play the character well.<br/><br/>The writing is brilliant and the Coens weave the story in such a way that it reminds me of their previous movie, The Big Lebowski. In the end, as J.K. Simmons character sums it up himself, nothing really happens, but while watching it all unfold, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity."

","Norman Cousins would have loved the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading."" The late great Saturday Review editor had treated his illness with Marx Brothers movies, having ""made the joyous discovery that 10 minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep.""<br/><br/>I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the ""Burn"" screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from ""Fargo""-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.<br/><br/>Others may lead the cast list with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, but to me, their performances were just a bit on the self-conscious side, trying too hard. At any rate, it's a great cast, and while the plot might have turned into a dud in somebody else's treatment, the Coen Brothers' writing is hilarious, their zingers deadly.<br/><br/>A critic, probably with bad digestion, has decried this ""very black comedy set in a blanched, austere-looking Washington, D.C. Â— an uninspiring and uncomfortable place in which everyone betrays everyone else, and the emotional tone veers from icy politeness to spitting rage and back again."" If I had a chance to think, instead of enjoying ""Burn,"" I would have contemplated MoliÃ¨re and Evelyn Waugh, their comedies of manners, psychological insight, and unbridled great humor.<br/><br/>Yes, there are betrayals (none better than the totally unexpected one at the end of the film), and there is rage, but all contained within a glorious bubble of writing-directing-acting excellence. ""Burn"" grips and holds, surprises and entertains, it is a virtuoso piece.<br/><br/>Don't be misled by the a ""action-trailer"" on TV, saturating the airwaves; it says nothing of the film. Malkovich punching Pitt over a compromising CD of spook stuff is not at the heart of this - the McDormand character's pursuit of cosmetic surgery is, what with her self-examination, a lengthy session with the surgeon (Jeffrey DeMunn, in a brilliant turn), her desperate quest for a way to pay for it. Funny and going deep at the same time, ""Burn"" presents a series of character studies (hence the thought of MoliÃ¨re), in the context of mannered yet true social interactions (Waugh).<br/><br/>Skip descriptions of the plot, reject self-righteous denunciations of smart skepticism and charming evil, go and wallow in life-affirming laughter."

","It makes me sad that, with such great actors to work with, the best the Coens could do is make a mish-mash comedy/drama/horror that was lukewarm at best and boring at its worst. I felt sorry for the actors; they had so little of interest to say or do. I almost fell asleep about 20 minutes in. Where was the madcap screwball comedy? Where was the dark ironic humor? It was all just one-dimensional darkness. Where was the good editing? (i.e. we never saw Clooney holding the gun but we know he shot Pitt in the closet.) Instead we get pointless, morose and dull. This movie coulda been a contender. These characthers coulda been somebody. Instead they're really just forgettable. And that's just a waste."
"Galina_movie_fan","9","152","288","15 September 2008"," The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies - they don't know how :)
","After their Oscar winning turn last year, The Coen Brothers are back with the new film, this time comedy/crime/spy story which is very funny, very dark, quite angry, at times surreal, always ironic and to put it simply a must see for any Coens' fan which means a fan of great movie making. Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner, No Country for Old Men, their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs. But keep in mind, it is comedy: Coens' style and it means that not always the most likable characters get what they look for. As much as the film is funny, it actually paints very disturbing picture about stupidly, idiocy, incompetence, inability to see one step ahead of your actions that keep filling every aspect of our existence with dangerous speed. I loved it - from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and very funny and deliciously clueless, Brad Pitt, and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes, and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semi-retirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman, and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to ""re-invent herself"", both added to the film's multiple delights.<br/><br/>This time, Coens' usual collaborator, Roger Deakins was not director of photography, instead, Emmanuel Lubezki, four times Oscar Nominee (for Children of Men, The New World, Sleepy Hollow, and A Little Princess) took care of camera-work. The film has very beautiful look to it, and I was happy to recognize some of my favorite places in Washington, DC and George Town."

It makes you scare, it makes you thrill moreover - this might be awkward- it makes you also laugh. All these are mixed in a scenario which I haven't seen so creative for awhile. It's like a math problem. And just like it, your mind working through the movie. Keeping guess that who's dealing who. I recommend this movie especially for crime movie lovers.

It had characters that seemed real, a ridiculous but interwoven plot that somehow was hilariously credible and side splitting humor all the way though.<br/><br/>""Burn after Reading"" had none of that. Some of the overacting was atrocious especially from Pitt and McDormand and to be honest Pitt's exit from the film came none too soon. There was little plot structure and some branches ran off into in-explicable dead ends. The only characters I found worth watching were Malkovich who tried to inject some life into it, the sincere gym manager who contrary to Pitt deserved some more lines and the dry humor of the intelligence agents. The Coens really love violence. Maybe they should try making a movie without it. I felt in this one it was only there to relieve the boredom."

I'm talking about Burn After Reading, and it's probably the best film I've never understood. After making one of the best chase movies ever - and one of the BEST ever movies in any genre - in cinema history, No Country For Old Men, the Coens turned back to comedy; they seem to do this often. And what they also did was typical; they approached some of the best actors in the world and threw them into this great spooks movie. It's as if some demented chef was running a fast food franchise joint, and is convinced it's the best restaurant in the known world.

"zardoz-13","1","104","201","26 September 2008"," Ham-Fisted Performances, Poor Plotting, Labored Jokes, and Sudden Lapses of Violence
","""No Country for Old Men"" directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven, overwrought, misanthropic comedy of errors ""Burn After Reading"" should have been burned after they made it. Remember, the Coen Brothers won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar for their inspired but violent account of an indestructible hit-man who methodically tracked down his victims and killed them without a qualm. As their first feature since ""No Country for Old Men, ""Burn After Reading"" radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity. The fourteenth movie that the two brothers have helmed together struggles to be as side-splitting as either ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou."" Instead, this forgettable farce turns out to be as mirthless as two previous Coen misfires ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty."" ""Burn After Reading"" opens like a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. An orbiting spy satellite camera zooms into the Chesapeake Bay area on the East Coast, penetrates the cloud cover and pinpoints C.I.A. Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. A bow-tied, bald-headed, Princeton-educated, career C.I.A. analyst, Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox (John Malkovich of ""Being John Malkovich""), explodes with rage when his boss (David Rasche of ""An Innocent Man"") relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post. The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism. Cox quits the C.I.A. rather than being reassigned. As he storms out of the room, he vows to pen a tell-all memoir. Later, every time we see Ozzie working on his memoirs, he clutches a drink in his fist.<br/><br/>The scene shifts to Hardbodies Fitness Center. Personal trainer Linda Litzke (Oscar-winning Frances McDormand of ""Fargo"") plans to have a number of surgical cosmetic procedures performed on her flabby physique. ""I have gone as far as I can with this body,"" she whines to her plastic surgeon. She is looking for somebody to date on the Internet and she hates her appearance. When her company insurance refuses to cover these elective operations, Linda blows a gasket. Although she isn't pleased with herself, her Hardbodies boss Ted (Richard Jenkins of ""Step Brothers"") drools whenever he is around her. Linda calls him her friend and then all but ignores him. Another Hardbodies trainer, bimbo-brained Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt of ""Ocean's Twelve"") who wears his iPod like jewelry, discovers an anonymous computer disc left in the ladies locker room that contains Ozzie's C.I.A. secrets. Against Ted's wishes, Linda and Chad blackmail Ozzie for $50-thousand dollars so Linda can pay for her four procedures. Meanwhile, Ozzie's ice princess of a wife Katie (Oscar winning Tilda Swinton of ""Michael Clayton"") indulges in an extramarital fling with a married but philandering U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer (a bearded George Clooney of ""Leatherheads"") who constructs mechanical sex machines in his spare time. Pfarrer is married to a successful children's author, Sally (Elizabeth Marvel), who hates the dinner parties that Harry takes her to at Katie's house. Not surprisingly, Ozzie refuses to pay Linda and Chad a dime so Linda approaches officials in the Russian Embassy. Meanwhile, Katie locks Ozzie out of their house and begins divorce proceedings.<br/><br/>Ensemble piece that it is, ""Burn After Reading"" meanders from one quirky character's complications to another in a haphazard manner. The Coen's erratic script for this farcical but violent yarn about a group of largely unsavory dimwits that make moronic fools of themselves seethes with irony. Surprisingly, the Coens seem to have taken leave of their comic senses because their sophisticated humor falls flat on its face. Moreover, in their efforts to drum up laughs, co-stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney deliver performances that verge on epilepsy. Tilda Swinton is particularly rude and hostile as a pediatrician with the bedside manner of a crocodile. She has no problem bossing around either Ozzie or Harry, but she cannot get a child to take its medicine. Pathetic, selfish, delusional cretins populate ""Burn After Reading"" and they refuse to accept reality. For example, Linda believes that if you think positive thoughts that positive things will happen. Indeed, this eclectic gallery of characters qualifies more as caricatures. Since we feel little sympathy toward them, the trials and tribulations that they endure to attain their goals rarely prompts anything more than a smirk or two.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Burn After Reading"" devotes more time to infidelity rather than of espionage. This hyperactive but less-than-hilarious hokum qualifies as a failure on multiple levels. Ham-fisted performances, poor plotting, labored jokes, and sudden lapses of violence spoil what might have been a neat little bit of nothing."

","The Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" is a movie so thoughtless, so arrogant, and so poorly executed that it has forced me to re-consider my opinion of their previous films and seriously raised the question of whether they've been frauds all along.<br/><br/>Joel & Ethan C. have always had an ""offbeat"" sense of humor and an ""unusual"" way of making movies, but fans like myself have always reasoned they were simply following their Muse and making the movies they had to make. With ""Burn After Reading"" they present us with an espionage ""spoof"" whose sense of humor is on par with that of the world's worst rejected sitcom pilot, and you have to wonder: Is this what they've truly been all along?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, George Clooney & Frances McDormand all star as Themselves; no attempt is made at building characters or adhering to any storyline reality. Brad dances because he likes to dance, George panics because it worked well in ""O Brother."" The ""plot"" is ostensibly about amateurs entering the spy game with comedic results, but it breaks down so fast and so completely it's not even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>No matter how many times McDormand blinks cute and begs us to remember Fargo's Marge there's no hiding the fact that the finished product here looks as if there was NO development done whatsoever. The movie feels like Joel & Ethan thought it would be a lark and filmed the whole deal in a week with a digital camera. The garbage that resulted is the death of cinema: Hollywood home videos with million dollar paychecks.<br/><br/>I reserve the F grade for movies that are beyond badÂ… movies that have somehow crossed the line between respectable failure and offensive insult. If you like movies you'll avoid this one, and if you like the Coen Brothers you won't after witnessing the crime they commit here. Stay far away.<br/><br/>GRADE: F"
"Monotreme02","8","24","40","18 October 2008"," Not what I expected: dark, over-the-top, hilarious but surprisingly poignant
","The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair, there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films, the Coens chose to follow up their most heavy-handed and serious film since Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, with a nutty, over-the-top screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film, Raising Arizona, the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it; it's funny, but it's also surprisingly dark and sad, and even poignant to some extent.<br/><br/>Based on the Coen's first wholly original screenplay since 2001's The Man Who Wasn't There, Burn After Reading features a plethora of classic Coen staples: repetitive (and brilliant) dialogue employing a strange and almost poetic use of curse words, a multifaceted plot featuring slightly dim-witted characters in way over their heads, blacker-than-the-night comedy, over-the-top performances from a pool of actors featuring recurring collaborators and newcomers to the Coen clan alike, and to tie it all off, a lesson-learning conclusion in which nothing ends up being learned at all. It's wonderful how the Coens complicate the plot so much only to round it all off perfectly in the end. Like all of their films, Burn After Reading is a carefully calculated dance in which every pause, every stutter and every camera move is planned in advance.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie is trying to get into the Coen's heads and see what they think is funny. What's for sure is that the brothers have the most unique sense of humour in Hollywood; superficially, it seems as if most of the film's comedy derives from over-the-top slapstick/screwball antics and bleak, black comedic situations and visual gags, but in reality Burn After Reading's comedy is a lot subtler than that. As I already mentioned, this is a film in which every twitch and stutter is calculated; fittingly, this is the real source of the film's hilarity, in the actors' facial expressions, subtleties, and delivery of the lines. It's great to think, for instance, that the Coens probably thought that applying a booming, ominous drum-dominated ""epic""-type musical score to the movie in the style of a Tony Scott action-thriller would be absolutely hilarious, and that's just one example of the many jokes in the movie that just soar right over your head. In addition, I think that the Coen Brothers are probably the most talented employers of curse words in Hollywood. Many directors are familiar with the colourful phrases, some more than others, but only the Coens know how to make various S- and F- words utterly sidesplitting.<br/><br/>Blessed with one of the more impressive ensemble casts of any film this year, Burn After Reading inevitably features a plethora of good acting. Surprisingly good acting, actually, proving I suppose that the Coen's didn't really mean for this to be a total farce but do reach out for a little something more. Frances McDormand, George Clooney and John Malkovich all deliver fantastically colourful, over-the-top performances, but each of their characters also has an added level of sadness and poignancy to them that adds a little something more than physical comedy to the actors' performances: McDormand with her almost tragic loneliness and obsession with cosmetic surgery, along with her equally tragic ignorance of those around her that do appreciate her for what she is; Clooney with an equal amount of loneliness and desperation, and an undeniable air of incompetence abound him, suggesting that his mediocre job is probably the best he can get; and Malkovich, with his alcoholism and acute superiority complex. Tilda Swinton and the ever-great Richard Jenkins are a lot subtler than their higher-billed co-stars, and Brad Pitt delivers the only truly one-hundred percent cartoon performance in the film; thought despite its emptiness it's also the most enjoyable and completely hilarious.<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons I reserve for last; he only appears in two scenes in the film, but they are undoubtedly and by far the funniest and most successful scenes of the film. Props to him for admirably succeeding in carrying the Coen's hilarity to another level of deadpan comedy.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have an interesting sense of humour, and it is present up front and center in their latest film. Just the concept of following up a serious drama-thriller like No Country for Old Men with an over-the-top screwball black comedy probably seemed hilarious to them. Featuring great, uproarious performances from a stellar ensemble cast, the Coens really give it their all with their offbeat, so-subtle-half-the-jokes-soar-over-your-head comedy. And yet, the film occasionally does manage to reach out a little further from its apparent genre limitations and provides us with something more poignant and truthfully sad. It's even somewhat startling just how dark the movie gets and how cruel the Coens are to their characters. It wasn't quite what I expected, but then again, that's the Coen Brothers for you."

","This has to be the lamest attempt at a movie plot in the Cohen brothers' career. This movie attracted viewers solely on their name alone. Brad Pitt was the shining jewel in this travesty and he gets the ax, BY ACCIDENT!!! Who the puck cares about Linda's 4 part surgery. It's just to make herself feel better? She was obviously too ignorant to realize that she looked beautiful to those around her and it wasn't like it was a necessary or life saving procedure. Ozzy Cox was totally on the rebound after the shyt hits the fan with his wife divorcing him and what does he get? A COMA. Nice. He could have dished out some vengeance on those succeeding in make his life hell but NO. Everyone is sleeping with everyone which connects people unknowingly yet no one really gets found out. Thank you for movie tension that goes nowhere. The Russians waste even more time by telling the dimwitted protagonists that their information on Cox is ultimately useless. Scenes of Clooney building his ""Mystery Machine"" kills you slowly when its only to find out that its a ""Sit on it and Go Puck Yourself"" Machine. Literally!!! The chair he secretively builds has a pucking dildo in it that goes up and down as the occupant, I imagine, moves back and forth while seated. OM-F-G HILARIOUS!!! If I'm gonna shell out 10 clams i should walk away from the the theater going, ""Dam, that was a good movie!! I can't wait to talk about it with my friends!"" Not, "" Why the did i pay to see that? It might as well have been a movie length commercial."" To be Honest, I happened to thoroughly enjoy the Cohen brothers work and they had yet to disappoint until i saw this skid mark of a film. Watching this is like ""peeling your bark"" without ""falling a tree"". You sit there, hacking away at waves of build up and tension, waiting for the climax to make sense of all this and NO. All you get is a cramp in your hand and a hole in your wallet where a 10 spot used to be. Meanwhile, The Cohen Brothers are laughing all the way to the bank. I know some of you reading this may totally disagree. Fair enough. All I know is that I wasn't the only one NOT laughing in the theater. And yes i know it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. But that's the only thing this movie had going for it and even that was scarce. Comparatively, No Country For Old Men was fantastic. If they were gonna do drama, do it like that. And The Big Lebowski was hysterical! If they wanted to do a comedy, they nailed it right on the head with that one. Even that movie had awkward situations that involved bumbling idiots who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and yet everyone walks away a little wiser and a lesson learned. But mix the 2 and you get an abortion of a film that is the one I'm trying to save you from watching. The point of a good movie, no matter what genre, should be that the viewer walks away WITH something. In this case, Run the hell away cause you ain't getting shyt. Now go buy a dime and thank me for helping you make a better investment than a ticket to this fecal filled feature of phucked uptitude. NEXT!!!"
"DarthVoorhees","1","38","70","8 January 2010"," The Coen's Bastard Film
","Inevitably an excellent filmmaker or in Joel and Ethan's case, filmmakers will make a bad film. Joel and Ethan have enjoyed so much success and have made so many great films that they would be allowed a poor film. 'Burn After Reading' shook my faith in the Coen Brothers whom I greatly admire. It isn't just bad it's jaw droopingly awful. It's 'I want my rental fee back' bad. It's maybe I forget 'Big Lebowski' or 'O, Brother Where Art Thou?' and skip your next comedy bad. Skip this film at all costs. Forget the name Coen is on the box, because the Joel and Ethan Coen I've seen must have shut themselves off when they made this piece of work.<br/><br/>What could be unfunny? Everything. I laughed maybe once in the film and it was more of a ""Really?"" laugh (I think you'll infer that the scene was where George Clooney's Harry showcases his ""chair"") I didn't necessarily find it all that funny but it was a curve ball laugh. The Coen Brothers have always had droll humor. I've greatly enjoyed their earlier comedic efforts. Here it is just sad to watch. It gets to a point where the film seems downright pretentious. That's a low that the Coens never reached before. Their films have always been very smart but they included the audience in it. I just couldn't go with them with 'Burn After Reading'. I knew all the punchlines the Coens were setting up and where the laugh track might sound but none of these scenes were very funny. Joel and Ethan are brave enough to set up a scene where the 'punchline' is Brad Pitt getting shot in the head. It isn't funny. There are two instances of quirky humor being supplied with violence. I laughed at this in their 'Ladykillers' (which many did not like but I really enjoyed), but here it just seems grim and depressing. Everything in the film is far too tongue in cheek but when you have people getting killed and a serious tone it doesn't work.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is it's characters. I don't think the Coens have been given a better cast to work with in terms of talent. None of the characters are allowed to be given life because there is no detail to them. We get very broad ideas about them but nothing to engage us. The character who suffers the most from this is George Clooney's Harry. I think he had the most potential but he is really given an inadequate amount of screen time. He is obviously a sex addict but we don't know why or how he got these insecurities about having relationships. Clooney is eccentric sure but it would have gotten more response from the audience if we knew why. Frances McDormand's performance is the best in the film and it is so despite the script. She is obviously aging and insecure but the Coen Brothers don't really tell you this in their script. McDormand has to bring it out in the subtle of her performance. All the Coens give us is that she is single and concerned about her looks. What McDormand does is carry this character on her own in a decent performance.<br/><br/>Much is made about everyone being unlikeable in the film. The fact is I couldn't care one way or the other if the characters are unlikeable, in fact I'd prefer that they weren't. The problem is these characters have no real personality. These very talented actors are playing for emotion and mood. I can't describe the performances. They are over the top in a surprisingly restrained way. I can very easily imagine the Coen's telling George Clooney and crew to ""quirk it up"". It seems like that. If the Coens had written better characters I have no doubt that this excellent cast would have organically gone and created the kind of characters the Coen's love. Joel and Ethan take a gamble and expect their great cast to save a garbage script, they don't collect.<br/><br/>I don't hate the Coen Brothers, on the contrary it is because of my great respect for them that I am so hard on this film. The last thing any filmmaker needs is blind praise. It seems like 'Burn After Reading' received a great deal of blind praise."
"tara_is_taiza","1","34","63","23 January 2009"," Just my opinion!
","The only thing funny about this movie is when Brad Pitt gets punched in the face and the chair George Clooney makes in his basement! Other than that this movie is slow going and has no point what so ever. Why the hell is Ozzy's wife important. other than the fact she's a b*tch? A lot of the boring crap could have been cut out and you would have had the same result but then the movie would have been a half hour long. It was supposed to be a comedy but all the funny stuff was shown in the previews. They wasted a great cast on a crap movie! I will say that George Clooney was the best one in the movie. Take what you want from this and leave the rest. I didn't like it but you might."
"neil-476","6","13","21","30 October 2008"," Another Coen private joke
","I have had mixed feelings about the Coen brothers for some time. For me, their movies fall into two distinct categories. There are those which I have enjoyed - Fargo, Lebowski. And there are those where I have felt that a good idea has become inaccessible to the audience (ie. me) because it is excessively dressed up in the brothers' private sense of humour (Hudsucker, O Brother).<br/><br/>Burn After Reading joins the latter group.<br/><br/>The idea - assorted misadventures concerning a revealing autobiography written by a disgruntled ex-CIA operative - is great, and would work as either a screwball black comedy or a thriller. Burn After Reading is clearly intended to be a comedy, but the comedy (as is so often the case with the Coens) remains somewhat inscrutable. It's like the couple of kids in your class at school who would laugh uproariously at some private joke which completely passed by everybody else.<br/><br/>It's a shame this is so, because at least two of the performances are screamingly funny - JK Simmonds as a befuddled CIA executive and, especially, Brad Pitt as a terminally dim personal trainer. Richard Jenkins delivers a touching portrayal of a man who desperately loves Frances McDormand's character but is completely at a loss as to what to do about it, and Tilda Swinton gives us an ice queen. These performances belong in two other films - both are excellent, but neither is even slightly funny. Nor, for that matter, are the two savage on-screen killings, although I distinctly got the feeling that both are meant to be hilarious. Malkovich chews the scenery and looks like a cartoon.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Frances McDormand. She is the central character, playing a shallow woman with tunnel vision as far as raising the money for cosmetic surgery is concerned. I like Frances McDormand, and I think she is an excellent actress, but I strongly feel that she was miscast in this movie. A fading bimbo is what was needed, and Miss McDormand is not a fading bimbo. Her marriage to Joel Coen may have had a bearing on her casting.<br/><br/>I wish I shared the Coens' sense of humour - I would have enjoyed this more."
"dbborroughs","5","24","44","6 January 2009"," It didn't work for me
","Wacky Coen Brothers film that should on the page work, but in actuality falls flat. The story is about John Malkovich a disgruntled CIA agent who quit in order to write his memoirs. The disc is lost and it becomes a scramble between a bunch of twits in order to get their hands on the information contained with in. Well acted, well written the film falls flat because however the Coens put the film together it drains the humor out of the situations. I mean there were things that made me laugh in the trailer that just sort of washed over me with out a ripple in the film. I have no idea what happened. Its good after a fashion and better than the things like The Lady Killers, but its still not say Lebowski or one of their lesser films."
"Quinoa1984","10","18","32","13 September 2008"," ""So, what have we learned?"" well, the Coens know convoluted/cracked comedy for one
","And casting, let's not forget that. The Coen brothers, usually writing with specific actors in mind, have placed some of Hollywood's biggest and some of the plain best actors around in parts in Burn After Reading that test them to how far they can take the material before it spontaneously combusts. Maybe it does. While their film does start a little slow, if not too much so, their plot soon requires all of the actors- some Coen regulars big and small, some new- to act stupid, angry, confused, wacko, desperate, going nuts, and generally in characteristic form of a Coen comedy, which is far and beyond a distinct step above a lot of other zany/dark comedies. Thankfully, they all meet the challenge.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is about as convoluted as Alfred Hitchcock lost in a jungle-jim screaming for Mommy while the spiked edges of the metal scrape his noggin. And like Hitchcock, they use star George Clooney for great use as their own quasi-Cary Grant (a friend mentioned that Grant never died, he just became Clooney) as a treasury agent who is having not only an affair with a (now) ex-analyst John Malkovich's wife Tilda Swinton, but with internet-date seeker Frances McDormand. And yet, this is just a small part of the screwy-relationships angle of the picture that unfolds, which includes divorce and not-secret longing and even a home-built chair with a springy dildo.<br/><br/>The Coens main concern here, as with Big Lebowski, is just tossing in a plot thread that is about as true a MacGuffin as possible: Malkovich's ex-analyst character starts up his memoirs, and they somehow get on a disc and wind up in the gym locker room at the Hardbodies fitness center, and McDormand and Brad Pitt's dim-witted ""good Samaritan"" character devise a scheme to muck with Malkovich's documents. From here it becomes a ""cluter-fuck"" as one character says (or maybe more than one), and there's a string of paranoia running throughout for Clooney, McDormand, and even Malkovich. And without spoiling anything, mayhem and violence ensue.<br/><br/>That last line could also apply to the Coens previous No Country for Old Men, only this time (and not-too-oddly enough this was written off-and-on while that written), in Burn After Reading we soak up all of this with a kind of permission-slip to laugh our heads off. Sometimes it's very dark and nihilistic, and just darn right unexpected- one death especially had me and everyone I was seeing the movie with slack-jawed for a few seconds before suddenly going hysteric for five minutes- but it never really strays from being true to the wacky formula the Coens are used to. This doesn't mean every second will be totally crazy like Raising Arizona, but as it builds it becomes clear it's one of the best of the brothers' comedies, loaded with inspired and cleverly insipid dialog (once again Clooney's character, as in O'Brother, has one certain obsession-tic), and some fine outrageousness. Did I also mention its the funniest work Pitt's done in who knows how long, or that you'll have to stay through the end credits just to be able to laugh at the song?"
"jkingshott","5","14","24","26 December 2008"," Not really funny
","This is a very dark movie. There wasn't a single character I felt any empathy for. The Brad Pitt character was just too stupid to be respected. The Frances McDormand character was really hideous at heart. I guess the gym owner was sympathetic, but I felt what happened to him was just ridiculous. <br/><br/>It's also much more violent than I expected from the 'screwball comedy' billing it received. I felt the trailer was misleading. I expected something along the line of O Brother Where Art Thou, which is one of my favorite movies of all time. This isn't that at all.<br/><br/>I was sort of entertained by this movie, but when it was over I felt that I had wasted two hours of my time. I would call this a ""feel bad"" movie."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","4","5","25 March 2018"," Brad Pitt should do more comedy like his role in Burn After Reading
","Mrs. Shullivan and I saw this movie when it was first released ten years ago. In fact we sat through the film twice because we were 10 minutes late and missed the beginning and boy were we glad we stayed and watched it a second time. This comedy/crime/suspense film is such a classic with the comedy style presented by both Brad Pitt and his buddy George Clooney. This is another Cohen brother film release so one does know what to expect (somewhat) with the Cohen brothers. <br/><br/>The Cohen brothers usually move a picture along at a rapid pace with a gifted and creative storyline as well as with great music score and this film fits their method of operating to a tee. Brad Pitt plays a not too bright health club instructor named Chad Feldheimer who along with his somewhat brighter peer fitness instructor Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) recover a disc that holds some pretty important information that certain bad guys want back.<br/><br/>So Chad and Linda figure they can maybe receive a kind of reward for the return of the disc to the (not so) rightful owner. When Chad and Linda get in touch with the foul mouthed alcoholic and retired CIA agent Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) I thought we were watching another sequel to the 1994 Dumb and Dumber films. Add to the mix Osborne Cox's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wanting a divorce from her husband so that she can move on to her current lover Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) and you have in this comedic mixing bowl enough nuts and bolts to blow the roof off of any comparable perfect comedy/crime caper.<br/><br/>We have watched this film several times now and we will be watching it a few more times whenever we want a good laugh. I give the film a perfect 10 for 10 rating."
"welsh11","8","4","5","15 December 2013"," Plan Goes Awry Strikes Again
","WARNING: Review Includes SPOILERS<br/><br/>This film follows the typical pattern of a Coen brothers movie. The ""plan goes awry"" theme is the central premise, though the Coens have claimed idiocy is the main theme. Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is after four different cosmetic surgeries, and after being denied by her HMO, she is desperate to come up with the money. This is the main plot, and all other characters are weaved into this storyline. Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) works with Linda at the Hardbodies gym, and works as her accomplice to get a reward from Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) after they find what they believe to be his disc containing sensitive CIA intelligence at Hardbodies. Unbeknownst to them, however, Osborne had recently been fired from the CIA, and the disc was simply his memoirs. Osborne's wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton), has been having an extramarital affair with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a man also employed by the CIA in the treasury department. The disc found by Chad and Linda was created by Katie. She saved Osborne's memoirs and personal financial information on the disc in an effort to stake her claim in his funds before filing for divorce, as advised by her attorney. Believing the disc to be valuable, Linda and Chad locate Osborne and inform him they are in possession of his sensitive information, and they will return it to him for a fee. Osborne is not amused, nor is he cooperative. When they realize they will not get a ""Good Samaritan Tax"" from Osborne, Linda and Chad decide to take the information to the Russian embassy. <br/><br/>The characters in this film are exaggerated and completely absurd, Chad in particular. It was clear Brad Pitt had fun with this character, and he was the highlight of the film. It was a loss to the movie when he was killed off at about the halfway mark, but the Coens knew what they were doing. Chad was such a lovable character that the audience could really appreciate him when he was on screen, but he did not have too much screen time. Viewers did not have the opportunity to become bored by him. He was humorous in his absurdity, and the film would not have worked without him. His death supports the theme in that it was one of the unintended outcomes of Linda's plan.<br/><br/>Linda's plan was to take the disc and sell the ""sensitive information"" to the Russians. When the Russians demand more information, Linda makes Chad break into Osborne's home to steal more. Unfortunately, this does not work out as planned, much like the plan in Fargo, another of the Coens' films. Chad is ultimately shot dead by Harry while in Osborne's home. This scene most compliments the plan gone awry theme. Linda was not out to hurt anyone, she only wanted to look better. Money was her motivation, and unfortunately, her selfish plan left several casualties in its wake. <br/><br/>The Coens commented on social problems throughout the film. Linda's incessant search for the perfect body with money as a motivator for her actions shows that vanity has become an unfortunate social tradition. Further, when the CIA officers are on screen, they take a nonchalant position. They attempt to make sense of it all, but, in the end, decide they have learned nothing. They basically sweep all the problems under the rug Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a comment on the current state of those in power. <br/><br/>The Coens employed the use of the musical score as a means to communicate emotion. The deep drumming instills in viewers the intensity of scenes. The suspenseful music functions to create structural rhythms and stimulate emotional responses (Boggs & Petrie, 2008, 292). The score prepares us for action by building dramatic tension, and when it is played, we become subconsciously aware that exciting action is about to take place. The music compliments the theme by being played when plans are about to fall through. <br/><br/>Burn After Reading was edited in such a way that quick cutting between scenes fosters excitement in the viewer. The editing is smooth and unobtrusive, successfully communicating the fast pace of the story. This supports the theme in that is it fast and chaotic, much like when the result of a plan is unintended and continues to snowball into worse outcomes. <br/><br/>References Boggs, J. & Petrie, J.

","The Coen Brothers nail another comedy with a wonderful cast playing wonderful, screwball characters. This movie is a riot. The cast includes George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Malkovich is superb as Osbourne Cox, a fired CIA agent who writes his memoirs in defiance of the agency that dumped him. A copy of his memoirs ends up in the hands of the employees of a local gym - Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), who are incredibly dumb and driven. They try to blackmail Cox, and the story spirals into complete chaos.<br/><br/>George Clooney should stop acting for anyone other than the Coen brothers. I don't know what they have that brings out the lunatic in Clooney, but every time he's in a Coen movie, he does the best job he's ever done. He's a good actor the other times, but for the Coens, he's one of the best of today's actors. Malkovich is excellent all the time, and he's used by the Coens superbly - well, I said superb about him a paragraph ago, but it's still the right word. His physical comedy here is hilarious. He's a great actor, and he gets to let it all out as Cox.<br/><br/>Among the nice things about this movie is that there are no babes (well, maybe Pitt, but we'll think more about that later), no slow-motion martial arts fights, no big gun fights with full automatic weapons, just funny scene after funny scene, with a few shockers thrown in to keep us off-balance.

"reidy-christopher","4","33","70","26 September 2008"," Great party! You're not invited.
","This film was enjoyable in a detached kind of way. You are not ever involved with any of the characters. It's sort of like watching a Cohen Brothers home movie or the student film of some very talented, but very in-jokey film students. It doesn't matter if you think it's funny--it cracks up the directors, and that's all that matters. It's too bad. At times, the film is brilliant; sort of like ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" if that film had been written by the ""Airplane"" guys and co-directed by Ingmar Bergman and David Lynch. But that only comes in sublime flashes. For most of the rest of the time, you feel like you are watching over paid if not over qualified Hollywood Movie Stars (and yes, Frances McDormand, you are one. You too Tilda)hamming it up (way too much mugging here)at some sort of comedy camp retreat for actors. You sort of wish they had found some new struggling fresh faces for these roles, since the actors here seem to be slumming, or lazy, or falling back on old tricks. Remember how refreshing Frances was in ""Blood Simple""? That's what they needed here. The other thing they needed was a cohesive script. Too much happens ""off screen"" so to speak; when it would've been way more interesting than what we actually see. The CIA agents talking about the case is lame and falls flat, and frankly, is lazy. The other mistake was the shock moments the directors shoe-horned in for no reason other than to shock. Gore did not belong in this film. This really should've been rewritten and polished and given a strong plot on which to rest all the complications. This was a lost chance. This film really could have been a true classic. As it is, it's a notable, but forgettable minor comedy thriller. Wait for DVD."
"roedyg","7","5","7","16 November 2012"," Canadian humour in an American Movie
","The first thing to understand about his movie is it is a comedy. It did not dawn on me until I was well into the movie. I debated whether I should consider revealing this fact a spoiler. I am used to very broad humour in American movies. This was more subtle leg-pulling Canadian style humour. There is a comedy show on CBC Radio called ""This is That"" in Canada where every week they suck new listeners into thinking it is a legit soft news show interviewing eccentric people. Listeners phone in to express their outrage at the things the interviewees are proposing. Burn after reading is like the movie version of This is That.<br/><br/>I saw the cast including Brad Pitt and George Clooney and expected them to play roles highly charming to females. But Pitt plays a character as strange as Dustin Hoffman's Ratzo Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy or Raymond Babbit in Rainman. He is handsome and sexy as only Brad Pitt can be, but with so many strange verbal and kinetic tics and hair styled by Peewee Herman, he creeped me out.<br/><br/>Nearly everybody sleeps with nearly everybody else. It takes great effort to figure out who is married to whom, who is lovers with whom, who is angry about their partner's infidelity and who is not. It is like a kaleidoscope of partners shuffling.<br/><br/>You have to keep track not only of the plot twists, but what each character thinks is going on. It is as complicated as a French farce.<br/><br/>To add to the complication, John Malkovich and J.K. Simons look somewhat alike, so I sometimes got them confused too.<br/><br/>Simons is the perfect actor for the role of CIA chief. He can say anything with a straight face and make it sound completely reasonable and sober. They gave him the final scene. No matter what happens, he takes it in stride. The preposterous of this builds and builds as the situations get more and more insane. Then suddenly I twigged at the utter absurdity of it all and collapsed in laughter.<br/><br/>It is a very cleverly constructed movie where the humour sneaks up on you."

","This film is packed with superb performances and extreme character juxtapositions: Clooney's used car salesman approach to the fairer sex, Frances McDormand's desperation for cosmetic surgery that leads her into the most unlikely of alliances with the gawky idiot played hilariously by Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton's studied coldness and straightness and her manic, dangerously disappointed husband played by a masterful and creepy John Malkovich...the plot, as with many Coen brothers films, is almost irrelevant: it's the set-pieces and the way that things happen that grabs you.

I completely and utterly disagree. I am, what some would call, a child. I am sixteen years old. Not old enough to even see the movie alone, though I did. I loved the movie, the humor, as is the case with all Coen brother movies, was indeed dark. The story had a wonderful arch. It was simply well made and well acted. Though i would have to say, from the perspective of an actor, John Malchovich's character seemed to have nowhere to go. It reached the zenith in the first scene. Yes he was a misanthropic, smart-ass, jerk, for lack of a better word, but his anger peaked then had nowhere to go but down.

","""Burn After Reading"" shows what happens when a couple of bungling amateurs attempt to beat the big boys of the C.I.A. at their own game.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are the D.C.-based health club workers who stumble across a computer disc that they believe contains top secret, classified information. In actuality, it's the property of Osbourne Cox, a C.I.A. analyst who has recently been let go from the agency, and who is composing his memoirs as an act of retaliation against his former bosses. Tilda Swinton plays Osbourne's harridan wife who's having an affair with a tic-plagued, exercise-obsessed married man embodied by George Clooney. The discovery of the disc leads to a roundelay of false assumptions and comical misunderstandings all wrapped up in an intricately plotted scenario dripping with situational ironies.<br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" is Joel and Ethan Coen's darkly humorous follow-up to their Oscar-winning masterpiece, ""No Country for Old Men,"" a grimly serious work that took little time out for comic relief (and earned them bucket loads of awards for doing so). This new film finds the boys back in the more familiar terrain of ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski,"" where the laughs outnumber the gasps by a healthy margin. ""Burn After Reading"" certainly adheres to the customary Coen Brothers formula where a heightened quirkiness and a deliberately disjointed storyline are coupled with sudden flare-ups of violence and the unexpected deaths of major characters.<br/><br/>While the refusal to follow a predictable narrative path is one of the chief selling points of any Coen Brothers film, the fact of the matter is that, in the case of ""Burn After Reading,"" the script probably could have used a few more revisions to bring the disparate elements more satisfactorily in line with one another. Too often it feels as if the movie itself is rambling around pointlessly, without any clear direction or purpose. For one thing, many of the scenes that might have served as the connecting tissue holding the various story lines together seem to have been - perhaps deliberately - left on the cutting-room floor. We're laughing along with the craziness all right, but we're also hoping against hope that the filmmakers will find a way to bring it all together in the end. Instead, what we get is a sit-down synopsis of events that is probably the least successful finale of that sort since the closing scene in ""Psycho."" For if viewers think they were frustrated by the truncated ending in ""No Country,"" they ain't seen nuttin' yet.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""Burn After Reading"" is the delicious performances from a cast that any director would give his eyeteeth to work with. Malkovich, McDormand, Clooney, and Swinton all manage to define their characters through individualized quirks without ever going over the top and reducing their characters to caricatures. But it is Pitt who steals every scene he's in as the nerdy, hyper kinetic doofus who fancies himself a double-naught spy fit to stand alongside the James Bonds of the world. Pitt has rarely been this winning.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. ""Burn After Reading"" is a frequently hilarious film that is vastly preferable to all those cookie-cutter comedies that can be found habitually ensconced in the neighborhood multiplexes. But it's not exactly prime Coen Brothers either, and, for that reason, I have to make this only a halfhearted recommendation. But, then again, even inferior Coen Brothers is better than no Coen Brothers at all."
"moutonbear25","8","18","36","12 September 2008"," Burnt After Having Read
","The now infamous Coen brothers make a lot of movies and they know that people out there see a whole lot of movies too. A population distracted by constant film watching is a population led to see the world in a truly dramatic fashion. Finding a computer disc in the ladies locker room of a fitness club would ordinarily be just another occasion to throw something left behind in a lost and found box, likely never to be reclaimed. If you've seen one too many movies though, and you don't have a whole lot going on in your own little life, you might see finding this disc as an opportunity to blackmail the owner of said disc for contents you believe to be top secret C.I.A. intelligence. There's just one thing the movies don't tell you about capers such as these though, and that is that none of it is real. In BURN AFTER READING, the Coens decide it's time for a little fun and serve up a hearty dose of signature comedy that both highlights the influence of film and perpetuates it further at the same time.<br/><br/>BURN AFTER READING begins with a thunderous, percussion heavy score and an all too familiar opening shot of the planet we call home. Slowly but persistently, the worldview becomes more focused and as we descend, we zero in on the city of Washington. The titles appear on the screen, digitally processed as though you were reading them off a computer. Have the Coens made a super spy movie, I wondered, and with that, they had me exactly where they wanted me. Though you wouldn't know it from the way they speak in public, the Coens are big jokers; they like to play with their audiences. They get you thinking one way and then take you in a whole other direction. It's almost like they're laughing at you sometimes but really, they just want you to have as much fun as they seem to be having. And fun is to be had in BURN AFTER READING. After perfecting the art of suspenseful drama with last year's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, the brothers have returned to more familiar waters for zaniness that is entirely offbeat while still sharp and biting.<br/><br/>The premise itself is certainly amusing, if not a little scattered, but it is the top-notch ensemble that solidifies this work as quintessentially Coen-esquire. Regulars like George Clooney and Frances McDormand return as two particularly kooky people who find each other online while pretending to be different versions of themselves. Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich are a married couple on the way to divorce. Both are, to a fault, cold and crazed respectively, as well as formidable performers. Richard Jenkins turns in another self- effacing, understated performance (after this year's THE VISITOR) that should nab him more work with high profile directors. And while all of these performances are top notch and so delightfully exaggerated, it is Brad Pitt that shines brightest for the simple reason that he is entirely ridiculous. Pitt plays Chad Feldheimer, a fitness trainer who has perhaps been running on endorphins for one too many laps, and the only character in this film who isn't pretending to be anything he isn't. This could have a lot to do with his character not being smart enough to pull off disguise but Pitt himself is more than capable. We never quite forget that we're watching Pitt but that's what makes his unbridled exuberance as he bounces around to the music in his headphones so darn funny.<br/><br/>Despite the title, nothing actually gets burnt after being read at any point in the film. The act itself though is so dramatic that to name your movie this essentially announces the intended tone. BURN AFTER READING definitely makes good on its promise and has a blast doing it. The Coen Brothers are sitting pretty atop their throne as two of Hollywood's most celebrated filmmakers and their latest plays out almost effortlessly. Even switching over to a new cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki (rather than long time collaborator, Richard Deakins), happens without a beat missed. It's as though they could do all of this in their sleep. Now, that would be one hell of a dream that would make one heck of a good movie. We just have to make sure we can spot the difference between that and the real thing."

You're on the edge of your seat wondering 'Uh oh, what's going to happen next?' Brad Pitt as the goofball co-worker of the protagonist, is hysterical.

It's a story of paranoia, miscommunication and cosmic coincidence. In the hands of lesser directors this might feel nonsensical and too random but the Coens are skilled artisans when it comes to surreal, weird plot lines and story movements and it shows. Definitely worth a watch or two, if you're a fan of the Coen Brothers. It is definitely one of their movies after all and if you don't enjoy their style this might be rough."

"Mudsharkbytes","9","13","25","7 September 2008"," If you are a fan of Coen Brothers comedies, this is a must see.
","Whenever I see a new movie by Joel & Ethan Coen I usually have a similar reaction. I am always entertained but more often than not the real entertainment comes from pondering and discussing with others what it is I have just seen. Like a good wine, their movies improve with age & repeated viewings, yielding revelations, plot twists, connections, parallels & many details that are often impossible to assimilate upon first viewing. <br/><br/>Burn After Reading is the quintessential Coen Brothers comedy. An original plot that cannot be compared to anything I have ever seen before, great characters, great acting, impeccable directing and editing, numerous typical dollops of Coen brothers leitmotifs (for lack of a better word) - shoes, mirrors, pinstriped suits, telephones, characters that are virtually unanimous in their vanity and fixations on working out. And MANY prolonged laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is an involved, convoluted tale that is about, ultimately, not much at all. The Coens are famous for creating plots where whatever can possibly go wrong does or however somebody can possibly do the wrong thing at the wrong time or be confused and misinterpret something, they will. The usual outcome of this in one of their movies while not necessarily happy for the characters, is very satisfying to the moviegoer. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt turns in a great performance playing the stupid & vapid Chad Feldheimer. Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke is equally short in the brains department and long in vanity. J.K. Simmons, who stole many scenes as Garth Pancake in The Ladykillers, has a great part as a CIA superior, George Cloony is almost manic as the paranoid & obsessive Harry Pfarrer, and John Malkovich taps into vast resources of anger as the unfortunate Osborne Cox. <br/><br/>All in all, a great movie that I can't wait to see again. No doubt I'll catch many details I missed the first time."
"griffolyon12","10","18","37","12 September 2008"," Probably the funniest comedy of '08!
","Burn After Reading is the Coen Brothers returning to what they do best, comedy. After the superb No Country for Old Men, the two brothers decided that for their next project they'd do a wacky and fun screwball comedy, and it paid off very well. The film is very funny and entertaining; like previous Coen Brother's comedies it is filled with dark humor and quirky, yet likable characters. If you asked what the film was about, I'd have to say nothing really; it's really just a movie about a bunch of idiots who are somehow connected in a plot that turns out to mean absolutely nothing, but that's what makes it all the more hilarious.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers did a superb job directing, and their screenplay was as tight as always. Of course it is the acting from this stellar A-List cast that makes the film such a joy to watch, in particular the performances by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand steal the show in practically each scene that they're in. <br/><br/>Overall if you're a fan of previous Coen Brother's comedies you'll love this film, and even if you have never seen a Coen Brother's comedy, but like dark humor, you'll love this film. It is easily the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 out of 10!"

There are some good moments in it and if you're bored it's worth a look but don't expect anything too amazing because you won't, in my opinion, get it. It's true that the past record of the Coens makes you expect more and perhaps if it wasn't them making it I would be less harsh but I'd still say the ending leaves you wondering why you bothered."

","I was expecting great things from this movie - my appetite had been whetted by an amusing trailer (which sadly contained all the funny moments which the movie had to offer), by the presence of the likes of Bard Pitt, George Clooney and John Malkovich, and by the fact that the film as directed by the Coen brothers whose most recent film, No Country for Old Men, I thought was excellent. Alas, Burn After Reading was a huge disappointment - incredibly slow, confused, unsure of what type of movie it really wants to be. There are a couple of genuinely funny moments, one or two shocks, but that's it. This was described as a 'comedy' thriller but, in comparison to the likes of Big Lebowski or Oh Brother Where Art Thou, it simply isn't one! In short, a bit of a turkey!"

","Burn After Reading in a strange way reminded me of 8 1/2 in that both movies are about nothing. But these kind of movies can only go so far and Burn After Reading pushed it to the limit. I would explain the plot to you but as I explained there is none.<br/><br/>The writing and directing was excellent by the Coen brothers. They took the storyline about as far as they could some how making their message believable showing that things never really go according to plan and they showed this in all aspects of life. The Coen brothers are show how they are quite a quirky duo when they make movies such as The Big Lebowski, Brother Where Art Thou and of course this. With their talent though they take movies like this further than almost anyone I can think of could.<br/><br/>The acting in here was very entertaining to watch. John Malkovich is always entertaining to watch, his anger and rage is just a pleasure to watch as ironic as that may sound. Brad Pitt's total embodiment of stupidity in here is probably his best role I have seen to date but then again that maybe shouldn't be too surprising. Francis McDormand was very funny with her need for artificial improvements all over her body. George Clooney, who seemed to be sleeping with everyone was very charming and probably the most interesting to watch behind John Malkovich. Tilda Swinton has began to impress me a lot and has only done so more with the her cold blooded performance. Lastly Richard Jenkins and JK Simmons were actually the most entertaining to watch despite having a superstar cast in front of them.<br/><br/>Despite this movie being so technically sound I still did not think it was an amazing or profound movie. It was a movie with an average story that was totally uplifted by its cast and directors.<br/><br/>My rating: 7.3/10"

Pitt's overacting is painful, but not as cringing as those members of the audience who felt it necessary to burst into fits of laughter when ""Chad"" slurps from a drink or walks along the side walk.<br/><br/>Have we become become so obsessed with the likes of Clooney, Pitt et al that so much as word coming out their mouths is met with screams of adulation? <br/><br/>Not sure what is more frustrating - the film itself or the people who love it."

","I give this film a 1 for ""awful!"" I am a longtime Coen brothers fan ever since Blood Simple, and the funniest movie i have ever seen is - hands down - The Big Lebowski. I was thus expecting to be amused by a cast of quirky characters in a masterfully woven plot that entertains but also says something deeper about life. The cast here is classic Coen; the characters are classic Coen, but somehow all this potential did not add up to equal FUNNY. I really don't know enough about film-making to posit why this is the case.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because there is no universal moral to this story (other than that the CIA has too much power). And unlike the brilliant Lebowski, there are no likable characters here - none of them seem human enough and thus I felt deprived of a good belly laugh over those recognizable (and laughable) human foibles which I found so endearing in the cast of the Big Lebowski. Maybe they just needed more depth. For whatever reason, unlike with the Dude, Larry and Donnie, I didn't care very much about what happened to these miserable people. I only expected that all their vapid and sordid machinations would come to fruition in the end in some kind of brilliantly intertwined crescendo (at least this is what i was expecting after such a disappointingly unsatisfying setup). But no - the film ends abruptly and falls flat - i found myself bursting out loudly upon seeing the credits roll with a disgruntled ""THAT'S ALL?!"" To be honest, I did laugh once, at Brad Pitt, whose character was unfortunately killed off soon thereafter. And I also had a mild chuckle at John Malkovich's outfits, and at George Clooney's rakish behavior.

The premise is flimsy and the characters with one or two exceptions are unlikeable. Pitt's portrayal ranks alongside his outstanding effort in ""Snatch"", and Clooney's comedic talents have long been on show, but for mine Malkovich was one paced, Tilda Swinton wooden and Frances McDormand sounded too much as if she'd just stepped out of her police uniform and off the set of ""Fargo"". For me a great disappointment watching a film patiently anticipated.

","I was kind of hoping for another brilliant one-two punch after No Country for Old Men, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but Burn After Reading has the feel of being written and made quickly and without much refining. Structurally, it's most like Lebowski, in that it's about a bunch of people mixed up in stuff that is beyond them, mostly nobodies finding themselves in a convoluted spy plot. The joke is that no one really knows that it's all much ado about nothing. The story has Frances MacDormand and Brad Pitt finding a CD with what they think is sensitive information on it. They think they can blackmail John Malkovich, to whom they believe the CD belongs. Meanwhile, George Clooney is screwing around with both Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton, and MacDormand, while being married to another woman entirely. Unlike Lebowski, Burn After Reading never bothered to involve me, or be very funny, for that matter. Brad Pitt is the only one who really gets laughs. His meeting with Malkovich, most of which you'll have seen in the commercials, was pretty great. Besides the goofy plot, there's nothing here even resembling the Coen Brothers; no stylish cinematography, little repeatable dialogue. Even Carter Burwell's score feels like it was written in an afternoon, and it sounds a lot like an earlier Coens score, I think Barton Fink. It's most likely their least memorable movie, with the possible exception of The Ladykillers."

Frances McDormand is excellent as usual, as Linda Litsky, a shallow health club employee who wants plastic surgery to better her dating prospects. She and Chad (Brad Pitt) come across a CD which seems to have national security information, so she and Chad decide to try and sell this to the Russian Embassy.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is the CIA operative who loses his job, loses his wife (Tilda Swinton) and subsequently has a breakdown. His scene when trying to get into his Georgetown brownstone after his ex-wife locks him out is classic. <br/><br/>Coen Brothers farce here covers it all. J.K. Simmons has a cameo as the head of the CIA, and his deadpan portrayal of indifference and cynicism is dead on. <br/><br/>Worth watching a few times, highly recommended. Clever and sardonic, an accurate portrayal of deception, politics and narcissism, which American audiences in particular may appreciate. Well done. 10/10."

","This bright comedy is suggested for anyone who got tired of all the classic usual stupid-funny movies and would love to enjoy themselves with smart, strange, confusing and some-kind extreme circumstances involving crime and paranoia. The last term might be misunderstood but all this will get clear soon enough. SPOILERS: The story is about some people who are all connected through deception, political discrimination, husband/wife cheating, blackmailing, exploitement while the following words: CIA, love via Internet and lawyers complete the entangled background. You get many messages through funny scenes and stupid behaviors. For start we are presented in a word of deception concerning the marriage where lawyers thrive consulting their clients to use a divorce in order to exploit their companion.Internet meetings and plastic surgeries take place too while a fuzzy filled in conspiracy climate(issue: obsession of being watched) leads each protagonist to follow a dangerous path with no return. It also raises the point about the common American fears stuck to the past (the Russian enemy). The observer to all this seems to be the CIA who discover that they can barely control the situation while they don't really understand what is going on! BIG SPOILER: In the last scene we see the director of the CIA wondering where they were wrong... my guess is that it all started because of the lawyer of Katie Cox who advised her to spy her husband!So what's the main message of the movie? DON'T FOLLOW YOUR LAWYER'S ADVICES ABOUT LEAVING/DECEIVING YOUR HUSBAND! Anyway,I think all this mess was a bit too much that's why the 7 for vote."

What we have is a collection of forty-somethings being content to coast on their reputations, desperately looking for a fresh face to infuse some life in the proceedings. ""Burn after Reading"" wants to be a farce, but forgets to be funny. It pretends to tell us something about the world we live in, but does so shallowly. And on top of that, it seems to present a negative world view for the sake of it, which is borderline unethical coming from people as talented as this.<br/><br/>Now, if you're a Clooney/Malkovich/McDormand/Pitt/Coen-fan and must see this movie, I won't stop you. There are some enjoyable moments, and you'll occasionally laugh. I guess Pitt IS funny as sports instructor, and Malkovich is always good when he's just being John Malkovich. But in the end, ""Burn After Reading"" is a hollow exercise in black comedy that never bites, never connects, and wastes millions of acting talent on a throwaway script that could have used a LOT of seasoning."

Adding to this a really abhorrent screenplay and the worst acting by Clooney and Pitt to date. Big names do not an utter miscast conceal. Maybe next time actors like Steve Martin, Lesley Nielsen or Jim Carrey could play the clowns in yet another meagre and clunky rip off of previous efforts. Not that I will bother to watch the next one, but at least people will have an honest warning up front.<br/><br/>Not really much to say about this movie other than that I struggled to make it through to the one hour mark before eventually I had to give up, that it sucked in every regard one could think of judging a film of comical intent and that once again the general public can't tell shÃƒÂ¯t from Shinola when it comes to rating a movie.<br/><br/>Cheers and thanks for reading.<br/><br/>*/****"

","Though most Coen Bros. films skirt a fine line between reality and fantasy, this is the only film in their ranks that is so inexplicable and stupid, it must be a true American crime story. Burn After Reading details what happens when you give absolute idiots classified information. The Coens needed the perfect oddball cast, and they got one. John Malkovich is easily the standout favorite of mine. A disgruntled ex-CIA agent with the dirty mouth of a truck driver and a lethal temper. He's phenomenal. Frances McDormand shines here as a middle-of-the-road dolt who only cares about plastic surgery. George Clooney is just George Clooney, but I got a kick out of his patented sex- machine and his priceless reaction to finding a stranger in his home. Brad Pitt, as the over-the-top gymnast, is the only one that sort of left me cold. Nearly anyone other than Brad Pitt could've played that character. A seasoned comedian, no doubt, would've knocked it out of the park. Is this a highlight of the Coens? Not exactly, but it's entertaining as hell."

","Coen Brothers' Burn After Reading (2008) is a roller coaster of a ride. Even with its bizarre story, hyper-real characters, incongruous setting the movie incredibly manages to keep one engaged from starting to finish. Burn After Reading serves to be a great parody on the espionage films of the bygone era. The seemingly strange casting of Malkovich, Clooney, McDormand, Swinton and Pitt turns out to be the movie's greatest asset: it's their impeccably flawed performances that gives the movie its real impetus. <br/><br/>Burn After Reading serves to be a quintessential Coen Brothers film with its subtle, immaculate use of Dark Humor. The movie's strange outlook may make it appear like an exercise in style to those not accustomed to such unconventional style of filmmaking. But the receptive audience is expected to appreciate it more. <br/><br/>So, if you are bored by the monotony of life or the mundaneness of cinema and want to try out something new then Burn After Reading is exactly what you are looking for!!!<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

","This movie was terrible. I'm baffled that it was nominated for two Golden Globe's. You would think with a cast like Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and John Malkovich that it wouldn't suck so bad, but it did. When I saw the preview I thought that this was a must see, the preview was very misleading. There was not one funny scene or even a funny line in this ""comedy"". I guess the writers thought that if they put enough F-bombs in the movie that it would make someone laugh. Or if they made a movie that had absolutely no plot and no organization but did things like kill off the entire cast just because that people would like it. I would go as far to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this one."

There seemed to be some scope for Pitt's character but the act was too short. George Clooney's performance is pretty good. But again the script doesn't seem to have the substance required. I sat through the movie expecting the Coen Brothers to create magic as the plot proceeds (like they usually do) but that moment never seemed to come at all. The Coen brothers definitely were not successful at showing what they saw in the plot. I really don't understand the very high rating. Or it could be just me.

No generic La-La Land. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You could easily imagine how funny a movie like this would have been in the 70s with actors like Alan Arkin, Peter Falk, George Segal, Ruth Gordon, Paula Prentiss. Perhaps I'm a little sentimental...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hats off to Rasche and Simmons playing 2 CIA bureaucrats, they made everything out of very little and they were funnier with the few lines they had than probably all the other actors.

Too much money involved. I found myself constantly guessing what this movie would mean for each actor's career. The movie world is way too uptight.

"mlzema","1","15","33","9 March 2009"," Memo to the Coen Brothers
","I am only moved to post a comment here at IMDb when a movie or TV show I've watched is unusually good or unusually bad. This attempt at comedy falls squarely into the latter category. However, I want to be fair, so this critique is actually a memo to the Coen brothers, to be taken as they like, as advise before considering their next comedy:<br/><br/>1. Every movie needs AT LEAST one likable/sympathetic character. This movie has none. 2. The word ""fuck"" is only funny to males 15 years of age and under. They're not allowed to see this movie. 3. Prop comedy should NOT include a large rubber dildo. Again, it's only funny to males 15 years of age and under, and again, they're not allowed to see this movie. 4. Don't do this to Brad Pitt. He's barely credible as an actor as it is, and he has a lot of mouths to feed. 5. Having people die in a movie billed as a comedy is not funny, especially if it's with a hatchet. 6. Don't do this to George Clooney. Would he have sex with a woman who looks and acts as frumpy as Frances McDormand's character in real life? 7. Every movie should have a beginning, middle, and 'satisfying' ending, but this one appeared to be a series of unrelated scenes edited together. Even worse, it essentially could've been edited in a different sequence and it would've made about as much sense. 8. Don't do this to the U.S. Government. They are having enough P.R. problems as it is, and this didn't help. 9. Divorce is NEVER funny. Didn't you guys see ""The War of the Roses""? 10. Offer a full refund to anyone who went to or rented your movies who found them less than satisfying. (NOTE: could get expensive!)<br/><br/>Of course, if the Coen Brothers ever did condescend to read this review, I'm sure they would only laugh from atop their considerable pile of money, so I appreciate IMDb's forum to allow me to blow off steam after having spent $5 on this stinker of epic proportions."
"burtonyan","4","15","33","2 November 2008"," Probably the only person here who thought it was crap...
","After some thought I have decided to give this film a 4, bearing in mind that whilst I have never reviewed a film before I would say that I am very generous person with points, therefore I am even more surprised how nearly no one had decided to criticise this film as it was. Frankly, I would have thought the average points on here would have about 4-5, to see that it got a 7.7 was shocking, to say the least.<br/><br/>The high score given here was the main reason why I went to see the film in the first place, little did I know that it was another one of those artsy fartsy films that certain people (probably those who would actually bother to leave a score) would rate it highly, which is exactly why I too decided to rate this film because I want to give this film the score it really deserves.<br/><br/>Immediately I noticed the similarity with 'The Big Labowski' and guessed that they were probably by the same writer. I never had the chance to finish 'The Big Labowski' mainly because I fell asleep after roughly half an hour of it. Honestly, who finds watching a sad ass loser living out his crappy life funny? Not to mention entertaining! This film and 'The Big Labowski' together are easily some of the worst comedies I have ever seen in my life, both films had showed no end of complete pointlessness and stupidity blown out of all proportion, with ridiculous story lines, though I am less sure about 'The Big Lebowski' because I didn't actually finish, and having sat through another film (and fighting to stay awake through some parts of it) by the same writer I am not sure that I want to.<br/><br/>Now, back to the film, I will try to analyse without giving away too much of the storyline. It is essentially a string of completely random story that is somehow connected and intertwined, an exploration of the famous six degrees of separation if you will (though a study by MS on msn found it was more like 7), a clever thing to write, true, but the way it was conveyed doesn't do this type of story justice, if you want to see lives intermingle, then watch 'Car Crash' or something. If you are looking to have a good laugh, well, you are much better off looking elsewhere, whilst there were the odd funny moments it is far from being funny enough to keep you entertained, which isn't helped by the severe lack of a realistic storyline, it becomes more believable as the story evolve, with people feeling the pressure and starting to break down, still it was like Alice went to wonderland without following the rabbit, it doesn't connect and thus makes no sense. A recent film that I had seen, 'Ghost Town' was far funnier.<br/><br/>It lacked any big idea, you can argue that it's about human nature but the film's portrays humanity in such a way that it assumes all men (and women)are evil/selfish, an overly pessimistic view of life, I am surprised how the Coens brother haven't yet committed suicide if that was what they thought of the world.<br/><br/>What surprised me even more, though, was the long list of brilliant actors, truth be told they did a tremendous job making the funny moments... well, funny. I think the only reason why they signed up to the film was because it was written by the Coens brothers, who seems to have had a long list of highly rated films."

Several times during the movie I realized how long the entire audience had been silent. Silence is a great sign for a drama, lousy for a comedy. The actors do a fine job with the material, but the material just isn't that good. Seeing Brad Pitt and George Clooney make funny faces can only carry a movie so far.

There was not one character that I liked or could in any way shape or form relate to at all. That for me is a first when watching a Coen Bros. film. Maybe if they had a little for development rather than just being thrown at us, I don't know. Like I said the film itself is well shot (they picked an awful lot of dreary overcast weather though), sounds good, and actually is paced well, and the way the characters are all intermingled with one another without knowing was pretty cool. Clooney's wifes character seemed kind of shoved out of the loop until we see her on her book tour in Seattle but whatever, that could have been another story in itself. Overall this movie was okay... Just not what I was expecting after NCFOM."

","After No Country for Old Men the Coens brothers no doubt had free rein (and a blank cheque) for their next project. That they chose to waste that potential on something as flaccid and underwhelming as Burn After Reading is bitterly disappointing and proves once and for all that the brothers are not as talented as we would like to believe.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is about morons and, not incidentally, that also seems to be its target audience. It is a clichÃ©d ensemble piece - a panoply of characters are introduced which appear to have no real connection between them and slowly the links are revealed. This simplicity would be forgivable if there were a single charming or clever element in the piece but sadly it all seems like a bad joke. The characters are composed of nothing but ticks and grimaces; McDormand looks like she is in a no man's land between 2 minor strokes (and is eerily reminiscent of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka) while Clooney confirms that the sum of his comedic acting ability is his willingness to contort his face. Pitt is the only major player who comes off more or less unscathed (he seems to embrace the absurdity, rather than trying to act through it) but his role is too minimal to save the film. The script is unwieldy, veering from confusing to overly simplistic and has a somewhat puerile sexual focus.<br/><br/>Good points are few are far between. The supporting players are generally good - with J.K. Simmons and Richard Jenkins especially memorable. Indeed the formers interactions with his intelligence community subordinate, as they try to figure out what the hell the main characters are up to, provide the films only consistent humour.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is a black comedy with too much milk and sugar - the result is anemic and lacking the grown up sensibilities of the brothers' better films. Fargo, for example, is extremely funny at times but laces that humour with a real sense of human desperation and a respect for the audiences intelligence.<br/><br/>It seems pretty obvious to me that this film would not exist without the success of No Country for Old Men, a film which I thought was effective but rather overrated. Perhaps if more people had felt like I did we wouldn't have had to suffer through this flat, laugh free 'comedy'.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is about morons, for morons and (quite possibly) made by morons. Avoid."

","Elmore Leonard once explained that in his writing he removes the parts that people skip. The Coen Brothers might do well to take this advice into consideration. I kept wanting to skip to the next scene in hopes of finding something interesting.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have a gift for creating quirky, interesting characters. But in many of their movies, including ""Burn After Reading"", they fail to create a similarly engaging plot. In short, the movie is all dressed up with nowhere to go.<br/><br/>Much of the movie seems to focus on the entangled web of infidelities between the characters. I guess I can't blame them since the spy plot line is thin and weak, which provides all of a minute's worth of action in the 90-minute movie. But the Coen's fail to make even the love triangles and quadrangles interesting. And if you can't make sex interesting, you have a serious problem.<br/><br/>I keep hoping that the Coen's will rise to their potential and create a movie that goes somewhere.

","The John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinion and Tichard Jenkins' bundle serves exclusively to baffle the audience.

I give it a 1/10 for either feeling poisoned, or out of jealousy for so much talent wasted and so much money tossed; line up in front of the counter and wait for your turn to be foiled. The only plot device which would indicate some intelligence is in the title: ""Burn after reading"", a thought that Joel and Ethan might have had after writing the screenplay, or in the last line of the movie: â€“ What did we learn, Palmer? â€“ I don't know, sir. â€“ I don't F-word know either. I guess we learned not to do it again. â€“ Yes, sir. â€“ I'm F-word if I know what we did. â€“ Yes, sir, it's, uh, hard to say â€“ Jesus F-word Christ. (the story concludes with this F-fetched ending). But this - deus ex machina - creates a false sense of consolation and implies a lack of creativity on the part of the authors; if the professional life of Joel and Ethan Coen took a turn for better or worse I don't know and it remains to be seen."

","The Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" is one of those movies with a farcical and convoluted plot involving idiotic one-up-manship that is essentially an excuse for the filmmakers to poke fun and for their stars to have a great time doing silly bits. Here our zany Brothers return to one of their favorite themes: what happens when simpletons get in way over their heads with a cynical league of morons. Clooney, McDormand, Malcovich, Swinton, and especially Pitt, all whip out their best comedic timing and smarmy facial expressions in this tale of misguided blackmail and bumbling counter-intelligence. Unlike their last two comedic travesties (the barely there ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and the wacko ""Ladykillers""), the Coens' focus is sharper and crueler in this ""Reading"" and pointed directly at the government, society, themselves and their audience.<br/><br/>I've seen four out of the last five Coen Brothers' films in crowded theaters where their faithful often laugh out of turn at some of the most unfunny of moments. ""Burn After Reading"" has plenty of those moments, as well as some truly funny ones, but one has to wonder why such a talented pair would shoot so low as to desire the elicitation of that ""solo"" laughter from the loons in the audience that constitute the filmmakers' personal league of morons. When Clooney's hardwood floor-loving womanizer unveils his ""special project"" to McDormand's plastic-surgery obsessed internet speed dater, it's a hilarious anti-climax to what had been a long build-up in previous scenes that had the whole crowd groaning and giggling. But isn't Clooney's rear-entry sexual-aid device a bit emblematic of how the Coens' have been treating their audience lately? Later, when Malcovich's alcoholic ex-CIA analyst literally takes a hatchet to another character, it again elicits uproars, but I couldn't help but think the Coens' were symbolically taking out their frustration on the faithful who have been befuddled by their recent offerings. We're a cynical bunch, and so are the Coens, and whether they see themselves as the simpletons in over their heads and their audience as the league of morons, or vice versa, is never clear.<br/><br/>At least with this slow ""Burn"" we don't have to deal with the pretentious philosophical ruminations of their literary bound and insanely overrated Oscar-winner, ""No Country for Old Men"". While this might not recapture the pure joy of their original dark comedy, ""Raising Arizona"", this star-studded and occasionally hilarious ""Burn After Reading"" is the Coen Brothers' most entertaining film in years, even if we're all a little more bruised from the wear."

","""What did we learn, Palmer?"" ""I don't know, sir."" ""I don't f...'in know either. I guess we learned not to do it again."" That exchange between the head of the CIA (I guess) and one of his agents closes out this movie and about sums up my reaction to this movie. After more than an hour and a half, I don't really have a clue what happened, and I sure hope it doesn't lead to anything else!<br/><br/>There was some potential, and I confess that I really did chuckle a few times at some of the ridiculous situations that were portrayed, but overall this whole thing was a muddle of those ridiculous situations. The basic premise seemed to be promising. An ex-intelligence officer leaves a disc with what appears to be classified information on it at the gym after a workout. It's found and two employees - Linda and Chad (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) - decide to use it to make some money to help Linda pay for some cosmetic surgery she wants. It almost sounds like it could have been a slapstick sort of semi-spy caper, but it just didn't seem to work. The attempts to get laughs out of the viewer seemed too forced - everyone seemed to be trying too hard to be funny, but humour needs to flow more naturally to be truly funny. Of all the cast, the only one I really enjoyed watching was Brad Pitt, who was cast a bit against type. He's a sort of gay-like (because that was never really spelled out but seemed implied) fitness coach. Other than that, I was quite underwhelmed by everyone and everything. 2/10"
"ionceslappedahippo","4","9","18","13 November 2009"," intelligent, humorous, but ultimately pointless
","If the point of a movie is to take the viewer on a journey then this movie runs out of gas on the driveway. I was really looking forward to seeing this film having seen the trailer but all it's savvy and undeniably fantastic performances from all the actors (particularly John Malkovitch) could not make up for what this film so obviously lacks.<br/><br/>None of the characters is likable - I mean, to think of any film randomly, in 'American History X' for example the viewer is led to sympathise with the protagonist who is a horrible murdering racist (once he's reformed obviously, which shows that in that movie there was at least some point to the story) showing that with the right screen play an audience can be made to identify with practically any character.<br/><br/>Conversely Burn before reading is completely bland in that respect, it fails to draw in the viewer, at no point did I even care what happened to any of the characters - I can't work out what the film is trying to tell me (if anything). I have just spent a totally beige evening with this movie, watching this is the equivalent to eating a bowl of sawdust for supper. <br/><br/>There may be a multi-faceted plot and a few laughs (derived from stellar performances rather than script) but there's no story, no character development, no twist, and then, when you're starting to wonder why you forked out for the DVD it comes to an anticlimactic, sudden and disappointing end."

That raises another point for me that is important in any movie. I just didn't care about any of the characters. They were all devoid of any likable qualities.

","I confess, I'm disappointed. I think I'm not alone in saying my anticipation of the movie was great - the Coens are normally reliably interesting, I loved their previous Oscar-winning affair, and there are few actors more watchable than Clooney, particularly alongside the ensemble gathered here. And each performance is engaging - Pitt wonderfully reinvents himself here and Malkovich is superbly unbalanced. The odd set piece and running gag is a hoot.<br/><br/>But this is a really disjointed and lazy affair. It has the feel of a movie that had no forethought whatever, like the Coens got up in the morning, had a shower and a cup of coffee, called up a few of their mates to join them on set, and asked the actors to brainstorm what they were going to do that day. Just for laughs. And maybe that really is what they did. Like a cleverly conceived twisty plot? So do I! Sadly, there ain't one here - it's disguised as something interesting and quirky that is really just plain unfathomable, arbitrary, pointless.<br/><br/>And where's the writing? The script relies heavily on F***s and S***ts - on their own, perfectly fine descriptive words, particularly in an emergency or in a moment of heightened passion. Both words have enhanced numerous movies I can think of. Some movies would be much the worse without them. But overused in what should be a highly intelligent movie script time and again because more imaginative writing appears to have gone out of the window... well, it's just lazy and dull really.<br/><br/>If, like me, you have a few questions as the credits roll - mainly, was it entirely necessary to give Brad Pitt such a wastefully indulgent early exit halfway through the movie? - don't worry, by the time you get to the bar to order your pint, you'll have moved on. It's that kind of movie in the end. Kind of engaging for an outing at the cinema, but way too slight to be memorable for long."

What I got was a poorly acted hour and a half of hope-crushing, nerve-wracking discomfort. From the very beginning the movie is irritating, in no small part due to John Malkovich playing another creepy weirdo with nothing redeeming to say or do. Essentially, everyone is sleeping with everyone without any of the hi-jinx that would have broken the atmosphere of quiet unpleasantness that leads up to the unforgivable conclusion. This movie seems to have the theme ""All nice people get killed and all the bad people get to live"". There were only two good characters in the movie, and both of them die in gruesome fashion that would make an avid Robot Chicken watcher flinch. Brad Pitt was almost adorable as a vaguely gay gym employee whose ""good Samaritan"" plan is perverted by his insecure friend who spends the whole movie complaining about her appearance. Her machinations end up dooming him, as well as the only other decent character; Richard Jenkins' ""Ted"". Ted is her boss who is in love with her and discouraging her from getting her plastic surgery. They both die for her mistakes and she gets to have her surgery. The characters were intended to come off as quirky and bumbling, but they just read as boring. Also, for the first few minutes I thought John Malkovich was doubling roles as both Ozzy and Linda. Some of the gags and scenarios were mildly funny, but the movie as a whole dragged on and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. If you're an apathetic, antisocial, self-described intellectual teenager, this movie may appeal to you. If you are a decent person it will likely fall flat. Shock value at being made intimately aware of the contents (physical) of Brad Pitt's head does not make a good movie. Also, my summary of Clooney's role was that I almost forgot to mention it here. He was there the whole time, but he was mostly a foil. Maybe my expectations were too high, but from now on I will trust no reviews but my own."

The Tilda Swinton character was very unpleasant. . . kind of hard to believe the George Clooney character would have spent any time with her at all.

Despite the talented cast the characters seem cheap and disposable. The way to make a good movie is to make the audience care about the characters, to either love or hate the characters, and this movie does neither.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes that could be considered somewhat funny, and I almost laughed once, but the monotony and excruciatingly pointless detail of the rest of the film, combined with the heavy-handed and almost berating style of humor employed elsewhere makes it hard to enjoy the good parts.<br/><br/>The profanity was overused and didn't really contribute to the film, simply having a character say ""fuck"" repeatedly is not funny. Violence was overused as well, while I usually enjoy dark comedies I didn't find that the death/destruction/mayhem added to the story in any real way and didn't lead to any interesting or funny situations.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film, even to someone who likes to watch bad movies.

","i know a lot of people say that this movie was great and all that. Maybe it is just me but after i watched the film i felt unclean and distressed. The whole movie was a mess of unbelievable sub plots mixed within a ninety minute film. There are only two parts i found funny and actually laughed out loud. The problem i was dealing with was the direction of the whole puzzling movie. Brad Pitt s character who was the most outstanding character and the star of the film gets shot in the head and dies after one hour... after that, i lost every interest of the film. Too much going on and the ending was very inconclusive. There are one or two good points about the film is the acting. Acting was well done. The character use, well, maybe too much character use making the whole film confusing. And it was a funny in some occasions. I know the Coen brothers can do much better than this.

"robert-temple-1","10","6","11","27 February 2009"," ""The Idiocy of This World""
","With their droll, cynical humour, the Coen Brothers have made this triumphant satire on what in the script they call 'the idiocy of this world', which they clearly view as a Ship of Fools. John Malkovich in the latter part of the film screams at someone: 'You are one of the league of morons against whom I have been struggling all my life!' Every character in the film is a member of this League of Morons, and the film itself is an attack on the League of Morons who clearly run the world, especially its governmental so-called 'intelligence' services, which according to the Coen Brothers' view of things should be renamed the Idiocy Services. The only characters in the film who are not total morons from the beginning are John Malkovich and his wife Tilda Swinton. But Malkovich is progressively reduced through unbearable frustration to a state of total idiocy himself, and as Joel Cohen drily remarks in a bonus feature to the DVD: 'Malkovich has embraced his inner knucklehead'. ('Knucklehead', for those unfamiliar with American slang, means 'idiot' or 'fool'.) That leaves the cold and calculating Tilda Swinton as the only person in the film who is theoretically a non-moron, but she has herself been reduced to a parody of an intelligent person who, in order to cope with the welter of idiocy surrounding her, has entirely lost her humanity and become an engine of devouring and despairing egotism. Which leaves no one and nothing to admire, a view of the world apparently held by the Coen Brothers and graphically portrayed in their revolting and disgusting recent film 'No Country for Old Men' (for which see my unfavourable review). This new film, because it is a black comedy, is wholly admirable despite its unremitting cynicism, and it provides many hysterically funny situations and lines of dialogue. As usual with Coen Brothers films, it is brilliantly made, since they are a pair of dark geniuses who flicker eerily like a couple of coal fires glowing side by side in the half-light, chuckling impishly, perhaps devilishly, to themselves. All the actors are spectacularly brilliant. Brad Pitt as a stupid 'jock' with a head of solid bone is simply amazing. Frances McDormand really outdoes herself this time, portraying the insane logic of a total fool hurtling towards Ã‚â€¦ in this case not doom but, ironically, what she wants. It is the others in her path who come to sticky ends. John Malkovich not only embraces his inner knucklehead but does a lot of brilliant acting as well, and leaves us feeling as frustrated as his character is, and ready to stalk along in our underpants too, holding a hatchet with intent to kill. Tilda Swinton is the Ice Queen of All Time, and we really don't want to meet her. George Clooney is a befuddled moron with a coarse beard which surely would have scraped Tilda's face off (?). They are all having a great time, and you can sense the teamwork at every turn and in every scene. Everybody is betraying everybody else, with glee and no conscience or even awareness of what conscience might be. As for the story, well, where does one begin? It almost defies explanation, because it is such a parade of idiocy from beginning to end, but we are rapt with attention and glued to the screen because it is all so amazing, and can people get any stupider than that? The answer is unhesitatingly 'Yes', they can get stupider than that, and even stupider, and the downwards spiral of total idiocy is so devastating that one wants to look away but cannot. What a compelling vision, this time of a side of hell which is hysterically funny, although it portends the doom of us all which a world run by fools will inevitably bring. Can't the Coen brothers do a remake of 'Polyanna' or 'Sound of Music' or something, to dispel their unremitting gloom?"

But, sadly, Burn After Reading feels rushed and loose, as if they simply decided that star power could hold together a weakly comic plot.<br/><br/>This movie portrays a strange view of people, one that feels immediately elitist and pretentious. It seems to say that when people lack a sense of importance they spend their time looking for sex or drugs or some way to make themselves feel better about being insignificant. Such as Frances MacDormand's pursuit of cosmetic surgery.<br/><br/>The Coens, riding on the success of No Country for Old Men, seem to have written this script in a matter of hours, called all of their friends who want to win awards, and filmed this mess.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a parody of No Country for Old Men that didn't have a good understanding of what that movie was about.<br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority here, but this movie is a throw-away that will inevitably end up earning some sort of ""classic"" status along side of that Wes Anderson garbage polluting people's indie-rock obsessed minds.<br/><br/>I hate that this thing was made.

Every character acted as if they had an IQ in low double figures, which may work for a gym instructor, but not with people who are supposed to be high up in law enforcement. That only works in a ""Naked Gun"" style farce. Every situation was like a joke with only half the punch line - meaningless.What happened when the film finished.

Tilda Swinton was great as the ice princess, but, alas, she wasn't given much to work with either. This ends the good parts. The rest of it was awful. Sure, there were some funny parts, but, overall, the movie was a bust. The pacing was very strange - it seemed like there was about 20 min of movie left on the cutting room floor that could have helped it and a bunch of stuff that was easily ditched that would have helped immensely. There was definitely a funny, dark movie idea somewhere, but it was lost. And, the end was just inexplicably awful, hence my summary ""deux ex machina"" - it's like the movie was a low-budget indie film that ran out of budget/film and they realized they needed to wrap it up, so, they did.

","As I write this IMDb has an average user rating for this film as 7.8, Rotten tomatoes has awarded it 79% and as I glance at it's ad on the back cover of this weeks Time Out, one is presented with a red and yellow back drop for a galaxy of stars. Twenty five to be exact. Four each from five very reputable publications (The Times, The Guardian, Empire, Time Out and The Independent) and of course the snapshots of five of Hollywood's finest. On further exploration between the constellations you find the familiar names of Joel and Ethan Coen. With such a solar system of names and praise, it would certainly seem that the brothers Coen have indeed created, as the poster proclaims, 'America's No.1 Comedy'. <br/><br/>I had the pleasure of winning a couple of tickets to watch this Comedy the night before it's official release.Having only seen, but not really paid too much attention to the television advertisements for this film, I was also in the fortunate position, not to have formed opinion or developed any impression from the wonders of the galaxy outlined above. Having witnessed the ninety six minutes of this feature the only opinion or impression I was left with is that this film is truly rubbish. Knowing my constitution, these are harsh words, but I can not be more sure, it is an accurate description. Only after leaving the auditorium and gazing upon the poster outside did I first learn of the praise this film has received. I had to confess to my date that evening, I would have to agree with the likes of The Times, Guardian, Empire, Time Out, and Independent, I would also award this film four stars, but only if it were out of twenty. <br/><br/>Something was amiss. Had I lost all taste for what can be construed as a good film or was it that Ethan and Joel have become so huge that anything they can put their name to is going to be dusted with diamonds. Reflecting back on the ninety six minutes, I can only conclude that it is the latter. This is one of those films where the directors/writers have run different story lines along side each other, each slightly interlinked and with them coming together to tie it up nicely. Taking this recipe for a clever film has not produced the suggested results. I was almost tempted to walk out as the story takes so long to get going, and don't presume you'll be rewarded for your patience. This film offers the viewer very little. Each of the story lines and characters are not well developed enough to keep you engaged or entertained. As to the comedy, the only way this film is funny, it that there is amusement to be found in watching the very famous (Cloony, McDormand, Malcovich, Swinton and Pitt) playing roles as idiots. However, at best the comedy only provides a rare, seeking chuckle and not the common side-splitting chortle you are promised from 'America's No.1 Comedy'. <br/><br/>If your idea of a good film is watching famous names, looking a bit silly, only to get a few instances of solid silliness, then this one is certainly for you. However, if you need a modicum more than this, whether it be from storyline, comedy, character development etc etc, do not be dazzled by the array of 'praise' which comes with this film. Any money or time spent on it would only be wasted. 2/10"

","I agree that this film was a mockery of not only the actors in it, but also the audience members. I think the Coen Brothers tried to make a movie quickly on the heels of No Country for Old Men and figured since No Country did so well, everyone would come and see Burn After Reading. Well, they were right, as I heard the movie topped the box office this past weekend, which is unfortunate. The performances in the movie are overall well done. At times it felt as though some of the actors broke character, but this could be a result of poor writing. It had occasional moments where the audience would burst into a quick laugh, but not enough of them. I found the plot to be confusing with many dead ends. The last quarter of the film feels very rushed. The few gory bits seemed to be simply for the sake of gore, out of place, and just for shock value. Now, the thing that bothered me (and most of the audience) the most...the boom mic kept dropping into the scenes!!! From the very beginning of the movie right until the end, it happened over and over again! I would say the boom mic was visible in at least 70% of the movie. In a hotel room, it can even be seen in the mirror beside the bed. It was so blatant and obvious that we began wondering if it was done on purpose. Everyone in the theatre picked up on it and kept pointing it out. I even heard a man behind us say ""Oh my god, that is bugging me so much!"". It really takes away from the movie itself and is the worst example of this happening I've ever seen. I found the ending disappointing. I won't spoil it, but it left too many loose ends untied. I am a HUGE fan of the Coen Brothers. I would never trash them without reason. O Brother Where Art Thou, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country For Old Men are some of my favourite movies of all time; but Burn After Reading does not measure up at all. I hate to say it, and i'm sure you'll all roll your eyes, but it should've been called ""Burn After Watching""."

Smug, Smart Ass and Condescending the movie seems to be a joke on the audience (how dare you take us seriously!) If this is satire, its pretty heavy handed. As a comedy it comes up short as well. There are some sporadic laughs but they aren't really worth the investment. The plot in a nutshell: 2 brain challenged Health Club workers (McDormand and Pitt) come across a computer disk left by an nut case ex-CIA agent (Malkovich) When the ex-agent (who's just been fired) doesn't want to give them a reward, (it's his memoirs) they decide to see if the Russian embassy might want to buy it. Malkovich is married to Tilda Swinton who is having an affair with George Clooney who is also boinking McDormand on the side. It all sounds complicated, but it isn't very involving or funny. The movie takes a long time to get going, then it doesn't really go anywhere. One scene where someone is dispatched is so clumsily shot and edited you aren't sure what happened. Another likable character in the film is killed off and we are supposed to laugh at the gruesome details. The actors are mostly wasted though Pitt, McDormand and Malkovich do wring some laughs out of it. THe 2 actors who play he CIA agents come off best. All in all, a major disappointment.

","Winning Oscars hasn't kept Joel and Ethan Coen from their tradition of switching back and forth between comedies and dramas. The brothers have followed up the brilliant Western noir NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN with the funnier, less bloody but no less wickedly anarchic BURN AFTER READING (BAR), reuniting actors who've worked together in and out of previous Coen Brothers movies. Set in Washington, DC and environs (portrayed by New York and New Jersey), BAR is a screwball paranoia comedy about people who work in intelligence, pitted against people who lack intelligence. :-) When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich, proving he fits right in with the Coens' loopy repertory company) loses his CIA job, he decides to write his memoirs. A disk is found at the Hardbodies Gym with what ditsy trainer Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) suspects is ""sensitive s**t"" belonging to Cox, building a chain of nutzoid misunderstandings, violence, and other paranoia-fueled shenanigans. Those drawn into the insanity include Chad's co-worker Linda Litzke (the ever-wonderful Frances McDormand, her blue-green eyes communicating as much as her dithery yet determined voice. She has the same hairdo as Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but it looks better on McDormand :-)), hoping to finance her extreme plastic surgery makeover by getting money from Cox; reward or blackmail, it's all the same to Linda and Chad. (Without giving away too much, love-starved Linda ends up an unwitting femme fatale, in every sense of the term.) Then there's womanizing Treasury agent Harry Pfarrar (George Clooney, doing a frantic comic version of his Oscar-winning SYRIANA role), a man who needs to run after sex (literally and figuratively) to stay in a good mood and is never without an oddball choice of words: ""I have lactose reflux...Does that contain shell food?""; Tilda Swinton as Katie, Cox's tightly-wound pediatrician wife; Richard Jenkins as Ted Treffon, Hardbodies' manager, who's secretly in love with the clueless, self-absorbed Linda; and J.K. Simmons and David Rasche as CIA men who have to sort out the increasingly crazy mess. The whole cast is terrific, but if anybody steals the show, it's Brad Pitt with his two-tone hair and smilingly bumbling attempts at extortion. Like our household faves Max Von Sydow and Anjelica Huston, Pitt knows when to have fun with a role, and his delight in playing Chad is infectious. Even BAR's little details are a hoot, like Cox hiding out on his houseboat and keeping in shape by exercising to FitTV's GILAD'S BODIES IN MOTION (I've used the show to further my own fitness efforts :-)); Harry singing ""My Eyes Adored You"" and ""Born Free"" in the shower (alas, we only see this from the viewpoint of Chad, who's hiding in the closet :-)); and Linda using the (fictional) romantic comedy COMING UP DAISY, starring Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes, as a litmus test for the dates she meets online. (There's even footage of Mulroney urging the unseen Daisy to get down from a tree. Maybe Mulroney did it as a favor to his buddy Pitt.) Between his affairs and 5-mile runs, Harry finds time to be a hobbyist; without spoiling anything, I can only say the contraption he builds gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object! :-)"

","Burn after watching.<br/><br/>If I had the opportunity to rate this movie with negative stars, I would give it a -6. It is easily one of the five worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of seeing and it may be among the top three worst movies. Unfortunately I paid good money to see it. It's 97 minutes of my life I will never get back. It was nearly as disturbing as 'Nowhere' and almost as boring as 'American Movie'. The last two minutes were humorous, but the five minutes prior to that were so unnecessarily violent and disturbing that the ending did nothing to redeem the film. The first 40 minutes were so boring I nearly left the theater - in retrospect I definitely should have done so. If I had any real hope of success, I would write to the Coen brothers and demand my money back. Avoid this piece of refuse and condemn it to the bit bucket where it belongs!"

There was too much swearing, like every other word, the plot tried to hard to be a spy movie, there were too many murders, and the ending left me going, ""what, that was it?"" The spy plot hook was weak at best,extremely contrived, and they killed the comic relief within the first 30 minutes, leaving nothing funny for the rest of the movie. There were only 6 people in the theater with us on a Saturday night, and after watching, I knew why! the clips they play in the trailer for this movie are the best parts of it, and make it look like an adventure comedy when it is not. It is a drama, and a depressing one at that. <br/><br/>If you hate yourself, or want to punish someone, then watch this movie, otherwise, don't bother!"

","John Malkovich is a mid-level CIA bureaucrat who is fired for misbehavior. ""A DRINKING problem?,"" he shouts wildly. ""You're a MORMON. Next to you we ALL have drinking problems!"" Propelled by revenge he begins to write a tell-all memoir, saving it to disk. He loses the disk at a gym, Hardbodies, where it's found by the empty-headed employees Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand, who try to sell it to the Russians, who aren't interested in it because it's ""drivel."" McDormand meets womanizing ex-Secret Service agent, George Clooney, who is schtupping Malkovich's wife. The disk full of ""secret"" information is forgotten about and there follow all sorts of permutations on misidentification, paranoia, murder, and confusion.<br/><br/>Of these, the trump is confusion. The CIA is trying to keep track of all this but is constantly being surprised and left bemused by new and inexplicable coincidences. So is the viewer.<br/><br/>The humor doesn't depend on the plot, which is nonsense, but on twists and inversions of the conventions of the spy movie, and maybe movies in general. It's a comedy with some very funny moments, and other moments that clunk like a fumbled bronze mallet. Example of funny moment.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt wants to confront Malkovich and demand money for the lost disk, so he breaks into Malkovich's house. Malkovich himself is out, but his wife's lover, Clooney, comes in and makes himself at home while the terrified Pitt hides in a bedroom closet. Clooney comes upstairs to the bedroom, takes a shower, casually puts on a robe, whistling and singing to himself. Then he opens the closet door.<br/><br/>We expect to find Pitt cowering behind the clothes. Instead, there he is, right up front, greeting Clooney with a silent grin full of glistening white teeth, as if he were selling magazines on the doorstep. We only see his face for an instant -- before Clooney makes a reflexive grab for his gun and blows Pitt's head off.<br/><br/>That's one of the more amusing scenes.<br/><br/>The performances are okay. Nobody flubs it and, in fact, Brad Pitt is outrageous in his enactment of a comic role. The direction itself has its smiles. I do wish more effort had gone into plotting a story that had more opportunities for laughs, that didn't depend so heavily on cute moments and characters with pointless quirks."

Clooney continued being the sexiest man alive and I walked out of the cinema not hating John Malkovich, which is not an easy task after seeing his role in Rounders. The way he loses his mind on the phone time & time again is very good entertainment. Tilda Swinton is as always an annoying, arrogant, s*it-eating dropkick with a nose like Satan's throbbing member.

"J_Trex","7","7","14","17 September 2008"," Worth Checking Out but Not Among Coen Brothers Best
","The plot of this film was difficult at times to fully understand how things developed the way they did. As the trailer for the movie indicated, a CD containing classified information fell into the hands of Chad (Brad Pitt), a good natured if somewhat bone-headed fitness instructor, who comes up with the idea of selling it back to its rightful owner, a recently fired CIA Agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkevich). Linda (Frances McDormand) works with Chad at the fitness club. She has an internet dating service hookup with Harry (George Clooney) who is also having an affair with Katie (Tilda Swinton), who happens to be married to Osborne Cox. There were numerous other backstories & sexual intrigue, yet one thing that seemed to resonate throughout the film was that everyone is unfaithful & screwing someone else. And it all seemed so pathetically joyless. The sex displayed in the movie seemed like a publicity campaign for celibacy or at the very least a knock on internet dating services.<br/><br/>The bad sex notwithstanding, what was less than clear was how the CD found its way to the gym where Chad happened to find it on the floor. We're left to assume it got there by way of Linda, but the film doesn't show when or how she got it. I suppose it doesn't matter all that much, yet I found that small detail just a little frustrating.<br/><br/>All of the performances were excellent. I particularly liked George Clooney's role. He played the philandering Treasury agent Harry, with a goofy demeanor, not unlike his character in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" or as the lawyer in ""Intolerable Cruelty"". There were many hilarious scenes, particularly funny was when Chad & Linda tried to sell the CD to the Russians (they called on the Russian Consulate after Osborne declined to pay their ransom demand). JK Simmons played a high level CIA chief with his usual comically bombastic demeanor displayed so well as JJ Jamison in the Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>As far as Coen brothers films go, I would rate this in the middle of the pack. But as Woody Allen once commented about Sex and Pizza, ""Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good""."

The film is soooo slow and boring and basically a complete waste of time. With all the ecellent actors, you would think it has no chance of failing. But that is the most surprising thing. It fails on every level. I was watching to see if anything actually happened, I actually think it is one of those films that the actors star in as a favour to the director. Can't write any more than that really, make your own judgement as not everybody has to agree on what is good or isn't."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","2","5","9","25 April 2011"," Leaden Unlikeable comedy
","To be honest I only made it to the end of this out of a sense of duty, being an admirer of the Coens, but a more tedious and unfunny comedy comedy would be hard to imagine. The major problem is the sheer unlikeability of the characters, narcissistic, cynical and devious. After 15 minutes I was ready to quit, but the appearance of the reliably quirky Frances Mcdormand, managed to sustain my interest a little longer.<br/><br/>Another major problem is the lack of funny situations. A guy having his head shot off in the closet is not funny. Neither is another one being hacked to death. Nor is having Malkovitch and Clooney engage in such displays of wit as ""f**k you you f**ker!"" What ever happened to the Coens's ability to write evocative and witty dialogue? The only mildly amusing scene was the unveiling of the mechanised dildo machine in Clooney's basement, but that had absolutely no relation to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it is revealing that the only people who end stickily are a couple of ordinary and inoffensive guys who work at the gym, and not any of the selfish wealthy narcissists. I'm guessing this is a little window into how Hollywood views the common man nowadays.<br/><br/>The dreadful ending seems to have been conceived in the wake of No Country For Old Men. In that the ending worked, but comedy is a different business and the Coens have conceived enough good ones to know that.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the first film of the Coens where I sense they might be succumbing to their own hype."

","Burn has a lot going for it. As with most Coen Brothers' movies, this spy spoof has a brilliantly quirky story that is full of interestingly flawed characters.

Nothing ever really takes off like you would expect or want.<br/><br/>This movie is not near as bad, nor near as good as some reviewers contend. Maybe it's because people have certain expectations of any Coen Brothers movie. As for me, some of their movies I love, and others I hate. Then there are a few, like Burn, that are just okay. Burn delivers light entertainment, with an occasional flash of great dialog and dark humor. If that's okay with you, you won't be disappointed."

","Joel and Ethan Coen's thirteenth film is a return to their quirky lullabies after 2007's Best Picture winning grand work 'No Country for Old Men'. 'Burn After Reading' stars Frances McDormand as Linda and Brad Pitt as Chad, both fairly dumb gym-trainees who're in possession of a disk containing some valuable and hopefully juicy memoirs from a recently fired CIA-agent Osbourne Cox, played by John Malkovich. They want to blackmail him so they can get money for her plastic surgery operations. Meanwhile Malkovich's wife Katie, (played by Tilda Swinton) is secretly dating internet-cruiser Harry (George Clooney) who's also cheating on his spouse, and is cheating on Katie again with exactly Linda.<br/><br/>It's adultery, it's espionage-light, it's body before brains, and it's a cynical view of America. How seriously cynical it is is another question, but for me not a very important one. The story is mainly pieced together by good performances in classic Coen-roles, especially Malkovich who's mainly pi**ed-off and actually the most professional in the whole film; Brad Pitt doesn't add much substance but he adds belly laughs with iPod, bicycle and a bleeding nose; McDormand has great body language as she does everything in her power to fix her nose, belly, breasts and bum; Swinton is cool, cold and clutching between her two parallel lives, and Clooney makes mostly weird grimaces as a ladies' man, and adds paranoia to the whole ""soon-they'll-know-where-you-are-at-any-give-time"" CIA stupidity. 'Burn After Reading' is Coen-lite, but Coen lite is way better than most American stuff out there. J.K. Simmons as CIA-superior gives some fine dialog throughout his brief appearance as; ""Report back to me when it makes sense"", and ""I'm fu**ed if I know what we did"" - pretty insightful actually."

The directors/writers as always perfection.<br/><br/>Having said all of this, I just think the movie shifted gears from the moment dumb-dumb got shot. Again this is not a bad thing. It just became something more than a goofy comedy and so we tried to find what that ""something more"" was.<br/><br/>We never found it. We so wanted Tilda to get her comeuppance. Foul b*tch that she was. David and J.K. were wonderful also.<br/><br/>In the end we concluded that the movie purports that Americans are so self-absorbed, vain and self-centered that all we think about is what we think we are entitled to. And that amounts to four plastic surgeries --- which she gets, at the cost of death, government cover-ups and several lives destroyed.<br/><br/>Now think of this.

The trailer portrayed a movie filled with whit, spy blunders, and John Malcovich acting like everyone's an idiot. Sounds hilarious, right? Then I actually watched the movie. The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the very dry feel of the movie designed by the Cohen brothers to create a sense of monotony in the characters; the only thing was, once the dynamic of events occurred, the film was still incredibly monotonous. After the ""excitement"" of the film begins to build, everything goes down hill and by the end of the movie when J.P. Simmons is trying to make sense of events, nothing makes sense.

","As a long-time avid fan of the Coen brothers, I felt let down by this latest effort. While the story line was easy enough to understand, it felt contrived and forced. I especially found it hard to believe that these well-educated, erudite characters would use such language to this extent; it eroded my suspension of disbelief...I spent two years on an aircraft carrier during Vietnam so I am no stranger to the repeated use of the f-word among the lesser-educated ranks but, one never heard an officer talk like John Malkovich's character...I think maybe the Coens were suffering from a mild attack of creativity failure; this movie was not up to some of their recent efforts (""O Brother, Where Art Thou ?"" comes to mind, a movie on my top 20 fav list along with ""Fargo""). Perhaps writing ""No Country for Old Men"" at the same time was just too demanding. I look forward to their next effort and hope they regain their rhythm..."

","This is the crappy movie the Coens have always hinted they have in them, and now this dreary, leaden, pointless dud is in the evidence archive for keeps. It's the best argument for why the Coens should never, ever stray from their formula again. 'Burn After Reading' is the kind of Mannerist, misguided movie you make just to keep working, rather than because you have a decent idea. Structurally it's incompetent. Characters and motivations are introduced (in maybe ten minutes) and then we're in a holding pattern for the rest of the movie. Nothing develops. All of the characters proceed to behave like thinly written morons from the ""American Pie"" movies. Scene after scene just sits there, piling up, one after another, defying the urge to entertain, building to nothing. There isn't a confident move made in the whole thing.<br/><br/>The cast all has a ""Hooray, I won the lottery... I'm in the next Coen Bros movie!!"" look on their faces. But the firepower just ends up being too heavy for this piddling idea (And when I call it an ""idea,"" I'm being very gracious). You've never seen so many big names with so little to do. Despite all the super-positive energy on display, no one can convert this turd into something else. And no one is as lost as Brad Pitt, who tries to shoehorn a leading man effort into his small, dumb supporting part.<br/><br/>This is a comedy? Can the Coens tell a joke without over-explaining it like a pair of nerds?

Set in Washington, DC and environs (portrayed brilliantly by New York and New Jersey :-)), BAR is a screwball paranoia comedy about people who work in intelligence, pitted against people who lack intelligence. :-) When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich, proving he fits right in with the Coens' loopy repertory company) loses his CIA job, he decides to write his memoirs. A disk found at the Hardbodies Gym with what ditsy trainer Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) suspects is ""sensitive s**t"" belonging to Cox builds a chain of nutzoid misunderstandings, violence, and other paranoia-fueled shenanigans. Those drawn into the insanity include Chad's co-worker Linda Litzke (the ever-wonderful Frances McDormand, her blue-green eyes communicating as much as her dithery yet determined voice. She's also wearing Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh hairdo, but it looks better on McDormand :-)), hoping to finance her extreme plastic surgery makeover by getting money from Cox; reward or blackmail, it's all the same to Linda and Chad. (Without giving away too much, love-starved Linda ends up an unwitting femme fatale, in every sense of the term.) Then there's womanizing Treasury agent Harry Pfarrar (George Clooney, doing a frantic comic version of his Oscar-winning SYRIANA role right down to the beard), a man who needs to run after sex (literally and figuratively) to stay in a good mood and is never without an oddball choice of words: ""I have lactose refluxÂ…Does that contain shell food?""; Tilda Swinton as Katie, Cox's tightly-wound pediatrician wife; Richard Jenkins as Ted Treffon, Hardbodies' manager, who's secretly in love with the clueless, self-absorbed Linda; and J.K. Simmons and David Rasche as CIA men who have to sort out the increasingly crazy mess. The whole cast is terrific, but if anybody steals the show, it's Brad Pitt with his two-tone hair and smilingly bumbling attempts at extortion. Like our household faves Max von Sydow and Anjelica Huston, Pitt knows when to have fun with a role, and his delight in playing Chad is infectious. Even BAR's little details are a hoot, like Cox hiding out on his houseboat and keeping in shape by exercising to FitTV's GILAD'S BODIES IN MOTION (I've used the show to further my own fitness efforts :-)); Harry singing ""My Eyes Adored You"" and ""Born Free"" in the shower (alas, we only see this from the viewpoint of Chad, who's hiding in the closet :-)); and Linda using the (fictional) romantic comedy COMING UP DAISY, starring Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes, as a litmus test for the dates she meets online. (There's even footage of Mulroney urging the unseen Daisy to get down from a tree. Maybe Mulroney did it as a favor to his buddy Pitt.) Between his affairs and 5-mile runs, Harry finds time to be a hobbyist; without spoiling anything, I can only say the contraption he builds gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object. I'll admit BAR may not be for all tastes, but to quote James Thurber, if you like this sort of thing (and obviously I do), it's the sort of thing you'll like!"

","Saw the film last night. Wondered why no one's commented on the unfunny reliance on the f-bomb rather than on more skillful dialogue revealing the characters' self-centredness. Wondered why no one's mentioned the deep unpleasantness of two characters meeting violent on-screen deaths which are meant, apparently, to make the audience laugh uproariously. Really couldn't figure out why the only character with a heartfelt sense of loving attraction to another human being meets a gratuitously nasty end. Decided, finally, that in this case the Coen Brothers have gone tone-deaf. They seem to think that graphic violence is just a kind of entertaining energy. They've lost touch with what's truly amusing about egocentric naivetÃ©. And they've forgotten that an audience tricked into laughing at violence, anger. and stupidity ultimately feels manipulated rather than entertained. I heard last night's audience grow increasingly confused, and uncomfortable, when trying to decide how they were expected to respond to the bleakness of the moral landscape of the film. Intolerable Cruelty shows that the Coen Brothers know how to write and direct screwball comedy; Burn After Reading is evidence that they've missed the mark this time. It's as though they've stopped being interested in the humanity of other human beings."

"framptonhollis","9","4","7","1 January 2017"," f*cking BRILLIANT!
","Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the finest filmmakers around, and it seems like every time they make a movie it ends up being a masterpiece, and ""Burn After Reading"" is no exception. Despite not normally being considered one of their greatest films and simply being severely underrated in general, I believe that this is better and funnier than more popular Coen's films such as, say, ""The Big Lebowski"" (a film that I also LOVE). It's actually saddening how little this film is praised, because it deserves much more acclaim and attention, for it is one of the most original, inventive, hilarious, creative, and shocking movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Practically every aspect of this bizarre black comedy is pitch perfect. The cinematography and overall placing/movement of the camera both work together to make the film quite visually stimulating, while the characters and relentlessly inventive plot work together to make the film a great entertainer for the mind and emotion. And don't even get me started on the performances! How perfect can a movie get? These are some of the finest performances I have ever seen in a comedy, every single performer does an amazing job and perfectly encapsulate their character's personality. I ESPECIALLY have to give credit to Brad Pitt, who plays a lovably idiotic gym instructor that accidentally kickstarts a farcical string of crime, chaos, and even murder. His performance had me losing it while laughing, this is, without a doubt, the best Brad Pitt performance, and I'm willing to say that it is not only one of the best comedic performances, but maybe even one of the best performances PERIOD.<br/><br/>But, the rest of the cast does excellently as well! John Malkovich is simultaneously threatening and sympathetic, while Frances McDormand portrays a desperate sex addict in a way that is both funny and pathetic, while George Clooney plays a charismatic but slightly mentally ill man dealing with a difficult romantic situation. And there is also brilliant performances from Tilda Swinton, Richard Jenkins, and J.K Simmons (who only appears extremely briefly, but still manages to impress highly).<br/><br/>This is among the most enthusiastic reviews for a film that I have ever written, and that is because of how amazing this film is! This should be required viewing for all human beings that breathe (and animals should watch it too)."

","One thing you can bank on with the Coens is that the undeserving still can be bumped off. These are not morality plays. Sometimes the good guys end up slumped in some corner with bullets in their respective heads. Sometimes a person who is inconsequential and likable also ends up in the same place. The thing with these guys is that there is always a strain of unique humor running through the movie. In this case everyone is either moronic, amoral, or stupid. A lot of mistakes are made through misinformation and too quick action. This is the way it is. John Malcovich gets the ball rolling by losing his job (or quitting it). Because he has been a high roller at the State Department, his innocent and inferior memoirs are picked up by a health club trainer (Pitt) who can't think five steps ahead. And then there is the Francis McDormand character who is trying to reinvent herself but needs a bundle of money to get liposuction. The funniest, to me, are the people at the top at the State Department who are watching this maniacal feast and simply let things happen because they don't have a clue what to do. There are three incredibly funny scenes where the lead man has the events explained to him. At one point he tells them not to notify the FBI and instead burn the body. This is a precious little movie. Once again, I left satisfied with a Coen product."

","I think I relied too much on IMDb... A nearby Hollywood Video was out of business and everything was on sale. I heard this movie was a brainless funny movie (which is not always my favorite) but was still interested, so I checked the rating in this web: 7.2; seems pretty high for a brainless comedy, so I bought it.<br/><br/>After I watched the movie, it turns out: Wow, it's not brainless at all! but I don't see how it's funny either! The movie really isn't good or funny, instead of comedy it should be a drama, an just-okay drama, the twist ending wasn't so twisty either. Throughout the whole movie, I only smiled, but never bothered to laugh, in fact, the movie was rather sad. I love watching movies, all kinds of movies, and I'm usually easily amused...my point is, I really felt like watching this movie was a waste of time, and I can't even remember when was the last time I felt this way.<br/><br/>I gave 5 because I tried to be reasonable (meaning: at least I finished the movie and it wasn't so bad that I wanted to destroy the DVD, and the movie does have some meanings to it), not just some haters who like to complain about their ""valuable hour and a half"" and give 1 out of 10."
"nefastus","4","4","7","31 January 2009"," This is a Cohen movie you can safely skip....
","Amid all the critical acclaim and unabashed praise that many gave this movie I had hopes. I love ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" to me are master works. ""Fargo"" retains its charm even when covered with blood or thrust into a wood chipper...but sadly ""Burn"" fails.<br/><br/>Why? The cast is superb, but they seem to be enjoying playing mockeries of their own screen persona than actually playing a character. There are exceptions to this such as J.K. Simmons, Swanson and Malkovich, but Pitt and Clooney seem more content on doing a parody of themselves than actually turning in a character performance. It sadly reeked of gimmick to me.<br/><br/>I wanted to emphasize with someone, but none of them had any redeeming values which is opposite most of the Cohen brothers' previous works. There is only one character that has any redeeming virtue about him and that was Richard Jenkins as the love lorn gym manager. Of course his demise is brutal, I suppose this is part of the Cohen joke. Now don't get me wrong, I am used to watching characters that you can emphasize with get killed in Cohen movies and still walk away saying it was a good story.<br/><br/>This was not. It was a very narcissistic movie. Which I suppose is the point that the Cohens were trying to make, narcissism pays off after all the self obsessed person is the one that wins in the end of this mess.<br/><br/>The humor is not well played and somehow the comedic timing was off in several scenes. Part was due to the fact that some of the actors seemed not even to take the movie itself seriously enough to make it funny, but like the Ocean 11 movies, seemed to be more interested in celebrity bonding. I just couldn't buy into it. A story about 2 dimensional characters that are vain and self seeking doesn't make a story. It doesn't even make a farce when the characters cannot draw you in. <br/><br/>It was bleh. <br/><br/>Sorry, can't recommend it, but I have hopes for future Cohen movies."

"DonFishies","6","7","15","29 October 2008"," Disappointingly pedantic and boring
","Well over a month after seeing it, I am still disappointed by Burn After Reading. The massive amount of talent involved, the fresh from winning Oscars Coen Brothers, and the premise of a classic screwball comedy, should have meant instant gold. But instead, it rather came and went with nearly a whimper.<br/><br/>The film jumps around quite excessively, but basically gets kickstarted after Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his senior analyst job within the CIA. He gets drunk, annoys his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and ends up writing his memoirs. One way or another, a CD with a lot of this material is found in a local gym. Thinking it could be used as leverage towards an expensive plastic surgery bid, trainer Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) (with the help of co-worker Chad (Brad Pitt)) attempt to blackmail him into paying money to get it back. When that does not work, they go to the Russians.<br/><br/>Throw a subplot involving the gym's manager Ted (Richard Jenkins) pining for Litzske, Cox's wife's affair with another CIA agent Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a whole lot of paranoia and intrigue, and J.K. Simmons, and you basically have what the Coens figured would be an appropriate follow-up to the mesmerizing No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>The problems only begin to start with the story. The film runs for 95 minutes, but it feels about a half hour longer. About five minutes into the film, I was totally bored. Sure, it had plenty of laughs here and there (and many of the Coens' signature hilariously pitch black moments), but the whole thing just lacks the zest to make it run properly from beginning to end. Hell, even comparing it to The Big Lebowski, a comedy classic ten years after its initial release, is a bit of an insult. While that movie packs laughs with a ridiculously silly story that works, this movie tries to want to give a touch of laughs and a ridiculously silly story that may have worked as an concept on paper, but not on film.<br/><br/>Moments that should be funny are plagued by boredom, and when the emphasis on paranoia begins to sink in, the film only hurts itself more. I am a big fan of the Coens, but watching this almost made me think they may have truly lost their touch. With the exception of No Country, the brothers have yet to make anything remotely better than decent since O Brother, Where Art Thou? almost ten years ago. They clearly still have some creativity left in them, but they are barely polishing any of their movies before churning them out. This film feels like it could have been able to measure up to the greatness of their classics like Lebowski and Fargo, but the magic seems to be missing. It is almost as if they are trying to recreate something they used to have, but no longer can even muster to make work. Yes, the movie is funnier than a lot of the usual film offerings, but at the expense of putting the audience through agonizing torture waiting for the next funny moment. I would like to think that No Country was not merely a fluke, but with something as rushed and pedantic as this, I cannot fathom thinking of it as anything else.<br/><br/>The acting is almost just as disappointing.<br/><br/>I have heard the raves, but as far as I was concerned, McDormand and Swinton were fairly bland in their roles. McDormand gets a lot more to do than Swinton, but both look and sound like they are merely taking up space, and getting ready between takes to grab their money. I usually like McDormand, but her character just seemed so plain and lazy that I could never take her seriously for an instant. This may have been the intent, but when we have to watch the pathos and desperation build for her, I think we can assume she needed to put a little more effort in. Swinton serves as a mere catalyst to the reasoning for the whole film in general, but she is so underused and underwritten it hurts (especially after coming off an Oscar win for Michael Clayton). Even worse, she puts less effort into her performance than McDormand does.<br/><br/>Clooney, while clearly putting more effort into his character, is just too silly for this film. His zany, oversexed nature is a little jarring when it first springs up, but it gets to be a little bit of a handful by the end of the film. He is clearly just trying to ham it up as someone who may or may not be a close representation of the real-life Clooney, but the results of this bizarre attempt are hit and miss. Malkovich on the other hand, gives a valiant effort with his character. Although his character is nowhere near as important in the second half as he is in the first, he shines rather brightly within the cast as someone who takes the role seriously, but clearly has the ability to play funny too. I think if the focus reverted and stayed on Malkovich the whole time, he could have made up for more than enough faults the film has.<br/><br/>As it stands however, Pitt is the one who steals the movie. Playing totally out of character, his silly performance is the only real reason anyone should sit through the movie (and the criminally underused Simmons). His weird portrayal fits in very well, and is nowhere near as jarring as Clooney's. Pitt is clearly having fun, and is giving it his all to convince everyone that he is playing the anti-Brad Pitt. It is just too bad that he is negated to being a mere supporting character to the rest of the cast. If they all worked with one screw loose and put in some effort like he does, the movie could have actually been worthwhile.<br/><br/>6/10."

Within 20 minutes I was thinking to myself, well it's not really all that long.<br/><br/>By the time it was over, the dragging of a film that was only an hour and a half seemed like an eternity.<br/><br/>Even worse, is that this movie had been marketed as being along the lines of say ""thank you for smoking"". A quirky intelligent film, but instead it wasn't intelligent. Quirky, maybe, but not really in a good way.<br/><br/>If anything the cast is what drove this movie for a box office hit.

But it was the predictability of the plot and the negative world view the Cohens continually express towards the world that really got to me in this film. The explicit graphic violence is unmotivated and done for laughs. I guess in a depraved world that pours into movies like Saw 5, and get their kicks off of watching their fellow human kind die, this works. That really sickens me. But not only that, throughout watching this film I felt obligated to try and like it, and you know what, that's doesn't speak much for your film. The plot circles around and around until finally the realization sinks in that it is going nowhere, there are no character arcs, and the comedy that the Cohens go for has already been done... by themselves. They even try the same joke at one point, taken straight from O' Brother, Where art thou? I'm sure many people will disagree with me and that is fine.

George Clooney playing a devious womanizer, Brad Pitt playing an energetic and cooky gym trainer, and John Malkovich playing a bored and life hating ex-CIA agent!!! What could be better?! Well, for starters, any movie other than this one.<br/><br/>What a disappointing and unforgettable shock this movie was to see some of Hollywood's greatest actors play in such a crapping pot of a movie. Instead of everything coming together, this movie seems to fall apart from the beginning. Picture a building in the shape of its own rubble, then that being reduced to more rubble, and you have the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>I can't believe that Clooney, Pitt, or Malkovich are in this movie. Great actors who can do and have done great work end up in a movie that seems to have been written by some disturbed blood obsessed weirdo who had some free time between their ""how not to make a film"" class and ""pointless blood spatters"" class. That's another thing, the violence in this movie is so pointless, it has nothing to do with the movie. It's as if the writers, (who, when I heard it was the Coen Brothers became even more disappointed since I like most of their work) just felt as if some blood would do the movie good, without wondering how or why (Sort of like ""No country for old men"")<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good and somewhat expected from the actors who played here, except for Pitt, but you can't blame him since the script seems to have been put together from a pile of shredded works thrown in the air then glued together randomly. Don't get me wrong though, the acting may've been good, but the characters are so messed up it really doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending, which ironically is the both the best and worst part of the movie. The best because it signifies the conclusion of this crapping pot, and the worst because it doesn't actually exist. Now, it may be hard to understand, I know because I don't fully understand, but to put it simply, there is no ending. It felt like there was another 40 minutes of film coming then someone accidentally snipped the rest of it off and said ""Hey, that works, let's leave it like that."" <br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a horrible, confusing, and disappointing movie that you'll regret watching, so spare yourself, and don't watch it."
"Sci-Fi-Man","2","8","18","2 November 2008"," Boring, unbelievable characters, walked out at 45 minutes...
","Worse than TV.<br/><br/>This stinker of a movie joins in less than 10 movies that I have walked out on. Alien 3, Die Hard 3, Fresh Horses, etc.<br/><br/>Loved earlier Coen work, Fargo, Raising Arizona, etc. Did not see what the fuss was about No Country for Old Men, it was kinda boring in between the over the top violence.<br/><br/>At the 45 minute mark I realized I was thinking about what I have to do at work on Monday (a very bad sign), looked over at my wife and she made it clear she was ready to go.<br/><br/>Why are the characters in so many movies such caricatures and totally unbelievable? TV has become way better, for example, I dare anyone to watch the first 15 minutes of Showtime's Dexter and not be instantly hooked. I watched the entire first season in one week.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with many here, Clooney was not funny, Pitt was not funny, and Police Chief Fargo was out of place.<br/><br/>My score 2/10 for Malkovich, he opened the movie pretty well but it just was just so boring after that..."
"james_quain","1","8","18","23 October 2008"," Awful film, great actors = a car crash of a film!!!
","This is possibly one of the worst films I have ever paid money to see!! It try's to be a dark comedy but is not funny in the slightest, I never believe in walking out on a film but this film pushed me right to the limit. It just goes to prove that you can have lots of amazing actors in a film, but it the writing is not good, then it is a waste of time!! The trailer made this film look great and I for one was really looking forward to seeing it. Even the parts of the trailer that made me laugh failed to in the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good dark comedy I suggest you watch 'In Brudge' that is a hell of a lot more dark and funny!!<br/><br/>If you are considering watching this film I suggest you save yourself the money!!"
"Terrell-4","6","8","18","6 October 2008"," A throw-away effort by the Coen Brothers, but Tilda Swinton takes the prize for seriously unlikable funniness
","If you enjoy sour shaggy dog stories told for the enjoyment of clever, sour people, you might like Burn After Reading...a shaggy dog story if there ever was one. It takes the easy target of Washington's shallow denizens and mixes them into the equally easy targets of CIA paranoia and serial infidelities. And all these denizens, with one possible exception, are either numbskull boobs or nasty boobs. The Coens have given us not only a sour shaggy dog story, designed to pull the rug from under the audience, but they've populated their tale with characters that are interchangeable cardboard cutouts. The characters may look different and sound different, and may even appeal a little because of the cleverness of their unlikability, but they all dance to the same tune...the Coen Brothers patented polka that can be mighty engaging at times, but can also become as condescending as a Saturday Night Live skit. <br/><br/>If a director and a writer have any respect for their audience, they don't behave as if the audience is just part of the joke...the dumb patsy everyone else will snigger at for being taken in by that shaggy dog. If Marge Gunderson had turned out to be the shallow, constant butt-of-a-joke that Linda Litzke is, Fargo would never have been a great movie, just a show- off film filled with nothing but black humor and technique. With Burn After Reading there's no one likable except a guy who gets his with an axe. Even the Coen Brothers' technique seems to fail them. Burn After Reading, for me, just lurches from one set piece to the next. Half way through we realize nothing is going to get better, nothing is going to change, and the deaths, body disposal issues, black humor and CIA insouciance are going to be tiresome and predictable. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt has gotten a lot of press for his performance, and why not? But I'll give my award to Tilda Swinton. For my money she was the only person who managed to be both true to her character (e.g., a boob or unlikable, and in Swinton's case, unlikable) and yet very amusing in her unlikability. She's first rate. Wish the movie had been. <br/><br/>To see Swinton at her most sympathetic, watch her in Young Adam and The Deep End."
"Jonny_Numb","6","8","18","3 October 2008"," Burn Before Viewing?
","You have to hand it to the Coen Brothers, the maverick satirists of American idiocy (and its resulting comedy-of-errors quirkiness): only they would dare to follow up their most critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning films with offbeat comedies that are no less consequential when it comes to the bloody consequences of man's avarice. ""Fargo"" was followed by the cult classic ""The Big Lebowski,"" and now the Best Picture-winning ""No Country for Old Men"" has ""Burn After Reading,"" a jolting, surprising comedy that shows the film-making duo's mastery of cinematic form as a source of humor...and frustration. The plot (a gleeful jumble that recalls the tone and vulgarity of ""Lebowski"") concerns a discharged CIA agent's (John Malkovich) memoirs falling into the hands of two self-absorbed gym employees (Frances McDormand and an inspired Brad Pitt); meanwhile, a close-knit circle of Washington insiders (George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, et al) swap wives and find themselves entwined in what seems like a vast conspiracy (even the Russians are brought in to juxtapose Cold War paranoia against our post-9/11 era of fear) that is really just a string of misunderstandings inspired by the simplest of minds. While this is the Coens' umpteenth variation on the premise (after ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo,"" ""Lebowski,"" and ""No Country""), ""Burn"" shows them toying more with the mechanics of storytelling than before: there is a deliberate (yet also slow) buildup that holds back humor in favor of establishing character; and it is based on this knowledge that the film's last half often erupts in hilarity. And while the broad, artificial-feeling characters run the risk of throwing ""Burn"" into self-parody, the brilliant cast elevates what could have been throwaway caricatures. While a marginal effort in the Coens' unique filmography, ""Burn"" remains a distinct delicacy in a cinematically mundane year."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","9","21","12 September 2008"," Another smart and well done film by the Coen Brothers... OK, let's face it, these guys are geniuses
","I mean, we see a film that has the Coen Brother's name on it, it's usually going to equal gold, these guys have brought us some pretty amazing movies, like Fargo, The Big Lebowski and of course the latest classic that won best picture No Country for Old Men. They now bring us Burn After Reading, basically a movie about how the most average people can be really stupid. Let me put to you this way, imagine the dumb jock who thinks that he's smart and can pull something as far as trying to blackmail the CIA into giving him money, oh yeah, I know, right? But the reason why the Coen Brothers make such memorable films, their odd ball characters, I mean they know how to tell a story, but their characters are what make the film so memorable... just look at Fargo: Marge Gunderson... The Big Lebowski: The Dude... and No Country for Old Men: Anton Chigurh, who takes this movie? Tough call to say right now, but I have to say the underdog in this movie is played by John Malkovich.<br/><br/>The movie starts with CIA agent Osborne Cox who just got canned from his job and he goes home, not exactly heaven, his wife is horrible and cold, she's cheating on him. she's cheating with a man, Harry Pfarrer, who is married and is just cheating with everyone possible, including a woman, Linda Litzke, who along with her gym trainer co-worker, Chad Feldheimer is framing Cox for a CD of his memoirs that has information that the CIA wouldn't like the public to get their hands on. Linda wants money for her cosmetic surgery and gets Chad, who's screws aren't exactly tightened, and they play a game they shouldn't play with the CIA, blackmail.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is a very smart and intelligent comedy, I was very impressed with how well told it was and the acting is just as usual nothing short of greatness. We have an A-list cast that truly delivers, both Brad and George bring some humor to this technically dark tale, but like I said, the performance I found most impressive was John Malkvich, I haven't seen him in anything in a bit, so it was nice to see him perform and do a fantastic job as well. His scene with Brad Pitt in the car where Brad is trying to play bad cop with him is so memorable and delivers a great laugh. Burn After Reading is definitely a must see in the theater, like I said before, I mean, it's the Coen Brotehrs, need I say more? Well, I'm sure we've forgotten their little mistake by now, like The Lady Killers, so go ahead and enjoy their new treasure Burn After Reading.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jskidmore271","3","13","34","19 September 2008"," Should have been titled ""Burn Before Seeing""...
","While I am a fan of the Coen Brothers films and I do admire their talent for making movies but I have to say that their latest installment, ""Burn After Reading"", is simply a train wreck from start to finish. While the concept of the film is somewhat original and previews show promise, it really, and I mean really, fails to deliver. Even the actors didn't seem to bring their A-game to this hodge-podge of a film. Most of the characters in the film weren't even likable nor was there any chemistry what so ever. The only real interesting character was Brad Pitt, who, ironically, becomes a perfect example of the theme the film sets for itself: stupidity! The film itself starts to dive into a bunch of story lines creating suspense and tension and eventually it all just flat lines in the end. Like their other films, it follows the Coen Brothers formulas; cheating spouses, backstabbing, money trail, bloodshed, and of course their dark sense of humor.<br/><br/>With that being said, I'm not the only one who felt this film left a fowl after taste. My family, whom I saw it with, hated the film more than I did! My mom even said, ""I would rather watch the ""Saw"" movies(which she greatly despises) than that movie"". I'm trying really hard to think of a good outcome from all of this but nothing is really formulating which should be a really big RED FLAG! All I can do is pray this film gets the coup de grace it deserves which I guess in some terms is the only nice thing I can say. Just check out some of their better films like ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""O' Brother Art Thou?"" and ""No Country for Old Men"". Seriously listen to the title above, you'll be glad you did."
"skullkir","Null","5","10","12 November 2011"," Do not watch this movie.
","Before watching this movie I claimed that the Cohen brothers were the best writers of their generation. Now, I'm not so sure. I wouldn't have thought it was possible to dislike a piece of their work, but this was an exception. There were no likable characters, it made literally, no sense. You know how Cohen brothers movies are kind of weird and you're not really sure what's going on but then it all ties up at the end? Imagine if it didn't tie up at the end, and instead all the characters with charm get shot through the head and hacked to death with a hatchet in the street whilst the characters you wanted dead just sit there and get everything they wanted. I felt dirty after watching this movie."
"funkyfry","4","5","10","19 January 2009"," Zany caper without much heart
","Setting out to do what they do best, a zany caper film with bizarre characters and delicately acidic dialog, the Coens proved once again that they've been to this well a few times too often. Not that the film is terrible or that it's particularly worse -- but also not better -- than the average comedy of its type. The weight of the film's apparatus drags down its momentum; there are too many big-time actors playing cute and overemphatic character roles, too many ""look at this!"" moments, and not enough real heart or appealing characterization to carry the thing through.<br/><br/>The set-up is rather delicious -- a routine CIA analyst (John Malkovich) has his secrets stolen by his cold-hearted wife (Tilda Swinton) as part of a divorce investigation, and they end up in the hands of 2 ludicrously ambitious and foolish gym employees (Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand), who try to use the ""secrets"" on the cd/rom to blackmail the CIA guy or get cash from the Russians. George Clooney plays a guy simultaneously having affairs with McDormand's character and Swinton's.<br/><br/>Let's get the messy stuff out of the way first -- George Clooney is very funny in the movie, as he usually is in the Coen's films (although they all seem like one performance), but he was terribly and disastrously miscast in this film. There is just no way that a guy who looked like him would be trolling on the internet and picking up a woman who looks like McDormand, much less carrying on an ongoing affair with Tilda Swinton. I was wondering whether he had a fetish for unattractive women, since that would be the only thing that could explain his character's motivations considering how rich he was. Frances McDormand hasn't been particularly attractive since she was in her 20s (a lot of this movie stunk of Joel Coen's obvious and understandable blind spot in this department), and Tilda Swinton looked enough like a man when she was in her 20s to play one in ""Orlando."" It's just ridiculous -- there are plenty of other good actors who they could have cast who don't look like the reincarnation of Cary Grant, so they must have been trying to make a point by pairing Clooney with these women. But I can't really see what the point is -- if they were saying, ""this is how it really is in adult life"", then they shouldn't have cast such a gorgeous leading man. It's true that in Hollywood you often see rather ordinary men paired with fabulously beautiful women, but there's not much point in reversing the trend just for the sake of being unconventional.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt has some funny moments, the only parts of the movie where I laughed. But his character became annoying too after a bit too much screen time. The only character I could really relate to was McDormand's, but there was a bit too much obvious appeal from the directors to overcome the character's moronic behavior. Richard Jenkins gives a good performance as a sad-sack former priest who has fallen in love with the McDormand character, but the film-makers spend too much time making him sympathetic, to the point where it becomes manipulated as well. In the midst of these pathos-laden struggling ""little people"" are all these relatively beautiful strivers and seekers who seem to have 2 dimensions only in their better moments. The Clooney and Malkovich characters are particularly void of any real emotion or interest.<br/><br/>To put in a good word for the film, it's not quite as bad as ""Intolerable Cruelty""... but in the same territory. It doesn't degenerate towards the end into a much worse film like ""Cruelty"", but it never really soars or pays off on the initial promise of the opening scenes, the cast and creative people and so forth. I think back to Gene Siskel's comments on ""Raising Arizona"", about how none of the characters had any emotional weight or appeal, and although I never felt that way about ""Arizona"" I feel like he described ""Burn After Reading"" to a tee. The characters are all either smothered with emotion or left hanging as caricatures by the director(s) who've gotten too carried away with solid craft to pay attention to the larger purpose of the piece. When the Coen Brothers say in the ""bonus features"" of the DVD that they concocted the story merely to support a handful of characters that they'd like to see played by Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, there's no evidence in the film that would contradict the claim. And it seems to me a risky and far from ideal way of making a story to entertain audiences. Putting dramatic actors in funny roles or funny actors in serious roles seems to delight the Coens, but this film sorely lacked real comedians. David Rasche was the only really funny guy in the movie, and he wasn't in enough of it.<br/><br/>Hopefully the Coen Brothers are just sinking into a temporary rut, and they'll come back after this with something that holds together better. I'm starting to get the same feeling that I had when ""Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Fargo"" came out, that the best days of the Coens are behind them."

Waiting for ""something"" to happen. I love dark comedy, this was not. The acting was very poor, Brad Pitt, being the only one that was really funny. George Clooney was a terrible actor in this. The ending was the best part of the whole movie, only because we know it to be true. I was very disappointed. I would have given this one a miss, if it wasn't for the clever marketing, which show the only funny parts. The women too where rather bland with little emotion in their acting as if it were ""put on"" rather than professional ""real life "" acting. I would not tell anyone not to go see it, I would also not really tell anyone that this is a great do not miss flick. The CIA involvement was rather funny, and that acting was good, dry sense of CIA humor. The plot was smart and looks like it was taken out of ""a day in the life of intelligence stupidity"". It felt like some thing more was missing and when it ended we both looked at each other and said, ""it's nothing like we thought it was going to be"" (and not in a good way)"

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","7","16","27 December 2008"," Farce and parody are the dual carriage of sanity
","It is a comedy and it is funny. But why is it so funny? It is funny first because it is a parody of American society, of the small middle class of working people who are not particularly swift and definitely not lucky but they just do what they do with some desire to get some satisfaction out of it. Maybe even some profit or benefit. The favors of a woman, or some extra investment money. Nothing really serious but just five plastic surgery operations for the bargain price of $25,000. And that would give some dynamic ambition to anyone, and anything would be good enough to make that extra money. When you add to that the fact that everyone is playing around with another woman or another man, and the film remains within the limits of straight-dom, you have it all. The spy-apprentices will get entangled with the adulterous spouses and the situation is unbelievably complex, and lethal if not plain deadly. But then the film Â– and it starts with that Â– is situated all around one third rank CIA executive, hence with spies and other undercover actions and activities. But since most people in that situation are not in any way listed as active spies, the CIA top boss Â– if there is one Â– just wonders what it is all about and his reaction will be to clean up the situation. And the clean-up will be drastic. Only the three women will survive: the spouse of the spy, the spouse of the security service chap and the unmarried woman who wants to finance her plastic surgery. The two spouses are free since the two men they were married to end up dead. And the third woman is happy too since the CIA pays for the plastic surgery to bury the business. In other words the film is a big parody of many other films, and first of all Mission Impossible, but transferred to the level of the dummies who read all the books especially written for them, and these dummies in this film are definitely dim. And then the rest is quid pro quo (both imbroglio and legal meaning) and crazy situational complications. It turns the very serious security problems of the 21st century into a farce, and we think somewhere that after all they are a farce which makes the film absolutely righteous.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"chad-dougless","1","7","16","23 September 2008"," Terrible movie
","This movie did nothing but drag. The plot had the makings for what could have been a funny movie, yet the dialogue and character interactions made the experience excruciating. Brad Pitt did a great job acting like a complete idiot, which was funny, but did not distract enough from the overreaching nothing that was the plot. Sad to say, but I have seen horror movies with better character dialogue and less annoying acting. I can appreciate the desire to have ""real"" interactions between characters, but all they achieved was something ""real"" boring.<br/><br/>Others have commented that the humor was dry and if you don't appreciate dry humor you will not like the movie.

","I wanted to enjoy this movie because all the Coen bothers previous work I've loved. But this is a weak storyline and the acting, by mostly good actors, isn't convincing. It's as if they don't believe in the narrative either. Not all actors, however talented they are, can play comedy and that is very apparent in this movie.

","Well judging by the reviews here you're either going to love it or hate it, there's no middle ground. When it ended, I was laughing my a-- off just from the absurdity of the whole thing. I mean that in a good way. I think the movie was meant to be absurd, establishing characters in untenable situations and then having them wring their way out by the most clueless of means. I guess you have to be able to process dark humor for a film like this. Clooney's paranoia, McDormand's obsession with plastic surgery and Pitt's oblivious demeanor spell trouble at every turn, and the writing is clever enough to keep one truly off balance. When Harry (Clooney) reacted with his twenty year veteran U.S. Marshal reflexes, I just couldn't believe what happened. Just one of the many twists you won't see coming that made the film a genuine treat for this fan of the Coen Brothers. You may not like it, that's OK.

We have the health nut that has those silly health drinks who says ""that's the stuff"" and rides his push bike to the drop off... then smooth talker who claims he has a big job with a big GUN but has never fired it before.

Overall I was very impressed with the entire cast, although I thought George Clooney and Tilda Swinton were less impressive than the other four (pitt, McDormand, Malkovich and Jenkins).

The only memorably funny item was the CIA boss (J.K. Simmons). Brad Pitt's character was mildly amusing, while the Linda Litzke character (McDormand) was just annoying and very unsympathetic. I wanted someone to blow her head off. And where was John Turturro? He was one important missing ingeredient. These actors are good, the Coen Bros. are great; so what the hell happened?

But the Coens have a lot of talent, making some extraordinary films, and we have come to expect more from them this.<br/><br/>BAR is all clever and no polish. The casting is OK, but nothing to brag on. (Most actors would sign-up for a Coens film without giving it much thought or even reading the script.) The acting is about average for the star-power involved, with Pitt (surprisingly) being the stand-out. The cinematography is just ho-hum. Long-time Coens collaborator Deakins is sorely missed. Several of the scenes have a sense of desperation about them that seems out of place. (For example, the scene with ""the chair"" is just not very funny and really doesn't contribute anything to the story or character development. And it seems totally inconsistent with Clooney's character.) <br/><br/>The clever plotting and story-line are what save this from being rated much lower. Everything ties together pretty neatly and leaves you feeling smug and self-satisfied.

Great performance by John Malkovitch, and almost as good by Brad Pitt, but not quite at his best for George Clooney.

","Burn After Reading is more comedy than drama, but the humor starts off slow because the film takes time to set up several characters and their story lines. Then it becomes hilarious. It employs several different kinds of humor, some so subtle you might miss it if you don't pay attention, and some that hits you like a pie in the face. It also uses shock humor, sexual humor, and good old watching-a-moron-be-a-moron humor. <br/><br/>I've only seen it once, but I intend to view it again. It has a great cast (I loved J.K.

"bannedcompany","2","4","8","29 December 2008"," The Coen Brothers Are Hacks...And I'm Sick of It!
","I'll bet my life that Burn After Reading, in its early process, was initially designed to be a serious movie. But since The Coen Brothers are total hacks and incapable of writing a truly passable movie, that idea was scrapped and eventually turned into this absurdest mess we have now stupidly labeled as a ""black comedy."" Let's get one thing straight. ""Black comedy"" is codeword for ""lazy script in disguise"". Have the vastly overrated and mediocre Coen Brothers stumbled into writer's block? Did they realize that the movie made no sense whatsoever ever and to appeal to the so-called ""intellectual movie-viewers"" they had to add scenes of 'that old guy that was in Juno' to show that ultimately the movie making no sense was REALLY the 'point of the movie' and it was all an intentional ploy? Did they not know that an intelligent viewer would catch onto this trick? Beneath the absurdism of Burn After Reading lays a very badly written script that has no layers and no crust. All I see in this movie are terrible characters that were originally designed for what was probably going to be a serious crime thriller, but once the Coen Brothers realized how moronic the characters were and how stupid the plot was, the Coen Brothers instead opted to turn the characters into walking dufuses and turn the plot from serious to absurdism.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentleman, this isn't an intellectual movie that you have to 'get'. It's a poorly designed movie that tacked on the extra absurdism to pass off as wit.<br/><br/>Seriously, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in '08."

All of you who gave it a high score must have either been really drunk while viewing it, or plain posers, who think they know a lot about cinema and art.

"Otoboke","Null","4","8","17 October 2008"," For lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedy.
","Being the second Coen brothers' movie of this year alone, thirst for more output from them isn't necessarily at a high, yet that won't stop most audiences from getting excited. Thankfully, such excitement won't be without its foundations, as Burn After Reading, although not quite as remarkable as this year's previous effort, is just as effective at managing to deliver what it sets out to do. In stark contrast to the brothers' No Country for Old Men, this outing sees them adopting their much more familiar satirically witty tone throughout, delivering what is perhaps their most comical and sharpest movie to date. Headlined by an all-star cast, and with a multi-layered story that revolves around national security and the personalities of all involved (plus a few Gym employees), there's a rich body of ingredients to take in here, especially on a one-view basis, but while such a movie is best suited to repeat watching, it's not hard to see the raw entertainment value present first time. Hilarious, engaging and always refreshing to watch, Burn After Reading is a cinematic treat of sorts; nice and easy, focused and all about telling a good story with even better characters.<br/><br/>As has been the case with the Coens for so many years now, the tone established throughout this feature walks the fine line of satirical comedy mixed with compelling character drama and even a few instances of thriller-orientated action. Through this tricky razor edge narrative, the brothers create a movie that amuses at its peaks but doesn't necessarily flow as fluidly as their more renowned works. Nevertheless, despite some pacing problems, from start to finish, all involved manage to nail the mesh between shtick and drama effectively enough to give you quite a few belly-laughs whilst avoiding degrading the whole experience into a ridiculous, flat-out comedy driven feature. Sure enough, the humour is dark at times, and the satire is thin, but delivered by the cast involved who in turn are portraying their own mix of off-the-wall characters, Burn after Reading does well to get you on its side right from the beginning when Malkovich walks in and begins dropping the f-bomb left, right and centre. Off-put with plenty of drama and thriller tinges, the mix is potent, and the directors do well to keep things in balance so as to keep the majority of the film consistent in tone and focus.<br/><br/>Perhaps the single greatest element of the film and indeed, the directors themselves is their ability to bring out the best of their cast, and in turn without resorting to personas that such actors have done in the past. In fact with the odd exception of Malkovich, pretty much all of the lead stars here have roles that go against their grain so to say. George Clooney is probably the biggest example of this here, playing sleazy Harry Pfarrer with utter conviction; there are no sly smiles here that bring on the charm, these smiles have quite a bit of coldness behind them. Brad Pitt too extends himself beyond his regular cool-cat persona and portrays always-eager fitness freak dunderhead Chad Feldheimer in what is possibly the most entertaining performance throughout the feature. Frances McDormand, although regressing back somewhat to her character in Fargo, gets to have fun with eccentric, obsessive and neurotic Linda Litzke, and Malkovich a recently quit C.I.A. agent going through divorce, often finding himself sleeping at midday and drinking at night before losing his head.<br/><br/>Sure enough all these names are enough to make any cinephile get excited, yet the result is even more arresting than imagined. Put together, the actors work tremendously and play off each other exactly as is needed to keep on the edge of that razor of thrilling drama and comedy; there are moments of sheer hilarious caricature, but these are also off-put with grounded drama that only supports these instances of comedy insomuch that we see characters getting into these situations; we laugh when they laugh and we laugh when they react a certain way, because in a sense, we know them. As such, this is Burn after Reading's real centrepiece highlight; the characters are entertaining and at the same time compelling thanks to tight, focused direction from the Coens and spot-on performances and chemistry from the highly capable cast.<br/><br/>Sure enough, there are elements that conflict in the Coen's script that even they can't seem to work around when it gets to piecing all of their convoluted parts together. As such, pacing and momentum can dip during specific segments, particularly during the opening act. In this respect Burn after Reading distances itself from the picture-perfect flow of similarly toned Fargo, but not by much. It's a low-key effort, and a more than capable one at that, even if fans of this year's No Country for Old Men and the classic Fargo may leave the cinema a little under-whelmed. When it comes to delivering a highly enjoyable two hour ride full of laughs, thrilling plotting and refreshing characters portrayed by top-rate performers however, Burn after Reading certainly does its job. Put simply, this is good cinematic fun with plenty of intelligence behind it all to keep things interesting; for lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedyÂ… but you probably already guessed that just from reading the name Coen.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"samuelding85","6","4","8","11 October 2008"," Destroy After Reading
","The Coen Brothers are back with Burn After Reading, after the Oscar winning thriller, No COuntry for Old Man.<br/><br/>To create Burn After Reading, the brothers used the following formula to tell the story: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an CIA agent, was dismissed by CIA + unhappiness with his wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton) = Obourne's decision to create a memoir.<br/><br/>Katie's infidelity with her friend, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), behind Osbourne's back + Osbourne creating a memoir = Memoir burnt into a CD.<br/><br/>CD - do not know how the CD ends up in a female lockers in a gym = CD landed into the hands of 2 gym workers, Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) CD x (Chad + Linda)+ thought of highly classified secrets = extortion from Osbourne.<br/><br/>Extortion - failure to extort from Osbourne = sell the CD to Russian Embassy at a higher price.<br/><br/>Katie removed Osbourne out of his life X acts to make his life miserable = Osbourne in frustration.<br/><br/>(Linda X Harry)/ spying from some mysterious character = Terror and fear.<br/><br/>Osbourne in frustration + Terror and fear + Selling the CD to Russian Embassy at a high price = Disaster.<br/><br/>It takes time and patience to work out several complicated formulas, which gives you Burn After Reading. The Coen Brothers are quick to solve the formulas, but it seems that they might had missed out some details or two, which leaves several questions to the movie.<br/><br/>Are they selling a dark comedy with the story that falls towards Fargo? Sort of. To me, Fargo and Burn deals a type of issue: one needs money (whether they need it desperately or greed makes them wants the money.)and gets the money through the wrong way, which ends up getting more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>While Fargo features only McDormand and William H Macy as the leading cast, the Coen Brothers throws in more A-listed actors and actresses and eye candies to spice up the story. It is a good thing to have them, but too much of it and not handling them properly just spoils everything.<br/><br/>No crossover between Clooney and Pitt, little crossover with Clonney and Malkovich. The lack of direct face to face interaction between the 3 leading actors just ruins the expectation from the audience. And why no face to face interaction between McDormand and Swinton? It is sad to say that with a list of A-listers, there are not much chemistry among each other. It seems that McDormand's interaction with Pitt and Clooney is the only reason that prevents the movie from getting a total failure.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading seems to make one remember as a movie by Coen Brothers with a group of A-listed cast, but easily forgotten, compared to the impact the Coens created when Fargo was released to the public in 1995. So, one can simply destroy after reading it."

","As Mark Kermode would say, an hour and a half hours of my life I'll never get back. Having really liked Fargo and the Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou, along with many other reviewers I was looking forward to seeing this one based on the critical acclaim. Despite good acting it was ruined by a pointless and weak story. I hope someone takes the premise (of the security info found by a goof-ball) and makes a proper comedy out of it. No likable characters except perhaps Malkovitch's until he turns out to be a psychopathic killer, and Pitt's who is killed off too early on. Pointless, self absorbed waste of celluloid.

","After two weeks of suffering the effects of Hurricane Gustav, I called my friend and we agreed to see another movie at the theatre he works at. We agreed on this one since I was interested in seeing another Coen Brothers film and my friend was interested in seeing Brad Pitt. Pitt was perhaps the most enjoyably funny character here especially when he does one of his dance moves (my friend always says ""Go Brad! whenever that happens). And we also laughed out loud at the contraption that George Clooney made that he showed to Frances McDormand. The best parts for me, however, was the dialogue between the C.I.A. agents David Rasche and J.K. Simmons concerning the whole plot of this movie especially when Simmons says to tell him when all this makes sense! That seems to be the whole point that nothing makes complete sense. (In fact, knowing Joel and Ethan's sense of humor, I didn't really expect that!) And how hilarious was it seeing Pitt and McDormand's ""blackmail"" call to John Malkovich has to be one of the most absurd moments ever on film! The scenes with Tilda Swinton aren't as memorable as those of the other actors but she has some moments. In all, if you're a Coen Brothers fan, you should definitely seek out Burn After Reading."

So after reading a few negative reviews I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised and surprising is exactly what it is. I think the fact that it plays like a suspense thriller or a drama is part of the fun. When we're laughing out loud the audience really understands that they are witnessing a unique comedy. I mean people clapped in our theater and that has been rare to nonexistent this year, even for the Dark Knight they didn't clap. My husband laughed so hard he couldn't catch his breath.

"eric262003","9","2","3","21 August 2018"," Goes Beyond a Screwball Comedy
","Sure ""Burn After Reading"" is a zany screwball comedy written and directed by the Coen Brothers but it goes way beyond the screwball elements of the genre. The casting was well thought of, the plot is surreal and spontaneous and everyone feels at home here. I was especially impressed with Brad Pitt as a thick-haired, gum smacking fitness guru, Chad Feldheimer. I thought he was a great actor, but here he cranks it up a notch and just lights up every time he's on screen. It's a role that's really out of this world.<br/><br/>What I mean by that is that George Clooney and Frances McDormand who are seeking for a relationship in the wrong areas. McDormand plays Linda Litzke, a co-worker with Chad who thing she will find her Mr. Right on the Web even though her physique may not attract a lot, but give her credit for trying. She then turns her attention over to a plastic surgeon and does some incredible work to all various body parts to make her feel good about herself.<br/><br/>George Clooney stars as philandering U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer. Harry also seems to be addicted to dating sites and will date anyone that smiles back at him. Harry and Linda introduce themselves and seem very comfortable with each other that is until Linda and Chad find a secretive disc that hold personal information to an Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) a CIA officer who was fired for being inebriated on the job. Cox is married to child doctor named Katie (Tilda Swinton) who's been promiscuous with Harry. And well the plot will likely thicken.<br/><br/>No apologies about it, the plot meanders here, there and everywhere. And sure it wraps up quite nicely, it's not the real reason why this film is incredible. The characters and the dialogue sells by itself. Linda and Chad are great together as they take this top secretive disc to the Russian Embassy which could give them a nice cash reward so that Linda. This leads to the boys and girls over at Langley, Virginia to take charge. The dedicated CIA officer (David Rasche) takes his case to his superior (JK Simmons). The boss has little dialogue, but can deliver a witty punchline.<br/><br/>John Malkovich strikes a chord every time he graces the screen as the ex-CIA official Osborne Cox he's an inebriate who denies himself on those accusations because he remains punctual in a compulsive manner. He's condescending, cue-balled, hates people and impressed how he caught those two plebeians at the gym. Clooney can show he can transform his characters making them very versatile in everything that he does. One minute he's serious and focused, then after a wink of an eye, he can be a moody imbecile. You never what Clooney has in store for us. This marks the third and final line of doofus Clooney comedies that the Coen Brothers starred him in after ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"". All the while as much as he can play serious and focused characters it's great that Clooney can take the time to lampoon himself every now and then.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is very fun to watch here as a determined individual with a small fragment of her state trooper character from the 1996 cult classic ""Fargo"" lurking around her character here. She has a great deal of innocent intentions about her, but her mission to take this top secret information to the Russian Embassy is her mission and will stop at nothing to achieve her goal. In every role she stars in she just seems naturally fit and comfortable and it organically works out in the end.<br/><br/>In the end ""Burn After Reading"" is clearly not the greatest Coen Brothers film nor will it make you go into any kind of deep thinking. It's still a funny film, energetic with great levels of sadness which is believable since knowing that the characters we have to endure with in the next 95 minutes are not the most sanely bunch. I'm not complaining that the film was too long. In fact it's quite reasonable. My gripe is that the ending was way too free and ended quite abruptly. There are several questions left unanswered as many issues remain uncovered."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","3","22 December 2017"," Zany screwball paranoid thriller with faux suspense and real laughs...
","Remember that quote from Bart Simpson about cartoons being just a bunch of hilarious moments with no messages at all?<br/><br/>Well, you can believe ""Burn After Reading"" says something about the incompetence of secret services, the growing paranoia of the post-9/11 era and how you could make a mountain of nonsense out of the smallest piece of randomness, it's tempting to see some hidden meanings behind the madly elaborate plot, but I'd rather take the 'Bart Simpson' option and see this as another proof that the Coen brothers don't need to conform to any specific style or narrative. In other words, they're just having fun.<br/><br/>And why shouldn't they? After ""No Country for Old Men"", they probably wanted to get back to their roots and make a screwball comedy Ã  la ""Raising Arizona"" without the luxury of a heart-warming subplot, though Frances McDormand's obsession with her plastic surgery carries something poignant despite the ridiculous height her obsession reaches. The Coens had won a Best Picture Oscar with a movie that provided one of their most iconic characters, they couldn't possibly surpass themselves two years in a row, so before turning to more serious movies, they had to make ""Burn After Reading"". I read many critics trying to give it more meaningfulness than it has, but what these critics lack is obvious perspective, when you realize that they made after it their personal masterpiece, ""A Serious Man"", you see ""Burn After Reading"" as a relaxed step backwards before another big leap. <br/><br/>And relaxed seems like the fitting word, it is remarkable how the actors are having fun playing either against type or their usual type to over the top proportions, revealing so many weaknesses and insecurities you realize this is one of these rare instances where a film is only driven by losers, even ""Fargo"" had bad-ass state trooper Marge Gunderson played by Frances McDormand.Speaking of this great actress, we know she's never been a sex symbol or bound to pretty glamorous roles, so it's a credit... even if they used a double- to her to set the tone right at the start when we see a doctor checking the flaws of every single part of her body, her floppy underarms, her belly but there's no voyeurism in that scene, nor is it played for cheap laughs. It is the most important scene of the film, because for all the hilarious gags it paves the way to, if the film ever had one pillar, one pattern, one unshakable element is Linda Litzke's desire to have a complete plastic surgery. Unrealistic? My wife wanted a nose surgery ever since I married her, now, she's done it so I could relate to Linda's obsession. Actually, I was surprised by the number of situations I could relate to.<br/><br/>The film opens with the firing of CIA analyst Osbourne Cox because of an alcoholism problem and the way the whole scene is played works perfectly. I giggled a little during the interactions between John Malkovich (Cox) and his officer (David Harshe) but then I laughed during the confrontation with his wife, a domineering nagging ""stuck-up bitch"" played by Tilda Swinton, accusing him of relying on her money. And I lost it when he said he was going to pull himself together and do some... consulting or that he's always dreamed to be a writer. Anyone who's been unemployed know that ""consulting"" and ""writing"" are like the euphemism for being a job-less schmuck moving in circles and slippers in your home. Some fancy words to describe the obvious yes, Cox is a loser and his wife makes him even more of a loser, she is just so unbearable, you've got to wonder what Harry found in her.<br/><br/>Which takes us to Harry, George Clooney as a man married to a successful children book writer... also a bored womanizer. At first, Clooney plays it like his usual Cary Grant of the 2000's but then he channels the performance of Tom Ewell in ""The Seven-Year Itch , it's fun to see actors playing in or against their own tropes, Tilda Swinton being more stuck-up and pompous than usual or Clooney trying to convince us that he can be a loser too. But the gold medal of playing against type belongs to Brad Pitt, I wasn't fond of his Aldo Raine in"" InglouriousBasterds"" but ""Burn After Reading"" was the perfect platform for an over-the-top comedic performance, as a dim-witted gymnasium Dude who try to play a game too big for him, and endanger his life while a simple smack in his face almost ran him to tears. Pitt's performance is a highlight in a movie, you could tell he was still carried away by his zany persona in Tarantino's movie but it didn't fit.<br/><br/>Here it does because the film IS a joke, it's not meant to make a point but to make you laugh, there is some intelligence behind its seemingly pointlessness but there are two key characters in the film who act like a Greek chorus. The officer who fired Cox and his boss played by JK Simmons, their reactions to the current events are just pure bafflement, they're powerless and can only wait for ensuing development. They perfectly embody our position as viewers and while not tying the movie together, the ending provides the perfect punch-line, not that it doesn't end in a rather anticlimactic way, but it's a movie whose McGuffin is a CD that is given more value than it deserves, maybe a clever reference to the film's plot. Who cares of its meaning when it's played for gags? When even a simple picture of Putin hanging in the background make you laugh for no reason.<br/><br/>Once again, the only unshakable truth is that Linda wants her plastic surgery, and that's enough to drive a plot, and everyone crazy in the process, Americans, Russian and CIA included."

Also, the plot itself (not the idea behind it) is somewhat superficial, and the ""hidden"" symbols and conclusions are not really hidden, so the viewer is not required to think as hard.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, very enjoyable indeed."

","From beginning to end I relished every second of this movie, and I returned to delight in it several more times. Was there a bad performance? A resounding NO! Was the screenplay and directing first rate? A resounding YES! Everyone of the cast, major or minor, was just wonderful but for me Brad Pitt (poor pliable, innocent Chad) stood out but just by a little but it's a big little!. How can anyone find fault with the performances of McDormand, Clooney, Malkovich, Swinton, Jenkins, Simmons, and on and on! The Coen's, I presume, are master's of coaxing out the best of the actors and I'm a Coen Brother's fan with some minor exceptions. I encourage all those with an IQ over 100 to watch this film as it is a gem to be savored multiple times. Brilliant movie!"

","Burn After Reading (2008): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton: Hilarious Coen Brothers film regarding a misplaced disc by an ex-C.I.A analyst that is found and used for blackmail. It also references paranoia in that such information can lead to tragedy. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen with numerous plot twists yet the outcome feels incomplete. They are notorious for bizarre yet clever films such as The Big Lebowski and Blood Simple. John Malkovich is demoted at the C.I.A but instead quits. His wife is having an affair with a Treasury department agent, played by George Clooney. Frances McDormand plays an instructor at a fitness gym who is intrigued by a disc and decides to investigate or profit from it. Malkovich is at his comic extremes as he rapidly slips into madness when blackmail plays a factor. Clooney descends into paranoia when people are not who they seem, and murder intrudes unexpectedly. McDormand investigates the contents of the disc that she fails to realize isn't what she thinks. Her curiosity will cost others severely. Brad Pitt plays her co-worker whose intrusion bares fatal consequences. Tilda Swinton plays Malkovich's irritated and cheating wife. Humor is wayward in its take on violence. It regards how one senseless gesture can cause so much chaos. Score: 9 / 10"

Their Screenplay is wholesome, it blends in humor, romance, violence & even suspense. The characters in here are so uproariously wicked, that what happens to them ahead or from there-on, seems justified. The Coen's know how to execute a film with flourish & Their Direction, as usual, is pitch-perfect. A Special Mention for the striking Cinematography done by Emmanuel Lubezki.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: The ensemble cast perform Magnificently. Brad Pitt takes the lead with an astonishingly hilarious performance. He enacts the dumb character with unbelievable conviction. Frances McDormand is simply fantastic. Seriously, has McDormand ever given a bad performance? George Clooney is totally despicable in his part, delivering a performance that reminds us how versatile & fearless Clooney is. John Malkovich is first-rate. Tilda Swinton is in excellent form. Richard Jenkins is flawless, as always. J. K. Simmons stands out. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Burn After Reading' is profoundly funny & irresistible. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"jerica-tripp","9","2","3","4 May 2014"," Appearances Can Be Deceptive
","Burn After Reading is about tow gym employees Linda (played by Frances McDormand) and Chad (played by Brad Pitt). They unwittingly come into possession of a CIA agent named Osborne's (played by John Malkovich) memoirs. Believing this to be top-secret government information they try to sell it. Harry, Osborne's wife's lover is brought into this mix of characters. George Clooney plays Harry. <br/><br/>The major theme of the film is idiocy. The Coen Brothers themselves stated this as a theme of the film in an interview. This is very evident in the character's idiotic behavior throughout the film. Chad's character was especially dumb. The character's unintelligent behavior is the main catalyst for the film's development. Idiocy as a theme is evident as Chad and Linda attempt to sell the disc of memoirs to the Russian Embassy. The Coen Brothers have used this theme before. The Big Lebowski also used idiocy as its central theme. The character Walter (played by John Goodman) was an idiot, a lovable, gun- crazy idiot. He would relate any situation back to the war, which would add nothing to the conversation. The Coen Brothers have a true affinity for characterization as is evident in both The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading. The film constantly focuses on a single character's dumb-founded face. This enforces the theme. The angle of the camera is direct. The scene that best encompasses this is the scene where Chad meets up with Osborne to sell him the memoirs. The camera focuses on Chad's face and allows Brad Pitt's acting to shine. He can really show the expressions of Chad's dumb face. The second is the use of motif. The film keeps the viewer on the outside looking in. We are not part of the action, only viewing it. I believe this adds to the film's over-all feeling. The Coen Brothers are great at creating very original characters. The motif is of single character monologues and two characters intense dialog. Such as Osborne being on the phone with the bank. We are able to develop a better interpretation of his character. He is angry and assumes the banker is an idiot.<br/><br/>This is seen again when Osborne encounters Chad in his car. We are able to see Chad's idiocy shine as he twice repeats, ""appearances can be deceptive"". This phrase I believe encapsulates the whole them of the film. Chad is an idiot but is trying to sound smart. Appearances can be deceiving, but in the case of this film, no character is capable of appearing smart.<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Boggs, J. & Petrie, J. (2008). The Art of Watching Films.

Would you recognize yourself in one of the characters? You may: blue collar, white collar - the middle class is there, the writer, however, took a precaution and didn't include a certain common type of character in this film. It is a writer's film, indeed, the story is self-sufficient and was AFIK published as a book some time after the movie hit the screens.

","Every once in a while, there can be some value re-exploring movies since different contexts may yield new reactions. Comedies involving espionage often stupefy characters and situations and then build humor out of dumb and one-dimensional characters doing dumb things. Burn After Reading tries a different route by using intelligent characters, but crafting situations so full of confusion and panic that bad decisions become the only options.<br/><br/>The plot opens with Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) demoted from his CIA analyst position to a less prestigious career. In anger, he quits with a few choice words to his boss. His wife (Tilda Swinton), dissatisfied with her marriage and engaging in a long-term affair with a U.S. Marshal (George Clooney), copies financial records in preparation for divorce. Most likely by accident, she also copies classified documents that are discovered by gym employees played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand. Their attempts at blackmail set most of the movie's events in motion.<br/><br/>The comedy for Burn After Reading shines from the character's confusion and the audiences' understanding of the whole picture. When the gym employees first contact Cox about the classified documents, Cox has no idea that anything is missing. In his anger, he assumes the blackmailers broke into his house to steal his memoir. Since Cox refuses to pay $50,000 for his memoir, the gym employees take the classified documents to the Russian embassy and attempt to sell the information. While seeming like a good idea, the absurdity and silliness of trying to sell classified information to the Russians is manifested by the other characters' disbelief. Cox's profanity-ridden tirades, serving to remind the audience how outlandish the whole situation becomes, keep the audience laughing at a plot that superficially should be serious.<br/><br/>A second source for comedy is U.S. Marshall Harry Pfarrer's growing paranoia. Since he's sleeping with the wife of a CIA Agent, he jokingly believes the CIA follows him at the orders of Cox. As the plot continues building, he notices cars following him and men in suits with sunglasses. Suddenly his original joking proposition doesn't seem too unbelievable. The audience knows that Cox doesn't direct the tails, by laughs at the paranoia as Pfarrer suspects everyone as a possible spy.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is not the gem of Coen Brothers comedy â€“ that spot is probably best reserved for The Big Lebowski. However, spy thrillers seem to come along several times a year and keeping a smart satire in your movie collection to watch after the most recent manifestation of Salt or The American helps foil the absolute seriousness of the paranoid-action-spy-thriller genre.

","A meditation on the psychology of entitlement, this movie posits a world in which every living creature is a plaything, a patsy, a cog in a machine or a moron. It is twinned with a meditation on the psychology of pattern recognition; in this movie not a single person is capable of seeing what's in front of him or her because they are spring loaded to see something completely different; every character defines his or her own self interest so narrowly, and with such ludicrous emphasis on the wrong things, that a horrible outcome is pretty much guaranteed.<br/><br/>Every single character is rendered ugly by a character flaw. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) is a horndog SOB with no more ability to tell the truth than fly to the moon; Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is obsessed with appearance to the point of being unable to make anything resembling a moral judgement; Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) is so gullible and malleable that he reminds me of that line out of the 1968 film No Way to Treat a Lady ""A thought of yours would die of loneliness!"" And it continues like that. John Malkovich's character (was there ever an actor who chewed scene with such slow-mo relish and verve?) is just an upper class man's son who evaporates as a viable mate when he loses his job, thereby causing his wife (Tilda Swinton, who must have been told ""Please channel every gonad sapping fishwife with clipped English diction EVAR, thankyou"") to run off to a divorce lawyer.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie, my brother turned to me and said, ""So, run into any likable characters yet?"" And the answer was a resounding no, but that didn't make me want to stop watching. I wanted to see it through, because I wanted to see if anything like justice would occur, and it didn't.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie because it's brilliantly written and very well made. But those characters, hoo-boy. I am glad my life has more meaning, more friendship, and something resembling ethics and rationality, because these fictional folks abandon all such considerations in the first frame, and suffer the consequences all the way through, while the Coens hold up the magnifying glass. One question remains. Are we being asked to mock them or identify with them? Either way it's an uncomfortable, if funny film."

","Burn After Reading is a funny comedy from the Coen brothers whose other directorial credits include No Country For Old Men, The Big Lewoski, and Fargo to name a few. I won't reveal any spoilers because it's better to see it without knowing too much about the movie. Burn After Reading may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's definitely worth watching because of the terrific performances by the whole cast. George Clooney is funny as Harry a philandering State Department marshal whose cheating on his wife. Frances McDormand is equally impressive as Linda Litzke an employee at Harbodies a workout gym whose wants cosmetic surgery. John Malkovich is good as always as Osbourne Cox a CIA Agent who quits his job after being demoted. Tilda Swinton is effective as Osbourne's cold wife Katie a doctor who's having an affair with Harry. Richard Jenkins is good as Ted Treffon the manger of Hardbodies who has feelings for Linda and Brad Pitt is hilarious as Chad Feldheimer a total goof ball whose also an employee at the gym Hardbodies. Pitt may not get a whole lot of screen time but he does a great job at playing a complete idiot. J.K. Simmons also shows up in a brief cameo role and does a solid job with the small part he does have in the movie. Well done. The Coens continue to show with the movie their talent and skill as filmmakers. So if you're a fan of comedies than you can't go wrong this one because Burn After Reading is worth seeing for the laughs and the exceptional performances by the talented cast."

It was very well done, but the movie IS too short imo.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers are just shockingly good at making movies... the only thing that they could have done to improve the movie, was to make it longer, as 90minutes really isn't enough... if this movie was 120min-150min, then I'd probably have given this movie a 9/10 or even 10/10... but otherwise than that, this movie is fantastic."

","A perfectly balanced blending of dark and funny, it's not just another Coen Brothers movie - it's their NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Like the Hitchcock classic, it boasts a brilliantly confected screenplay built around a plot mechanism - a McGuffin, as Hitch called such things - less substantial than air, involving government spies, secrets, duplicity and connivance. The Coens, as inventive as ever, add plastic surgery and keep-fit to the mix.<br/><br/>Superbly performed by a top-notch cast (has Brad Pitt ever given a more delightful performance? I really don't think so) and particularly noteworthy for its witty editing (courtesy of the Brothers themselves, under the name of Roderick Jaynes), it is crammed full, like all vintage Coen-work, of characters whose own worst enemies are themselves.<br/><br/>Some clearly find this sort of thing heartless, some find it far-fetched. I find it well-observed and sadly true-to-life."

","Burn After Reading is Coen, no doubt, but it doesn't feel complete, its the first film of theirs that I feel the characters don't exist out side of this film, anything out of frame does not exist!. The characters feel like caricatures with a built in code - be this kind of character. Brad Pitt is the quirky, dumb character with a good heart. John Malkovich is the just got sacked, angry all the time, old man. George Clooney is your typical full of himself, womanizer douchebag. <br/><br/>Im not saying this is a bad thing, The characters are actually pretty fun to watch go through their daily struggles, get pulled into a tangled web of deceit, lies, cheating, plastic surgery, love and CIA intelligence.<br/><br/>The film has this keen eye for the over the top. Every situation is only slightly unbelievable, only slightly over the top. The way these characters interact is like their jumping out of different films and colliding at that one point and time, None of them seem to know anything, all of them have some ulterior motives that make them seem like the most despicable people in the world. <br/><br/>Nothing actually gets resolved either, There's even a scene at the end where J.K Simmons himself says that 'we learned nothing'. Was the last 90 minutes a waste of time then? No, I think its just the classic Coen brothers curveball, start sub-plots then drop them and end with no resolution, just like life in a way. The way the characters were set up also leads us to the fact they never would get much of a resolution anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, Burn After Reading is a great comedy from the Coen's. It didn't set the world on fire and unlike The Big Lebowski, 6 years later, it still hasn't, but its a fun, quirky film that is still a must see for any fan of the Coen brothers."

","The 2008 film Burn After Reading is written, produced, edited, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, is made up of an all-star ensemble cast. It takes place in Langley, Virginia in the early 21st century and although there is no real starring role in the film the entire cast does a great job performing.The Coen brothers are known for their comedies, and this film has some gritty scenes that will definitely get your attention. <br/><br/>The plot involves two unconnected threads that become intertwined throughout the film. The theme is Man vs. Himself, and the main characters show what each of their weaknesses is throughout the film. It begins with John Malcovich, as Osbourne ""Ozzy"" Cox, ""quitting"" his job as a CIA analyst because his superiors know he is drinking too much. This leads him to write a tell all memoir about his life and career. Once his wife Katie, TIlda Swinton, finds out about him leaving his job she takes her chance to get a divorce and continue her affair with Harry Pfarer, played by George Clooney. Her attorney advises her to get her husband's financial information and other files, which she puts onto a CD. <br/><br/>While leaving Hardbodies Gym, the disc is left on the floor by a law firm employee. Chad Feldheimer, played by Brad Pitt, is a personal trainer, obsessed with body image. He finds the disc and shows it to his co-worker Linda Litzke. Frances McDormand as Linda Litzke, then mistakenly thinks that the bank records and cryptic first draft of Ozzy's memoir on the disc is classified government information. Tracking it back to Osbourne, Linda and Chad decide to give the disc back, but for a price. Linda is desperate for plastic surgery and thinks that this could be the answer. Although Ozzy does not accept their offer, so they then turn the disc over to the Russian Embassy, promising there is more information to follow in return for monetary compensation. The problem is they do not have any more information, so Chad plans to break into Osbourne's house and retrieve more information. <br/><br/>Harry Pfarrer, a sex crazed US Marshall, is entangled in many extra-marital affairs with women he's met online, Linda Litzke being one of them. This is how the two story lines connect. While taking his daily run, Harry has also noticed that someone in a dark car seems to be following him everywhere. Meanwhile, Ozzy returns home to find the locks are changed and his bank accounts are whipped out, his wife has making her divorce plans known. He is left to sleep on his boat. Chad is on his mission and once he sees the house is empty he breaks in to the Cox's house. Unfortunately Harry returns to the house to find Chad in the closet, and shoots, kills, and disposes of him, thinking he is the spy that has been following him. He later finds out that his wife has hired a private detective to follow him, because she too is ready for a divorce. He is not the only one having an affair. Harry and Linda met online and meet, later in a discussion she mentions her friend, Chad in missing. After more discussion Harry realizes it is the man he shot, and accuses Linda of being a spy as well. <br/><br/>Richard Jenkins, as Ted, knows of Linda's need for more information being sympathetic he decides to break in the Cox's house as well, and look for more information. Ozzy, mad and drunk breaks into his house and finds Ted there. Ozzy shoots him and Ted stumbles out of the house, Ozzy then beats him with a hatchet in the middle on the day, right in front of his house. <br/><br/>At CIA headquarters, Ozzy's former manager and his Director, J.K. Simmons, try to understand what happened. Chad and Ted are dead; Ozzy is in a vegetative state and dying after being shot by an agent while attacking Ted. Harry was arrested trying to board a flight to Venezuela, but the CIA Director suggests letting him go. Linda agrees to cooperate in return for the CIA financing her plastic surgery. <br/><br/>The central theme of the film is Man vs. Himself. Nothing leads to a man's demise like man himself, and each on the main characters are plagued by one problem or another. Harry struggles with lust, and the need for sexual relationships. He also thinks he is being followed and has major paranoia. Ozzy struggles with his addiction to alcohol, which leads to him losing everything that is important to him. He too deals with paranoia, and that someone is watching. Linda has major body image issues and constantly feels the need to improve herself. She is willing to do almost anything to get the plastic surgeries that she feels she needs. Chad is obsessed with his body image as well, he devotes most of his time to perfecting his body. Ted is a good man, although he is to kind, and sympathetic. This will end up getting him killed. The camera angles in Burn After Reading opens with a theological shot; a Google-Earth's eye view of North America that rapidly zooms in on Langley, Va. The film begins and ends with the Google Maps view of the Earth. There are an abundance of low angles and you are often looking up at the characters. The dark scenes display good shadow detail and an inky black level. This is very important because of the technique Burn After Reading was shot. Things in the foreground tend to look extremely detailed, while the back becomes soft. Osbourne's boat and when Harry is jogging, in the first dusk scene, shows great evidence of the quality transfer."

I enjoy Frances McDormand â€”she's terrific.I figured if she's in it, John Malkovich, J.K. Simmons is in it... then it should be interesting. What I didn't know is it was going to be one heck of a movie. I laughed til I cried, I laughed til I coughed and my sides hurt. It's definitely up there with my top movies. Hey I love going to the movies and often times, I am disappointed....but not with this one baby, not with this one... there's some parts I wish didn't happen, but overall, it's a GREAT MOVIE.

","Burn After Reading, simply said, is a story of what happens when paranoia is combined with depression, stress, and/or loneliness.<br/><br/>It tells of what happens when something as simple as finding a memoir of a CIA agent can be deadly when handled extremely by the CIA.<br/><br/>It tells a story of two very idiotic gym employees who found the memoir and want to use it to their own personal advantages (Linda, who wants her cosmetic surgery paid and Chad, who just want some rewards for finding the CIA's sh*t -- Chad: ""Osbourne Cox? I thought you might be worried... about the security... of your sh*t."") Now, this movie is made out of random, meaningless plot and intersected with some more random, meaningless sub-plots.<br/><br/>But, somehow, the meaningless-ness of this movie is what made it genius, I'd say! It explores how normal people would react when this kind of things happened to them (I won't tell you what, you have to see it for yourself). And it is filled with dark humour.<br/><br/>But what stands out the most is the acting. It is a cast of big names acting stupid. Which is...good, actually...in a way. It's very confusing, to say the least. You just have to watch it.<br/><br/>And the star of this movie is not Clooney, but surprisingly, Pitt. He just shines throughout each scene he's in. And, not to mention, his character is very funny.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading -- another genius movie by the Coen Bros. -- but at a lesser effort -- recommended!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. As usual, high expectations often lead to disappointment when it comes to movies. Being a huge Coen Brothers fan, I can happily re-watch just about any of their films at just about any moment (exceptions would by The LadyKillers and Intolerable Cruelty). Despite a tremendous cast, ""Burn After Reading"" just seems to go nowhere, I didn't have much fun getting there! The two best characters in this one are Brad Pitt as a perky, dim-witted personal trainer (replete with Vanilla Ice/Eraserhead hair) and John Malkovich as former CIA agent Osbourne Cox. In A-typical Coen Brothers fashion, most of the other characters pretty much fall flat ... in an over-the-top kind of way.<br/><br/>The amazing cast is completed by Tilda Swinton playing Malkovich's bitchy wife who is sleeping with/dominating George Clooney's character, who is a paranoid sleazeball and seems to have no real purpose other than to also be sleeping with Frances McDormand, who is partnering with goof-ball Brad Pitt to blackmail Malkovich out of $50,000. Richard Jenkins is the fitness center manager who has a quiet crush on McDormand and is fed up with Pitt.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments and certainly a couple of pure Coen Brothers scenes, but the story and the characters just don't seem complete, which is the biggest surprise and disappointment. I can only assume that Ethan and Joel felt the same way, and that the J.K. Simmons character speaks for them when he speaks lines such as ""Well we really don't have much, do we?""."

","Coen Brothers comedies at their best, like The Hudsucker Proxy or Raising Arizona, are brilliant, and up until today I would have said that Coen Brothers comedies at their worst are at least mild fun, but this is one is utterly wretched. The movie's plot relies entirely on the stupidity of its unlikeable characters: the cascade of calamity could have been stopped had anyone in it had half a brain. From the half wit who is shocked her insurance won't pay for her cosmetic surgery on, this is a movie about people with no clue. The movie is pointless and dull. Ostensibly a comedy, it fails to be funny in spite of some good performances. Brad Pitt gives it his all as a dopey personal trainer, but like all the other performers he is done in by a script that gives him nothing to work with.<br/><br/>This is a terrible, terrible movie, easily the Coen's worst film, and I find the good reviews it has received inexplicable.

","It's really a shame. This movie had so much going for it, such as a great cast and talented direction. However, it just didn't do anything. It almost did on several occasions, but it ended up coming up short each and every time. I didn't think it was that funny, either, and the film really struggled with figuring out if it wanted to be a comedy or spy thriller, and it didn't do a good job in either category. The only saving grace was John Malkovich, who has proved that he is definitely one of our best actors out there. Unfortunately, his efforts went for naught. The Coen brothers need to stop believing their own press and start making the kinds of great movies they made in the past. Come on, guys!!!"

If I hadn't read on the DVD box that it was meant to be a comedy I wouldn't have realised for much of the film. A comedy really needs to get a few good laughs in the opening scenes which this sadly lacks, in fact the funniest scene is right at the end when its a bit late to grab the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>The film starts with CIA agent Osbourne Cox quitting the agency when he is demoted. He decides to write his memoirs which leads to trouble when his wife copies his computer files as she thinks they may contain financial information she could use when she divorces him. The disc with the files is lost in a gym and found by two less than intelligent employees who see it as an opportunity to make some money, little knowing that the information on it is fairly low level. Against this spy story we also have Cox's wife having an affair with Treasury agent Harry Pfarrer who is also involved with one of the two gym employees.<br/><br/>The actors did a good enough job as one would expect from such big names, although I thought the best performance came from J.K. Simmons in his small role as an unnamed CIA Superior which provided more laughs than the rest of the film did. Some viewers might be put off by the constant swearing and while it isn't a particularly violent film there is one scene where somebody is shot which is bloody and shocking.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend buying this to anybody who isn't a completist who needs to see every film of a particular actor or the Coen Brothers. It might be worth watching when it is on television if there is nothing better on."

Well, what happens is a ridiculous and absurd chain of events which makes up ""Burn After Reading"", a comedy of circumstance, or as I would like to call it a thinking-man's screwball comedy. The cast is really great and dead on, with a deliciously frustrated and raging John Malkovitch, a pretty-boy meat-head Brad Pitt, a paranoid-philanderer George Clooney, a self-obsessed basket-case Frances McDormand, a decent-yet-too negative-and-self-restrained Richard Jenkins, a cold-stuck-up bitch Tilda Swinton and a permanently s*it-faced J.K. Simmons.<br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" is one of the best movies I have seen so far this year (and there haven't been many of those), and quite a successful comeback for the Cohen brothers after their last great piece ""No Country For Old Men"". This is the Cohen Brothers on their lighter side, when I mean lighter side, I mean that in as far as the Cohens go, you make your own deduction from that! So Cohen brothers fans fret not for this is not ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". ""Burn After Reading"" is more in the vein of ""The Big Lebowsky"" or ""Barton Fink"", with a bit more realism if I may say so.<br/><br/>The saying goes ""No man is an island"", well in this movie the world portrayed is full of little islands, islands drifting apart rather than together. In hindsight, I think this film has more in common, or at lest shares some common threads with Sam Mendes's ""American Beauty"" than even with previous Cohen comedies...perhaps, perhaps not, at least that is just my own worthless opinion.<br/><br/>Coldplay had a song on their album, ""Parachutes"", I cannot remember what track it was, either ""Don't Panic"" or ""Troubles"", where one line goes something like ""We've been living in a bubble"", well watch this movie and see what you make of it."

","""Nothing makes much sense. So you might as well make whatever kind of movies you want and hope for the best."" - Ethan Coen<br/><br/>""Nihilism is not only despair and negation, but above all the desire to despair and to negate."" â€“ Albert Camus<br/><br/>Few filmmakers encapsulate the tenets of postmodernism as purely as the Coen brothers. Postmodernists vehemently deny any such thing as absolute truth, revel in nihilism, sarcasm and irony, reject objectivity (which mirrors everything ""new"" in the science community, from Chaos Theory to Quantum Decoherence to The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to Godel's Incompleteness Theorems to Turing's Halting Problem etc), maintain a posture of ""mock, ironic distance"" and adhere to French philosopher's Jacques Derrida's understanding of language, in which words and images have no meaning and are viciously self-limited, all systems of signs only referring to other signs, all language a web of references. <br/><br/>As postmodernism is associated with relativism (anything goes, the era of ""whatever""), such artists believe that no meaning can be derived from text other than whatever subjective meaning the interpreter assigns to it. Since there are no absolutes, the very linguistic symbols used by the author to communicate are undermined. With symbols undermined, surface re-arrangement becomes the artist's primary tool. Enter the age of ""that's so random"", of incessant pastiche and mock sampling (taken to the extreme, see the random cutaway joke inserts of ""Family Guy""). Gradually postmodernist art evolves to the point at which it starts to mirrors the universe it believes in: total randomness and utter nihilism. The universe of noir. <br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" is another in a long line of Coen brothers film noirs. Noir is by definition a conspiratorial and largely indeterministic universe, and the one genre that aligns itself perfectly to the Coens' world-view (all Coen films are either noirs, screwballs or hybrids of the two, noir being screwball without the comedy). From the bowling pins and tumbleweeds of ""The Big Lebowski"", to the car crashes, murders and tornadoes of ""A Serious Man"" and ""No Country For Old Men"", the Coen's have now started to bring the subtext of their earlier films to the forefront. Their films are now exclusively about the world being ""about"" nothing other than mechanical, cosmic causality. <br/><br/>This is the problem with being too intelligent for your own good. Everything either becomes a tongue-in-cheek homage, or you wallow in the dead end of intellectual limits, finding new and clever ways to soliloquise over the vacuity of existence. Woody Allen, like the Coens, has made a career out of doing just this. In fact, the Coens are Woody Allen with visual style, both the Brothers and Allen oscillating between ""serious"" films about nothingness and ""funny"" formalist games about nothingness. Early Coen films, like ""Where art Thou?"" and ""Barton Fink"", even went so far as to deride socially conscious artists altogether. ""Fck it, dude,"" is the Coen motto, as a title card in the Coens' ""A Serious Man"" essentially states.<br/><br/>It's not that there isn't truth to such conclusions â€“ everything is, after all, a bit meaningless â€“ but one should question the productivity of not taking the next step and asking, ""So what now?"" If the pointlessness of life exists only to be talked about and converted into art, then that talking and that art are just as pointless as life. Better, perhaps, to break through the brick wall of meaning(lessness) and choose a fork in the road: create some meaning or find some that has evaded you thus far. Which is why the mantra of cinema's late modernists was always ""nothing matters, so everything does"".<br/><br/>And so ""Reading"" is another Coen Brothers film populated by confused and stupid people living in a wholly absurd, indeterministic universe. The difference here is that all the characters are motivated by sex (usually in the Coen universe it's greed and revenge). We have Linda, a woman who is obsessed with plastic surgery and finding a man, Harry, a marshal who is making a sex machine to please women in his basement and who hops from one sexual relationship with a woman to the next (symbollically, his holstered gun/penis has ""never been really used""; he's been put out to pasture and is caught in a mid-life crisis of sorts). Then there are various wives and minor characters, all of whom are looking for love or trying to improve their body images. The only characters who escape these hang ups are Osbourne, an intelligence analyst who drinks because everyone around him is a complete buffoon, and Brad Pitt, in another wonderfully funny role as a good natured man-kid. <br/><br/>Government apathy and American obsessions with sex and physical perfection - the moronic nature of the entire modern age â€“ are the targets, but its handled as low scrutiny satire, the Coen's not interested in examining or empathising with the hang ups of these characters, but highlighting how useless these hang ups are in the face of a universe that is wholly uncaring. In other words, we're all raving, needy, thoughtless airheads, who should wake up to the fact that we're just bouncing around like pin-balls. <br/><br/>The film is wrong to portray the CIA and intelligence community as a bunch of clueless numskulls (they masterfully play ignorant populaces like pawns), but the film nevertheless ends with two great scenes. One in which our intelligence analyst bemoans the fact that everyone is an idiot, whilst failing to realise that the man he is about to kill is a well meaning, compassionate and caring ex-priest. The other great scene occurs immediately afterwards, and involves a CIA agent summarising the film we just witnessed, leaving the audience with a resounding sensation that nothing has been solved, and even more embarrassingly, that there was really no problem at all. <br/><br/>7.9/10 â€“ Filled with freakish nuances that make it more rewarding to re-watch than the directors' more celebrated fare."

","The Coen Brothers are the rebels of the film industry. They never use Hollywood conventions and formulas, and that's what makes them so unique. The Cormac McCarthy book, ""No Country for Old Men,"" was considered unfilmable by many, yet it was lauded by critics and audiences alike (it won, though undeservedly, the Best Picture Oscar, but I thought ""Atonement"" was better). However, while the Coens' are undeniably talented, they are not flawless. And this time, they've created a real stinker.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in this movie, very little of which is actually interesting. The main storyline revolves around a pair of nitwit gym employees (both of whom would rival Romy and Michelle for lack of brainpower) who get a hold of a disk of private information belonging to an (ex) CIA analyst, Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), and use it to get rich quick by various means.<br/><br/>The characters here are either idiots or too smart for their own good. None of them, however, are interesting or funny. All the actors, which include Brad Pitt (as one of the brainless gym employees), Frances McDormand (as the other one), John Malkovich, George Clooney as a paranoid philanderer), and Tilda Swinton (as Cox's wife), have given terrific performances in the past, and they certainly give it their all in this film, but it's all for naught. This movie really sucks.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that it's bloated. Clooney and Swinton's roles are more or less inconsequential, and could have been almost completely written out.

This movie has a similar sense of humour to 'Fargo' and 'The Big Lebowski' rather than 'Intolerable Cruelty'.

With a cast like John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, J.K. Simmons, Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins and Frances McDormand, 'Burn After Reading' certainly does not fall short in the acting department but it is Frances McDormand who steals the show as fitness instructor who is obsessed with cosmetic surgery (in order to 'reinvent' herself). The opening sequence hints a spy thriller but once we land into the world of the absurd characters. Pretty much all the lead characters are obsessed with their image. The dialogues are laugh-out-loud funny. The humour is very dry (it might not appeal to all). The plot follows a steady pace and closes with a solid end.

","One must always approach a Coen film like approaching a snake with stick, because you know in the end it will try to bite. Some people call it entertainment, I think it's just stupid.<br/><br/>As with all Coen entertainment, the word 'f---' is used more than common words such as 'the' and 'a'. And ALL of the major actors in the movie act like there's a surgeon in the dressing room who performs a lobotomy before they go in front of the camera. The Coens must hang out with some REALLY STUPID folks or people whose brains are totally fried out on drugs.<br/><br/>But it isn't the verbal profanity, it's the actual screwing with people that I find objectionable. All of their movies are depictions of a screw.<br/><br/>And while screwing is certainly an 'adult' entertainment, the entertainment value heavily depends on whether one is in the position of screwer or screwee. So, while all the screwers in the audience laugh their heads off at the antics on the screen, keep this in mind: what goes around comes around...the screwer will ultimately inevitably become the screwee, and then the joke is on you.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton's character was the only one in the movie that was compelling, and she had the most unlikeable character of them all. Who am I to say? But I'll say it anyway, Brad Pitt IS TOO OLD to be playing roles like this. And a note to George Clooney, you'd do your career an enormous boost when the next time the Coens call, you tell them you're not available...or do you always want to play goofs? Everyone loves a young rake, but when you get older the same antics just come across as hopelessly lost. C'mon guys, you're both GREAT actors, you just need to devote your talents to better material!<br/><br/>So you may place me in the ranks of those who dislike Coen movies. I think part of their appeal is that they play out some adolescent fantasies under a veneer of reality. Except that actually, there's less reality in them than the Lord of the Rings."
"jimojimo","4","3","6","1 February 2009"," A confusing, unresolved mess.
","At one point in this movie, an CIA agent calls the situation 'a cluster****'. Perhaps not ironic at all is the fact that he's describing the plot to this movie--and he's correct! <br/><br/>The movie is set in DC, and nearly all characters work for some government department with the exception of Brad Pitt and Francis McDormand's DC gym employees. Pitt's character finds a CD at the gym with what appears to be sensitive CIA info, and he and his co-worker at the gym (McDormand) try to blackmail the owner of the CD, and when that does not go well they head for the Russian embassy to see if there's interest there. Shades of Sean Penn in Falcon and the Snowman there.<br/><br/>However, Pitt's character is the most glaring 'fish out of water' in this movie--but not because he's not with the government. It's because his character is a character that has never existed in human reality.<br/><br/>He's overplaying a character that's an amalgam of gay, stupid, jockish, quasi-gutsy, and 'dude'. In this film he's not funny, not cute, he's like the zipper in the dryer that keeps making noise while you're watching TV and you wish it would stop.<br/><br/>The best and most affecting performance is by Richard Jenkins who plays the lovestruck gym manager. Malkovich's and Swanton's performances are good as well, and so is David Rasche (anyone remember Sledge Hammer?).<br/><br/>And the music score--very heavy 'suspense' music--does not work as suspense music or as 'comedy ironic suspense' music. And speaking of what isn't a fit--Clooney's basement contraption had no place in this movie at all, it was a giant WTF. It would've been funny in a movie of a different flavor but I just rolled my eyes.<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot more revolves around who's cheating on whom, and that gets very confusing. Clooney's character is sort of the thread that ties all of the different plot lines together, but it's too confusing and sloppy that it doesn't work. Nor does it ever tie up the numerous loose ends, which is a disappointment of Soprano's proportions.<br/><br/>I give it 4, for Rashke, Jenkins, Malkovich, and Swanton's performances, but the messy, un resolved plot prevents it from any higher."

I thought if I endured it till the end I might be greeted by a major twist and everything might have fallen into place. No such luck was bestowed upon me.<br/><br/>It DOES have several funny parts in it, but they seem to be out of context with the drabness of the rest of the movie. The very least I expected was to be able to see John Malchovich get shot, or see him in hospital. And the very point in the film!!! I wanted to see the results of her plastic surgery. How can they get away with just having a 2 minute dialogue at the end of the film to wrap up all the loose ends.<br/><br/>So in short, it didn't really get going and it seemed like it was just cut short cos they realised this is going to be a poo film so just gave up.<br/><br/>I know there will be some pompous people reading this who will cast this comment aside because they think they are such film buffs that they can watch a film thats not funny and still think it's funny through intellectual satire. Well I'm sorry to break this to you, but American's don't really get satire and maybe this is the most prominent example of such. <br/><br/>If you're wanting to watch a funny film, go and see Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.

","I lose patience with movies that throw plot devices at you that aren't supported by ""real world"" rules. This is one of them. For example, two of the characters are having an affair and the male character is in the woman's bedroom while she is away. The male character accidentally shoots a third character hiding in her closet. It's a ""bullet through the brain"" head shot that leaves a mess all over the place. Afterwards, we learn that the body is disposed of in a river. It's clear that the male character never tells the female character what transpired in her house. But wait a minute, remember it is her house, and the shooting occurred in her bedroom closet, and she's clearly a fastidious person who would notice anything awry. How did the shooter get the closet cleaned up so quickly that she wouldn't notice? Clearly, some of her clothes would have been spattered, too. Also, the third character broke into the house by breaking a glass panel on a rear entrance to unlock the door. So, in the space of presumably a few hours the shooter's character got rid of a dead body, cleaned up blood and gore all over the wall and carpet of a closet, cleaned any affected clothing that got spattered, then cleaned up the broken glass from the rear door and replaced the glass panel. This movie is supposed to be set in the real world, that is, it's not an alternative fantasy universe where physics don't apply. But here's a key plot development that doesn't pass a real world test. This isn't the only plot element that doesn't make sense, just the worse. If any of this is explained in a Deleted Scenes segment, then we didn't bother watching it."
"jammasta-1","7","3","6","16 November 2008"," the shape of things to come
","I must say I admired Coens' cinematic productions up to and including ""Fargo,"" but later found myself bored or unengaged by what they put through to the viewers. Their earlier style was either complete farce or a dark, brooding satire (so to speak) and it was just what the casual moviegoer needed after all those typical romance-and-cigarettes movies of the late 80s/early 90s. I, for one, did. Sadly, this dark element has mysteriously disappeared, to be replaced by an unwelcome doubtlessness. Where earlier movies posed and then withdrew unnerving, deep questions about humanity, mixing human horror (usually death and/or violence) with human idiocy (""I will destroy you!"" and such), the late 90s Coen movie (outside the great ""Big Lebowski"") seemed to veer all the more toward an unreflexive, transparent imagery in which the comic virtually displaced all the tragic. And this was sad. Lackily, there was still enough meat in it all to suggest more good things to come, and I guess we can safely assume ""Burn After Reading"" prophesies a revival of the good old Coens. I certainly wish it does. The movie itself is a little uneven, but even if its form and content are sometimes undecided, it leaves a mark on the viewer. The clash between the (implicitly) unlimited power of today's secret services and the unreality of modern life's casual events produces a very striking image. And the same goes to the cast of characters, which is as disparate as you could ever imagine. Take the comedians: Pitt, McDormand; the tragic actors: Malkovich, Swinton, Clooney (for the most part); and link them through a host of undecided, unrelated, displaced people - like Malkovich's (former) superior in the CIA, or McDormand's employer. The outcome is an explosive mixture, and it is something to watch."

However, there were some moments that I found funny. Brad Pitt was great as the goofy, stupid gym trainer and John Malkovich was perfectly odd as the ex-CIA member caught up in the whole thing. Nevertheless, the story was a bit too complicated for me, and I didn't laugh as much as I'd hoped to. They got rid of Brad Pitt too early into the movie, and they kept Frances McDormand in way too many scenes. I was upset, I wish it was better. But that's okay, because for now, I can watch Jeff Bridges rule as ""The Dude"" over, and over, and over again."

","It's interesting that the Coens chose this film after the barnburner that was Old Country. To catch the trickle down crowd with a piece that makes fun of the very part of the crowd that trickles down - that's real courage.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading condescends, but meta-textually. And Brad Pitt is a big give-away that this is exactly what the Coens are doing. He's amusing enough to keep the non-Coen audience entertained, but hollow enough to obviate the underlying theme. You just got mocked, average America. But the Coen take on average America cuts a wide-swath - it even includes us, the Princeton (equivalent) educated who think that we're artists because we like a good film but what do we ever really do - write a few pages of memoir as clichÃ© (see our user comments) and wander around with a drink in our hands (how many movies have you watched this week?).<br/><br/>Nice. Don't get me wrong - I think that it's great. The Coens have successfully skewered, and they've gotten away with it.

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","6","9","28","11 September 2008"," ""Oh my f'ck!"", WTF happened?
","After commercial and critical smash No Country For Old Men took the country by storm last year, the Coen Brothers had thrust themselves into the land of very high expectations for their follow up, which, admittedly, couldn't be more different. Their latest film featuring a stellar cast is unfortunately not as stellar as the performers. I found it to be frustrating and predictable, although well written and well acted. Maybe I just didn't like it and I'm missing all the 'charm' that is giving it the Oscar Buzz...wait, that's just Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Pitt is the shining star here, there's no doubt about it. If it weren't for the fact that he has the smallest role in the film in terms of importance and screen time, he'd be a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Now that doesn't seem as likely, although he more than deserves it. Pitt is off the wall hilarious, inventive, wild, thoughtful, and flat out irresistible. This marks a change from his darker performances, like Fight Club or Seven, and his charming performances, like in the Ocean's trilogy and Mr. & Mrs. Smith.<br/><br/>The rest of our cast is exciting as well. George Clooney plays a sort of hybrid of his ladies' man & idiotic characters, though I think the character was more paranoid than stupid. He did a great job as well. John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are great as well, with the latter being lovably hyper and stupid, and the former putting on a great show as far as the humor of insanity goes. Malkovich's understanding of the script and tone of the film is wonderful.<br/><br/>And that's about where my applause for the film stops. There are no technical problems with the film, as it is a well made film, although I felt the film dragged a bit in the beginning, taking far too long to get going. In fact, the plot of the film isn't established until about 35 minutes in, if that. It also felt far too long in terms of runtime, when in reality it was quite short. I also have problems with the predictability of the film, which is unusual considering the film is the brainchild of the Coen Brothers. I successfully predicted plot twists, character deaths, and the overall ending of the film before it happened, and felt a bit of a slap to the face by the ending.<br/><br/>In short, Burn After Reading represents a sprinter running at the top of his game, only to trip and tumble, stopping just short of the finish line. While the acting and idea are nice, in the end, it just didn't do the job as far as keeping me interested and invested in terms of emotion or attention."

There wasn't a single character that I cared anything about. I didn't hate them, like them or have the slightest interest in them. To say the humor was lame would be an understatement. There was no humor. No one was funny. It wasn't even slightly enjoyable. My husband and I endured about half of it and consider it to be time we would have more enjoyably spent having root canal. Sometimes people think ""Wow, if the review is that bad, I want to see for myself if it could possibly be as bad as that."" Don't waste your money. I love movies and see a lot of them.

As usual, the characters are well casted and acted, but they're not nearly as interesting as those in the aforementioned films.<br/><br/>I'm sure that I will be criticized for ""not getting the humor"", but I DO understand what the film was going for. I just wasn't particularly impressed with the end result. Die-hard Coen fans will no doubt love this flick.

"goldwriting","6","4","10","25 September 2008"," Burn After Reading: Coen's Bring Imperfect Wackiness
","As September crosses into the present, film critics and aficionados everywhere begin grinning and twitching in excitement. Oscar movies are officially on their way to the nearest silver screen. With the ribbon of quality content being cut, the first expected contender came from the brotherly duo not unfamiliar with the Oscar machine, the Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan. Fresh off the heels of their Best Directing, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscars last year for No Country for Old Men, the cinematic brothers brought us a new chapter in their visual memoirs, Burn After Reading, a throwback to the darkly humorous days of Fargo, which also won them a Best Original Screenplay statue. Into the mix of directorial style and writing finesse we gained the acting skills of Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton. Frances McDormand is also along for the ride, but she's a Coen staple (and also married to half the duo, Joel Coen). This movie had Oscar potential written all over it, so the only question going in was would it live up to the expectations? SwingÂ…the ball connectsÂ…it's going deepÂ…almost thereÂ…awww. Ground rule double.<br/><br/>This is not an Academy award winning film and certainly not one of their best, but still a nice way to slide into the season of quality content over box office boffo. Burn After Reading is a quirky, silly tale following a disc of information thought to contain CIA secrets from a disgraced and angry analyst (Malkovich), which is found in a local gym and tightly grasped by the hands of a woman (McDormand) desperate for money to cover her plastic surgeries. Mostly what the Coen brothers are known for is the depth and creativity of their characters and this film does well to cover the bases on that point. Frances McDormand plays Linda, a terribly pathetic woman so deathly afraid of aging and the current state of her body that she has blinders on to the rest of the world and the happiness it can offer. She brings the solid level of commitment and shine we've come to know her for. Brad Pitt joins in with what has to be his silliest and least intelligent character to date, Chad, a constantly hyper-active, exercise fanatic who works with Linda at a gym called Hardbodies. I have to imagine this was a fun role for him to play since he hardly gets to let loose like this anymore, not since 12 Monkeys. He provided a lot of the early humor in the film, but also drops one of the biggest plot twists halfway through. Clooney brings to life Harry, a ex-personal bodyguard with a penchant for compulsive lying and an addiction to sex. George only gets to be this wacky under the tutelage of the Coen brothers, so even while it's not his best work by any means, it's a fun reminder that he can indeed get goofy with the rest of the gang. Tilda plays the ice queen wife of Malkovich, while also having an affair with Clooney. Watching her in this role, along with some others, I wonder when her picture will be included in the dictionary next to ""emasculating"". Not to be left out of any discussion about over-the-top characters, Malkovich plays his part to the hilt, but I honestly feel his best moments are in the opening scene. There's not much of an arc for him, so only seeing him come to life early on really provides any surprise and unseen moments.<br/><br/>Burn plays inside the footprints of Fargo, but never quite catches up to it. The Coens obviously know their craft and continue to put material out there with their own voice and character stamp, but this film felt a little like a step back for them. Maybe it was just a way to resettle into the dark comedy they are known for after their detour into heavy drama with No Country. Also running parallel to this is the question of the marketing campaign. Again the trailer was cut in a fashion to show one type of movie, but once you were in the theater it became something different, not wildly so, but still there is a distinct shift in tone from wacky comedy to dark comedy, and sometimes those audiences don't mix well. It's like seeing a trailer for Police Academy and getting Rushmore. Two great tastes that taste awful together.<br/><br/>Recommendation: If you're a devout fan, you've already seen it anyway. If you're on the fence, wait until video. If you're completely on the other side of the fence, you still read this far anyway? I'll take that as a compliment. Thanks. :)"

","The Coen's are creative at conjuring up absurd stories to fascinate us. However, I personally feel that Blood Simple and Fargo are still the best examples of their genius.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is darkly humorous, sarcastic, and, as usual, nihilistic. We clearly understand an underlying premise to the story during the end credits when ""CIA man"" is blurted out in raucous song to celebrate the agency's supposed ineptitude.<br/><br/>It is easy to recognize a liberal slant (not surprising) in the Coen's endeavor to proselytize. In the beginning, a principal character is accused of having a drinking problem. He recoils to his accuser, ""You're a Mormon. Next to you everyone has a drinking problem."" My first thought: How much more that would have gone over if Mitt Romney had been chosen as McCain's running mate for president. Hollywood is now a ""vatican"" for liberal dogma. My philosophy teaches that to change minds, you should not be afraid to step on everyone's toes. The Coens only preach to the choir.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is full of cultural satire, but lacks universal appeal and is arguably less believable than the lunacy found in Dr. Strangelove: a film just as comically stark yet more appealing to young and old audiences.<br/><br/>In any case, this film takes us for an enjoyable ride, but only while it lasts. At the end we want more."
"DICK STEEL","10","5","14","5 October 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Burn After Reading
","Fresh off their triumphant victories with various awards for No Country For Old Men, the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan return to open this year's edition of the Venice Film Festival with a colourful satire in Burn After Reading. Writing this screenplay in between that of No Country's, these two movies couldn't be any more different from each other, one sombre in mood, and this one very much lighter, but no doubt having a chock full of undercurrents flowing throughout its relatively breezy pace.<br/><br/>Watching this movie and sitting through the web of relationships between the characters, would also play on your mind how each of them are linked through six degrees of separation. For instance in Michael Clayton, George Clooney and Tilda Swinton share only one intense scene toward the finale which was quite powerful, but here, they turn into strange bedfellows when their characters Harry and Katie share beds and makes a cuckold out of Katie's husband Osbourne (John Malkovich). Or how the Ocean 11/12/13 collaborators in Clooney and Brad Pitt grace this film by sharing one crucial scene which turns the tide of the mood. It also marks the return of Coen movie regulars Clooney and especially Frances McDomrmand, having roles in Fargo, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona. And that's already discounting future collaborations with Swinton and Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The list goes on to muddle your mind.<br/><br/>I'm still at awe with admiring the Coen's screenplay for Burn After Reading. Characters get so carefully crafted that they're never one dimensional, each with their own load of problems to deal with, and having almost everyone related in some way to another. It begins in a rather mundane fashion with Malkovich's Osbourne being surplus at Langley, before heading home to prepare for a party of sorts with wife Katie, whom we learn is having an affair with Harry. To have a brief introduction of the main players, we have gym personal trainers in Brad Pitt's Chad, whose colleague Linda (Frances) is having a professional and personal crisis in being too old looking for the job, and wanting to undergo a costly plastic makeover.<br/><br/>Throw in some infidelity amongst the characters, and you have a premise set up for pandemonium when Osbourne's memoirs somehow got leaked, and begins as a catalyst for a series of events that will turn everyone's life topsy turvy, bringing out wonderful performances from the ensemble cast. You'll have rug after rug being repeatedly pulled from under your feet by the extremely mischievous screenplay, while on one hand taking its time to build up some strange tension, and on the other just let everything that could turn into comedy, punctuate their way throughout.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic satire on the state of intelligence of the intelligence gatherers and community in general, where troops on the ground get unceremoniously dismissed despite the good work done because they don't know how to play boardroom politics, where people high up the food chain just want to hear what they want to hear, only the good stuff and none of the bullshit problems, making decisions on fanciful whims to nobody's advantage, sweeping aside anything that could be kept in a closet, or swept under the rug. Ordinary folks too were not spared, with the poking of fun in people's fears in the current environment, as well as blowing things way out of proportion, making mountains out of molehills, thinking that there is value in blackmail.<br/><br/>We know how Brad Pitt can turn out some of the most amazing performances. From the brooding cop in Se7en to the crazed inmate in 12 Monkeys and his action-figure role as Achilles in Troy, I'm inclined to say that his innocent gym trainer role here beat them all. As Chad the simpleton, it's just incredible how his little nuances speak volumes, and one of the most memorable scenes involve those where Chad acts out his ""good Samaritan"" role, trying to be more than meets the eye, only to great comical effect. The other role that stood out is George Clooney's Harry, who's somewhat of a sexual predator, and cooking up something that would not look out of place in a typical Wong Jing movie, possibly getting the thumbs up for the most innovative device created.<br/><br/>That said, Burn After Reading is an excellent watch and comes highly recommended. Don't miss this when it gets released this coming week!"

","Something happened to this film. It just fell off a cliff after 1.5 hours. It could have been another great, along the lines of FARGO, but for some reason everything was shut down in a hurry with a seriously compressed critique of the CIA. In fact, until I listened to the lyrics of the song accompanying the credits, I didn't even fully grasp that the Coen brothers actually took themselves to be offering a CIA critique! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the critique of fitness gym culture and internet dating types dominated this film-in-progress. Too bad, for the world could really use a good CIA critique. In fact, there was plenty of time (about thirty minutes) that went unused--everything was abruptly called to a halt. (I am still wondering what the explanation for this was: production deadline? competing projects for Pitt and Clooney? who knows???) What cannot be denied is that this was a missed opportunity to pull all of the loose ends together in such a way so as to have constructed an intelligent farce. <br/><br/>Instead, BURN AFTER READING is a somewhat stupid farce that made fun of people who don't really need help in that regard. Everyone already knows that those people are a bunch of losers. What not everyone knows is what a bunch of losers so-called analysts are. But rather than offering viewers something that they might not already know, the Coen brothers chose in this case to state the obvious--about a thousand times--and then pull the curtain on what could have been an excellent film.

","This is no feel-good movie. It has been compared to the Big Lebowski, which shows similar quirky humor, except there still was some affection for the main protagonists in that story. This is my main concern with Burn After Reading: it has no heart. Why the choleric ex-CIA man has to beat the friend of the misguided woman to pulp will always remain a mystery to me. No happy endings allowed, I guess. This is just a bitter self-righteous farce, well acted and beautifully filmed, but also deeply sad in its hopelessness. Not comparable to O Brother Where Art Thou. I doubt whether I'll ever watch this again. Self-declared aloof intellectuals will probably love it and declare it a masterpiece. In that case, I prefer not to be intellectual."
"MOscarbradley","7","3","7","9 November 2008"," No classic but highly enjoyable nevertheless
","The relative failure of ""Burn After Reading"" after the phenomenal and Oscar-winning success of ""No Country for Old Men"" says more, I think, of audience and critical expectations than it does of the Coens. It will certainly disappoint anyone expecting them to top ""No Country ..."", nor does it measure up to anything like their best work. It may move in much the same ball-park as ""The Big Lebowski"", but without that movie's wit or ingenuity and while the language may lack the consistency of their finer turns of phrase, (a proliferation of profanities is the order of the day here), it's still sharp enough and funny enough to draw you in and keep you entertained. Whether that's down to the Coens or the top-notch cast they've assembled is a moot point. Nevertheless, it remains a highly enjoyable piece of nonsense, splendidly played by splendid players relishing their every corny line.<br/><br/>The plot is one you could write on a pin-head and is daft enough to give the impression it's being made up as you go along. John Malkovitch is a CIA operative who is being put our to pasture. Tilda Swinton is the wife who is divorcing him in favour of George Clooney. Malkovitch is writing his memoirs; Swinton is building up a portfolio of their assets. There is a disc which gets left in a gym and which is found by a very dumb Brad Pitt who automatically assumes it contains state secrets and tries to blackmail Malkovitch. It doesn't! Frances McDormand is involved too, with Pitt in the blackmail scheme, (she's the 'brains' - I don't think so), and romantically with Clooney. A couple of people get killed, shockingly, as violence is something these people seem incapable of, (everyone's too dumb to be violent).<br/><br/>It fairly zips along and like I say, it's splendidly played. By now Clooney has become a first-rate farceur. McDormand has always been a gifted comedienne. Malkovitch goes magnificently over-the-top and Tilda Swinton has a field day playing it mostly straight but with her tongue lodged firmly in her cheek. The real revelation, however, is Brad Pitt as the clumsy blackmailer. In the past Pitt's comic prowess has been somewhat lacking. A continually improving dramatic actor, Pitt has always seemed uncomfortable tackling comedy but here he's on a roll. It takes a keen intelligence to pull off someone as delightfully stupid as Pitt's character, Chad and it's obvious he's having as much fun playing him as we are having watching him.<br/><br/>The film, itself, is no classic, (it's not even classic Coen Brothers), but it's very likable and I have a feeling that it might even improve with age. Aficionados of the Brothers Coen will definitely want to add it to their collection."
"blackburnj-1","8","3","7","19 October 2008"," Strange but satisfying
","The Coen brothers' have recently struck form with their dark, tense and stylish neo-Western ""No Country For Old Men"", which was more in tune with their past films such as ""Blood Simple"". With ""Burn After Reading"", they return to the territory of ""The Big Lebowski"", with a dash of ""Fargo"". This is at times hilarious, suddenly brutal and violent and quite bewildering at points. It is hard to describe the experience of watching this strange cocktail unfurl, but, at the end, it is found to be a satisfying experience.<br/><br/>This film, which is at its heart an absurdist rip-off of spy films, struggles to find itself, initially. It toys around with the idea of being some kind of modern day, mid-life crisis drama, but this jars with these characters who are designed for farce. As a consequence the film is a slow starter, and throughout the film the ""drama"" comes back briefly and never works, except in the case of Richard Jenkins' gym manager, who is truly sympathetic.<br/><br/>After half-an-hour, though, the comedy starts and grows throughout the film. At the head of this is a magnificent performance from Brad Pitt as the idiot Chad. Yes, the character is grotesque and two-dimensional, but it is a brilliant comedy performance with perfect comic timing. The star-filled cast is excellent, though some feel a little constrained (Clooney most obviously). Nevertheless, they and the Coens give this film many memorable moments as the comedy generates from a genre which should be dealing with world powers, where this film is actually concerned with ordinary people doing bizarre things which are, to the outsider, inexplicable. It's all summed up by the brief but memorable appearance of a bewildered J.K. Simmons as a CIA chief. Halfway through he delivers the line ""Report back to me when it makes sense"" and, at the end, he says ""What a Clusterf***"". These, essentially, sum up the film.<br/><br/>As for the Coens, although their script is a little confused, their direction is spot on. From the opening shot to the last, they take the parody of overblown spy films to the extreme. The look, sound and feel of the film are nearly perfect. The zooming in for no reason, the ludicrous music and many other stylistic touches make this highly enjoyable at every turn.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. Not by a long shot. Is it up there with ""Lebowski"" or ""No Country""? No. What is the film then? It is intelligent, bizarre, funny, confused, stylish, confusing, at times brilliant, often strange and a satisfying and enjoyable time at the cinema.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 5"

","I have always been a fan of the Coen brothers, their films always bring a unique idea to the table in a world where bland and repetitive ideas are all too common in cinemas nowadays. This film creates some brilliant characters and produces some hilarious gags and set pieces. It's a clever film at it's heart and requires your full attention throughout to work out who knows about who and what's going on where. Brilliant performances come from Brad Pitt, George Clooney and most notably Frances McDormand, and the Coens once again manage to make a film that is highly enjoyable and definitely worth the admission price.

","Well, I watched the film today, and I guess I will be one of the rare ones on this board that didn't like the movie. <br/><br/>It's a disappointment.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I went to the movie looking for laughs. I didn't get them, so did the rest of the audience in the theater. Brad's character is there to provide some slapstick humor but hey, Brad isn't Jim Carrey and can never be him. He looks awkward in the film sometimes. There are pretty much profanities in the film, the F-word, sexual humor and bad morals etc, but since everyone and everything are so ridiculous and ironic in the film and that profanities are pretty much acceptable in this type of films, so no problems here. It's just that I felt the F-word seems to repeat too frequently that it seemed a little forced and deliberate. The killings are shockers, they are pretty good, it's just that no one laughed. Maybe the audience in the theater where i am in just ""didn't get it"" or maybe it's just that they did not think brutal killings are funny. Period.<br/><br/>The best thing in the film has got to be the couple of scenes of the clueless CIA superior and his subordinate. They are absolutely hilarious. The Russians second them. The score is so ironic when applied to the film. It is pretty helpful to stimulate laughter, it's good. And the trailer has got to be the next best thing. It certainly looks great, it gives away most of the funniest parts in the film and idiotic Brad definitely comes as a surprise and is so much funnier in the trailer than in the film.<br/><br/>On the whole it's still a pretty enjoyable film, though nobody quite get the laughs but at least it sustained my interest because I for one, will want to know what the hell is going on in the film. It's an okay dark comedy, but if you are going for big laughs AND you are the type of person who don't find brutal killings funny no matter how they are carried out, be prepared to be disappointed."

","Another Coen Brothers comedy of who is screwing who? Maybe, but more to the point this is an example of a 90 minute string film, with a missing 30 minuets. Is this flick funny, yes, not as funny all the time, but very funny, at times. It is really a stoner film, disguised as a short FARGO. Too much information is given out without enough, ending plot. The film opens and closes with an aerial view of The Pentagon. Possibly to give an air of finality or complete misunderstanding. The story line is about how so many people, can enjoy being screwed, either from the vantage point of prey or predator. As with all Coen Brother films, this one is full of A-Star Power. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) a philandering husband, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) an exercise employee who is one of Clooney's bed mates. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) a recently unemployed CIA agent who is married to Doctor Katie Cox (Tilda Swanton) who is also screwing Mr. Clooney. Then there is Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) who gets a real screwing by Mr. Clooney, completely by accident. There are many point of view shots in this film, that causes the audience to question, why? Is the audience supposed to view each point of view shot as a separate but very important point in the film, each time this scenario shows itself on screen? One must decide this question for oneself, or maybe just e-mail the Coen Brothers. Seeing the film as a screener, allowed this reviewer not to get screwed, by evening movie prices. My vision and my viewing pleasure of this film were both blurred, after seeing."

"amesherway","8","3","7","16 September 2008"," Not a masterpiece, but hilarious.
","If/when I see Burn After Reading again, I'll make a point to count the number of times the phrase ""what the f**k?!?"" is uttered. These three words basically summarize the ""plot"" as well as the ""point"" of the Coen Brothers' new film, if it can be said to have either (hence the scare quotes). It's like a farce of old, characters constantly acting at cross-purposes (intentionally or unintentionally), confusing each other and themselves, foiling allies, helping foes, and everyone sleeping with each other.<br/><br/>As the CIA Superior instructs the officer briefing him of the situation says, ""Well... report back to me when any of it makes sense."" The movie feels like less of a finished masterpiece like No Country for Old Men, Fargo, or even The Big Lebowski, and more like the Coen bros. just got high one Saturday afternoon and decided, ""hey man, let's call over some friends and make a freakin movie man. let's just do it. I'll get a keg, you call George."" And the film does feature a number of Coen frequent fliers-- George Clooney and Frances McDormand most notably. Much has been made of the film's ""frivolous"" nature in critical reviews, and while in one sense I agree, on the other hand I'd ask what's so wrong with frivolity. The film is hilarious.<br/><br/>The cast is fabulous and makes the ridiculous morass of a plot work; McDormand as a gym employee obsessed with financing a set of cosmetic surgeries and John Malkovich as a hot-headed recently-unemployed intelligence agent are particularly funny. Much has been made of Brad Pitt's turn as a beautiful dumb-as-a-doornail fitness trainer and, while he is funny, it's tough to compete with the likes of Malkovich and McDormand. That's not to say he doesn't have moments of being really quite funny, but it comes off once or twice as being just-ever-so-slightly overplayed.<br/><br/>I think what I liked most about Burn After Reading was the fact that it was so much of a classical farce, but made postmodern (that's right, I said po-mo) by the fact that the characters constantly call attention to the farce with the aforementioned ""what the f**k?!?"" A number of characters say this over and over again, especially the CIA Superior, and given the weird-and-getting-weirder events of the film, it's a natural question to ask. But usually it's the job of the audience to ask such questions; here, the film points out its own absurdity. And I like that. I also like that even though we get attached to the characters, we don't really care that much when most of them die by the end. But what kind of tragic-comic farce would it be if they didn't? Anyway, it's a fun ride, and after No Country for Old Men, I can see how the Coen Brothers needed a little frivolity. It's not a masterpiece, but it's solid entertainment with a pleasing dose of self-consciousness."
"bkimbrell0","7","3","7","14 September 2008"," Burn After Reading
","Ever since 1984, the Coen brothers have made a career out of portraying naive characters caught in a tangled web of deceit, adultery, jealousy, ignorance, corruption, and stupidity, finding themselves in way over their heads, and typically resulting in their grisly deaths. Burn After Reading is no exception. The tone of this film is dramatically different than last year's spectacular No Country for Old Men, and many people expecting more of the same will inevitably be disappointed by this film. Before viewing this film, you should abandon all preconceived notions you may have based on the extremely misleading trailer, and simply walk into the theater prepared for a little bit of escapism. This film is not designed to be a serious masterpiece; that's not what it's after. Burn After Reading takes quite a while to rev up, and, quite frankly, the beginning feels very un-Coen-esquire and disappointing. Once Frances McDormand appears on the screen, the film begins to show it's potential. As it progresses, it becomes exponentially more original and involving, and four of the characters here do manage to shine, albeit some taking longer than others to do so.<br/><br/>The crux of the story centers around some gym workers who discover the personal writings and personal information of a CIA analyst recently forced into early retirement. The gym workers naturally assume they've stumbled upon classified material, and attempt to blackmail the analyst, setting off a wacky chain of events in which the ignorant blackmailers find themselves in way over their heads, dragging others into the situation, with inevitably disastrous consequences for all involved. The aforementioned four characters are played by Frances McDormand as a self-conscious gym trainer, Brad Pitt as her flamboyant and surprisingly un-annoying coworker, Richard Jenkins as the shy gym manager, and George Clooney in a strangely amusing role where no occupation seems to be required. Many of the other actors involved fall flat most of the time, including the usually good Tilda Swinton, whose two-dimensional character I could not appreciate very much. John Malkovich has an interesting role as the CIA analyst, but I feel they could have done so much more with this character; his last appearance in this film shows off this character's potential very well, it's just too bad that's his only great moment.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading portrays every last one of its characters as leading secret lives, driven by lustful and greedy intentions, manipulating those around them, and generally making life difficult for everyone involved in this tangled web. The film interestingly clues its audience in to the major points of the plot, such that we know what the main characters do not for the majority of the time, but interestingly throws in some side plots in which we, as audience members, are totally clueless. While these side gags are often rich in suspense, their payoffs are a mixed bag, serving primarily as distractions, though at times hilarious ones.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, this film is largely designed to be ""fun,"" and makes NO promise that it will be this year's Oscar winner for Best Picture. Could it be? To me it's highly unlikely, unless the Academy is so enamored of the Coen brothers that they fail to recognize that this film is nowhere near as involving as No Country for Old Men, and that the plot, dialogue, characters, and setting is nowhere near as inspired as that in Fargo. But you have to hand it to the Coen brothers for having the courage to have a little fun once in a while. The last line in the film sums up the ambiguity of this film perfectly. I can give this film a recommended viewing, but just note that my recommendation is not as enthusiastic as it could be. If you read this review and think it sounds like a film you would be interested in, by all means go and watch it in theaters.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"megatom5","8","3","7","13 September 2008"," A great Coen Brother Comedy
","I saw this film opening night. I had pretty high expectation of this film and it honestly lived up to it. Every character is played to a T, and the no nonsense directing only helps propel the film. To begin with something must be said about Brad Pitt's performance of Chad, the very ignorant yet ever energetic gym trainer. This is easily one of Pitt's funniest performance, and one of my favorites as it drops the usual weight attached to most of his leading roles. This brings me to the next great thing about this film, each of the stars gets about equal screen time, there really isn't a 'supporting' actor in this. George Clooney is equally as entertaining as the playboy adulterer. Frances Mcdormand is as charismatic in this as she was in Fargo, it's good to see her with the Coen's again. The Coen's directing in this is one of the best things about it, the shots and the music are all done as if it were a serious spy drama, which of course it isn't. What this creates is a brilliant spoof of the spy genre, not in an over the top sort of way but with subtlety. IF you are a Coen's fan see this. While it's not as outrageous of their comedy magnum opus The Big Labowski, it is on par with their other comedy effort such as O' Brother and Raising Arizona."

","After a disc containing the memoirs of a recently fired CIA analyst ends up in the hands of two dim wits who work at a gym, they go around trying to sell it thinking it contains important classified CIA stuff.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers are taking a different shift from last years highly praised ""No Country For Old Men"" and going back into their comedy genre in which they seem to excel at. Here is a film that is full of characters that do stupid things, at yet we still seem to like them. Even when they are hacking away at other people. While ""Burn After Reading"" is a decent film, the entire project feels rushed and the ending too forced. It's as if they had no other way of ending the film, so they tack on the wrap up job.<br/><br/>The film opens with the firing of John Malkovich, because he seems to be an alcoholic. We are introduced to his wife, Tilda Swinton, who is having an affair with George Clooney. Clooney is also married, but is not satisfied with just those two women, so he begins dating Francis Macdormand. She has been trying to find love online with no luck. Her co-worker, Brad Pitt, finds the disc with the CIA stuff and they both begin to blackmail Malkovich. Somehow these stories intertwine with each other in a dark and humorous manner.<br/><br/>Everyone involved seems to be having fun. Brad Pitt and George Clooney are specially funny in their roles. One as a young, gum-chewing, doofus. The other as a paranoid treasurer who decides to build a very unique chair. Both Clooney and Pit are playing against type. Which is nice to see from such big A list actors, in a comedy anyway.<br/><br/>McDormand is another one to watch. She seems to slide into this role perfectly, nailing every bit of dialogue that comes out of her mouth. It seems natural, even though most of the dialogue is not. Malkovich is the alcoholic CIA analyst who is mentally breaking down. Losing his job, cheating wife and other things. This character is dragged through the mud until he decides to explode. Malkovich plays it with a sense of integrity. An upper class way of presenting himself, much like how he portrayed himself in ""Being John Malkovich."" Tilda Swinton seems to have the cold hearted bitch role down pat.<br/><br/>For those expecting a laugh out loud comedy, you'll be really disappointed. ""Burn After Reading"" is a slow moving film. It wasn't until half way through did it really start to kick up and peak my interest. There are a couple bits that are really funny, and others then just seem out of place. Don't expect it all to but fluffy funny stuff, this is a dark film. It is a Coen film after all.<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons has a small role as a CIA supervisor who has no idea as to what is going on with these character. The audience feels the same way. While it's not entirely hard to follow, some people may have some problems with it. I guess that could have been there intention, especially with how they ended the film.<br/><br/>While ""Burn After Reading"" is good, it's not Coen good and that may disappoint some fans. But the film is basically about stupid people doing stupid things, done in an intelligent way. The film has a few surprises, I was caught off guard at least twice. I just hope they put more time and effort into their next project."

I viewed it, and them, as good examples of why the founding fathers started a revolution in the first place.<br/><br/>The film was numbingly pompous and smug along with the viewing audience. It begins with a satellite view of DC. ""Wow!"", the viewers and directors thought, ""This is what DC looks like from a satellite! We're COOL!"" Like they never used google maps before. It went downhill from there (for me at least.) The actors were all A-list but tragically, weren't acting. Or in the case of Brad Pitt, just acted BADLY. He was awful and unconvincing and his accent was so fake (whatever accent he was trying to make, perhaps southern?) that his character appeared mentally retarded. Maybe that's what he was going for but it only appeared to be a mentally retarded actor portraying someone stupid.<br/><br/>Malkovich is a splendid actor who, like Eastwood and Schwartzenneggar, used their typecasting to fit into roles that audiences loved to see again and again. The problem with this spy film was that he was so typecast into such a predictable role, he didn't even need to say his lines. They could have been read off by a Malkovich impersonator which is what he seemed to be portraying.<br/><br/>And perhaps that's the problem with the film: It was a bunch of actors given too much free rein to rest on their laurels or ad-lib that it made me question if a director was there who cared about the performances or if they just left the actors and cameramen to do as they pleased. It's funny sometimes in comedy where there's a good premise, but this one didn't have it.<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing new here. NOTHING. Big name actors. Check. Spy plot. Check. Cool street scenes to prove it was filmed in DC. Check. Yawn.<br/><br/>At least with Battlefield Earth, the awfulness was spontaneous in it's own way. ""Here's a rat for you to eat, Human.""

","Burn After Reading is a black comedy film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film stars George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The movie begins with CIA agent Osborne Cox losing his job. This prompts his long-suffering, unfaithful wife to consult a lawyer about divorcing him. Osborne decides to write a book about his exploits, but an early draft of his work ends up lost at a gym where it's found by the dim- witted Chad, and the plastic-surgery obsessed Linda. They decide to blackmail Osborne in order to help Linda pay for the numerous procedures she wants to undergo. Things grow even more complicated when Linda starts an affair with Harry, who also happens to be sleeping with Cox's wife.Two days later at the CIA headquarters, an official named Palmer and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. They are perplexed and decide to maintain observation until the situation ""makes sense.""Harry, increasingly anxious after killing a man he believes was a government spy, gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. After tackling him to the ground, Harry finds out that the man is a process server tasked with giving him divorce papers from his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel), who is having an extramarital liaison of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides in Harry that her friend Chad is missing; he agrees to try to help find him.The next morning, Harry and Linda meet in a park, and she provides him with more information about Chad's disappearance. When Harry realizes that Chad is the man he killed, he flees in terror, assuming Linda is also a spy. Linda then turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her. Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad, he agrees to go to the Cox home to search Osbourne's computer. Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat, Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that his wife has emptied his bank accounts, and, no longer having keys, decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie's lover and fires a gunshot at him. Ted manages to get out of the house, only to be fatally attacked by a hatchet-wielding Osbourne. At CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened. It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela, Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list, Chad's body has been disposed of and the CIA are holding Linda who is promising to keep quiet about everything if they will pay for her cosmetic surgery. A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his hatchet assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma. The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela, mistakenly saying that the US has no extradition treaty with Venezuela, decides the CIA will pay for Linda's surgery and postpones considering Osbourne's situation until he regains consciousness, which is not likely. The director tells Palmer that they did not really learn anything.<br/><br/>This is a quirky tale of lust, greed, vanity, idiocy and ineptitude that spreads its giggly ripples through the bureaucratic buildings and leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C. But nevertheless,the Coen Brothers have crafted another clever comedy/thriller with an outlandish plot and memorable characters.The acting was excellent. Frances McDormand,who got a Golden Globe nomination,should have been nominated for an Academy Award for she was great and outstanding.

There is sex obsessed paranoid government agent (Clooney), totally stupid but quite kind sport lover (Pitt), women who just wants the plastic surgery (McDormand), revenge seeking adulterous wife (Swinton) and self obsessed close minded ex CIA agent (Malkovich). All begins when Malkovich is fired form CIA and takes some documents with him to help him write his memoirs. His wife steals them to help her in divorce, but attorney's secretary looses them, and around those documents everything unfolds. All in all this is a very entertaining comedy if you like a black humor go for it."

","Burn After Reading was an okay film in some regards. The plot was very intricate and thought out, and the film had a lot of potential, but I personally thought it fell a bit short in actually delivering what it could have.<br/><br/>The characters weren't very well-developed. Compared to the Coen Brothers other movies, in particular the Big Lebowski, most of the characters in Burn After Reading (especially Osborne Cox) didn't get enough time on the screen for their character to blossom. Instead, it's like we just caught a glimpse into the characters without actually understanding every little nuance of them.<br/><br/>Also, there were a few scenes which weren't filmed but mentioned in the scenes where the two CIA officers discuss the situation as it is unfolding. Some of these scenes, such as Pfarrer's flight to Venezuela and Cox's pseudo-death could have made for very interesting scenes, but were simply ignored outside of casual references at the end. Like I said earlier too, a lot of the characters seemed underdeveloped, and quite a few extra scenes could have definitely been scripted.<br/><br/>That leads me to the script, which wasn't that great. It had its moments that were okay, but in general the script didn't have the same uniqueness of other Coen Brothers films. It lacked a lot of their originality and quirkiness, and really I can't think of any truly great quotes from it the same way as I can films like the Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>In short, the plot was sort of quirky and funny; the script and characters had the potential to be so, but in the end they just weren't. After watching it, I feel like I tuned in late and missed part of the film or just saw a really long trailer. I don't feel like I really saw a completed Coen Brothers film."

","In Washington, D.C., a group of seemingly unrelated characters and a tangle of subplots makes for an entertaining, if lightweight, star-studded comedy with tragic overtones. A CIA man (John Malkovich) gets fired while his wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with a playboy (George Clooney); an insecure woman (Frances McDormand) and her dippy co-worker (Brad Pitt) find the CIA man's memoir and try to peddle it to the Russians.<br/><br/>This film has all the delightful earmarks of a typical Coen Brothers film: It's full of ordinary, somewhat dim characters, greed has a major role, the dialogue is often hysterically funny, and things get quickly out of hand and disaster ensues. The casting is typically odd; Clooney is made out to be a pretentious and rather unsavory guy despite his charisma and Pitt is a foolish simpleton. McDormand is wonderful as the naive middle-ager who gets mixed up in international affairs, and Malkovich is manic and off-kilter as usual.<br/><br/>It's all chaotic and weird, silliness gone wild that is fun to watch but soon forgotten."

No reason to go into the plot because basically there is no plot. The acting is nothing short of sensational, even the bit players. Brad Pitt is a stand out. Who knew!! He is becoming a great character actor despite his great looks. Let's have more like this for him. The only shortcoming is that certain scenes seemed to end on the cutting room floor or perhaps were not filmed. They should have been to fill out some of the holes, but nonetheless, no biggie.

The interpersonal dishonesty between most of the characters further complicates this leads to a very complex turn of events. Overall this is what makes the movie a complex collage of darkly humorous events that the Coen brothers have been known for. This is done without repetitive plot forms.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","15 January 2020"," Sometimes a bit all over the place, but funny nonetheless
","""Burn After Reading"" is an American movie from 2008, so slightly older then a decade, and this is another film by Joel and Ethan Coen, who certainly have their safe spot among my most favorite directors. And writers. It is not one of their best-received films, but this does not mean in any way that it isn't a good watch. To describe it accurately, you could say their best is simply marvellous and their weakest is still decent. And I agree with the critics here: This is a decent film from beginning to end in its under 100 minutes. The only perspective from which you can see it maybe slightly disappointing is if you compare it to ""A Serious Man"", the film they made after this one and funnily for this one here they got an all-star cast (and I like pretty much all of them), while ASM has almost no famous actors in it at all. But we talked about that one already, so let's take a closer look at ""Burn After Reading"". I will spare you the names and just say that (if Pitt succeeds this year, which seems fairly safe) there are 5 acting Oscar winners in the cast here. Add to that talented actors like Malkovich and Jenkins and House of Cards fans will also get to see a familiar face here. This is a comedy. It is pretty dark at times and also quite violent here and there, but in the end it is really all about how much this film will make you laugh. And it made me laugh quite a bit. It is pretty impressive how the Coens are such good writers that they even get away easily with how much everybody here in this film is over-the-top. This includes Frances McDormand (still married to one of the brothers), who scored a Golden Globe nomination for her performance here. The other was for the film itself. Tilda Swinton was nominated for a BAFTA and that shows how much they love her because honestly this was maybe slightly too much praise. The other BAFTA nomination went to Brad Pitt and that one I kinda second. He was hilarious in how he portrayed this really simple dude, who still does not seem to be a bad guy, even if he joins in when they start this blackmail idea. It's all coordinated by McDormand's character I'd say though. So Pitt's character really does not do anything too evil here except mmaybe what he does to the guy with the butt issues in the very first scene. So hanging around with McDormand's character, who goes by the somehat funny name of Linda Litzke here may not be the very best idea. Richard Jenkins' character can tell a story too at the end about that. I must say she was entertaining, but also really unlikable to me with her shallowness about these operations and also about other people. I mean sure she cries when worried about Pitt's character, who is definitely her friend, but at the end we find out again that she is fine and really only thinks about her plastic surgery, so that is a bit of a happy ending for her character. However, only for her character pretty much you could say because the circle closes there when it comes to these surgery references and where we see her in her first scene.<br/><br/>This first scene also includes a doctor and once again the Coens show they are the masters in making minor characters seem fun and interesting. Characters who only appear once or twice. The doctor is one example. Another example would be the greedy stone-cold lawyer in his scene with Tilda Swinton. Now he is the only character probably colder than hers in this movie, although you don't know too much about J.K. Simmons' character for example because he only shows up in two scenes, but there he is a total riot and among the very best the film had to offer that it is almost a pity that he is not featured more prominently in here. These two scenes were also an interesting inclusion from the story-telling perspective because they take a rather unusual approach and it is a bit of narration about what happened to all the characters before we see them again or even as a final conclusion at the very end. Great way to end a film. Apart from these, my favorite parts were all in the first half hour I guess. The beginning with Malkovich, Swinton and Clooney was pretty great, also stay that way when the film moves towards the ""blackmailers"" and that phone conversation between the duo and Malkovich's character in the middle of the night was really laugh-out-loud funny too. Sadly, afterwards the film loses a bit of its touch and turns out to be all over the place. Of course, there are still fun scenes like those involving the Russians or those linked to Clooney's paranoia. Only because you're paranoid does not mean they are not after you or how did the saying go? It is definitely really true in this film. Oh yeah, the guy Clooney's character catches eventually is also a really funny one-scene inclusion. I should not forget about him. Pitt and Clooney, still two of the biggest stars now, do not really share much screen time together, but the one moment they do, it is among the most thrilling the film has to offer. Now that went all kinds of wrong there. Not just for Pitt's. Clooney manages to calm himself down again and catch a breath, but when he finds out who he shot near the end when talking to McDormand's character, he goes completely nuts. I take it though for that hilarious Venezuela mention during the epilogue. Another one who goes completely nuts here is Malkovich and I think maybe his character was the one that required the best performance and it was fairly challenging, but he did a good job like everybody else. Okay I think this is how I will end the review now. There were moments that did not do too much for me like the application in the cellar, but for its absurdity it still worked somehow, or that for once the music in a Coen Brothers movie was not even remotely memorable. It's still a good film though, how could it not be with Lubezki in charge of the cinematography for example. And what was up with that Mulroney running gag tribute? Haha that came out of nowhere for sure. Shame that by now he is not known enough anymore for the other audience members in my showing to catch this one. Overall, I give the film a thumbs-up. Worth seeing, but probably not the best choice if you want to start exploring the magnificant body of work by these two directors."

","I watched ""Burn after Reading"" when it first came out and remember thinking how funny and clever it was; however, for me, a decade later it just doesn't seem as special, unlike say ""Fargo"" by the Coen brothers. ""Burn after Reading"" is still much better than most films, but now it seems to meander too much, move in fits and starts, and just generally doesn't seem to flow very well. Again, I don't want to say it's not a fun movie, since the Coen brothers on their worst day are miles ahead of Michael Bay on his best, but it just isn't up there with their best work. Still, I get very tired of special effects driven films, and thankfully this is nothing like that at all. I suppose you could say its absence of a strong plot is part of its plot, which you'll understand after you watch this film. I'm still giving it seven stars, although that's probably a little bit of a stretch. I encourage anybody who wants to watch an odd movie to give this one a shot. But I really do mean an odd, kind of formless film--art mimicking life, I guess."

","Back in 2008 this film was really a fun engaging thriller/black comedy. Brad Pitt and JK Simmons especially were hysterical and fun. The labyrinth of a plot was a great send-up of thrillers and kept you guessing how it would end. Add in the Coen Brother's attention to detail and the rest of the performances this was a comedic thrill ride. But time has been extremely kind to the film.<br/><br/>Osbourne Cox, played with the right tone of condescending hubris by Malkovich, is the sort of petty incompetent jerk that unfortunately has worked his way into the public consciousness. Indeed, the general idiocy of the characters capture the beguiling mixture of malice and stupidity that is the hallmark of this era. These characters are easy to understand in their psychological drives and if they weren't so damaged, short sighted, and small they would not put into these traps of their own making. The film's commitment to giving characters what they *don't* deserve-the worst character gets what they want, the best character absolutely doesn't-ring extremely true of the current situation.<br/><br/>This film is so funny at pointing out how stupid we are it hurts."

","The Coen brothers Joel and Ethan put their distinctive comic spin on the spy genre with ""Burn After Reading"". Although it's not quite as good as ""Fargo"" or ""Raising Arizona"" in this viewers' humble opinion, it's still funny enough and smart enough to qualify as a good time. It works because its characters are clueless and naive and totally out of their depth, and it's fun watching a bunch of talented stars play these grasping bozos.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt play Linda and Chad, two schmucks who work at a gym called Hardbodies. One day, the janitor finds a disc in a locker room that turns out to have VERY mildly interesting stuff on it. As it turns out, this disc contains the memoirs of a disgruntled CIA agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich). Linda and Chad figure to capitalize on this find somehow, but their plans go awry. Meanwhile, womanizing Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney) manages to fool around with both Linda and Osbornes' fed-up wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>It's a testament to the abilities of this cast that ""Burn After Reading"" is as entertaining as it is, but the script by the Coens was already pretty amusing. One has to wonder how fools like Linda (who's desperate to ""improve"" her appearance with a series of plastic surgeries) and Chad can possibly extricate themselves from this mess into which they've placed themselves. And Harry has his own problems. Not only has he obsessed over creating his own hilarious gadget, but he ends up faced with a problem that completely unnerves him since he presumably had quite the ""safe"" career. (He claims he's never had cause to draw his weapon.)<br/><br/>Clooney and especially Pitt are hilarious. Malkovich does a lot of yelling in an amusingly unsympathetic role. McDormand is a delight. And Richard Jenkins, Elizabeth Marvel (as Harry's wife, a successful author), David Rasche, J.K. Simmons, Olek Krupa, J.R. Horne, and Jeffrey DeMunn add to the hilarity with their expert performances.<br/><br/>Everything leads to a priceless series of revelations / resolutions dictated to us by Rasche, and Simmons' reactions in this finale are simply great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good comedy that is well worth a look.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

Needless to say, most of the funny material of this movie was shown in the trailer.

I think some people may have been let down by ""Burn"" because they expected another Oscar film, but these people missed the point.<br/><br/>The plot is so intertwined (not unlike past Coen films, like ""The Big Lebowski"") that trying to figure out what's going on and who is working for who is half the fun. And every character has their idiosyncrasies, making them each unique and funny in their own way. Being able to write such a script and plot is a gift, and the fact they've done this successfully multiple times really makes me feel that the Coens are going to go down as some of the greatest creators of their generation.<br/><br/>Fans of ""The Big Lebowski"" will like this one. The style is similar, and the cast is amazing: Pitt, Clooney and Malkovich? You really have to be a cynical person to not be interested in this one."

","OK, the film is not as bad as the summary heading would suggest, but this is still pretty tepid fare from filmmakers from whom we have come to expect more.<br/><br/>Two fitness trainers come upon a forgotten CD-R containing what they believe to be classified information. They set about blackmailing the author, CIA black sheep Cox, who quickly realises they are out of their depth and allows his own demons to wreak vengeance on these ill-prepared charlatans. Meanwhile Cox's wife is at it with his sex-obsessed best mate.<br/><br/>It's all very convoluted and tawdry, but it doesn't matter, because the bottom line is - there is no one to like in this film. The writers, the directors, the actors - no one goes out of their way to create an ounce of empathy for any one of the God-forsaken beings who inhabit this narrative. The Hardbodies manager comes closest, but even he is so wimpy and unassertive that his demise barely registers. Pitt and Clooney are clearly in contempt of the men they portray. They have enough craft to cruise through the role, but their attitude towards the men they represent is contemptible.<br/><br/>It is all very amusing, slick and fast-paced, but in the words of the final on-screen character - what did we learn? His answer is: Not to do it again. I hope the Coens were listening."

","Burn after Reading while it may not be the Coen's best effort, succeeds and hits all the right spots. A highly likable dark comedy with an intricate web of storyline and chock-full of hilarious and delightful characters makes this film a winner. It couldn't have been better with the Coen's on board, a saucy, stylish dark comedy that delivers all the punches and succeeds with the narrative and character development. The acting is superb from frequent Coen collaborators Frances McDormand and George Clooney to explosive and charming performances from John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Although if you sum it all up, you'll find that the plot is basically just an excuse for a movie about nothing but the Coen's made it seem like it is about a lot of things. As JK Simmons' character said in the end, ""what a clusterf-ck""."

","This is in my mind the perfect companion to ""No country...."" It is a bleak statement about the complete and utter lack of intellect in American society nicely wrapped as a comedy and so pretty subversive. Every character in the movie with few exceptions is self obsessed, only vaguely aware of others, and determined to get their share. People strive in vain with vain motives.<br/><br/>One thing I did not quite get was that stylistically the film was rooted in the 1980's early 90's most of the cars looked about 15 years old, the hairstyles, decor, the phones and clothing looked rather dated. The Russian embassy was a concrete slab and the Russian characters all wore ill fitting suits typical of that era.<br/><br/>The one somewhat decent and rational person in the movie who appears not to greedy motives meets an untimely end while trying to be helpful. The one ""winner"" in the events who essentially wins by accident due as much to the ineptitude of others as his/her own efforts seems so typically embody the stupidity of desire and how that can ruin others around them.<br/><br/>All in all an interesting morality tale that falls on the side of amorality and chaos. I always like Cohen brothers' films even when they are sub-par since they are generally better than most of the crap movie goers are offered."

","I have now seen 8 Coen films to date and would not profess myself a major Coen fan. I was baffled by No Country for Old Men, I fell in love with Oh Brother Where Art Thou, I watched the cult status behind Big Lebowski and Fargo grow from the sidelines, I enjoyed Intolerable Cruelty, and I lost my faith in the brothers with Ladykillers and Man Who Wasn't There.<br/><br/>As you can see, it's an up and down relationship that I've had with their films, and was hesitant to log in an 8th Coen outing (I feel 7 is more than enough films to see of a director you're not crazy about) but couldn't resist the bizarre-sounding plot and the idea of seeing Brad Pitt go into full comic mode. And I thoroughly loved the film.<br/><br/>For one thing, I'm a native of D.C. and the Coens have a great sense of place in their films: the superficiality of sunny Hollywood in Intolerable Cruelty, the bible-belt-based bluegrass-churning populist Southern Charm in Oh Brother Where Art Thou, and the quirkiness of the Minnesota cold in Fargo. I can't tell you how great the reception was in D.C. where we might not see these things as that far-fetched: beauracrats (in the form of JK Simmons) making decisions about what to do when people are getting killed and secrets are being spilt out to other nations on the basis of what takes the least paperwork and allocating $50,000 for a random lady's plastic surgery for virtually no reason at all.<br/><br/>The plot is truly screwball and does a far better job of past Coen films at raising the ante in the third act so that we're invested to see what deliciously improbable ways the screenwriters will tie up the loose ends. It also doesn't help that some of the protagonists are actually likable: Brad Pitt as the airhead exercise junkie who's as faithful a friend as they come, Frances McDormand as the gym worker who just wants to look pretty, Richard Jenkins as the poor schlub who likes her, etc."

","A good movie. A clever movie. A great movie? No way. Not even close. The movie has a muddled story and is not particularly humorous. BUT there is one aspect of this movie that saves it from DVD oblivion - the stellar performance of John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich makes this movie work. He is actually FUNNY. This cannot be said for the other performers. Was Frances McDormand funny? NO. Brad Pitt? NO. By the way, he was not the Brad Pitt of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Troy, two movies in which he excelled. Brad Pitt playing a buffoon is an example of flagrant miscasting. Nevertheless the actors give strong performances and the story does offer an interesting take on the nature of bureaucracy and human irrationality. There are movies in which casting top stars as goofy, cartoon-like characters work, but this is not one of those movies. Casting Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, Bill Murray, Jack Black, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, or Steve Carell as buffoons can generate laughs with the right material but comedic acting can fall flat with the wrong cast and in this movie, with the exception of Mr. Malkovich, it falls flat."

THAT movie was classic and almost cult worthy. Compare this movie to ""Intolerable Cruelty"" ... a nice, fat piece of crap.<br/><br/>BRAD PITT: SUCH a talented guy using his skills to portray a character of no interest whatsoever. Maybe the gay community will chuckle... a little. But for the rest of us who remember Fight Club as well as his fantastic performance in Snatch ... we will all be very saddened by this.<br/><br/>summery of Pitt: Is he dead to us now? Has he now gone the way of the mighty Tom Cruise? From this movie I would say he has.<br/><br/>George Clooney: You think to yourself, ""Is there a better movie than Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" or Oceans 11 and that in itself make you fork out money for this dog dropping of a movie. And we feel so betrayed. Oh, George, you're smarter than this.<br/><br/>George's character is also shallow and silly. The Olympic committee gives Georges character a 2.3 difficulty for performance. George, like Brad, did a great job... but that's like saying you or I got 100% on a 3rd grade math test.<br/><br/>Summery of Clooney: Read the scripts, Georgey, BEFORE you agree to do 'em.

It was like watching Michael Jordon playing basketball with the Wissoogal (sp?), AK girls basketball team. A genius surrounded by the inept.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this script killed any late-in-life heroics Johnny boy could have possible mustered up.<br/><br/>There were others lesser names in this film and suffice it to say they all did a fine job.

IOW, my garbage men are great guys, but they'll never set themselves apart by emptying rubbish. Actors: Good. Script: Trash.<br/><br/>I can't believe I spent money on that thing. I have buyer's remorse. This movie is NOT good enough to hit up on a $1 Red Box Video but IS good enough to watch if you download it as a torrent. IOW, if it's free and you can be totally comfortable watching it and not required to pay too close attention (let's see, free, comfy and multiprocessing... perfect) then yeah, why the heck not.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Save your money.

","Burn After Reading is a very funny Coen Brothers movie that is far more meaningful than their last film, the Best Picture winning film No Country For Old Men.<br/><br/>Beginning with a cosmic zoom into the CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA. and ending the same way after some 90 odd minutes, Burn After Reading takes us on a screwball adventure of mistaken motives, extortion and a desperate need for plastic surgery. And since this is a Coen Brothers film, I do mean 90 ""odd"" minutes.<br/><br/>Set in Washington in the here and now, (with one exception), we remain in the DC area and as everyone knows, Washington is a town that fairly runs on paranoia, secrecy and convoluted plots. That's also true of Hollywood and Wall Street, but at least the citizens of DC can pretend they are performing a public service, when they are really just running around on fool's errands.<br/><br/>The plot starts when Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a mean and inept drunkard who mans the Balkan's Desk at the CIA is demoted for his alcohol problem. Angry, vengeful and raging impotently, Cox decides to write a tell-all book about his experiences with the CIA. The fact that he had a very low security clearance, was never privy to any important top secrets and knows nothing of any value to anyone does not occur to him.<br/><br/>Simultaneously with this, Osborne's wife Katie, played by an icy/hot Tilda Swinton is planning to divorce him and she has been surreptitiously gathering information about Cox's true financial health so she can be sure to get a proper settlement after they divorce.<br/><br/>Then, through some plot complications too difficult to recap, a computer disc of Cox's financial information is found on the floor of a local gym where the plastic surgery obsessed Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), and an empty-headed gym-bunny named Chad (Brad Pitt) make the fateful decision to use the information on the disc to extort money from Cox; a plan which fails abysmally.<br/><br/>Still needing money for her elective surgery, Katie along with Chad then decide (rather rashly) to take the disc to the Russian Embassy in the hopes they will pay for the information. Which turns these two fitness trainers into ""Persons Of Interest"" to the CIA.<br/><br/>Those two separate plot points are the engines that propel Burn After Reading and both are based on the seemingly conflicting desires of revenge and self-improvement. But, as is typical of the Coen Brothers, the simplest of plans frequently go spectacularly awry. Don't worry if you lose track of the plot. As you will discover, with most Coen Brothers films, following the characters is more important than following the story line.<br/><br/>For example, John Malkovich is perfectly unlikable as the bitter CIA man, but we soon conclude that he has never really been on top of anything in his life, which is why he treats Brad Pitt so abominably.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is thoroughly believable as the kind of woman who can't see how beautiful she is and acts as if a tummy tuck and breast augmentation are the magic bullets that will solve her persistent loneliness. But, McDormand's character is so self-absorbed she doesn't even notice that Ted (Richard Jenkins), her boss at the gym is in love with her and is secretly pained when he discovers that she's in trouble.<br/><br/>But it's Brad Pitt who made the film for me. Whether he was stretching a gym patron's legs to the point where the guy's ligaments snap or just chewing gum and listening to his I-Pod while car dancing; being a complete featherbrain has never looked so sexy.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Pitt is surveying Malkovich's Georgetown house when he notices some suspicious people going in and out of the house, coupled with another car down the road with a driver who also seems to be spying on Malkovich. <br/><br/>As Pitt tries to process this information, you can literally see the wheels of his tiny brain grinding as he tries to formulate a theory about what he is witnessing, but his skull is as empty as a helium filled balloon. He is the living, breathing incarnation of a ""himbo"" if ever I saw one, sporting a body that's a perfect 10, but an IQ in the negative numbers<br/><br/>Since this is a Coen Brothers movie, you can expect some serious violence. Interestingly, most of the violence is perpetrated on the nicest and most naive of characters. Initially, I felt that the Coen Brothers had irreparably damaged this film by the inclusion of such violence against a major character we have come to like, but by the finale, considering the sheer ludicrousness of the whole story, I was smiling again. <br/><br/>While all this other stuff is happening, there are some senior intelligence analysts at the CIA, keeping tabs on the people in this story and they are trying to make sense of it all, but they can't. This is where you should invoke Occam's Razor. Of course these CIA guys can't find a plot or pattern, because there isn't one.<br/><br/>We live in a phenomenological world, where random things occur and are often not connected except by the most coincidental of tangents. Yet, because of our innate ability at pattern recognition, we humans can convince ourselves that all kinds of unconnected coincidences are meaningful. I hate the clichÃ© of the weak-minded that claims, ""Everything happens for a reason"". Because in truth, not everything is connected. Some things happen for no rhyme or reason. <br/><br/>Generally speaking, you should never believe there is some kind of conspiracy going on when ordinary stupidity and fecklessness is more than adequate to explain phenomenon. That is the ultimate message of Burn After Reading and it is a good message, and although it may be too bleak for some people to grasp, that doesn't make it any less true."

","When you watch a movie and don't understand what it's about, you might just be stupid. When it's clear the folks who made the movie don't understand what it's about, that's when the viewer is better off being stupid. While Burn After Reading looks and sounds like a typical Coen Brothers production, there's an awkwardly flat feeling to it because the Coens seem to change their mind from scene to scene, and almost from moment to moment, as to whether this film is being serious or funny, sarcastic or earnest, realistic or over the top.<br/><br/>Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is a CIA analyst who's lost his job. He's the sort of pretentious intellectual who pronounces the word ""memoir"" as ""mem-wah"" and sees himself as the superior mind at war with a world full of morons. Osbourne is married to Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton), a jagged iceberg of a woman who quickly becomes disgusted enough with her unemployed husband to consider divorce. It also helps that Katie is having an affair with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a boor of a U.S. Marshal with the slippery charm of a good used car salesmen.<br/><br/>Osbourne tries to write a book about his life in the CIA, only to discover that he doesn't have anything to say. A copy of what he does manage to put to page falls into the hands of Linda Lizke and Chad Feldheimer (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), co-workers at a fitness gym. Linda seizes on what she thinks is classified information in Osbourne's book as a way to pay for the plastic surgery she desperately wants, either by blackmailing Osbourne or selling it to the Russians because all of Linda's knowledge about spying and espionage appears to have come from the James Bond films she watched as a much younger woman. As for ChadÂ…well, he's a high spirited meathead who can't handle anything much more complicated than a treadmill.<br/><br/>The circle completes itself when Harry starts having an affair with Linda while simultaneously moving in with Katie. As Linda and Chad try and extort money out of Osbourne, someone starts following Harry and everyone winds up tangled together in one of those instances where everyone's mutual idiocy winds up looking like some sort of intricate scheme.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, Burn After Reading is never able or even willing to establish a consistent tone. Nowhere is that more evident than in the vastly differing performances of the cast. John Malkovich plays it like he's in a black comedy about a self-important man discovering he's an insignificant cog in the world machine. Tilda Swinton acts as though she's in a comedy of manners. Frances McDormand is doing a satire on the issues of aging and body image to a middle-aged actress. George Clooney is doing a straight midlife crisis movie. Brad Pitt's mugging for the camera falls somewhere between parody and spoof. Like most Coen brother movies, the humor here is supposed to flow out of the characters' interactions. Because these people are all telling different stories, nothing ever gels and no one has any chemistry with anyone else.<br/><br/>Unlike most Coen brother films, this story is so poorly constructed, though, that you're never waiting to see what happens next. You're only waiting for the movie to end. A sign of a poorly plotted script is one where major characters simply vanish for long stretches of time because there's no room for them. In this case, it's Osbourne who disappears for the middle of the film and Katie who fades away at the end. They're the first characters we're introduced to, but Harry and Linda come to dominate so much of the narrative that the movie ends up ignoring the very people it initially establishes in the viewer's mind.<br/><br/>Another sign of a poorly written script is when the authors introduce a character to explain or underline things for the audience. That's exactly what the Coen brothers do here. Writers who do that fool themselves into thinking the viewer is too dumb to get the point. If you have to be that blatant about the point, you're not making it very well.<br/><br/>Some bad casting is also at work here. George Clooney is playing a middle aged guy who has affairs with other middle aged women, but middle aged guys who look like Clooney don't bird dog women their own age. Brad Pitt is also way to old to be playing a brainless hunk of beef, especially when he's paired with a female character that's consumed with worry about her own age and physical appearance. Pitt is in great shape here, but there's a point when you can no longer play young and he flew by that a while ago. Linda and Chad are clearly meant to be an older woman and a younger guy, but Pitt is much too close to McDormand's age for that to work and the movie never acknowledges that. There might have been something to be made out of a woman of McDormand's years who wants to look better and a man of Pitt's age who does look better, but that's never even hinted at.<br/><br/>It is the Coen brothers, so there's still some stuff worth watching here. None of it comes completely together and Burn After Reading never engages your mind or your heart."

And, like the long list of thrillers they've made before it, it's a genre they've pulled off well.<br/><br/>As the main character, Malkovich has to carry the film, and as intense a dramatic actor as he can be, here he is given a springboard to show how funny he can be too. His voice and the way he pronounces words, mixed with the awkward and far out situations he finds himself in here, make for comedy gold. In support, Clooney has aged so his good looks aren't something to fall back on so much, but he's his usual chirpy wise guy persona.

","The Coen brothers' filmography appears to follow a cyclical pattern: in 1998, after winning the Best Screenplay Oscar for Fargo, they released that piece of cult insanity known as The Big Lebowski. Ten years later, courtesy of their recent Oscar success with the stunning No Country for Old Men, comes Burn After Reading, another piece of zany, irresistible madness. On one level, it is also a perfect companion piece to their previous film, showing once again that America really is, forgive the expression, no country for old men. Especially the ones in suits and specs who trade secrets.<br/><br/>One such man is Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a bad-tempered CIA analyst who is fired for having a drinking problem. Since he all of a sudden has a lot of free time, he thinks an appropriate way to spend it would be writing a memoir, much to the chagrin of his uptight wife Katie (Tilda Swinton). Unfortunately, the disk containing a small part of his remembrances is found on the floor of a gym locker. The manager (Richard Jenkins) wants nothing to do with it, whereas Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), desperate to have a series of surgeries to look better, and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), a fitness-obsessed doofus, see it as an opportunity to make some easy money. While the two try to carry out their bizarre blackmail attempt, Linda gets involved with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a Treasury employee who is also sleeping with Mrs. Cox. Needless to say, there will be chaos, hilarity and the occasional squirt of blood.<br/><br/>The magic of Burn After Reading lies in how Joel and Ethan Coen approach their satirical handling of all things spook-related: instead of hitting the full parody mode, Ã  la Austin Powers or Johnny English (in which, coincidentally, Malkovich played the villain), they envision a pretty generic spy story (their inspiration, or so they claim at least, was The Bourne Identity) and then just pinpoint the natural absurdity of these scenarios, especially the major coincidence of all the people involved being connected somehow, leading to everyone being paranoid about everything (the classic ""walk in the park scene"" is a must-see) and a clueless CIA director (J.K. Simmons) wondering what the hell is going on. That's actually the big message the Coens deliver: most of the time, even secret agents have no clue of what they're doing.<br/><br/>The dialogue is, as always with these writers/directors, comedy gold, from Harry's priceless rendition of something as simple as ""Well, hello!"" to Chad's blackmail phone call (""Osborne Cox? I thought you might be worried... about the security... of your sh*t!""), and all those classy lines are served to perfection by one of the most committed ensemble casts the Coens have ever assembled: regular players like Clooney (partially spoofing his Oscar-winning role in Syriana), McDormand (a brilliant self-referential performance) and Simmons know what to do and comply hilariously, while Swinton, the new girl on the block, uses all her scenes to the max in her reinterpretation of a ""cold, stuck-up b*tch"". And then we have Pitt and Malkovich, who need a separate mention: the former, dim and proud of it (with a laughable Johnny Suede haircut), is happy to toy with his image playing what is essentially ""The Dude"" Lebowski's stupid cousin; the latter, doing something of relevance for the first time since he lampooned himself in Being John Malkovich (1999), transcends all the villains he's played in the past with a turn that reeks of borderline craziness and instant comic appeal.<br/><br/>""So, what did we learn?"", one character asks at one point. Applied to the audience, the answer would be: a) the Intelligence community is a league of morons; b) this might even be the Coens' funniest movie ever. A gem."

This time everyone's missing something, usually the common sense part of the brain, but the trouble is caused by two gym employees (Pitt and McDormand) who come across a CD with CIA code on it belonging to an ex-CIA analyst (Malkovich), thinking they can blackmail him and make money.<br/><br/>Surrounding all that are other characters vital to the story: Malkovich's wife (Swinton) and her lover (Clooney) who is having multiple other affairs regularly in spite of his marriage. Much of the conflict and plot in this actually revolves around the shambled marriages of these couples and actually not on the CD, which of course is all part of the point.<br/><br/>Like all Coen brothers films, including their award-winning ""No Country For Old Men,"" when you sit back and think about this film everything seems to click. It's difficult to explain without revealing the plot, but the important thing to keep in mind when viewing this film is that it plays on our perceptions of movies being great mystery thrillers that you have to try and figure out. You also need to remember that it's supposed to be a comedy. The Coen brothers will do everything to trick you into thinking it's more than just a comedy, but it's not.<br/><br/>Comedy is also not a word used lightly. This is easily the funniest Coen brothers film short of ""The Big Lebowski"" and what's even better is it has guys like Pitt and Clooney playing complete goofballs unlike their usual typecast. This is easily the most enjoyable part of the film. Actors like McDormand, Malkovich and JK Simmons continue to provide the Coen brothers more great talent for their gem of a script.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers want you to take ""Burn After Reading"" seriously and will use all of Hollywood's standard smoke and mirrors to align this film with your mental framework about movies (suspenseful music, dramatic and thoughtful camera angles, etc.) but the ability to step back and understand the directors' intent here is the key to loving this film instead of liking or being completely confused by it. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
"Polaris_DiB","9","3","9","14 September 2008"," ""Well, what have we learned?""
","There it is, the Coens have done it again. They've hit another home run by taking what seems like a pretty standard plot and gleefully playing with the audience's expectations. ""Burn after Reading"" is a hilarious and almost dizzying espionage comedy movie where the true intelligence has no idea what's going on and the lesser intelligence are creating problems over practically no goals at all. Like ""The Big Lewbowski"", many players factor into the story, but this time you're treated to a much more ensemble cast of characters that frankly have no idea what to do with each other.<br/><br/>Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his job as an analyst for the CIA after he's given a short shrift that sets him off. He decides to write some memoirs to damn the institution that he feels hasn't treated him fairly, while settling into a less-than-stable home life filled with infidelity and backstabbing. Actually, for a movie featuring the CIA as a major part of the character's lives, much more sordid goings on simply involve sex and loneliness than any international hijinks. But of course that's just the point as relationship-by-relationship, Cox' memoirs and computer data end up in the hands of two bumbling gym workers (one (Francis McDormand) of which ends up in a relationship with Cox's wife's lover (George Clooney), further sealing the twisting inter-relations of this group) who of course do the stupid thing and decide to try to get money for it, causing all sorts of scandal as Russians, Americans, public servers, and private investigators all try to figure out what's going on and what's important--because who cares about the memoirs of a third level government analyst, anyway? To the Coen's repertoire of working with great actors over the years is added Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt, both of whom, of course, do amazingly. Apparently Brad Pitt's role was written just for him after he approached the Coens about doing something with them, and really the movie gets going once Chad appears. Other familiar faces from Coen brother history appear, sometimes in cameos (this is probably the most cameo'd movie of the Coens, ultimately), and all of them seem happy to be involved once again with another great movie by the masters.<br/><br/>But, of course, the joy of seeing good acting and great direction is overshadowed completely by the Coens return to form as they twist expectations. Much has already been made about the fact that the characters are essentially idiots and most of them don't even know what they're striving for, but even better, some of the more significant moments of the plot aren't shown while other smaller moments are lingered on, creating a beautiful branching tree of a world where sometimes the real information is simply in an aside when people are aggravating over the details. This, of course, is pulled off with panache by the Coen brothers' legendary dialog, which of course had the majority of the theatre literally rolling on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>And like most of their movies, the humor comes mostly from a dark place of absurdity that honestly makes one shake one's head and think, ""Where do they come up with this stuff?"" If anything else, this movie is so unique and original it deserves a look-see just to watch the look on a Ceon brother's newcomer's face as he or she follows the inevitable, but winding course of their morbid fascination with botched crime, paranoia, and dysfunction.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"Chris Knipp","8","3","9","13 September 2008"," A carnival of human folly
","In Burn After Reading the Coen brothers turn to a new genre, the spy story, and they shred it and, along with it, their cast of characters. Typically for the Coens, there's tight construction, quick pacing--and a somewhat unseemly delight taken in human stupidity--in the course of which a number of A-listers are coaxed into working hard to demean themselves. <br/><br/>This at least is what the critics are mostly saying. Now, in fact, the action's a bit puzzling, and the finale a tad unsatisfying. But what some reviews seem crucially to overlook is that there's much fun to be had here for viewers, not only in absurdities of dialogue and action--in the seemingly helter-skelter ""clusterfuck"" plot--but in the way the extreme story elements and satirical characters are destined to undercut whole chunks of movies you'll be seeing in the near future. <br/><br/>You've got a group of types. There's the ice queen wife (Tilda Swinton), her alcoholic husband (John Malkovitch), the cosmetic surgery-seeking plain girl (Frances McDormand), the ambivalent philanderer (George Clooney), the gym bunny (Brad Pitt), the good bloke (Richard Jenkins). Then you've got the various people they're tied to or get involved with, none of whom matter much except for a ""CIA Superior"" (J.K. Simmons). The machinations of the gym bunny and the plain girl (co-workers at a gym called Hardbodies) are reported to Simmons by an agent. They're trying to extort money from ex-spook Malkovich and sell his info to the Ruskies. Simmons gives orders to minimize damage and make some sense out of it all. It will be hard any time in the near future to observe any such characters and plot elements in another movie and not be reminded of how devastatingly they were twisted and mocked by the Coens.<br/><br/>The CD-rom Pitt and McDormand find at Hardbodies contains some intelligence-valueless memories of Malkovich's just-ended CIA career. He calls them a ""league of morons,"" but he speaks too soon, because he's an idiot himself. Cruelty and anger do not make a man smart.<br/><br/>Reviewers accuse the Coens of meanness, but satire doesn't have to be nice. It is good to be able to laugh at ourselves, to see our own folly. The excellent and very famous actors who perform in this movie may understand that better than the critics do. They know the value of having a bit of fun--of laughing at themselves. They're not so much demeaned as set free of their solemn garb as tragedians who weep in a movie like Babel (as Brad Pitt did), or snarl and get tough like Clooney in Michael Clayton, and so on.<br/><br/>The action takes place in the environs of Washington, DC. The CIA, as moviegoers know all too well by now, is over the border in Langley. The opportunists, lobbyists, and exploiters, the poseurs and dreamers and has-beens, are everywhere--in the real DC, that is. This is a specialized and notional one, for the Coens are artists.<br/><br/>The Coens do not always succeed. There's a slight risk in their returning to mockery after the solemn horror of their literary adaptation of last year, Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men. They had never worked off somebody else's story before and the purity of their accomplishment grew from their playing another's music, so to speak. In their own mode, ever since Blood Simple, the brothers have been cruel both to their characters and their audience--cruel in a way that gives excruciating pleasure in the suspenseful moments of Blood Simple. They can become too reductive and condescending, as in O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or too crass, as in The Ladykillers, or just boring, as in The Man Who Wasn't There, or merely conventional, as in Intolerable Cruelty. And as clever and able as they are, it is still true that when they have most succeeded, it is n partly by accident, as in Barton Fink, which owes much to the dorky intensity of John Turturro, and thegargantuan genius of John Goodman; likewise The Big Lebowski became a thing far beyond their abilities because it stars Jeff Bridges--and again the great Goodman.<br/><br/>But enough of the filmography--which in a way this movie has nothing to do with. Its virtue comes from its working a new game, the ""clusterfuck"" of schemers and cheaters so mixed up with each other everything ultimately implodes--with a plop.<br/><br/>The ""clusterfuck"" grows out of greed, vanity, and lust. The Coens' alleged ""cruelty"" comes from the stern morality of the satirist.<br/><br/>Clooney is sleeping with everyone he can, and that includes Tilda Swinton, Cox's (Malkovich's) wife, a mean pediatrician. McDormand, whose vanity makes her want thousands for wholesale cosmetic surgery, is dating via the Internet, and thus she starts seeing Clooney too. Clooney goes to Swinton's and Malkovich's house when Malkovich is away, and then Pitt goes there in search of more state secrets. The critics think Pitt is the dumbest character of all. But he is the most selfless: he only wants to exploit the discovered data because it excites him to do so, without any real ulterior motive or plan. Malkovich is motivated, as in so many of the actor's roles, mostly by malevolence, and this time, the perversion of feeling that arises from alcohol.<br/><br/>The Russians are not in bed with anybody, but the CIA has an inside man at the Russian embassy. The lesson of John Le CarrÃ©: the Secret War is always behind the times.<br/><br/>Other than this, it is dangerous to reveal the plot; the trailers already revealed too much. The devil is in the details."
"The-Sarkologist","6","2","5","5 November 2011"," What one can expect from a Coen Brothers Movie
","This film begins and ends in the CIA headquarters at Langley Virginia. It begins with a mid level CIA analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) being demoted and ends with his superiors left bedazzled at the 'shit storm' that they had just managed to avoid. In fact, the entire movie is practically a comedy of errors. At first I found it slow and painful to watch (namely because Cox is a born loser whose wife is having an affair and is planning on divorcing him after she steals all of his money). Actually, all of the characters in this movie are losers, and in the end one just simply laughs at their stupidity.<br/><br/>This is not a movie with any over arching theme that one can explore. Rather it is a black comedy like many of the Coen brothers films (and they do black comedy very well). The thing is, you don't sympathise with the characters, you just shake your head and wince as the movie progresses. Many of them end up dying, though Linda Litzke, the gym worker who is obsessed with getting enough money to be made beautiful, gets her wish in the end. Chad (Brad Pitt), Linda's co-worker, who discovers Cox's memoirs lying in the gym's locker room, sees money in his eyes, but he also ends up dead, and it is one of those classic scenes that you never see coming. Osborne Cox is simply raging at a world that he believes is treating him unfairly. We don't really see too deeply into Cox's personality, so we don't really know if what the CIA says about him is true (that he has a drinking problem), but we do know that he does develop one.<br/><br/>As for Harry Pfarrer, we know absolutely nothing about him. Well, we know what he tells us, but we learn that we cannot believe a word that he says. All we know, in the end, is that he flees to Venezuala because the US does not have a extradition treaty with them (and the CIA doesn't care about him anyway).<br/><br/>What started off as a painful movie, actually turned out to be a very good movie about the pointlessness of existence (therefore it would fall into the category of existentialism). While having a definite beginning and an end, there is not overarching plot moving the movie towards a definite conclusion. Rather, we are catching a glimpse into a period of time in the lives of a group of disconnected people who are stumbling around the world trying to make something of it. In the end it works out fine for the CIA, because everything has been swept under the carpet. While Cox's memoirs were nothing to get excited about, at least, to the CIA, the problem is gone. Did they learn anything from it? Probably not, but then that is the nature of black comedy."

"tpolakov-2","5","2","5","2 June 2010"," OK, it is not bad... but not good either.
","I personally think the Coen brothers' movies are overrated. Sure, I haven't seen a really bad movie from them, but I haven't seen a really outstanding one either. My problem with ""Burn After Reading"" is my complete lack of connection or sympathy to any of the characters on screen. To me it felt like puppets involved in trying to move a vehicle of a complex plot which tries to be smart and make a point in criticism of society, or structures of power, or the hidden violence in people, or whatever... But - I did not feel any of the characters was a real person. Clooney came the closest and likely if the movie focused more on him, and got rid of some irrelevant threads, it could have had much more impact. As it is, it just scratches the surface and stays among the ""average"" flicks which I think is sometimes even worse than the real bad ones. Those at least manage to produce some feelings. This one doesn't, at least for me."
"dromasca","8","2","5","1 February 2010"," a funny film about stupid people
","There is one mis-perception that this film fixed in my mind - there are not really funny films about stupid people. Stupid people are ... well ... stupid, their behavior is by definition subject of easy jokes, so for smart and educated audiences laughing at stupid people comes together with a feeling of guilt. No fun.<br/><br/>What makes 'Burn After Reading' different then? I think that one of the reasons is that this is not only a comedy about stupid people, but more about a stupid people in a stupid system. The Coens attack, catch, and dissect a lot of holy cows of the American political system (the CIA, the government secrecy), morality (matrimonial fidelity), social habits (Internet dating, the gym) and national obsessions (the shrink, the divorce lawyer, the plastic surgery).Almost nothing that is a clichÃ© in the average American behavior escapes becoming a victim of their cynical look.<br/><br/>While the script has certainly its role in the success of the comic experience, the story by itself does not try to be more than a funny chain of coincidences that hit a bunch of characters that act according to their immediate instincts and bad planning, something that brings us back to the time of the great comedies in the 30s and 40s of the past century. It would have been of no special effect without the master story telling skills of the Coen brothers, which pace their gags and laughs in the 96 minutes of screening (low figures well below recent Hollywood average).<br/><br/>Overall however the film succeeds through the perfect casting, and the brilliant manner by which the Coens succeed to bring the best out of their actors. John Malkovitch is an actor of all seasons, one of those that brings his personality in any role he does. Not here, where he melds into the alcoholic spy clerk, who loses his useless job and wife, hates the whole world and nobody cares about him, his life, or even about him losing the secrets he was supposed to have learned during his career. Frances McDormand who was the Coen's unexpected heroine in 'Fargo' is back in the role of a gym clerk who does not hesitate to betray her country to finance plastic surgery, but worries even more being in time at her workplace after leaving the Russian embassy. Brad Pitt is her gym trainer companion, looking flat-minded and younger than in the teen years of his role as Benjamin Button.<br/><br/>And then George Clooney. I feel every time that I write about Clooney in the last few years that I need to apologize (to myself of course, as he does not read me or care) for having underestimated his talent and having considered him yet another TV actor and beautiful face. His work as a director and his last performances as an actor are better and better. Here he is superb, the happy husband who cheats his wife with Internet dates without knowing the reason, the involuntary and hysterical killer who associates with other stupid people in senseless actions.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a cynical view of the world - but hey, this is entertainment, these are the Coen brothers."

","Aghhhhhhhhh... there's one thing about this movie thats just so bad....<br/><br/>Other than that one thing, this movie is fantastic. Dichotomy, much, eh? I've read through some reviews and a recurring thing is people thinking this movie is a movie about nothing... well... sorta... close! it seems to me the movie was more about how people react when they don't have all the information available to them.<br/><br/>Nobody has any idea whats going on. Whats fun is how they fill in the blanks. For Chad, not knowing what he has means he has some insane STUFF, super secret spy STUFF. For Linda, not knowing what she HAS gives her a container to fill up with all her desires. Wishful thinking at its finest.<br/><br/>I have to say, I love the ending of this movie. Its fantastic. The thought of a deranged Harry in a holding cell all mega-paranoid is hilarious, and, the idea of Linda ""sitting on the whole thing"" is almost too much to handle. mama mama.<br/><br/>I love the interaction of JK Simmons and David Rasche.<br/><br/>David is remorseful at not knowing, at being jumbled. He expresses his sorrow in his posture and demeanor at not fulfilling the requisites of his job. so funny. And JK Simmons, who'll throw money at anything and is relieved when people start shoot each other. I'm lost for words. Its just too damn funny.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say... erm... well, maybe you should watch it? OH, my gripe. Yes, the gripe. Damn. This movie could have been a 9 star movie (whatever that means) if not for one bad writing part but, I mean, its only bad because its bothered me for weeks. The part is...<br/><br/>Harry shoots Chad. Harry goes outside, slams his car into the Marriage Snoop's car. He asks ""Who do you work for""... Yet! The question he never asks is ""Why was your guy watching me in the closet!!"" Its too hard for me to believe that Harry was, at that moment, able to fathom being spied on by two completely different agencies. That he did not want some resolution to the Chad incident through the Marriage Snoop is beyond me. Oh well.. I can't come up with anything better but its a big gaping hole in the script.<br/><br/>All in all, fantastic movie. Hats off, then on, then off again. Okay now stand on one leg..... goooood.

"rsd_anon","5","2","5","2 May 2009"," How can a movie with so many bad user ratings have such a high OVERALL rating?
","My wife and I saw this movie after seeing IMDb's high (7.3) user rating. We were extremely disappointed and would rate it a 5.5 at the most. What's most distressing to me is that I am GENERALLY in COMPLETE agreement with the overall user ratings that IMDb users give to movies. I rely on these ratings to choose movies to watch. If a movie has an 8 or higher it's almost guaranteed to be a great movie that I will enjoy and remember for a long time (with the possible exception of older movies that are rated highly for historical significance). If the movie is between 7 and 8, I anticipate an excellent movie. Ratings between 6 and 7 are a little more circumspect. If the movie is about a particular topic or genre with a big following (e.g. a western, or a NASCAR race film, or a children's cartoon, or a science fiction film) then I'll adjust the overall rating by perhaps a point, depending on how much I like/dislike that genre of movie. Movies below 6 are almost always boring or painful to watch and are generally just a waste of my time. I felt ""Burn After Reading"" was very disappointing as a comedy and dreadful as a drama. The only somewhat amusing part was the last scene. In looking through a few hundred of the latest reviews, it appeared to me that most people thought it was a bad movie, with just a few users rating this movie a 9 or 10. Those glowing reviews look like they were written by the cast or production crew of the movie (or perhaps their family) with a financial or emotional stake in its success. While I expect the first 100 reviews of a movie to be highly positively biased, I generally trust the ratings of films with over a thousand reviews. So ... what happened here? ""Burn After Reading"" has over 64,000 votes and a rating of 7.3, but a large percentage of the latest reviews were (like mine) fairly negative. Has someone figured out how to scam the voting process? ... or ... Is this a movie that people either love or hate? I'm very concerned that someone has figured out how to scam the system so that movie producers or interested parties can buy a high rating. <br/><br/>If the voting is being done fairly, I can fully accept that I rate a movie differently than others. What I can't accept is a system that allows for buying or manipulating ratings. <br/><br/>I would like to see IMDb provide a feature where a user can see a histogram of the user ratings. Perhaps then we would see a bi-modal distribution for this movie, revealing that people either loved this movie (9s and 10s) or didn't care for it (4s, 5, and 6,). That might then explain the puzzling votes I've observed.<br/><br/>A further refinement would be to have statistics that show if all the great ratings came from users who enrolled at the same time or some other characteristic that points to a manipulated voting process. It would also be very helpful to be able to look at a random sample of reviews. With 64,000+ reviews, I can't accurately assess the quality of the rating or reviews by looking at only the latest entries. A random sample would be a great way to look for irregularities in the voting process. Finally, there should be a way for users to flag suspicious votes to IMDb for someone to review for irregularities.<br/><br/>What do you think?"
"cppguy","3","2","5","25 February 2009"," Overrated
","I won't give this film 1 star. There was some good acting and it was professionally made. That said, when the central character Ozzy (John Malkovich) has been given lines literally no more than repetition of the F-word, and when we're expected to take this as a group of stupid people doing stupid things, but they all seem to be smart actors' campy portrayals of stupid, you have to wonder what you're doing watching this film. Dilbert does things so lame that Dogbert can't have fun mocking them. That's how this film felt to me.<br/><br/>I might as well point out some of the fun bits. The exchanges between the CIA people (David Rasche and J.K. Simmons) are the only truly clever comic bits with good acting combined. Get a few laughs from that and over Linda's (Frances McDormand) body obsession, but the rest of the film is a waste of time.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's attempt to be a hunky, but stupid, protagonist fail. I felt like I was watching the worst of Charlie Chaplain, Forrest Gump and Jethro Bodean rolled together. Could Brad do it? I suppose. But in this film, he didn't. He's dumb as a box of rocks, but can probe a CD and clarify the difference between Mac and Windows formatted CDs. Bad writing; bad acting.<br/><br/>Find something better to watch."

The Director duo rightfully presented a chain of events due to leak of a secret CIA data. One thing that lead to other was really engrossing and so much fun to watch. The background score was awesome. The beginning and ending of the movie with an aerial view of earth from space was really really innovative for this visual effects lacking movie.<br/><br/>In performances, Francis Mc Dormand as Gym worker, online date searcher and looking for cosmetic surgery was simply stand out. Without pretending, her unhappiness with loneliness and growing age was clearly reflected on her performance. Brad Pitt as macho gym instructor was convincing. Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich as frustrated husband-wife pair is fun to watch. What disappointed me was the role of George Cloony. His role was interesting but some how he did not manage do justice with it. In some scenes he had gone over the top.<br/><br/>All in all, a healthy comedy with realistic approach.

","I really didn't know what to expect from the film at first, though 'Burn After Reading' managed to exceed any expectation I could've had.<br/><br/>The cast performs tremendously well, Brad Pitt's character in particular, who actually made me laugh more than once, (which doesn't happen quite often when I watch a comedy film nowadays). But also Frances McDormand has some pretty funny moments. George Clooney and John Malkovich, however, I thought are less interesting than the other characters, although their acting is top notch! Tilda Swinton isn't in the film for laughs, but rather to tie loose ends together and she does that rather well with her more than bitchy character.<br/><br/>The plot is also quite interesting, though maybe confusing at first. Actually, the whole story revolves around nothing important. Then everything gets blown out of proportion because of the stupidity of the characters, which makes this film so funny. All of the characters are tied together in a complex way, with some pretty dark comedy as a result. Truth to be told, dark humor is required in order to like this film. It aren't really the jokes that make the film interesting, but rather the situations and the responses to those situations by the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, I think anyone who appreciates dark humor and an unconventional plot, will also appreciate 'Burn After Reaing'."
"mimosveta","5","2","5","3 November 2008"," So smooth to watch, it turns stale
","For starters, I'd like to talk to you about Keanu Reeves. Why Keanu when he's nowhere to be found in this movie? Because Keanu is often regarded as the worse actor ever. Even worse than Victor Mature. And yeah, sure, he often looks like he can hardly remember his lines, like he's not aware he's in the film at all, overall like he has no idea what the heck is he doing there, or where ""there"" might be. Yet, he is such a fine, subtle actor when compared to his highness Brad Pitt. They are even of the similar age, although looks much younger, while Pitt, every time I see him, looks more and more like shar pei. Not that it matters, I just had to mention it :). What matters is that he would be brilliant in this role that was so butchered by Mr. Pitt. Forgetful as he seams, it would still be a bliss compared to dreadful awareness of camera that Brad just can't get rid of. Brad couldn't stop overacting if his life depended on it. Rest of the cast does fairly well, of course. Sure, they don't exactly give mind blowing performances, who would expect that, but at least they do not annoy. They are all a bit silly, and painfully aware that they are, which feels so worn out, as such cases you can only see in movies. Real people are never consciousness of how exactly ridiculous they appear. But, what can you do, it's Coen brothers film. They can't outgrow these type of characters. One performance that does stand out, is Clooney's. He is on the very verge of overacting, but manages to cut it down to size, and even to look insecure at moments, which is magnificent, considering. The story it self is typical Coen brothers story. To fast, to ""smart"", flooded with number of characters, and oh, so, cool. Grand in every sense. So smooth to watch, it turns stale. It had potential to achieve something more, but submitting to conformity and popular demand for shallowness, fail to use, or abuse these elements (except for laughs) and remains in the realms of averageness. All in the name of high ratings. God forbid they have a message. Messengers tend to get shot. Who wants that."
"alecwest","8","2","5","27 October 2008"," Fargo meets the CIA
","When the Coen Brothers deliver comedy, it's usually not the belly-laugh kind of humor. Their humor is more subtle, resulting from the activities of ordinary humans caught up in ordinary life situations. BURN AFTER READING is no exception. I took away 2 stars for only one reason - that I've seen the ""basic"" plot done before (and done better).<br/><br/>The basic plot - a CIA employee is called into his supervisor's office to be given a demotion. The CIA employee then decides to leave the agency and write his memoirs. Afterward, all hell breaks loose. This is the basic plot behind BURN AFTER READING ... but is also the same basic plot behind the 1980 film, HOPSCOTCH.<br/><br/>But back to BURN AFTER READING. The motivating force behind the plot has less to do with the CIA analyst's memoirs and more to do with one woman's fierce determination to raise enough money to pay for four cosmetic surgical procedures. It would not be a spoiler to say that, by the end of the film, she gets her wish. This is because the complicated maze of intrigue and farce needed to achieve that end is what propels the film.<br/><br/>Again, the Coen Brothers deliver a solid film that connects all the dots of plot in such a way that it entertains - in a deadpan way, perhaps, but that's their forte. I only differ with other reviewers in one respect. I think the MOST solid performance was delivered by John Malkovich ... who plays the somewhat manic CIA analyst whose memoirs create deadly headaches for himself and a number of others who come into contact with those memoirs - directly or otherwise."

","Owing to a problem with the cinema's ticket machine I didn't see the first few minutes of the film, but that doesn't matter so much. The best thing about this movie is that you cannot predict what will happen next. There are twists and turns aplenty, and many comic moments. It's not a comedy, but rather like The Color Purple, some dark issues that when acted out strike one as extremely funny. Gallows humour, as we otherwise know it, challenging the best from post room jokes and the like. The actors...all without exception... perform beautifully in their respective roles. How could any other actor replace them. The Coens are masters of their trade and this is another superb example from this virtuoso trio (yes I said trio)."
"stewiefan201","7","2","5","20 September 2008"," It's a hilarious movie about stupid people, and we'll leave it at that
","The Coen Brothers are at it again! After taking home the Best Picture award at the Oscars for last year's No Country For Old Men, everybody was holding their breath to see what the Coens would do next. Well it's here, it's got an ensemble A-list cast, a loopy plot full of blackmail and espionage, and an offbeat brand of humor. Sounds like the Coens to me.<br/><br/>Burn after Reading is about an ex-CIA agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), who after quitting his job decides to write a revealing memoir about his past in the CIA. However his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), who is cheating on him with the paranoid Federal Marshal Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), finds his memoir, burns it onto a CD, and ends up losing it by leaving it at a public gym. It is here where two quirky gym employees, Linda Litzke (Frances Mcdormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), find the CD, and also Osborne's phone number and address. The pair decide to blackmail Osborne into giving them 50,000 dollars if he ever wants the CD back, otherwise they threaten to give it to the Russian Embassy. As all 5 of these morons get further and further into their little web of blackmail, greed, and deceit. Nobody seems to notice the severe consequences waiting for them just around the corner.<br/><br/>Burn after Reading is really not a film that relies too heavily on its plot, since it just gets more and more idiotic as it goes along. This film relies more on its stupid characters and all the immoral, self centered hi-jinks they get into. Which they could have avoided had they just acted a little smarter. I am not saying Burn after Reading was a stupid film, I'm saying it was a very good movie about stupid people, stupid morals, stupid decisions, and frankly just downright stupidity. These characters are all perfectly cast and every single character has their moment (or moments). John Malkovich is excellent as a very angry guy, who begins to just hate everybody and everything. George Clooney is funny as a paranoid, sex addicted weirdo who cheats on his wife every chance he gets. Frances Mcdormand also gives a standout performance as a woman who needs lots of money, because she feels she needs plastic surgery and rhinoplasty to make herself look beautiful. However the real scene-stealer here is Brad Pitt as a flamboyant gym trainer who is obsessed with his ego. In one scene his character tries to smart talk Osborne over the phone by pretending to sound like a secret agent, but really just ends up repeating Osborne's name over and over again. It's scenes like this that really give this movie its comedic flavor.<br/><br/>I have never seen a movie that goes this far with such idiot characters. However that is really what makes Burn after Reading a memorable film. Nobody acts with intelligence, everybody is self centered, absolutely nothing is at stake, and almost everybody gets hurt in some way by the end over nothing. There are a few scenes involving two CIA agents trying to figure out what exactly these people were actually trying to do, and they simply just have no idea, and neither do we. I can barely explain anything about this movie without using the word stupid in every sentence, which I'm sure you've noticed. So we'll just leave it at this: It's a hilarious movie about stupid people, and that's just about it. I give it a 3.5 out of 5."
"dan-allan","8","2","5","17 September 2008"," The Coen's Return to the Roots
","""Burn After Reading"" was an incredible effort from the Coen brothers, right up there with classics like ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""the Big Lebowski"" - you can even see how the film draws from its predecessors. One can see why the critics panned it, it is quite odd - but the didn't the same thing happen to ""Lebowski"" a decade ago?. The Coen's like to mix up their films (""Lebowksi"" after ""Fargo,"" ""Reading"" after ""No Country"") - and they shouldn't be faulted for it. The movie, very ""Lebowski"" meets ""Pulp Fiction"" - yet much more complex features masterful performances from Frances McDormand, George Clooney and Brad Pitt (who, in my opinion, should rival Heath Ledger in early Oscar consideration for Best Supporting Actor). Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich toed the line, and J.K. Simmons does a great job in a small cameo at the films end. The films strength is the acting - the plot is weak at times (perhaps even unconsciously borrowing elements from ""Pulp Fiction"") - but the cast pulls it through. Pitt's mannerisms are worth the cost of admission alone. Clooney's character is questionable, but he saves it with his Carey Grant-esquire charm. To enjoy this film one would have to be either a Coen brothers fan or a fan of cinema - the casual movie-goer would likely pan it (like so many critics). Definitely a must see - but you can probably put it off until the DVD release."
"citizenchris","Null","2","5","15 September 2008"," the entire cast is at the top of there respective game as are all the filmmakers involved
","Burn After Reading 9-15-08<br/><br/>""I want to go in fresh"" truer words have never been spoken about the movie going experience. Or at the very least a first time viwing experience. Going into a film there are many things that can inform your opinion and or perception of said film. Be it a trailer, genre label, word of mouth etc... With Burn After Reading I think the film works best if you don't know what to expect. Its seems to want to be a spy film and at the same time make fun of said films. It vexing as the film can at times challenge what you expect from parody. It can be ridiculous yet there are moments when its almost as if it wants to be serious too. This to my way of thinking is the brilliance of the film. Though don't get me wrong....its hella funny. I haven't laughed this much at a film in quite a long time. The plot in and of itself is or rather how convoluted it seems is the funniest thing of all. An example of this takes place when David Rasche's character sits down to give J.K. Simmons' CIA director character a break down of the events up till this point. The director is about as confused as the audience might be and reacts in a similar fashion. I love these kinds of self aware type scenes. There are two scenes in particular are quite fun and really seem to sum up what the film is really all about. The list of brilliant performances reads like the cast list...stand outs for me though had to be Malkovich and Swinton. Seriously though the entire cast is at the top of there respective game as are all the filmmakers involved in this wonderful film."
"blanbrn","7","2","5","14 September 2008"," Funny and neat work from the Coens. A nice concept of mixing the plot and intersecting it with complex characters.
","Certainly this Coen brothers comedy ""Burn After Reading"" will not be no Oscar winner like their previous effort ""No Country for Old Men"", but still the direction and over the top funny story makes this offbeat film one to watch. Many may see this as a spoof crime caper type and in many ways it is as it involves a plot of hidden info and the CIA. Plus for commercial success the all-star cast makes it watchable as each portray interesting characters with different attitudes who's lives intersect with a CD-ROM. John Malkovich is Osborne Cox a recently canned CIA agent who's down on his luck as his relationship with his pediatrician wife the classy and elegant Katie(Oscar winner Tilda Swinton)is about to go up into flames. As on the side Katie is seducing womanizer and federal government employee Harry Dfarrer(George Clooney).So the film has already introduced some complex characters now enter the big plot and theme of the movie two dim-witted fitness gym employees(Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) come across one of Mr. Cox's old CD-ROM disc of classified information from his CIA days. Then one by one this film presents a fun to watch hoot of mishap and adventures as you see how each conflicted character is drawn together over a simple little disc of information as in the end each life has been shaped differently. Pretty good work from the Coens as the theme and concept was neat and funny even though it may not be a critical success the star power of Pitt, Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, and Swinton will make it a commercial success. So to sum it up it's a pretty good feel good film to watch that you will have fun with."
"maricam","3","2","6","23 October 2017"," Sadly wasted potential
","Despite the all-star cast, regrettably, this movie doesn't deliver. If you enjoy this genre a far better movie which is superior in every way is Ruthless People (1986). Check it out instead. <br/><br/>Having said that, there was some potential here but poor writing and slow, clumsy pacing sank what could have been a hilarious black comedy. Brad Pitt just about steals the show as the dim-witted Chad Felheimer, a character very reminiscent of Bill Pullman's ""Earl"" in Ruthless People. <br/><br/>I'll be honest, the only reason I'm leaving a review for Burn After Reading is to strongly suggest everyone take a look at Ruthless People, a gem of a movie which should be analyzed and taught in movie-making school."
"filipemanuelneto","3","2","6","17 July 2017"," A huge mess in a boring movie.
","This movie seems to make fun of the secret world of spies, their agencies and secrets. The entire film revolves around an American spy who, after being removed from office, decides to write a memoir. But the CD-ROM where he put its sketch went to the hands of a gym employee who, with the help of an idiot coworker, tries to blackmail him. Then, the movie goes on to create a huge confusion about something so minor that, in the end, even the CIA are amazed at the situation.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I've felt here is the fact that the film handles everything very lightly, as if none of it were really important. That fits the movie, but it creates a huge barrier between the audience and the film, as if we were watching a movie that doesn't want to catch our attention. This gets even worse if we consider that no character is capable of reaching the public. There are only people, much like any human being we meet outside but we do not have the interest to know, and for whom we do not look more than once. The result is to become invariably boring, sometimes very difficult to keep up with. In the end, except for the action scenes, we don't care about the movie anymore.<br/><br/>The best of this film are the performances of the main actors, usually very good but unable to truly shine in a film that did not allow that (they are good actors but they don't perform miracles). Clooney was very good, Pitt was convincing in the idiot character they gave him, Frances McDormand was pleasantly futile (something that her character demanded) and John Malkovich was OK, in a character without major difficulties but Which also never allowed him to have much space to show talent."
"ShootingShark","4","2","6","2 July 2011"," Lame And Unpleasant Comedy Of Coincidences Amongst The DC Jet-Set
","Osborne Cox is a CIA analyst who quits when threatened with a demotion. He starts to write a memoir which unwittingly falls into the hands of the none-too-bright Linda and Chad, who work at a gym. A complicated web of blackmail, surveillance, infidelity and bizarre coincidences ensue.<br/><br/>What has gone wrong with the Coen Brothers ? When these guys were young, they made some truly outstanding movies - I would rate Miller's Crossing in my all-time top ten. Now it seems they just slap anything together, make sure the characters are all extreme caricatures, encourage their clique of bigshot actors to mug shamelessly and then wait for the accolades to pour in. Their films have become predictable, crass and stupid when they were once original, witty and brilliant. This comedy - I didn't laugh once - is like their previous remake of The Ladykillers; full of ridiculous, foul-mouthed, harshly unlikable people with no redeeming features whatsoever. Are we supposed to root for the paranoid vain operative who chases women on the internet, the drunken fired CIA agent who hates everyone and whose reveal-all memoir the plot revolves around is worthless, either of the cheating cold-hearted wives or the jaded ageing spinster whose only goal is to be able to afford plastic surgery ? The Coens and their actors may find these people funny, but I don't, and as the story races along at a hundred miles an hour I get the sneaky suspicion that they're moving so fast to cover up the fact that they realise nobody else will. There's a ten minute subplot involving Clooney building a sex toy in his basement which is not only staggeringly unfunny, but has absolutely zero relevance to anything. Can these guys really be the same men who made the deftly hilariously clever comedies Raising Arizona and The Hudsucker Proxy ? The all-star cast of award-winning feted actors prove clearly the old maxim that dying is easy but comedy is hard as they all fall flat, assuming that if they just shout loud enough and fast enough that somehow their performance will amuse. For me the only good turn is by Rasche as the CIA sub-chief, whose explanation of the plot to his superior is a lot funnier than the actual plot itself. Only he goes for a carefully measured and timed performance, the fundamental basis of all good comedy and a lesson everyone else on the picture needs to re-learn. And that in a nutshell is what's wrong with this movie - it has no timing, no rhythm, it's just a series of unpleasant scenes which rush past very quickly. It has some funny ideas and moments, but they're just ripples in a big choppy splurge of a film with no sense of itself. I really wish I could rate this film higher, particularly since the preceding No Country For Old Men was their best movie in a long time, but this so-called comedy sucks and these guys can do much better."

Burn After reading is ultimately a mess and a disappointment. At times it briefly flashes something resembling something brilliant but this is gone all too soon and the film is left all the more disappointing because of it. The film was just... annoying. Nothing stands out as being relevant or even interesting, the characters are, bar one, unlikable and unrelatable and the whole time you have to ask 'what's the point?' - a question the film never answers or even attempts to answer.<br/><br/>The closest I can to connecting with the film was when the two CIA personnel were conversing about what a 'clusterfuck' this all was and finally concluding that they learned nothing from the whole experience.<br/><br/>Was this the film being self-aware? Was the film just an elaborate prank on the viewer? <br/><br/>These two characters may not have learned anything but I did: Ethan and Joel Coen can release any piece of crap they like and they'll still get people lining up to tell them how fantastic it was."

I don't get how this movie received such high reviews, maybe i'm just not getting it. The plot in this movie just drags on and on and there is nothing unique about it. There is no action in this movie and it's neither funny nor witty, and to see that some people found this movie to be intelligent; come on!

But even I could appreciate the trademark dark humour, and the two leads Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand were simply brilliant, although it's a slight shame about the first 20 minutes before they are introduced, which drags somewhat.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is that two gym employees (Pitt and McDormand) find a disc containing the memoirs of ex-CIA agent Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich). The two embark on a mission to track down said CIA agent, hoping to coerce him into paying them a reward for returning the disk to him.<br/><br/>What follows is a hilarious scene with Brad Pitt at his best as a comedic actor, as the dumb jock Chad attempts to blackmail Osbourne Cox over the telephone, as Malkovich portrays a man who has been woken up in the middle of the night by an idiot perfectly, with a slow boiling rage before exploding.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous, unrealistic and filled with holes, but it makes for great entertainment. The film is not overlong either at just 90 minutes in length. As well as an action/crime/comedy the movie also provides us with a character study; examining the selfishness of the characters and their true desires. None of the main characters seem to have a bit of integrity to rub together, and don't expect too many of them to still be alive by the end of the film, just enjoy the ride.

Also noteworthy is that the pace and twists of the movie just climax towards the ending. But most of all it's a great mockery of today's lifestyles. Without giving anything away, it turns out that the characters are all losers in their own pitiful ways. This movie is intended for people who appreciate subtlety and somewhat intellectual humor.

","Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) quits his job at the CIA and puts his thoughts onto a disc, which is picked up by two gym trainers.<br/><br/>The imagination and bizarreness of the Coen brothers will never be appreciated enough and this creative realistic look at the CIA mixed with mid life crises is right up there with Lebowski and Fargo.<br/><br/>Opening from space and zooming down right into the heart of a CIA building will surprise even the hardcore Coen fans and the directional magic the pair conjure never lets up as a camera stays at foot height for the opening sequence, following Malkovich into his destination. The immediate interpretation of the organization is stereotypical sensation, a cold hearted bunch of men in suits telling their man his day is up. Malkovich's reaction is a marvellous turn of anger and amazement and the ""In the line of Fire"" actor never lets his guard down for the entire film.<br/><br/>When we see a group of A list celebrities collaborate it will either be superb or it will fail, and here, everyone is superb. Pitt's s*** stirring Chad is a comic revelation next to Swinton's bitchy stuck up Katie. McDormand may not be as strong as her pregnant Police Chief Marge from Fargo but you will laugh along with her all the way through, and her reaction to seeing Clooney's invention will be with you long after viewing. Speaking of Clooney (Ocean's Eleven) he plays a somewhat significant role to the proceedings. His uninvolved protagonist Harry becomes the King of the chess board at the end of the film, and as we get there, we are seeing a modern day male player, filled with that cheesy charm that you simply have to respect. The star of the show is Pitt who seems to get better and different with every film and that in itself is not easy to do, especially after performances like a certain Tyler Durden. J.K Simmons must be the most under-appreciated actor of the 21st century; he is in all of 2 scenes and has the most memorable impact on the forever twisting narrative.<br/><br/>When looking back, Burn after Reading is hard to cement into a certain genre. The obvious dealings with CIA and the illegal activities fall into the crime, but though a fast ending is not sharp enough to be categorized into a thriller. Not to mention the gritty realism gives the drama and the characters deliver the comedy.<br/><br/>Sharp and gritty, this 2008 Coen picture is equally as impressive as their previous releases and with such a brilliant ensemble of actors, it is unmissable"

","Burn After Reading is an infectious comedy from those pesky Coen brothers. Too bad that many reviewers here couldn't appreciate it. Like all Coen movies, it's strange and often unlike anything else you've seen before. It's fairly characteristic of them rather than a departure from their previous style, so if you've enjoyed their old movies then you should check this one out.<br/><br/>I think it's the kind of movie that grows on you, and which you're going to like even better over the years; the movie has many subtleties in it which you can only spot and appreciate over repeated viewings. But don't worry, you'll get most of it the first time.<br/><br/>Essentially, the movie shows fairly average beltway denizens behaving stupidly, with a good amount of bureaucracy and bad luck stirred in for good measure. It's not so much intellectual satire as much as smart slapstick. I'm not going to go into the cast, but it's both A-list and excellent. Even the bit parts are memorable, and will hopefully provide rich pickings for other directors. And it's got David Rasche (Sledge Hammer) in it, and he's awesome yet again!<br/><br/>Kind of hard to rate this one, but for sheer entertainment value it'd be a straight ten.<br/><br/>Just a few Q&A's you might want to know about this movie:<br/><br/>*Is it a poignant satire of the CiA? A damning indictment of the American secret service and military community in general? Or of the Bush administration? -- Not really. It's not political, it's simply a comedy.<br/><br/>*Many people seem not to have liked this, why? -- Beats me. Maybe they were expecting poignant political satire, when really the movie is just comedy. And the story is fairly complex so that you're left a bit puzzled when the titles roll.<br/><br/>*What's that wedge pillow which Clooney's character takes with him when he's leaving his lover? -- It's a sex wedge, a pillow designed to facilitate the bumping of uglies. Apparently."

","Recap: Osborne Cox is demoted (or fired because he subsequently quits) from his job as an analyst at the CIA. That is the start of a chain of reactions outside anybody's control. It contains secrets, spies, betrayal, the promise of love and cold brutal divorce. With more time on his hands Osborne decide to write his memoirs. Memoirs that through unlikely events end up in the hands of two gym instructors, who thinks the material is secret CIA-material and decide that they are entitled to a big reward. When Cox refuses to pay they turn to the Russian Embassy and then things really get out of hand. And in the middle of it all the CIA wonders what the .... is going on? <br/><br/>Comments: A splendidly written movie with a lot of characters with just a little insight on the entire story. Unknown to each other and themselves, they are all connected to each other, some in multiple ways. And when everyone tries to get a grip on things, they just makes everything worse. And that's what is so fun! For all the right reasons, the make all the wrong moves.<br/><br/>Apart from the story, the Coen brothers have also managed to create some great characters, and cast them with the actors they had in mind when they wrote. The result is interesting characters with actors doing what they do best. Malkovich is splendid in a role written for him, Clooney wins the day with a smile and McDormand is great as the obsessing, plotting woman in trouble way over her head. Best of them all, my favorite is J.K. Simmons as the CIA Superior charged with making sense of this mess (not an easy task).<br/><br/>Everything gives 90 minutes of surprising twists and fun. But it is not hilarious all the time. It sure got its moments, but in between it seems to slow down, or rather to prepare and wind up for the nest of these moments. It's not dull, not close, but there are some stretches were you kind of forget the comedy part, some jokes that not really work. It is a very good movie that lacks a little something to make it great.<br/><br/>7/10"

The CIA guys are probably about the nicest people in the film - they just clear up the mess! and wonderfully they are the only people in the film who haven't got a clue what's going on. Go and see it! Ethan and Joel have produced another masterful mix of the mundane and the bizarre. I wouldn't bother trying to read any plot synopsis - it just wouldn't do the film justice.

","Lsst year saw the Coens reach a new height of success with their multiple Oscar winning, gritty, tense and relentless masterpiece: No Country For old Men. This year they've gone for a more light hearted and comical addition to their film archive with Burn After Reading.<br/><br/>To put it simply, its about some supposedly confidential CIA data that ends up in the hands of some low brow gym workers that want to sell it back to a CIA analyst. The story slowly unravels and the genius of the Coen's screenplay unfolds.<br/><br/>The cast is simply fantastic. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton. Whats unusual about this cast is that they all have a relatively equal role in the film rather than one actor given a leading role to push for an Oscar (like Brolin in W.). Its a film of supporting actors that pull off exceptional performances. In terms of Oscars, I could see Malkovich's portrayal of the clinically insane CIA analyst Osbourne Cox receiving a nomination and possibly Pitt's performance as the dim-witted Chad getting some notice. But all in all a group of convincing and hilarious performances. I could see the Coen's get a nomination for their script but I doubt the academy will give them the award twice in a row unfortunately but a nomination alone is enough to value its merit.<br/><br/>The Coen's comedy is very dry and whats so clever about it is that the humour comes from very topical and trivial situations rather than the cheap comedy you get in spoofs etc. This is clever comedy. For example, Osbourne's over-swearing is oddly hilarious but all the Coen's are doing is presenting a natural reaction. It seems as if they haven't gone out of their way to include the comedy in the script, the comedy speaks for itself in the characters.<br/><br/>Now lets take a step back from the specifics of the film. To put it bluntly, this film is a series of mishaps, follies and misunderstanding between a bunch of incongruous characters. Much like Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing', this film is about nothing, being made a big deal.<br/><br/>I may be jumping the gun here, but I do see this as modern Shakespeare. The nature and unusualness of the story seems to match the quality of Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing' and possibly some of his other poems. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a complex drama but the irony of the story just cries Shakespeare to me. Also, the governmental satire seems to hint Kubrick's Dr Strangelove which is also a film of mishaps met with stupidity.<br/><br/>The Coen's have devised a very smart piece of comedy. I see this as the 'Much ado about nothing' and 'Dr Strangelove' of our time, met with the usual high standards of direction and cinematography with the Coen's Apologies if the reference to Shakespeare appears pretentious as I don't want to present this as a pretentious film. Its a fun, crazy and dryly hilarious.<br/><br/>Absolutely excellent film 8.4/10"

","So far I have not seen any comments from the UK so hopefully I will be among the first. (Thanks to a free preview screening.) <br/><br/>This is one of the funniest films I have seen for a long time.<br/><br/>I can not understand how, in some of the comments, people could find it unfunny, slow (what???), or pointless. Or why they are offended by a few f-words. All a matter of personal taste I suppose.<br/><br/>The film is similar(-ish) to Fargo in that it depicts people who are in over their heads (and in this case EVERYONE is in WAY over their heads), except the tone is not as dark and it is all mostly played for laughs.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is an absolute joy as Chad. Why oh why has he not done more comedy before? George Clooney is great and Frances McDormand is a delight. John Malkovich is, well, just scary.<br/><br/>The film is a cleverly-constructed farce. But there is more to it than that. Recent news stories about missing government information on mislaid disks give it a measure of (maybe accidental) topicality. Besides that, this is a film for our times, depicting paranoia, dishonesty, stupidity, and a sense that no-one from the lowest worker to government high-ups has a grasp of what the real truth is behind any event."

","Great actors and well written. Too slow though. I liked how everyone was tied in, although there was no closure on Katie Cox. The slowness killed it though, it could have been more to the wall. My first thought at the end was how well the title reflected the conclusion of the film, Burn after reading. JK Simmons character did just that when it was completed due to the cluster... The movie seemed more for an older demographic though, both through the actual people that were at the movie as well as the situations that were portrayed in the film-- dating service, reconstructing your body, SEX.

","I donno about others, but I loved this movie! It was kinda hard to guess what it was going to be about from the TV previews but being Coen Bros and Frances McDormand fan, and given that Brad Pitt rarely chooses bad movie roles I figured if nothing the movie should be somewhat entertaining. And true enough it was more than that! Malkovich and Tilda Swinton only add to the amazing talented star power and make this movie a one crazy adventure. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie because even those little tidbits of plot are exactly what makes it so much fun, but I will say that it has the following: this movie is funny, silly, honest and tho far-fetched curiously and realistically believable- which is what makes it that much satirical, tragic and comical. All of the characters have their own issues and quirks and carry the weight of the movie fantastically - you never feel there is only 1 or 2 main characters; there are at least 5 or 6. I seriously cannot say enough about the talented cast which made all those characters come to life."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which sees the Coen's get back on more comedic ground after the darkness of ""No Country For Old Men"".<br/><br/>I think I read somewhere that a lot of movies are about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situation through no fault of their own. In this film the characters seem to get themselves into trouble through their own character flaws, greed, stupidity,paranoia,and hubris to name a few. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Pitt has no problem making himself look foolish. Malkovich plays the self absorbed former CIA agent brilliantly. McDormand is great as the unhappy gym worker, determined to turn her life around at almost any cost. However I find myself tiring of twitches in Clooney's performance that he seems rely on in most of his comedic performances such as in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"". Pesonally I was delighted to see David Rasche, from the brilliant ""Sledge Hammer"" TV show of many years ago.<br/><br/>It is certainly miles away from ""No Country..."" but the Coens still though a few curve-balls at us when we least expect them and that helps the film rise above run of the mill comedies.<br/><br/>Treat yourself to a good laugh, go and see this."

","At a tipping point in the Cohen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"", CIA Superior played by the wonderful J.K. Simmons (""Juno"") and his CIA Officer played by hysterical straight man David Rasche have a profound exchange. Simmons says, ""So what did we learn from all this?"" Bewildered Rasche replies, ""UmÂ… I don't know."" To which Simmons concludes, ""I don't f---ing know either."" That pretty much summed it up for me, after watching an hour and an half of ""Burn After Reading"". And with the movie's conclusion I soon left the theater.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing about Ethan Cohen and Joel Cohen's ""Burn After Reading"" is that it is not funnyÂ—painfully not. You have Oscar Winners George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and Tilda Swinton, and Oscar Nominees Brad Pitt and John Malkovich either playing complete idiots or raving psychos. Granted for some the Cohen Brothers are doing art here. However, the over acting particularly on the part of George Clooney as moronic Treasury Agent Harry Pfarrer, and complete moron personal fitness trainer Chad Feldheimer played by Brad Pitt is utterly embarrassing. The cast could have all taken the advice of Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus from ""Tropic Thunder"", who in a cleaned up and politically correct vernacular advised actors to never play mentally disabled full out. Lazarus said it more plainly than I.<br/><br/>One has to wonder during the making of the movie, that some assistant didn't say, ""Hey George, you might want to throttle back just a tadÂ…"" The Cohen brothers are geniuses; but not here. The only actor that fairs well is Tilda Swinton which is a testament to her prowess and intelligence shining through. Here is the thing: Everyone in ""Burn After Reading"" is stupid playing stupid as opposed to stupid playing smart--which would be funny. There is no inherent irony in the characters. And in the case of Clooney, Pitt, and McDormand their characters have the I.Q. of squash. It's like paraphrasing Forrest GumpÂ—Stupid is, as stupid does. Rather here: stupid is stupid, and not funny.<br/><br/>And with the characters that are not stupid like Malkovich's Osborne Cox; the man is an arrogant unsympathetic ass. I think Swinton, who plays Osborne's wife Katie in part gets a pass for having to put up with all the other idiots and her insufferable husband. Swinton's performance is killer, and has the only semblance of authenticity. Fortunately, the minor characters like the CIA guys, Simmons and Rasche, remind us that ""Burn After Reading"" was intended as a macabre comedy. Giving the Cohen brothers their due: They execute the incongruous and macabre elements to perfection.<br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" is the collision of the stone cold stupid and the heinously arrogant. Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is demoted as the CIA's top analyst, because he is an alcoholic. Instead Oz quits the CIA, and embarks upon writing his memoirs which would reveal classified information vital to national security. Oz's suffering wife is successful physician Katie Cox (Swinton). Katie is secretly having an affair with obtuse Treasury Agent Harry (Clooney). Somehow Oz's memoir CD turns up at a health club, and in the hands of Chad (Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Francis McDormand). Chad realizes that he and Linda could exhort the CD owner for a fortune. Aging personal trainer Linda sees this as the leveraging point for getting the money she desperately needs for cosmetic surgery and liposuction, which her HMO refuses to pay. Self absorbed Linda also pursues a relationship with the married Harry (Clooney) through an on-line dating service. Linda is blatantly unaware that her boss at the club, Ted (Richard Jenkins) is in love with her. Philandering Harry also promises Katie (Swinton) that he will leave his successful Children's book author wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Well, not really. All is intentionally and needlessly convoluted. In the end we really don't learn a f---ing thing. More disappointingly, ""Burn After Reading"" is not really funny."

","Coming off of the hype surrounding ""No Country for Old Men"", Joel and Ethan Coen go back to their roots with this hilarious, offbeat comedy. While this humor might not be for everyone, this film is a delight for the die-hard fans of the Coens. Both Joel and Ethan are brilliant directors, writers, and producers as they have proved with each and every film they have released. ""Burn After Reading"" is probably their quirkiest film to date and with the help of the stellar cast, it could go down as one of their best.<br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" tells the story of a CIA official Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) who gets fired from his job because he is rumored to have a drinking problem. The fun begins when the two gym employees Linda (Frances McDormand) and Chad (Brad Pitt) find a disk that contains what is believed to be secret CIA information. It isn't long before Osborne discovers that he is being blackmailed by these two gym employees who will stop at nothing to get the reward money they feel there are entitled to. Hilarity, great acting, and ""Fargo"" style humor ensuesÂ… <br/><br/>There have been plenty of films over the past few years that have had a cast as big as this one but most of them fail to live up to their true potential. Luckily, ""Burn After Reading"" uses the entire cast as successfully with all the actors and actresses involving giving hilarious, off the wall performances. I could probably go on all day talking about how George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and all the rest of the cast shines thanks to the well written characters and witty dialogue.<br/><br/>Both Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the script for ""Burn After Reading"" and I have to admit the script is the core reason why this film worked as well as it did. When the film first starts you feel that the movie will be extremely complex with a lot of twists and turns but by the time it ends you just laugh because it's such a twisted, silly and overly simple plot. Only the Coen Brothers would be able to pull this off with such style and humor. Besides the plot, you have to applaud the witty and sarcastic dialogue. It's hard to really describe the screenplay as it's like low-brow humor for a high-brow crowd. It's oddly clever.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Burn After Reading"" is a laugh riot from start to finish. It's not your typical mainstream comic caper as most of the humor would be considered ""off beat"" by most. For fans of the Coen's earlier work like ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona"" this film will not disappoint. The cast is superb, the screenplay is quirky and original, and the direction is as great as always. Most importantly, this is a fun film that proves Oscar winning actors don't always have to play a serious role to prove how talented they truly are. I applaud Joel and Ethan Coen for creating a truly unique and funny film that breaks through the mainstream stereotype of what is funny.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Burn After Reading"" is a 8 out of 10."
"rparham","7","2","6","22 September 2008"," A funny entry from the Cohens
","Following on the coat tails of their recent Oscar winner, No Country for Old Men, the creative film-making partnership of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, return to somewhat more familiar territory with their most recent film, Burn After Reading, a comedy in their dark, twisted style. Burn After Reading is not one of the Coen's outstanding efforts, but it is more than amusing enough to warrant a recommendation.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading starts it's focus on Oswald Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who has been reassigned from his position, for, among other things a ""drinking problem"". Infuriated with this decision, Oswald resigns from the CIA, annoying his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and providing the catalyst for her to finally seek out a divorce so she can be with her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney). Oswald decides to begin writing some memoirs in his now ample spare time, a disc copy of which is inadvertently left in the ladies locker room at a local gym, where it is discovered by Linda Lytzke (Frances McDormand) and her co- worker Chad (Brad Pitt). They decide to use the disc to blackmail Oswald for a significant sum of money so that Linda can pay for cosmetic surgery she so desperately wants.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading can more or less be defined as a comedy, although in some ways it is not presented as one. Carter Burwell's score gives the film a generally serious tone, and the Cohen's are not afraid of taking chances that almost no other comedy would even think of doing. That being said, Burn After Reading is a pretty funny film, although it takes a little while for it to get going. There are some chuckles early in the running time, but this is one of those films that you have to build a bit before the laughs really start coming, and by the end, you are hooked.<br/><br/>Much of the film's humor is provided by Brad Pitt in a somewhat out of type performance as dim-bulb personal trainer Chad. His endless preening, and over-the-top exuberance make for many a laugh in the film. George Clooney is also quite funny as sleazy ladies man Harry, who is a mixture or narcissism and infantilism, and Frances McDormand provides a number of amusing scenes a enhancement obsessed Linda.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is definitely a film that fits in the Cohen's oeuvre, similar in tone to their Intolerable Cruelty and Raising Arizona, although not quite as funny as either of those films. Even so, Burn After Reading still provides a considerable number of laughs and is a notch above many other comedies, making Burn After Reading worth a trip to the multiplex."
"isabelle1955","Null","2","6","21 September 2008"," Contemplate After Watching
","I enjoyed the Coen's Brothers Burn After Reading, but perhaps not quite as much as I'd hoped, after seeing the trailers for weeks beforehand. The trailers definitely featured all of the best bits, and, I think, rather spoiled it for me.; instead of whetting the appetite, they built up the expectation to such an extent that it would have been hard not to be slightly disappointed by the actual product. Let's be honest here, the story is pretty slim and very contrived, the characters mostly stereotypes. But, it was fun to see that many big stars on the screen in one vehicle and they all appeared to be having a good time. This is most definitely an ""Oh look, there'sÂ…"" movie, and it's enjoyable on that level, but it doesn't pay to read too much into it. For a light comedy, the violence when it came was rather shocking, perhaps out of place in such a film. I felt that perhaps this movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be, a biting satire or a fall about comedy. There's a difference.<br/><br/>In brief, two self obsessed gym employees (I hesitate to use the word 'instructors' because all the gym instructors I know are such nice, well balanced people!) find a CD in the locker room, a CD which appears to contain some CIA files. The files belong to one Osborne Cox (a beautifully malevolent John Malkovitch), recently defrocked by the CIA for his alcohol habit and now filling his empty days at home with bad memoir writing and step aerobics. Unbeknownst to him, he is about to be divorced by his viper-tongued, doctor wife Katie (fabulous and astonishingly slim Tilda Swinton), who is having an affair with Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney), whose author wife is having an affair with some other guyÂ….and so on. Harry is himself a compulsive seducer, who picks up women via the internet. The files on the CD are worthless, but our two heroes Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are certain they have something of value to 'the enemy' and try selling them to a rather bemused Russian embassy employee. The Russians? Yes, the RussiansÂ… a running theme throughout the movie. And they can't even see Russia from where they live in DCÂ….. Linda wants money for plastic surgery. Chad's motives are less specific if equally dubious Â– he seems to just want the adventure of being a big shot. Linda meanwhile has a date with Harry, and all the characters get interlocked.<br/><br/>Now much has been made of Brad Pitt's performance in this movie, and it's certainly entertaining to watch, not because you think ""Wow! What a wonderful characterization of a gym bunny,"" but because you think ""Wow! Brad Pitt is aging well,"" (he is) and ""Hey! So a guy interested in architecture and world peace doesn't take himself so seriously that he can't have fun playing an idiot!"" In fact my main criticism of this movie is that Brad didn't take his shirt off. But you're never, ever in any danger of forgetting that this is Brad Pitt. His death (at the hands of a surprised Harry, when discovered hiding in a closet) is untimely and rather cruel and unnecessarily graphic and blood spattered, I felt. <br/><br/>The scenes in the Russian embassy are fun; the picture of Putin looking down from the wall over the shoulder of the chain smoking, skeptical Soviet diplomat. Other small details are fun too; the tedious subject matter (the workings of Congress) of the children's books Harry's wife writes, Chad donning a geeky cycle helmet and biking to his blackmail encounter with Cox. And Frances McDormand holds the whole thing together; Linda is a heart breaking character, searching for Mr Right in a cynical world of bed hoppers, banking on surgery to improve her chances, and convinced that this CIA CD is her one big break. McDormand is great. Ted Treffon (Richard Jenkins) is perhaps the one totally straightforward character in the movie, he adores Linda just the way she is, but ends up dead for his pains, hammered to death by Cox who finally cracks up. Jenkins (who delighted in The Visitor) produces possibly the best acting in this movie. His was the only character to appear where I didn't think ""Oh look. There's..."" There are certainly laugh aloud moments in this film. The two CIA bosses (J.K. Simmons and David Rasche) are fabulous in their surreal discussion of body disposal, yet it left me feeling it could have been better, and I'm really not quite sure what it was trying to say beyond DC is a sad and dysfunctional place. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm trying to read too much into it?"

The humor was sharp, witty and darker than the average person would expect from the previews leaving the audience gasping in crucial scenes. The movie was as uncomfortable to watch as Fargo (I love Fargo for its awkwardness) yet somehow managed to be as funny as the Big Lebowski and as over-the-top as Hudsucker Proxy.

This is a classic Coen comedy.<br/><br/>Another thing bothering me about the reviews are people commenting on specific performances and how great they were, this is a waste of time and effort. The ENTIRE cast brings their A-Game and if you have Pitt, Clooney, Malkovich, McDormand, Swinton, Jenkins and Simmons bringing their best, then you have a powerful ensemble cast to be reckoned with. It would be unfair to point out how awesome Clooney was or Pitt or any particular person because every single actor in this movie does a spectacular job. They embodied their characters humorously and realistically, I have a feeling people are mistaking more interesting characters for better performances.<br/><br/>The story, upon some scrutiny is a bit jumbled and hackneyed, which is the only reason it didn't get a 10/10 from me. However, the slightly muddied plot never once interferes with the pure joy and FUN being had by the cast, the filmmakers and therefore, the audience. That's what Burn After Reading is all about having some goofy, if at times dark and adult, FUN! These are some of the best actors/directors of our time just saying ""Screw it! We just did a serious film, let's goof off for a while"" and I can attest I enjoyed the ride thoroughly."

The movie feels like something of a combination of the Big Lebowski, Fargo, and Syriana. In a way, it is the darkly comic twin of No Country For Old Men. I was just expecting a fun dark comedy, but the social commentary was actually well done and gave this film a better feel to it. The humor in this film was great. My theater was cracking up for half the movie. Great visual gags, Clooney's sex life, the one liners, and the quirky characters and conversations make this movie funnier than Step Brothers, Pineapple Express, or Tropic Thunder. Of course, this film isn't as good as No Country For Old Men, but this is still one all Coen fans should go see.<br/><br/>I give this movie a strong 8/10, and put it at #88 on my top 100 list.

At times it's cheeky and over the top, but it can also be very serious. The laughs were not frequent from me, but for some reason, the same heart pounding I got from No Country for Old Men, I got at times in this. Really, this was not one of the Coen's best works, though it was still good and entertaining.<br/><br/>Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) has just been fired from the CIA, and he doesn't want to tell his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) the truth. She's got some secrets of her own, and she's been cheating on Osborne for psychotic charmer Harry (George Clooney), and Katie is secretly in the process of getting a divorce from her husband. Meanwhile, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is in the process of getting plastic surgery, and she's trying to find a love online, and she meets Harry. Chad (Brad Pitt) works at Hardbodies Gym with Linda, and he finds Osborne's files which were mistakenly left in the women's room. Linda and Chad try to give the files back to Osborne, and expect a small reward in return, he takes it offensively. Chaos ensues as many interconnected stories are told.<br/><br/>The actors were really great here. George Clooney and Frances McDormand are over the top, but funny. Tilda Swinton is perfectly cast as the rude woman she plays. John Malkovich is good at being angry, so he too was perfectly cast. Brad Pitt is a great addition to the cast a the flamboyant and clueless gym worker, and probably was my favorite character, as he was most likable. The other characters were inconsistent as to whether they were likable or not, though whether or not they were, the actors always portrayed them brilliantly.<br/><br/>The stories are okay. At times the movie drags, but usually it's well paced. The script is random and typical Coen strange. It's too serious to be a comedy, and too goofy comedic to be serious, so what we have is a movie stuck in genre limbo, never really reaching any genre successfully. It wants to be a comedy more than anything, but never fully reaches it's goal.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good, not great, outing for the Coens, with a lighter tone than some of their pictures, but pales as a follow up to No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 95 mins.

It's nuanced, fun, the actors are great not simply because they are big and talented but because of the characters they play unique for them and work well.

The film is a bit of a send up of spy pictures like ""Three Days of the Condor"" or ""Enemy of the State"" (an under appreciated spy flick of the 90s). In this Coen Brother version of a spies and espionage, it's a world populated by a bunch of dumbbells (George Clooney, David Rasche, J.K. Simmons, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton), who end up circling a couple of fitness trainers (Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) who stumble upon a draft of Malkovich's autobiography and thinks they've discovered top secret material they could sell to the Russians. From there this screwball comedy gets even crazier and sillier. I don't think I busted a gut quite as hard as I did for ""Raising Arizona,"" but this film does have that same kind of silly frenetic tone that is unique to the Coens, so if you enjoyed that film, you'll probably enjoy this one, thought likely not quite as much."
"tabuno","7","1","2","20 January 2019"," A Tragic Comedy About Middle-Age Dumb People
","10 April 2009. This movie is a quirky black comedy about the craziness of relationships, self-obsessions, and mistaken-who-done-its starring George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, and Tilda Swinton. The delicate balance of drama and black comedy precariously teeters and barely survives a credible ending. The characters are fascinating, particularly Brad Pitt's pretty out there in his wankiness. George Clooney also offers a rather compelling and out of character performance. Overall, the movie seems to over-reach its target and the script isn't quite as tight nor as satisfying as the characters themselves. By the end, one feels that while the movie was fun, entertaining, and yes tragic, there just seems to be something missing to be completely satisfied with the movie. 7/10."

"kai_lyou","5","1","2","7 March 2018"," Very Confusing Movie
","Burn After Reading is a dark comedy directed by Joel Coen and his brother Ethan Coen. Burn After Reading has a score of 66 on Metacritic, 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a three out of four by Roger Ebert. The idea that the Coens are trying to convey is how plans can go incredibly wrong. One example is when one of the protagonists, Osborne Cox, plans to write a memoir of his time in the CIA. This plan, however, goes astray and ends with Cox being put into a coma. Another example of plans going awry in Burn After Reading was when Chad Feldheimer plans to ""give"" Cox's memoir back for a sum of money. His plan also goes horribly wrong, and Feldheimer is shot in the head.
 The plot of Burn After Reading is confusing; it is often interrupted by the comedic element of the movie. Linda Litzke is a protagonist, and her dates are often made fun of as a joke. This becomes confusing when Litzke goes on a date that is important to the plot. This scene, however, is easily ignored because we expect her date to be a joke. This makes the rest of the plot after this scene confusing because it isn't made clear that the date isn't a joke. The plot is also confusing because the acting appeared forced and characters had no motivation for their actions. One example is when Feldheimer tracks down Cox it is for no purpose except to advance the plot.
 Even with its flaws, Burn After Reading has marvelous cinematography; its camera cuts are perfectly timed and precise. One scene that displays the quality of the cinematography is the opening shot. The camera lowers from the sky into a building and seamlessly cuts into Cox walking down the hall as if it is all a single shot. I give Burn After Reading five out of ten stars because, despite the excellent cinematography, the plot is confusing and is advanced by actions that made no sense. Burn After Reading is a complex but confusing movie that I suggest you not watch."
"Screen_Blitz","8","1","2","25 August 2016"," Burn After Reading is dark, funny, and solidly smart with a wise direction
","This satirical dark comedy isn't terribly astonishing or groundbreaking in any way, but being another outing from the Coen Brothers, the masterminds behind films like 'Blood Simple', 'Raising Arizona', 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their most critically acclaimed 'Fargo'; it is difficult to resist the curiosity of this darkly funny picture. From beginning to end, it comes clear that Joel and Ethan Coen still have the smart and talent they brought have to the screen since their debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. Starring an all-star cast of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Tilda Swinton; this intelligent dramedy piece mixes the directors' signature style of humor and violence, with a decently crafted plot to keep viewers engaged. In the end, viewers will have experienced another triumphant piece of cinema by the efforts of the Coen Brothers. The film enters John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, a Balkan CIA agent who is resigned from his position due to his alcoholism, and decides his best chance of making money is through starting a writing career. He types up a memoir of his life and saves it on a disc which is unexpectedly found in the hands of Fitness manager Linda Litzke (played by Frances McDormand) and her assistant Chad Feidheimer (played by Brad Pitt). The two dimwits make a desperate attempt to sale it for money, but end up involved a series of unfortunate circumstances including a dangerous encounter with Harry Pfareer (played by George Clooney), a man who Osbourne's wife Katie (played by Tilda Swinton) is secretly seeing. <br/><br/>If you've followed through the Coen Brothers' filmography, you are likely to be aware of some their trademarks including their aestheticization of dark, morbid humor and idiosyncratic characters -- both of which are encompasses in this; and like in their previous work, it is all done with the directors' beautiful writing and style of direction. The plot, though nothing special, is beautifully crafted and moves at an appropriately steady pace. As the plot goes on, it spends just enough time to develop the not-so-smart characters while setting up some unpredictable thrills that are bound to take you by surprise, some of which end in bloody results. While there isn't too much thrills to experience, there are a fair amount of laughs to endure not just from the darkly humorous dialogue through the characters' stupidity in confronting dangerous situations. Yes, the characters are dumb and the movie is aware of this, but they're also charismatic thanks to the Coen Brothers ingenious writing. Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's wife and frequent collaborator of the brothers' filmography, comes out on top above the cast, delivering an endearing performance; perhaps even more so than her Oscar-winning as the pregnant police chief in 'Fargo'. This actress bring immense charm and humanity to her character. By the end, it is say safe she steals the show. Brad Pitt is also very appealing in his role, both funny and intriguing in a way that makes his character not stand out, but decently likable. George Clooney and John Malkovich are also granted their time to shine here, and the same can be expressed about Tilda Swinton as the wife of John Malkovich's character. While I can't say their performances fall in the Oscar calibur, they are with all honesty, difficult not to admire. <br/><br/>Burn After Reading is immensely entertaining with tremendous performances, an engrossing direction by Joel and Ethan Coen, a beautifully crafted plot, and a fair share of hilarity mixed with a dark atmosphere. This movie offers just another decent opportunity to experience the extravagant filmmaking that makes the Coen Brothers two of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the realm of cinema. In fair words, this one is definitely recommended."

","When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his job as a CIA analyst, he decides to write a memoir about his career. His wife Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton) is looking to divorce Osborne, so she copies their bank records on a disc, along with meaningless rambling about the CIA by Osborne. When two gym employees Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) find the disc they mistake it for top secret government documents and decide to use it to blackmail Osborne. When that goes wrong they decide to sell the disc. That's basically the story. There's so much going on that it's easy to get lost, but it's incredibly funny and at the end you just find yourself wondering what happened. It's easy to compare this to The Big Lebowski, another Coen brothers film that pretty much seems to be about nothing. While I wouldn't say that this is as good as that film, Burn After Reading still has the feeling of comedic randomness that only the Coens can provide. Go check it out."

","Solid, big fun with the Coen Brothers. Best watched in English.<br/><br/>The movie of course can not keep up entirely with other ""serious"" Coen movies, but is a solid, entertaining comedy, IMO way better than the other Coen comedy ""Intolerable Cruelty"".<br/><br/>The fun and the interesting part of the movie IMO is the presence of at least 3 big shots of Hollywood, Clooney, Pitt and Malkovich. All of them playing the roles of naives, fools, and lightly retarded guys. While we already know this role of McDormand in other Coen movies, there are not many comparable roles of these 3. In this regard, Brad Pitt does the best (or most convincing) acting job here IMO, Malkovich is also great, while Clooney tends to overact the role of the simpleton a bit, I think. Still, very enjoyable to see big names acting as fools, it's one of the inherent qualities of the movie.<br/><br/>You'll never see Pitt dying in a funnier way, and you'll learn something about Schwinn bikes.<br/><br/>Hint for ""foreigners"": watch it in English if possible, for example in German the movie loses much due to the inappropriate (""political correct"") translation."

","Whenever superb seasoned actors are given silly acts to play, that is painful. This movie would have done better with a bunch of newbie actors and not veteran actors. The plot is silly. CIA is more of ""Can't Investigate Anything"" sort of entity in this movie which is far from real. None of the characters actually fit in into this story line. Brad Pitt and Mr.Clooney deserved a better script and more serious action roles. Rest of the actors were relatively unknowns. These could be easily placed into the character roles.

That said, the cast in this movie contains some of my favourite actors, so I can't fault any of the performances at all. Brad Pitt in particular threw himself into his role!

","Burn After Reading is funny. After a brooding bout with some dense material in No Country for Old Men, the Coen's choose to engage in some rambunctious mimicry of the political spy thriller. Featuring a blessing of a cast, Burn After Reading tells the story of an idiotic ensemble, too lost in themselves to find anything worthwhile. The scariest part is -- the story is about us. And it's convincing.<br/><br/>Word has it that Joel and Ethan were particularly inspired by Advise and Consent and Seven Days in May. (The poster design is clearly modeled after the Saul Bass work on The Man With the Golden Arm. The same man did the title design for Advise and Consent.) The brothers' rich history of deft genre study is not absent here. In deconstructing the political thriller, we are shown a universe not far from our own -- one where everyone is too involved with their own desires to be bothered by anything happening around them. The score is full of dramatic percussion. Indeed, the story beats a hollow body. There's nothing to respond to these characters. Burn After Reading has the intelligence to exclude Washington bureaucracy out of this debate. The government employees are the most intelligent and reliable populace in the film. Still, they are clueless about the incomprehensible ambitions of their constituency. Burn After Reading manages to elaborate on a valuable insight regarding human folly without becoming bogged down by didactic crap.<br/><br/>In addition to the peripheral characters whom the Coen's occasionally allow to steal a scene, Burn is populated by a cast that is marvelous in name and in performance. It's full of exciting discoveries. Pitt, Malkovich, Swinton, and Jenkins deliver sensational work. The tradition of strategic director/actor pairing is as old as our technology. Burn is a testament to the virtues of adventurous casting. Pitt's stupidity isn't unlike his Tyler Durden, but it is more honest and, frankly, more revealing. Malkovich's vulgarity takes full advantage of his terrifying snarl. McDormand and Clooney are equally energizing and give their finest work with the brothers. McDormand's hesitancy and self-consciousness are a maturation of her sticky grin in Fargo. Clooney plays a character not far from Everett, but does so with more paranoia and swagger. A- list casts are cause for suspicion these days, but this is a marvelous example of how good an audacious Hollywood can be.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have always relied heavily on quirky resonance to their detriment. Their comedy is strongest when played with extended takes and mannered photography. We see much of that in Burn After Reading. They allow us to witness a more natural interaction with some marvelous actors and their expressive faces. However, these filmmakers seem to lean on wide shots as a punctuation, not a narrative fact. Their compositions have such a rich sense of space, but the shots stay in the can. It's a shame, really. The humor is built on interaction and interplay, not crafty visual manipulation. I only pick nits, though. They can stack up as many close-ups as they want as long as they retain the appreciation for long takes. It's a lost art in dire need of preservation. Drama is born of the long take.<br/><br/>The brothers function on the assumption that Comedy + Tragedy = Reinvention. It's a hopeless aspiration, but is it possible that they do it better than anyone else? Their best work does float in the land between straight-faced seriousness and banana-peel slapstick. This seems to be a corollary of insistent genre study. In an effort to subvert and deconstruct classic models, the Coen's manage to create scenarios with a greater complexity and density than is present in most popular contemporary filmmaking. Burn After Reading doesn't even seem like a spy film. It has such a deep respect for the dignity of classic convention that the subversion reads like an entirely new creation. Perhaps the slight lack of center in the film is a result of their appreciation for these conventions. Regardless, the Coen brothers are one of the most respectable filmmaking parties at work for precisely this reason.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading functions on steadfast but unforgiving fatalism. This is a common trope in Coen films, but only here is it made entirely explicit. To these filmmakers, human choice is independent of a crushing omnipotence. A CIA agent remarks, ""Well, we don't really know what anyone is after"" when presented with a summary of the film's puzzling event sequence. If there is a thesis to Burn After Reading, it's that we're all helpless creatures, floundering and philandering, smothered by our own desire. Like most of the Coen ouevre, the film ultimately becomes a thick tragedy. These characters, idiotic as they may seem, stand in for all of us.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of shrugging U.S. bureaucracy, we are all deemed incapable of governing ourselves.<br/><br/>79.3"

","Murder, blackmail, espionage â€“ and this is a comedy? But Burn After Reading, the Coen brothers' latest film, is hilarious. Joel and Ethan Coen, who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay, have created an ensemble of wacky, egocentric characters whose worlds collide with disastrous results after a computer disk falls into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) are clueless, greedy gym employees who find the disk containing personal and Â­financial files of Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who quits his job after Â­being demoted. Linda and Chad are sure the data is top-secret government information, and since Linda needs money for cosmetic surgery, they Â­decide to blackmail Osbourne.<br/><br/>Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) gets tangled up in the mess too. He's involved with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton) and Linda â€“ and he's married.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading may initially appear to be a lighthearted comedy, but, as Chad puts it, ""appearances can be ... deceptive."" The Coen brothers wrote the screenplay while they were writing No Country for Old Men. In both movies, the deaths of innocent people are not taken very seriously, and there are no consequences for the killers; so the ending of Burn After Reading is unsettling for me.<br/><br/>Why is this movie doing so well at the box office? The answer is simple: big names. I admit that my main reason for seeing it was that it was done by the Coen brothers. As for the actors, I don't think the characters would have been as amusing if they hadn't been played by A-list celebrities; at least Chad (the funniest, in my opinion) wouldn't have been as funny. He is the epitome of idiocy and artlessness, and yet, audiences love him, because he's Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Overall, it was the quirky personalities of the characters and the talent of the actors who portrayed them that gave this movie its distinctive quality."

","Burn After Reading is a movie which starts with great promise, thanks mostly to John Malkovich who plays newly fired CIA analyst Osbourne Cox. Initially it seems this is the character who will be the focus of the movie. If only. All too quickly the movie veers away from Osbourne and that's a shame because Malkovich is easily the best thing this movie has going for it. Once the focus shifts to other characters the movie begins to fizzle out. Osbourne pops up now and again and whenever he does Malkovich injects some life back into the movie. But those moments are all too fleeting. As the story plays out you want to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. It started so well. And it is after all a Coen brothers movie. These guys obviously know what they're doing right? But as the movie slogs along you eventually come to the point where you realize it's just not going to happen. This movie is never going to come together properly. In a nutshell it turns out to be a black comedy without any comedy. And who wants to see something like that? Yes, even the best filmmakers miss the mark sometimes. This is no Fargo or Lebowski. This is in the end a real disappointment.<br/><br/>This is a movie about some incredibly stupid people. You would think that would at least provide the opportunity to laugh at all the stupidity on display. But these people are too pathetic to laugh at. What we see here is more sad than funny. Brad Pitt plays gym employee Chad Feldheimer and this character is indescribably stupid. Mere words can not possibly express how dumb this fellow is. And Pitt really seems to be overacting, trying so hard to make something out of this dim bulb. But the effort fails. The character is a joke but not a funny one. What an incredibly annoying character Chad turns out to be. And fellow gym employee Linda Litzke, played by Frances McDormand, isn't much better. At least McDormand is more subtle than Pitt in expressing her character's stupidity. That's something I guess. Completing the circle of stupidity is George Clooney playing U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer. On the surface it may seem that Harry's smarter than the other dopes. He's not. Anyhow these idiots find themselves caught up in something way beyond the capacity of their feeble little brains and that should lead to some good laughs. But it never does. The only good moments come when Osbourne Cox pops up as Malkovich is always good for some memorable volcanic eruptions. But mostly we're just dragging our way towards a finish which leaves some characters looking back and wondering what exactly was the point of all this. That's a very good question. The whole thing was rather pointless. And rather unfunny. All in all it's a very disappointing effort from a directing tandem we've come to expect such great things from."

No ""cliche"" easy one-liners here but a well-acted character study with range and comedic depth unlike anything you're used to seeing from Hollywood these days. Malkovich is pretty much the only character that shows resemblance to former roles but his intensity and absurd situation keep with an edge needed to keep the action interesting. Pitt like you've never seen him before. Clooney with a swagger but very vulnerable underneath it all. No ""Oceans XX"" for either of them.

Here he is unrecognizable from many of his recent roles. In this movie he is playing a dufus to the hilt. He looks like he enjoys what he's doing.

Malkovich was fine. He is always good for a crazed guy kind of role.<br/><br/>Story: don't expect any major plots and twists, but more a study of some very interesting (aka dumb) characters.

","I watched Burn After Reading with some trepidation. Reviews had been largely positive and it was portrayed as a madcap kind of comedy, but other than Raising Arizona I have never laughed much at Coen Brother movies and usually end up with a mildly bitter aftertaste. And so it went. In the end I think it disappointed both myself and my husband for a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>One reason was that, with the exception of the poor schmuck who gets axed and shot to death, there were no likable characters. Isn't it kind of MOVIE 101 that you need to care about some of the characters? I mean, other than the one person with the least screen time? That doesn't mean the characters can't be flawed, but shouldn't they have some redeeming qualities too? Basically I don't understand why we're supposed to enjoy watching people who the Directors and Actors describe as ""stupid"" doing a bunch of stupid things for unsavory reasons. I also don't understand this notion that somehow stupid automatically = funny. (Christopher Guest movies, also so promising, mostly suffer from this same problem.) <br/><br/>The impression I got, especially from watching the extras, is that the actors enjoy these movies because people like Brad Pitt and George Clooney get to play against type, which must be fun for them. And all of the actors seem to enjoy working the Coens, etc. The Coens clearly have a vision of what they want and they have all the requisite skills to make great films, except, I don't know, heart. They write characters that they don't like. (I didn't see No whatever for Old Men which may have been a great movie.) They portray a world where the nice guy gets killed and the idiot shallow woman gets her cosmetic surgery. I guess we're supposed to see that as Irony, and/or Reality or something. Instead it just seems arrogant to me - sort of like good-looking people mocking that frumpy singing sensation from England for being frumpy - it diminishes the person doing the mocking.<br/><br/>We didn't turn the movie off - we waited to see how it ended. We agreed that the performances were good and, yes, Brad Pitt was surprising and fun (although the ultimate dumb blonde male performance not yet surpassed was Bill Pullman in Ruthless People). The fact that the movie held our attention just intensified the disappointment."

","When I first watched this film I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. After friends recommended 'The Big Lebowski' as a film I would enjoy I can honestly say I did and became an instant fan of the Coen brothers work such as the brilliantly tense 'No country for old men'. However the difference between the two films is the more i watch 'The Big Lebowski'the more I enjoyed the hidden messages and characters, this is the opposite for 'Burn After Reading'. I have watched the film on several occasions and increasingly come to despise the characters depicted. I understand this may be the point the Coen brothers wanted to portray in their film but it almost becomes unbearable to watch knowing that in all likelihood there are people in this world as shallow and devoid of any redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is outstanding as a brainless gym worker and Malkovich as the foulmouthed agent is hilarious and a joy to watch, however Frances McDormands character is sometimes hard to watch as her character becomes increasingly grating to the viewer to the point that she overshadows the comedic value of the film."

For me the best features of their films are/were characters, dialog and normality in absurdity. But in this film I had the feeling that absurd characters were created in sake of inventing absurd characters (I had the same feeling while watching No Country for Old Men). Also the structure is loose and the interconnections are way too forced. At certain times the film gets, I feel sorry to say but, boring and needs a better plot structure to keep it together and for me it lacks of it most of the time. The best thing in the film was John Malkovich; he was outstanding! Surely every film has its buyers but I have to admit this film disappointed me considering the cast and of course the creators.

Yet the Coens have showcased their comical range, from ""The Big Lebowski"" to ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and with ""Burn After Reading"" they choose to a silent wink into audiences of humor movies of today.<br/><br/>In the film, people know that a disk of the CIA should be important, should bring money, but they cannot fathom to understand how or where to use it. They are scabbards of a society that teaches what is good and bad without explaining. Thus, we are converted into stupid people with stupid plans. The laughing parts are dry, mainly because of the lack of empathy to the common viewer, but this is what creates it's unique style: not to laugh at them, but to laugh at ourselves, and our suppressed modern Neanderthal."
"MartinHafer","5","2","7","8 July 2009"," Well made but it felt incredibly detached.
","This was an odd film--and I don't mean this in a favorable way. That's because unlike most Coen Brothers movies I have seen, I felt almost nothing favorable towards any of the characters and it all just seemed very detached and, at times, uninteresting. While I can respect the intricacy of the plot and the good acting, I just felt like I could not have cared less about the movie and could have just as easily turned it off and not finish it. In fact, had it not been a Coen Brothers film, I probably would have done just that. Fortunately, the movie did get a little better towards the end, but not enough to make the time I invested in it worth the payoff.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the film didn't seem to know whether it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. And, if it was meant to be a comedy, the very graphic killings later in the film weren't the funny FARGO type but just violent. This much violence and cursing kill the comedy, though I still am not sure that it was meant to be a comedy...even on a dark level.<br/><br/>The other problem is that no one in the film is particularly nice or even that interesting. In fact, it's almost as if the film is trying to say that everyone is bad and it's all very meaningless. Perhaps, but I just found this made the film a hard one to relate to or care about, even if the acting was generally good.<br/><br/>""Blah""--a word I never would have thought I'd apply to a Coen Brothers film. I've seen all their films and I must say this is the first one that was blah among them. Even their failures are very good and challenging...this one was just blah."
"greenlivinisthelife","10","2","7","23 December 2008"," Now I can forgive them for ""No Country for Old Men""
","I was angry when I finished watching ""No Country for Old Men"". The Coen Brothers know morons, not evil people.<br/><br/>In this amazingly written and directed film, morons walk freely among us, and then they die! The people at the gym, the guy at the CIA, the socially maladjusted doctor, the marshall who never drew his gun... They're morons. They're morons who would have all lived to a ripe old age, except that they met. Large concentrations of morons are very bad for each other.<br/><br/>We are led to believe for a moment that Malkovich's character may have some intelligence floating around in his booze-soaked skull, but even he, in spite of his toughness, is a moron.<br/><br/>Not one frame of this film is wasted. Nothing is the least bit predictable. The characters are believable, just like the teller at the bank who doesn't know how to use the computer is believable. This is the most watchable film the Coen Brothers have done since ""Raising Arizona""."
"seawalker","8","2","7","27 November 2008"," ""Burn After Reading"" is good. It is very good.
","I have a strange and disturbing relationship with movies made by the Coen brothers. More often than not I will go to see one of their films at the cinema, dislike it intensely, dismiss it and then months or years later, after re watching it on DVD or TV, discover that it is actually a little masterpiece. It happened with ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Fargo"". It didn't happen with ""The Ladykillers"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (I hated them both) or ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (I loved them from the start).<br/><br/>I wasn't even going to bother to see ""Burn After Reading"". No particular reason. I just didn't fancy it. A lot of A-listers acting dumb in a clever-clever movie? Nah. Thanks, but no thanks. It was only a 'I've-missed-the-bus-what-else-is-on-at-the-cinema?' scenario that led me to deciding that it might be worth a look.<br/><br/>I am so glad that I did. I thought that ""Burn After Reading"" was kind of wonderful. Farce is a very difficult thing to pull off, but with ""Burn After Reading"" the Coen Brothers manage it with aplomb. I thought it was a very funny film.<br/><br/>I think the key to the success of ""Burn After Reading"" was down to the way that the Coen Brothers cast every single role perfectly, openly utilising the common public personas of their very strong cast. Frances McDormand is kooky. Brad Pitt is a himbo. John Malkovich is strange. Tilda Swinton is an ice queen. J. K. Simmons is gruff. George Clooney is... what else? A ladies man. (George Clooney, in fact, is truly superb and has never been funnier.)<br/><br/>Of course the plot is guff. Some nonsense about spies, secrets, infidelity, misunderstandings and sudden death (very surprising that bit). Maybe the Coens should have called it ""Spy Farce""? Actually, that would have been a pretty good title.<br/><br/>""Burn After Reading"" is good. It is very good. Enjoy."

","Yes, this movie is a lesser Coen Bros movie, the story hardly makes sense, the characters are mostly idiots and the human race is in general treated with contempt, but that didn't stop me enjoying it. The Coens simply don't employ bad actors, though Brad Pitt went beyond his range a bit as one of two airhead gym employees (the other is played by Frances McDormand) who try to blackmail a former CIA operative. That operative is played, all stops out, by John Malkovich, and his icy wife by Tilda Swinton. Her lover is played by George Clooney, being a real sleaze for once. There is also a wonderful cameo by JK Simmons as a CIA bigwig which probably does that organisation more damage than the Bay of Pigs invasion. As this character says, the story doesn't make sense, but if you stick around (the film is only 90 minutes long) you will be treated to some pretty subversive comedy and a feast of good acting. I happen to see this film the day after ""A quantum of solace: the Coen Brothers are a good antidote to the idiocies of the spy genre."

","The people who won't like this movie are people who prefer 'low brow' comedies like Larry, The Cable Guy's 'Witless Protection'. Ugh. However, if you have a brain, and use it on a regular basis, this movie is for you. It's well thought out, has many twists and unexpected turns and the acting was wonderful. Brad Pitt was particularly hilarious! The cast alone should tell EVERYONE that this is a quality movie and worth the 2 hours to see it. Raters who didn't like it are people EXPECTING an obvious Hollywood ending that many have been conditioned to want from a movie. But in my opinion, that type of ending is predictable and requires merely a 2-dimentional thinking process. You won't get that with this movie. Great movie, great acting, great ending. Loved it!"

"barrys82","10","2","7","27 October 2008"," An absolute ten to the Coen brothers
","The Coen brothers are back to their filming roots with this movie. Burn After Reading is a film with no pretensions, its only purpose is to entertain the viewer with some fantastic black humor, a characteristic in Coen's films, and very nice action and adventure. It has a very simple yet interesting story and a very well developed plot about A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to benefit from the discovery, a paranoid married man who is having an affair with the CIA agent's wife and the one gym employee becomes inadvertently involved. Each character of the movie have a conflict of their own but at the same time shares a common conflict. The movie starts with a slow rhythm but as the movie moves along it take a quick step until the end making it a very enjoyable movie. The cast is wonderful full of all star actors. John Malkovich in the role of an ex CIA agent is wonderful, Frances McDormand's performance is excellent, George Clooney is also very convincing and funny, Brad Pitt is fabulous is his role of a clumsy gym employee, he is a natural comedian, David Rasche, J K Simmons and Richard Jenkins are very good in their supporting roles, the only one I felt wasn't in the same mood as the others was Tilda Swinton, her performance was good but without the necessary energy. In conclusion, maybe the comedy of the year so far. Its intelligent, entertaining and enjoyable. Definitely a must see movie. Fully recommended."

","Burn After Reading (2008)<br/><br/>After the violent and poetic 'No Country For Old Men' which won 4 Oscars, the Coen Brothers seem revitalised and come back with this intelligently written, heartless and hilarious black comedy. Burn After Reading is pretty much as good as it can be.<br/><br/>When the disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent is found by two 'lightheaded' gym employees, they attempt to sell it for a reward. Little did they know that their actions will have grave consequences involving a variety of characters (including even the Russians and CIA bosses).<br/><br/>John Malkovich is the frustrated CIA agent Osbourne Cox, his wife, a stone cold bitch who by the way happens to be a paediatrician is Tilda Swinton, her lover George Clooney who is a Treasury Executive. Other characters include Brad Pitt as a stupid gym employee and Frances MacDormand as his associate. The casts includes other known faces such as JK Simmons and Richard Jenkins.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is one of the best films of this 'cinematic year' and has a good chance for some Oscar nominations next year. A supporting actor nomination for John Malkovich, who is superb; an editing nomination and most likely another Original Screenplay nomination for the Coens.<br/><br/>A comedy about infidelity, the cruel nature of humanity and the stupidity of intelligence forces.<br/><br/>Great fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"MaximumMadness","9","2","7","27 September 2008"," ""Burn After Reading""- A brilliant film that is primarily about... absolutely nothing!
","To say ""Burn After Reading"" has very little plot is an understatement. In fact, upon closer observation, that seems to be the exact point that the Accadamy-Award winning directors the Cohen brothers are going for. Despite all the chaos, cursing and violence in the film, it is all for almost no reason whatsoever. Well, actually, the film is about something, and it isn't something the previews will tell you about- it is about Frances McDormand's character trying to get plastic surgery so she can ""reinvent"" herself. That's about it for the actual plot.<br/><br/>And to a lesser extent, you could say it is about a love ""octogon"" (I don't say ""triangle"" because it doesn't have enough sides for this film) between the characters portrayed by John Malkovich (an ex-CIA agent who is becoming increasingly erratic), George Clooney (An oversexed agent who is cheating on numerous women- including his wife- simultaneously) and Tilda Swinton. (Malkovich's wife who wants a divorce- she is sleeping with Clooney and apparently wants to be with him.)<br/><br/>Oh, and you get Brad Pitt in a scene-stealing performance as a very enthusiastic fitness instructor named ""Chad"", who doesn't know how to stop even when he is in way over his head.<br/><br/>Yeah, the movie is about those guys too. It is also about Tilda Swinton's character copying all of Malkovich's files onto a CD so she can nail him financially with a divorce AND financial claims. And the CD just so happens to get lost, and unbeknown-st to her, it also (accidentally) has some ""highly classified"" information on it. Oh, and the beginnings of Malkovich's memoirs. Yeah, it is about that too.<br/><br/>And how Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt find the CD and want to use it to get a ""good Samaritan"" reward from Malkovich by blackmailing him with the information on the CD. The ""good Samaritan"" reward will of course go to McDormand's surgeries. (Quite funny is the first interaction between the three, over a phone, with Brad Pitt in a very confused state being verbally destroyed by Malkovich.)<br/><br/>Oh, and McDormand tries to give the CD to a Russian embassy for a reward after a disastrous meet-up with Malkovich; Clooney is working on a ""mystery"" project in his basement that turns out to be nothing you could ever expect; etc.<br/><br/>You will notice by now two things-<br/><br/>1) I am using the actor's names as opposed to the character's names. I am just doing this to make it easier to understand. and... 2) This movie is the most convoluted thing out there!<br/><br/>Yes, and oddly enough, despite its level of convulusion, it is very easy to understand and enjoy. And even relate to a little bit. Just like real life, it doesn't have to make sense, nor does it need a real purpose. <br/><br/>Basically, what it boils down to is this- it is a film about characters and their motivations and reactions to one-another. And in that sense, it is very realistic. The events in the movie, maybe not so much, but the characters are fleshed out perfectly.<br/><br/>This definitely is the perfect follow up for the Cohen brothers to the somber and at times almost disturbingly low-key ""No Country for Old Men."" That was a film to make you think the deepest of thoughts- THIS is a film to sit back and enjoy, and maybe think a little bit after it is said and done.<br/><br/>And although it can't quite reach the level of perfection seen in Cohen pictures like ""No Country..."" or ""Fargo"", this one comes pretty darned close. In fact, as the last scene ends, you will realize this is the closest to perfect you can get without crossing that sacred thresh-hold. <br/><br/>In other words, this is an excellent movie, with very minimal flaws, about realistic characters in a bizarre situation. (Believe me, I didn't even get to any of the sub-characters, including the brilliant J.K. Simmons!) This gets a very good 9 out of 10 for me."
"moviewizguy","8","2","7","26 September 2008"," A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to sell it.
","After last year's ""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coen brothers decided to take a lighter turn (not really) by directing ""Burn After Reading."" What can I say about this movie? Well, it reminded me a lot of ""Fargo."" They're both dark comedies. As you can predict, this film would probably not be their best film to date. However, it's still a really good film.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie is that it's filled with coincidences. I love these type of movies. This person is friends with that person who is married to this person who's cheating with that same other person who's--you get the point. Seeing this, of course it's going to be confusing if you don't have a paper to write every characters' name down and what relationship they have with the others. But it's not that confusing if you'd think hard enough. It's all part of the fun.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand has, yet again, created a lovable quirky character. John Malkovich, George Clooney, and Tilda Swinton all do a decent job with their roles. However, who stood out the most was Brad Pitt. Other than Heath Ledger's fantastic performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" I think Pitt should get nominated as a supporting role. He's that good because you have never seen him act like the character he plays in your entire life. He also provides a lot of laughs in this film.<br/><br/>Although not the Coen's best film, the movie is pretty good to what it has. It's amazingly short (about 90 minutes), which is a bad thing because I wanted it to be longer. There are equal moments of some funny bits and depressing moments but the film tries its best to lighten up the dark scenes. With it's fantastic characters and semi-confusing plot, this is a must see in the cinemas. Oh, and if you think ""Eagle Eye"" created paranoia, you haven't seen this film, yet."
"KUAlum26","9","2","7","25 September 2008"," The Laughs are there. It's up to you to find them.
","I've sampled some of the comments on this movie and,while most are quite positive(as this one aims to be as well),the negative comments went something to the tune of this:people acting stupid and situations not making any sense blah blah blah I was bored. This sucks! etc.<br/><br/>Well,folks,did you honestly expect a Coen Bros. suspense/comedy to be linear or NOT over-the-top? Seriously?<br/><br/>Following the monster success of No Country for Old Men,Joel and Ethan roll out a bizarre,wannabe spy comedy---""wannabe"" because practically ever member of the central plot are convinced that they're in on something of major government intelligence and sensitivity--that seems to be cloaked in the mundane. To explain the connect among the following characters would,in my mind,be over-indulgent of myself and be risking leaking a spoiler or two: a disgruntled,unemployed CIA point-man(John Malkovich,slow-burning and emotionally irritable as ever),his brittle,cheating wife(Tilda Swinton,pitch perfect);the man she's cheating with(George Clooney),a loopy ladies man who aspires to be an entrepreneur; a strangely insecure and manic fitness trainer(Frances McDormand,in character #877 of her rich array of types she can limn flawlessly);her friend and fellow trainer(Brad Pitt,who you can tell is having fun here),a guy who's emotionally sixteen years old and has an IQ about half that;their boss(Richard Jenkins),a lovestruck sad sack; a bemused KGB man and two utterly confused CIA chiefs(David Rasche and J.K.Simmons,dryly hilarious) all are woven into this tale,patiently inserted into the storyline to make a largely effective and(I think it's safe to say)fairly unique film.<br/><br/>While I cannot quite call this my favorite Coen brothers movie(that distinction would probably go to Raising Arizona,Fargo or The Big Lebowski),it's certainly a strong contribution to the canon. Yes,the story moves at an odd pace,the actions and events can be real head-scratchers and the performances can be very love it/hate it(particularly Pitt's and Clooney's),but the humor is definitely there,and if you can find it you will definitely like--maybe even love--Burn After Reading."
"bobsgrock","8","2","7","22 September 2008"," Wild, crazy, bizarre, unpredictable; it must be the Coen brothers.
","This is one strange movie. I cannot remember the last time I walked out from viewing a movie and thinking to myself, ""what the heck did I just see?"" I'm not sure this is such a bad thing. The first time I saw it, I was completely dumbfounded and flabbergasted. I couldn't believe this movie was written, produced, and directed by those genius brothers that made last year's masterpiece that was No Country For Old Men. However, since it is the Coen Brothers, I decided to give it a second chance and I am glad to say many things were cleared up, but not all.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to look at this movie from the Coen's point of view. Here they are, coming off winning three Oscars for making No Country For Old Men. If history is any indication, they are next in line for a much more light-hearted story than the last one they did. This offer is certainly the most bizarre of any Coen movie I have ever seen, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. The acting is terrific all the way around with an all-star cast worthy of watching. George Clooney is funny as a womanizing CIA goof, John Malkovich is also very good as an alcoholic, foul-mouthed former agent, Frances McDormand is beautiful to watch as a woman who thinks she is going down the tube, and Brad Pitt gives perhaps the best performance as a complete numbskull of a gym trainer trying his very hardest to help out his friend Linda (McDormand). Other supporting characters, such as the lovable Richard Jenkins and the cold-hearted Tilda Swinton also score.<br/><br/>I have come to the conclusion that this movie is really only for those who are a fan of the Coen's previous indie-type comedies. No Country wasn't mainstream, but it certainly had Oscar written all over it when it was released. This movie reminds me of back in the late 90's when the Coens made Fargo, won an Oscar for it, then released The Big Lebowski two years later. They weren't going for gold, just trying to get some laughs. And they did, creating a movie that is considered a cult classic some ten years later. If you appreciate the Coen's special brand of dark humor and wild storytelling, give Burn After Reading a chance. If not, don't bother; it's not your cup of tea."

If you like Brad Pitt and George Clooney you would definitely like this. Brad Pitt plays an absolute fool. It has a cast of characters that many recognize from other movies and shows. The previews just do not do justice to the hilarity of this movie. It also shows what low self-esteem can cause as it affects everyone around you. The character of ""Linda"" is a prime example."
"st-shot","8","2","7","15 September 2008"," Confederacy of Dunces
","Burn After Reading is a smart dark comedy about a cross section of DC area paranoids and functional idiots who seem determined to bungle their way to self destruction. Redeemable qualities are hard to find in any of these self absorbed but engagingly quirky characters who actively deceive partners while unconsciously living an existence of self deception themselves. It can and does make for a lethal combination.<br/><br/>CIA operative Osborne Cox refuses a demotion and quits his post much to the chagrin of his ice cold wife whose having an affair with Harry Pffarer a US Marshall and a sex addict. Cox decides to write his memoirs but has a disk of material lifted by his wife whose about to begin divorce proceedings against him. The disk is then lost at a gym where two brainless, body conscious employees hatch a bribery scheme against Cox. Matters are further complicated when Harry begins an affair with Linda Litsky, one of the extortionists. Before you know it the CIA and the Russians are involved.<br/><br/>This is the sharpest film the talented team Coen has made since The Big Lebowski. By insinuating much and revealing little they slyly keep the audience off balance throughout with a blend of comic detours and sudden violence. Their signature unpredictable style is well in evidence as they refashion stark characters of similar plots and manipulate star power to their advantage by casting Hollywoods two reigning hearthrobs, George Clooney and Brad Pitt to play narcissistic nitwits, which they do with aplomb.<br/><br/>Francis McDormand as the dense Linda, John Malkovich as Cox, Tilda Swinton as his wife and Richard Jenkins as the gym owner are all letter perfect as well. Peripheral characters also register heavily, providing the Coens room for some Swiftian social commentary. A cosmetic surgeon, a divorce lawyer and two high ranking clueless CIA officers who confuse the audience and themselves in an hilarious epilogue say reams about today's society.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading displays the Coens once again at the top of their game with an original and refreshing work that avoids the formulaic boilerplate and works outside the Hollywood box. It's visually tame for the Coen's but edited and paced in a way that demands such restraint, accenting both the suspense and the comedy with subtle movements that hold the same weight and impact of some of their grander flourishes. In doing so they have re-stated their claim to being America's best film makers."

But even so after the movie was over I still felt kind of bad for laughing when I did.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does an extraordinary job of playing a goof ball health nut and is responsible for over 70% of the times that I laughed.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers are masterminds at turning the darkest moments of the movie into the funniest, and making you laugh at times when you would think it impossible.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked this movie but I am sure that many won't due to its dark nature.

","Throughout all of the comments posted about Burn After Reading no one has caught a vital reference in the movie relating to the CIA's role in murdering American citizens; the reference being the somewhat obscure name choice of the character 'Olson', played by Armand Schultz, whose name refers to the bizarre but true tale of the U.S. Army scientist, Frank Olson, murdered by the CIA in 1953. The entire story is too long to post here but an internet search on 'Frank Olson' would turn up sufficient info. The basic information follows and is verifiable: Frank Olson was dosed with LSD, without his knowledge, during the MKULTRA era of psychotropic drug experiments on unwitting American citizens and subsequently suffered a psychotic break and nervous breakdown. After a psychiatrist recommended he recover in a mental institution he was taken to the 10th story of a Manhattan hotel and fell to his death by being thrown through a window. Although the CIA went on record saying he defenestrated himself and ruled his death a suicide, upon exhuming his father's body in 1994 Eric Olson had an autopsy done and it was discovered that his father had received blunt force trauma to his head prior to his fall. Basically, because he was privy to many illegal operations and state secrets and could not be trusted to keep them secret since he was mentally unstable...Frank Olson was murdered by the U.S. government and then the CIA lied about it. ALSO, the CIA has...get this...an assassination manual that includes instructions on how to disguise a murder as a suicide, such as through a fall from a considerable height, about 10 stories.

And this certainly applies to ""Burn After Reading"".<br/><br/>This comedy is very funny and those who aren't hip to the Coen trip will probably not enjoy it as much as their core audience. Espionage gets turned back assward into the harsh winds of adult games like infidelity and social posturing. A never funnier Brad Pitt is the dimbulb that lights up this crazy ensemble and his colleagues Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins get to be most effective playing ordinary folks who are in way over their heads.<br/><br/>George Clooney is too often expected to be Mr. Smooth in many of his roles. Here, he'll entice the ladies and also disgust them with his ""how the hell did this guy get that job?"" role. The man whose top priority is getting a run in before hitting the sheets at night gets much more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is brilliant, as always. I hope he works with the Coens again soon. His over the hill bitter lemon of a male finds himself hating everything in the world and not much good can come from the dark cloud his brain is immersed by. <br/><br/>The Coens may be guilty of many things, but repeating themselves isn't one of them."

","First off, before you go an watch this movie and jump straight to giving this movie a 4/10. Stop and remember, it's a Coen Brothers Movie. So in that being said you have to look at the comedy from the perspective of watching another Coen movie. I knew when I read that the Coen brothers made this movie and picked up on it being a comedy I knew it was gonna be good. Another thing, its nice to see Clooney and Pitt playing characters that are far from their typical styled roles in movies. I mean come on, Brad Pitt as an athletic instructor at a health and fitness gym, and George Clooney as an everyday man pretty much. So overall I give this movie about an 8.5 or 9 outta 10. A high rating I know, but this is grade A Coen Brothers at their comedic best. Give it a chance and watch it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."

","I'm writing this within half an hour of watching the movie because if I delay there's a very real chance that I'll forget about 90% of what went on. Yes, I laughed out loud several times and yes, it was reasonably entertaining from beginning to end but five years from now if I check the TV channels and one is playing, say, Ninotchka, another, say, Some Like It Hot - both of which I have seen several times - the only dilemma I'll be facing is whether to go with Garbo or Lemmon. On the other hand there's no doubt that this is a crowd-pleaser with an excellent cast; if, for example, Frances MacDormand has ever given a bad performance I don't know about it and whilst I can take or leave Clooney, Pitt and Malkovitch they did, on this occasion, generate a few laughs. And that's about it, I'm afraid."
"wallabout","9","2","9","2 January 2010"," An experimental comedy.
","I won't be making any long unnecessary intro and will immediately say that this movie was a definitive refreshment. Why? After years of film-making, it's widely known that screenplays and plots (in general) tend to end up unoriginal. You have to dig through many movies to find yourself the one you really appreciate. In my opinion, comedies recently have become horrible and it's just hard to find a decent movie with a decent sense of humour. As well, many writers and producers try to combine various genres of movie/film to yield a piece which, sometimes, turns up to be a complete failure.<br/><br/>However, this movie is a complete success. It incorporates elements from different genres which fuse together and produce a funny, yet tragic story that will keep you interested throughout the movie. I consider this movie to be very experimental due to its selection of actors and stories. Each and every actor has something special and represents a unique position in the story. And, just when you think that you can categorize and sort this movie into certain genre, another scene pops up and you're (once again) forced to reconsider your choice.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a perfect solution if you're looking for something that's going to make you laugh, but at the same time thrilled and sad; and - frequently surprised."

","Burn After Reading is a quirky spy parody directed by renowned Coen Brothers and starring a set of outstanding actresses and actors like Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The confusing story revolves around a retired CIA analyst who is going through a divorce. A disc with information about his finances and memoirs ends up in the hands of two idiotic gym employees who try to blackmail him. Soon, CIA agents, Russian double-agents and private detectives are watching and being watched around the analyst's house when things go berserk.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is quite intriguing. The story is original and filled with surprising twists and turns while also criticizing and making fun of American bureaucracy, cinema and society. However, this rather short movie takes too much time to introduce a bloated set of characters. The characters are often quite flat, predictable and stereotypical. Later on, the story develops draggingly and only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace. The conclusion to the movie feels somewhat aborted and is mostly told and not shown which is a sign for limited filmmaking in my book. The worst thing however is that this parody just isn't funny. I'm not the most serious guy and sure like to laugh from time to time but everything this movie evoked was a tired smile in two or three scenes. There is some creative situation comedy for sure but not one single truly hilarious scene. Since there are few action scenes and only a few small doses of suspense, this movie is only kept alive by its quirky characters and story.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Burn After Reading has a mostly original script and offers memorable scenes with plenty of strange situation comedy you will remember long after having watched this film. The actresses and actors are also delivering the goods and very convincing as they manage to make the most of their one-dimensional characters. John Malkovich is brilliant as disillusioned analyst, Tilda Swinton convinces as his cold-hearted wife, George Clooney mesmerizes as lying womanizer, Frances McDormand excels in her role as hectic gym employee who makes all the wrong decision and Brad Pitt is quite amusing as dim-witted sportsman who is constantly and stupidly singing and smiling.<br/><br/>In the end, you can give this film a try if you know and like the aforementioned actresses and actors as well as other movies by the Coen Brothers who certainly have their very own style. If one leaves out the brilliant actresses and actors as well as the situation comedy, one gets a movie with a confusing story line that just isn't funny though. I would recommend this flick if there really isn't anything else on television on a rainy night but it's overall slightly overrated."

","How can a movie blow with both George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it? By making a story line that has no purpose or true comedic relief. The only reason this review gives the movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because actors in it. How exactly is there humor in a story line that is not clearly defined and can't be followed? From the beginning to the end the movie is entirely too choppy.<br/><br/>We open up with a CIA analyst who gets demoted for being an ""alcoholic"". He Analyst gets highly upset, storms out of the office and quits and decides to write a book about everything he learned in the CIA. Meanwhile there is no proof in the movie that the guy is an alcoholic. Anyways goes on with wife is cheating on him with George Clooney, who is like a nympho and goes on dating sites and has sex with random women everyday, (like does this character have a job?). Anyways you find out later his wife is cheating on his as well and everyone is in a weird sex ring at this point right? Anyways both dudes get served divorced papers one at the beginning (Analyst) and one at the end (Clooney). The movie ""plot"" is that two bozos who work at a gym (Brad Pitt and an Older Lady) team up when they find a CD from the Analysts wife's attorney's secretary (see you already see how bogus this is) with information on it the Analyst's wife was using as leverage to take all her money's before she filed for divorce. It not only contained part's of the Analyst's book but also financial information from her husband where she could go in and take money from his accounts. The two gym bimbos try to get money from the Analysts using the disc as hostage saying they are ""Good Samaritans"" and deserve a reward if he wants his disc back. 
Of course at this point the Analyst blows a gaskit and doesn't agree to terms and demands his information back. The older woman gym bimbo wants the disc for plastic surgery money and Brad Pitt... well we don't know what he wants the plastic surgery money for or why he is even hanging out with the annoying older lady to begin with. It all spirals out of control to where eventually Brad Pitt gets shot by George Clooney, the Gym Bimbos boss get's shot by the Analyst and then the Analyst gets shot by a random dude in the street. The CIA is monitoring the whole situation, doesn't care about anybody dying just cares about their information on the disc. So in the end they agree to give the crazy older lady gym bimbo her money for her plastic surgeries to keep quiet. 
HOW MORE ANNOYING, STUPID, AND UNWITTY COULD THIS MOVIE BE?
Literally a waste of an all star cast. I want to erase this movie from my brain because that's how terrible it is."

","I think I've watched the Cohen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading' about four times now and, although I find it a weirdly enjoyable film, I still can't get my head round the beginning. I guess you'd call it a black comedy/drama, filled with mix-ups and adulterous relationships, yet the catalyst for how it all begins seems to be one of those 'blink-and-you-miss-it' kind of moments. A CIA analyst (John Malkovich) gets fired and ends up being blackmailed by a pair of gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of which is sleeping with a married man, George Clooney (who is also sleeping with John Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton). Confused? You may well be.<br/><br/>It's a pretty confusing plot, not because anything's that difficult to understand - it just has a real air of confusion about it all. And, I think that's deliberate. For we, the audience, are treated like the CIA agents in the film, left to look in on this series of odd developments and wonder what the hell is going on here.<br/><br/>Of course the film's storytelling style may not be to everyone's liking, however you have to admit that it has a stellar cast. With those names in the lead you'll be hard pushed to not enjoy their performances. Although, I have to say that (no-so-famous) Richard Jenkins stole every scene he was in and brought a real air of tragic pathos to the cast. In fact, he may well be the film's 'heart,' as, despite the other lead actors being big names, you may find it difficult to empathise with anyone besides Jenkins.<br/><br/>Although everything ties up with these characters lives, like I said, it does it in a deliberately vague way which leaves you with question marks over your head (making you see the events through the bewildered eyes of those men supposed to know everything that's going on ever). Oh, and don't read too many spoilers - as there are definitely some moments that you won't see coming!"

","The Coen Brother's Burn After Reading is the duo at their height of trolling the audience, a mood they seem to make some of the most devilishly funny films of their career. This one reminds me of long days full of running around, confusion and missed appointments, days where I get home and reach the end only to realize that for all the frenzy, nothing I did all day was really of any consequence. This film is sort of like that; a whole lot of clandestine nonsense and tomfoolery that adds up to.. well, not much of anything in the end. If that sounds like I'm being negative, I'm not. That's part of the Coen's charm and a core aspect of what makes this one so hilarious. It's also full of complete dimwitted morons, which only adds to the chorus of lunacy. John Malkovich teeters on the borders of mania, scary and funny as ex CIA half wit Osborne Cox, in a performance so utterly Malkovich that he almost seems like some other actor parodying him. He's got a cold hearted witch of a wife (Tilda Swinton) who is fooling around with even bigger idiot Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney is a riot) who is also fooling around with anything that has a pulse, being the squirrelly sex addict that he is. Cox has started a memoir (or, 'mem-wah', as Malkovich ludicrously intones it), the contents of which are on a disc that end up in the hands of yet even bigger idiots. Linda Litzke (Frances Mcdormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) run a gym called Hardbodies (only the Coens, folks) and see the disc as 'secret spy schit' they could use to make a buck. That's where the plot hollers off the rails into pure madness, as each and every character makes the dumbest possible decision along the way. J.K. Simmons and David Rasche are gold as two CIA honchos who are more puzzled than the audience, Richard Jenkins trolls perhaps the subtlest of all, and the cast also includes Jeffrey Demunn, Olek Krupa and a meta cameo from Dermot Mulroney. Among the cloak and dagger chaos, the Coen take every chance they get to spoof and lovingly ridiculue society's cringe inducing stereotypes, until you start to realize they're levels of exaggeration aren't all that over the top. Pitt is gold as the air headed gym rat, Clooney pure screwball, and Malkovich is a force of demented nature, his exentuated word pronunciations reaching a boiling point of absurdity here. This is up there with the Coen's best, and certainly one of their funniest hours."

The Coen brothers must have used their Hollywood pull to get all this talent together, but thankfully the casting never trumped the roles. Everyone fits their characters so well, and there's quite a few unexpected performances to be seen. George Clooney was especially memorable, I don't think that I've ever enjoyed one of his performances this much.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading isn't a rapid-fire comedy, but instead its humor is the kind that keeps a smile on your face basically the entire time, and then widens it with a chuckle or two every few minutes. I hesitate to say that it's for everyone, but I recommend that everyone give it a shot to see if it's there cup of tea. It certainly was mine."

Here on the Saturday night looking forward to some light comedy movie and it turn out to be a real massacre ain't my kind of fun. The trailer doesn't imply it to be black comedy either. I felt cheated and robbed of my valuable holiday.<br/><br/>Synopsis: a man and women found an ex-CIA memoir that contains what they believe was a valuable national security. They next plan trying to black mail that ex CIA to giving them money. The problem arises when he refused to pay the money.<br/><br/>What I believe is that - people are trying too hard having seen this is as Ethan and Joel's films they force themselves into like it. I on the other hand didn't quite enjoy it at all. The first 2/3 part of the film are complete pointless and only almost close to the end when things start to get interesting.<br/><br/>Frankly, I watch this movie because of them (Ethan and Joel) having seen No Country for Old Men (and really like it) I wanted to see what movie they will do next. I also believe that most (if not all) watch this movie of the same reason. The cast also add to that. But that doesn't help one bit.<br/><br/>The casting was probably the highlight of this movie with G. Clooney, F. McDormand, J. Malkovich, T. Swinton and Brad Pitt (even though he appears in like Â½ hour or so). The actors of this caliber need not be said how good they are. Still that doesn't help me one bit.<br/><br/>The movie do consist couple of humors though not kind of laugh-out-loud and not the thing you were going to look forward to.<br/><br/>Overall, It left me wondering if it wasn't for the two brothers would it even be made let alone famous? If it wasn't for the two would any of the cast still willing to appear in the movie? If it wasn't for them would it have gone straight to DVD kind of movie instead of theatre? Anyway, this is probably the only time I will ever watch this movie. I count myself lucky this time having not going to see this movie in the theater, otherwise I would have been so mad.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Sorry, but I can't recommend this to anyway one that do not enjoy black comedy.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)"
"Scarecrow-88","7","1","3","24 April 2011"," Burn After Reading
","The Cohens take their movie to Washington, D.C. Their movie concerns a recently unemployed CIA analyst (John Malkovich) with serious anger issues who has developed memoirs of his life/career. He loses the disc which contains this information, and it is discovered by a dopey employee (Brad Pitt) of a gym called HARDBODIES. Pitt notices a lot of CIA jargon, believing this disc contains codes or other private information worth some money, and soon fellow employee Francis McDormand, who has major self-esteem problems, desperately yearning for cosmetic surgeries to repair a body she is ashamed of, is involved. It is really McDormand who urges Pitt (but he needs little more than a nudge) to pursue the moolah, although Malkovich really isn't exactly loaded. Malkovich has a dentist wife (Tilda Swinton), a control freak, who is having an affair with a former member of the Treasury Department (George Clooney). Clooney is married to an author of children's books, always on trips to publicize her works. So this disc, which really isn't anything that special, causes a lot of ruckus. Murder eventually enters the picture along with the blackmail and rampant adulteries. I did find one scene particularly shocking: McDormand is so desperate for a payday she takes the disc to a Russian embassy hoping they will give her money in exchange for supposed American secrets! This is a woman who really wants to change her body image! Pitt might earn some laughs as a ditz, and Clooney soon succumbs to paranoia when he accidentally shoots someone who startles him and notices that there is a mysterious figure following him aroundâ€”he does soon learn of who this person is, and, as most of the situations in this movie, it's really a misunderstanding that gets far more out of control than need be. I think the best role in the movie goes to Richard Jenkins, the owner of HARDBODIES, who has it bad for McDormand although feelings aren't mutual because she is looking for a bohunk. The film features an assortment of adulteries such as Clooney sleeping with both Swinton and McDormand. Clooney's wife actually has a younger hunk on tour with her. Malkovich gets locked out his home and banking/savings accounts drained by Swinton who really asserts her seriousness about a new relationship with a commitment-phobic Clooney too afraid to confront anyone that would propose a threat to their love affair. J.K. Simmons has a small part as a head honcho in the CIA, bewildered at the events transpiring around Malkovich's disc, often receiving reports from his equally baffled agent. Simmons just wants all of this nonsense to subside, accepting whatever it takes to stop the bleeding. Malkovich, with little real screen time, is a ticking time bomb just on the cusp of erupting, and a character makes the unfortunate mistake of attempting to help McDormand retrieve extra information on the ex-CIA analyst at the wrong time. A lot of characters end up at the wrong place at the wrong time, or make poor decisions which backfire. Although, the ending does show that McDormand might just get her wish..<br/><br/>The film is built on reactions from the cast. A variety of f-bombs surface in the dialogue regularly, and how all the characters tie to each other is clever in its execution. It is amazing how avarice so drives everything in the movie...McDormand wanting her surgeries, Cooney needing to feed his lust, Malkovich unable to recover from a humble downgrade from a job he took so much pride in, Swinton only interested in controlling those in her life, Pitt a comic foil in McDormand's obsessive quest for enough cash but himself wanting a little payday for the disc's discovery. Jenkins, bless his heart, tries to appeal to McDormand's good graces and pays a heavy price in doing so, while JK Simmons receives numerous reports at his desk in the CIA about the whole mess, just exasperated by how Osbourne Cox's analyst's *dismissal* has accumulated into such a situation."

","Personally, I'm not such a huge fan of films by the Coen brothers; but it's hard to deny that each time they make a film, it's a different one. 'Burn After Reading' is a riotous spy-thriller, a viciously black farce that in which one can see traces of the brothers' previous films (deadpan scenes echoing 'Fargo', but also some of the zaniness of 'Raising Arizona', for example) but which is far from just a remake of any of them. As always, there are moments at which you can't help but chuckle; and it's fun to see Brad Pitt and George Clooney in such unheroic roles, although John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton do most of the scene-stealing. But the script suffers from a surplus of unoriginal swearing and a standard flaw of many of the Coen's movies: there's no reason to care for any of the characters. It's inventive and in places amusing; but it's still a film lacking in heart."

","While the Coen brothers have had their greatest critical successes with their more serious films they have always had a taste for comedy, particularly when it comes to dark humour. ""Burn After Reading"" is a film that illustrates this tendency.<br/><br/>The film features a serpentine plot built around a pair of vacuous gym employees, an ex-CIA agent, his wife and her lover. When an apparent breach of security opens up potentially lucrative possibilities these varied individuals collide in ways that are both comical and unexpected.<br/><br/>The cast is well-stocked with talented individuals. The always dependable Frances McDormand received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance but in my opinion it was Brad Pitt who gave the best performance. He steals the show as a dim-witted gym employee trying to orchestrate a blackmail plot. John Malkovich is also quite entertaining, whether he's flipping out or going on about his memoirs (the way he says 'memoirs' cracks me up). Tilda Swinton & George Clooney don't do much for me here but I think that's mainly because their characters are less interesting than the others. Meanwhile, the supporting cast is reliable and includes notable contributions from Richard Jenkins and J.K. Simmons in smaller roles.<br/><br/>As always, the direction is appealing, as is the entire visual aspect. Carter Burwell's score isn't particularly worth remarking on but good use is made of the Fugs' ""CIA Man"" for the closing credits. Overall, the film is solid in its construction but not especially noteworthy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Burn After Reading"" serves as an entertaining dark comedy that falls just a bit short of the heights that the Coens are capable of. Nevertheless, a minor disappointment for them still equals a standout comedy for anyone else, so I'd recommend giving this flick a shot."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","20 May 2010"," An odd venturing into territory of both the political and pastiche sort, as the Coen's just about tread water with a purposely dopey spy thriller-come-romance feature.
","It seems somewhat strange that George Clooney and Tilda Swinton would be in Michael Clayton, one of 2007's better films: a thriller about corruption; guilt; paranoia; espionage and so forth about a year or two prior to the pair of them then staring together in this; a pastiche of most of those things from the usually frustratingly wavy pens of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan. The Coen's do indeed deliver a strange spoof-come-pastiche, delivered by way of their off beat and scatty humour ranging from dark and dreary in brutally efficient deaths inflicted on some by others to the construction one character lends towards a contraption designed to give its user the full benefit of a sex toy with minimal effort. Burn After Reading calls to mind a number of films of old, mostly of the spy or espionage ilk; broadly speaking, the film is a little like that 1998 John Frankenheimer film entitled Ronin only with Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd's character completely removed and somebody like Jim Carrey's character from Dumb and Dumber inserted in place of him; an idiot that just happens to hold all the aces, much to the frustration of some of the other more brutal, more professional individuals entwined. Even Clooney's character himself has a name that echoes Michael Caine's Harry Palmer, but really only if you say it relatively quickly and repetitively.<br/><br/>The film over-complicates a relatively routine premise, but deliberately so. Brad Pitt's Chad Feldheimer and Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke work at a local gym in the Washington DC area. He's eccentric in his body movements and gestures, the sort that strolls on ahead with an idea because it initially seems like an hilarious thing to do without much thinking about what the consequences might be; she's a lonely woman desperately seeking companionship via an online dating website, with a number of expansive operations on her body and facial area the overall goal so as to completely reinvigorate herself. Their roles as gym supervisors signals a sense that they're based within a zone in which people are present so as to tone up or to change appearance, dramatically or otherwise. Linda and Chad will undergo a similar 'toning up' process as they ill-advisedly leave their common existence behind and enter the world of espionage as gym owner Ted (Jenkins) persistently tells Linda she looks fine in a physically sense, and that the changes she has planned are unnecessary. Whilst on the surface a mere comment about her plastic surgery, it works on another level as a warning of greater items of change; particularly, her dipping into this new world she is ill fitted to exist in.<br/><br/>This is all before we get to Clooney's Harry Pfarrer, a U.S. Marshall having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton), the wife of C.I.A. higher-up Osborne Cox (Malkovich) whose compact disc those pesky gym employees have happened to stumble into contact with. It's an act on behalf of the U.S. government that sparks all this off, their demoting of Osborne signalling his resignation out of anger and the consequent embarking on the writing of his memoirs, a document you can understand will reveal the last 'x' number of years of C.I.A. work. By the end, The Coen's have got a little more political than perhaps they ever have been when they provide us with a scene that sees oblivious, dumbo government officials, sitting around discussing the eventual aftermath of the unholy mess they themselves have created. The film has begun with the removing of a higher-up from a position of power; innocents have since been caught up in the aftermath; many people have perished in the mean time and then the American government have, in a rather brutal fashion and through J.K. Simmons' character, brushed it aside in a foul swoop when taking responsibility and finding out why certain things went so wrong would be recommended. Read into whatever political under currents you like.<br/><br/>Following Osborne's leaving of the service, he finds himself on a yacht out in the water with his father, informing him of the situation and talking of past decades when his father was in the force in a romanticised tone. He points at the ending of The Cold War as a moment that his line of work turned into something else as the boat seemingly drifts aimlessly out in the waters of nowhere, apparently going nowhere in the process, capturing what Osborne is feeling as he gazes off screen into the unknown. The best parts involve Osborne with the gym employees, Malkovich just about pulling off the scenes that require him to shout and badger people who are into something that's way over their heads, with Chad and Linda themselves trying to figure out the next plan of action; items that involve burglary and extortion in what is a passingly entertaining passage of play. The rest of it is a hit and miss meshing of romance and floundering on Clooney's and Swinton's behalf, barely any of it all that interesting but it somewhat eerily passes the time in an odd, numbing manner.<br/><br/>Despite its light hearted tendencies within the genre, it's perhaps more involving than Ridley Scott's relatively pedestrian Body of Lies or either of Greengrass' two hollow; wishy-washy; turgid Bourne sequels which run on a premise but are practically devoid of character and narrative, the second sequel of which uses a bog-standard framework of self-discovery so as to provide a sense things are progressing. Clooney's consistent state of paranoia born out of the fact he believes he's being followed and the strong phobias plus reactions he has to the idea of surveillance actually addresses the issues at hand in a far more involving manner than either of the three aforementioned films. It's tough to get too excited about Burn After Reading, the directors' skill in film-making compensating for the brash, aggressive energy the piece carries but it's not enough to render it anything too great."

","After watching this once, I watched it again, hoping it would get better. It did, up to a point, in that it was less confusing, since I now knew who the characters were and what they were about. Preparatory hints in the narrative were spotted, which explained what had seemed confusing first time round. Like how come Brad got shot so expertly and suddenly. When it happened the first time I couldn't make out how it had happened. I laughed a few times, but no more than the first time. Unlike The Big Lebowski, which just got funnier and funnier each time I watched it, probably about 50 times, BAR didn't seem to improve much. There were a lot of re-cycled dialogue echoes from TBL, not just the over-repeated cuss-word. This seemed funny in TBL, but not here.<br/><br/>I want to like the Coen films. A lot of them are definitely very good. But this one tends to support what some critics have complained of, that they are cold and cynical, and have little but contempt for the rest of humanity. What was the moral of this story? That the world is run by tired moronic bureaucrats and administrative apparatchiks, incompetently controlling other morons? Life's nothing but a poor joke? That anyone half-way innocent and naive, or half-way decent, like Pitt and Jenkins, gets rubbed out for stupidly trying to help another stupid, self-absorbed, silly person? Who ends up getting what she wanted? Well, maybe that's the way things are. Depressing really. Alive ridiculous, and dead forgot, like Pope said.<br/><br/>Nestling among the end credits, between ""Camera Scenic"" and ""Assistant to Mr Clooney"" there was a functionary called ""The Walrus"". I'm not familiar with everyone involved in making a motion picture, but don't think I've ever come across anyone whose job title might be The Walrus. For the record, this person's job was said to have been performed by someone called Drew Houpt. Tell us what you do, Drew."

","Sadly that appears to be what nearly everyone was doing here from the Coens on down the line of A-list actors. Though the film has plenty of funny, surprising, and if nothing else engaging moments, it pales drastically in comparison to other works by most of these folks. It especially pales in comparison to the Coens' recent No Country for Old Men which is near the top of my all time list.<br/><br/>The story deals with a recently fired CIA agent (Malkovich) losing a CD full of possibly crucial secrets he is planning on using to write a memoir with. Right off the bat that would seem like a highly illegal way of spilling compromising material, but somehow the man seems compelled to try and tell his story to anyone who might listen. Unfortunately he loses the disk at a health club and it falls into the hands of two employees (McDormand and Pitt) who plan on selling the info to the Russians after a failed, but hilarious attempt to sell it back to the agent. Most of the characters are connected by either the disk, or other characters in the cast they are screwing. Everyone here seems to be sleeping around with each other, but isn't that what life these days is all about? Really, this is not a remarkable project. All it does is give some of these A-listers a chance to work together and throw in some quirks here and there. Really nobody but Malkovich stands out in this ensemble. Pitt proves once again that there is no role he cannot screw up. The role of ""Chad"" is written just fine, but Pitt over-does it and tries to act excessively zany. I guess when you reach a certain level of stardom even the best directors either trust you to death or just don't have the guts to tell you how bad you're doing. Not sure which here. Tilda Swinton plays herself as usual, George Clooney is pretty good, and Frances McDormand again seems to blend right into her role. And the desperately random world of on line dating proves to be an easy target. Been there and done that! Luckily the film isn't that long, and if you have an hour and a half to watch these big stars mugging, go for it. 6 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","I love the Cohen Bros and the cast in this movie was unbeatable. My anticipation was great.<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed. The movie made no sense. At least other Cohen movies have a thread which can be followed. And I hated most of the characters. It was as if the actors all decided that they wanted to step out on the edge. That may have been fine for their acting joneses, but it was not enjoyable to me.<br/><br/>The only characters I liked were J. K. Simmons and Richard Jenkins. Pitt's character has some funny moments, but even McDormand's character seemed unsympathetic and ungenuine to me.<br/><br/>I would not recommend it to anyone, but I would not say don't watch it, either. Your tastes obviously might vary from mine."
"pc95","6","1","3","24 August 2009"," Starts slow but goofily entertaining
","Overall I liked ""Burn After Reading"". Some of the performances, notably Brad Pitt, really pulled the movie up from being a bore. The movie suffers from meandering for about the first 30 min or so where little seems to happen, and the characters seem somewhat uninteresting. Once the storyline picks up and the main conflict and motivation of the movie come into play the movie gets much better. This is in no small part to pretty much every scene between Frances McDormand and Pitt being fun. Being a satire, the Cohen brothers do a pretty good job putting together sharply defined characters in the meld of ""Fargo"". However this movie doesn't have as strong a plot/storyline. Despite that, lightly recommend it as an evening dinner flick or like such."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","22 July 2009"," Comedy and Violence
","This isn't a typical laugh-out-loud comedy, which in a way means that it *is* a typical Coen Brother's comedy. Laced with noir trimmings, black humour and some vicious violence it's a story that could just as easily have been told straight. In fact, you can almost imagine the brothers Coen rubbing their chins contemplatively as they try to decide which way to film it. They cast Brad Pitt and George Clooney in key roles, so maybe they wanted to leave their options open.<br/><br/>Pitt and Clooney are terrific in this. For an actor with matinÃ©e idol looks Clooney in unusually adept at playing amiable doofuses. In this one he's a serial philanderer who hooks up with Frances McDormand, a gym employee who has formed a blackmailing partnership with fellow employee Brad Pitt, a not-too-bright but enthusiastic guy with carefully coiffured hair. They found a disc in the gym changing room containing the memoirs of 'retired' CIA agent John Malkovitch after it was accidentally left there by his wife (Tilda Swinton) who was gathering information in preparation for a divorce. Clooney and Malkovitch are former colleagues who despise each other. The story is as involved as it reads but it is quite easy to follow.<br/><br/>The violence in the film doesn't always sit easily with the humour. One murder is so totally unexpected that it sort of shocks you out of the film for a moment, and leaves you half-expecting some kind of twist that will bring the murdered character back to life. But then, I suppose that's the Coen's way: they can take a story and characters that aren't quite realistic, lulling us into a kind of false sense of security that nothing truly disagreeable is going to happen to them, and then inject moments of brutal and realistic violence just to shake us up.<br/><br/>This maybe isn't the best of the Coen's films, but it's pretty good; and it suggests that they're a long way from running out of fresh ideas."

","This is a very bad movie. I wouldn't recommend it if you have anything better to do today, tomorrow afternoon, or on any day of the week. It's regretfully, because (at least) two major actors play in this film. Brad Pitt shows once again what he is capable of, playing very well. George Clooney is about average in this movie. The plot is exaggerated, the funny parts could cause a smile at best and the sensation it gives you after leaving the cinema is... ""Horrible! I just lost two hours of my life."" The only thing it succeeds in doing is make fun of the American people, of their weird habits and awkward society. But if you're looking for a funny movie, pick something else."

","Friday night made the big mistake of hiring ""Burn After Reading"". For some reason I thought it would be more enjoyable than the other awful Coen brothers movies i'd seen (The Ladykillers, O Brother Where Art Though etc) with it's great cast and wacky storyline. Bad move. As always, the old ""stick with what you know"" motto I've lived my life by would have served me well if I stayed disciplined.<br/><br/>The film is about some dimwitted fitness instructors (played by McDormand and Pitt) who stumble across a seemingly top secret disc with government files. Linda (McDormand) sees a great opportunity for blackmail and therefore the chance to fund her required plastic surgery while Chad (Pitt) just sees the chance to score some free money. Soon they become embroiled in a serious situation and it's no longer a chance for easy money. Will they pull it off? See it to find out.<br/><br/>**Spoiler alert**. The story was going OK but had several irrelevant story lines that weakly ended up intertwining with the main story (Malkovich, Clooney etc). The ending was a massive letdown to say the least. Besides Brad Pitt's performance there wasn't much to salvage. I know some people will say ""you just don't get the genius of the Coen brothers"", but personally i think they are knobheads."
"suzuspetals","7","1","3","29 January 2009"," Almost as good as Fargo...but not quite.
","The bizarre character stew in this latest Coen Brothers' film puts me in mind with their earlier film, Fargo. ""Fargo"" put a certain charming folksy twist to the murder mystery genre. ""BurnÂ…"" takes an almost vaudevillian approach to the political thriller (and, for that matter, online dating). There were similar dynamics between characters, although not on a par with the Macy/ Buscemi/ Stormare weirdness factor. Clooney gets to stretch his ability by playing someone with little to no redeeming value, and it's only seeing how hopelessly, laughably pathetic the character is that we don't come away from watching ""BurnÂ…"" thoroughly detesting him. He's a high-rolling loser who gets his in the end. Same goes for McDormand, who you can't help but feel is a victim of reading one too many beauty/ fitness magazines and finds her body lacking in its entirety. Malkovich manages to maintain some dignity as a low-level intelligence lackey who is convinced he can publish his memoirs and blow the lid off the intel community. Pitt is endearing as McDormand's high-energy nincompoop cohort (personally, I think Brad should stick with the smaller partsÂ…he does lunatic so well). Tilda Swinton could've shown up in her Narnia costume for all the ice she exudes in this film. Richard Jenkins once again puts in a solid performance as an ex-Greek Orthodox priest, perhaps the only noble character in the bunch. Written concurrently with ""No Country For Old Men,"" one can understand why this film may have lacked in energy. But great laughs and dialogue, and you come away wondering how people like these could possibly manage to get through life without their lunacy being detected sooner."

","I have never really bought into Coen Brothers comedy ethos. Apart from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" which i hated , i have quite enjoyed their films but i have never found them funny. The humour seems to wash over me , so i wasn't holding out a great deal of hope for ""Burn after Reading"" . It just goes to show how wrong i can be !<br/><br/>Osbourne Cox is a low level analyst at the CIA, after leaving his job he decides he will use whatever knowledge he has gained within his long years at the CIA to publish a tell-all memoir, Osbourne starts writing every juicy tidbit of information he can come up with, on his home computer. Unbeknownst to him, his wife's divorce lawyer advised her to make a copy of his hard drive's contents on to a CD, should he be withholding personal financials.<br/><br/>Through an odd turn of events, said disk ends up being accidentally left in a local gym by the divorce lawyer's receptionist, and ends up in the hands of two scheming idiot employees at the Hardbodies Gym, Chad and Linda . Believing they hold some valuable secret information, the two attempt to blackmail Cox into paying them money to live their ambitious life plans.<br/><br/>Characters are what the Coens do best. Whether it be The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski"" or Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo"" or even Anton in ""No Country For Old Men"". In ""Burn after reading"" we are spoilt with fantastic characters.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is superb as the slightly camp gym instructor Chad Feldheimer. I loved his phone conversation with Osbourne Cox when he informs him that he has his computer disc.The anger that comes from Cox and the surprise from Chas is brilliant. Pitt seems to put everything into this role and thoroughly deserves his BAFTA nomination for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>George Clooney is also great. He plays a paranoid sexual deviant that uses women for his own pleasure. His scenes with Frances McDormand ( Linda) are very enjoyable. especially the moment he shows her his new sex machine that he has made in his basement. The conversation goes something like this..<br/><br/>Linda:What is it? Harry : What is it? Harry : You sit down there, make yourself comfortable, put your feet in the stirrups, and... Linda : Oh my God. Linda :That's fantastic.!<br/><br/>The film is packed with conversation like this and i hate to admit it , i laughed my socks of throughout !<br/><br/>John Malkovich (Osbourne Cox) and J.K. Simmons ( The CIA Superior) deserve a lot of credit for their dark comedy acting also. <br/><br/>This is by far the best comedy the Coen brothers have done and even makes me think that i should go back and watch their back catalogue to see if i have missed something the first time round and if i have , in the words of the CIA Superior "" What a Clusterf''k!"".<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Only the Coen Brothers could pull off such a crazy, goofy, and ridiculous black comedy such as this superb movie. Middle aged people in all sorts of crisis, the CIA, greed, marital infidelity, tying people together until the end, when the characters have no idea they are all connected in a weird bizarre way. It amazes me sometimes the writing style of the Coens, and where they get these wild insane plots, that they continue to make work, movie after movie. This is not a LOL movie, but when one of the gags really hits home, you'll certainly get a good laugh. Brad Pitt is very funny, George Clooney is excellent playing a character caught in the middle of all the confusion, John Malkovich is extremely funny as the foul mouthed CIA analyst who quits his job, Frances McDormand is again dead pan humor at its best, and Tilda Swinton is excellent in a minor role, but a direct tie-in to all the madness.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the movie, and to me, this is very intelligent dark humor mainly for intelligent movie fans. The Coens are not known for making what you might call, normal movies, ""No Country for Old Men"" was as close to normal as they will usually ever get. ""Burn After Reading"" is a Coen classic, and a major league hoot of a movie. Incredibly entertaining, to say the least."
"anirban-iimc","8","1","3","12 January 2009"," Well Done, and with a great after-taste
","I am generally not a huge fan of movies which are all over the place and require one to carefully follow plots, sub plots and innuendos to be able to appreciate the flick. Having gone through the reviews on IMDb about Burn After Reading, I was fearful of this turning out to be exactly one of those kinds. But then, this ain't anywhere near that genre. T=And that is even more surprising because even though I thoroughly enjoyed this satire on humanity, I am still unsure as to which category does this movie classify into. We have had the Ceons deliver simple-plot-gone-terribly-wrong even before, number of times. But even so, this one was a class apart. This is a direct assault at each one of us, anyone who even briefly has day dreamt of being in a spy thriller in real life. Real life people do real life things and have visions of grandiose fed by high budget flicks and fast selling novels. Burn After Reading goes all out in squashing us common masses with batons of humor and ends up squeezing laughs and revenue out of us. Simply and truly fantastic. The plot - at first simple and stupid but by the end is complex and brilliant. All the threads weave in together perfectly by the end to create what one can safely call a perfect design. Throughout the movie we anticipate any (or all) of the characters to deliver a larger-than-life moment, an act of sheer genius, a dare devilry or at least a twist of ingenuity. And that is the beauty of this flick. Normal people, do normal things. The movie, in essence, communicates one thing - ""Never underestimate the predictability of stupidity""."
"rishi_is_here-1","8","1","3","5 January 2009"," Good but not great comedy
","I watched this movie with my friends in the Kinepolis theater few days back. Frankly speaking I was simply curious and kinda influenced others to watch this one over ""The Day earth stood still"" and ""Australia"" because of its impressive casting. When we got out of the hall we all were discussing nitty-bitties of the film and we asked each other ""do you like it?"", everybody said ""yes"" but then the extra enthusiasm was missing in saying that. I personally believe that tells the story.I don't think anybody would dislike it but it could have been better. It is hilarious, okay, that was also the plot but can it not be made more comical? Individually all characters played their roles pretty much as expected to their acting images, specially John Malkovich and George Clooney were at their best. Frances McDormand as Linda Litzke becoming crazy to get her beauty operations is as believable as Brad Pitt with his rather shorter role trying to spy on the Osbourne Cox aka Malkovich. Specially the last conversation between two CIA officials played by J K Simmons and David Rasche was extremely laughter provoking and I cannot but help to give some part of it (not word to word) Simmons: What did we learn from it? Rasche: I don't know sir, perhaps you can tell. Simmons: We should not repeat the mistake we did...a pause....only if we knew what did we do wrong in the first place. So in my view Coen brothers did a good job after ""No Country for Old Man"" but may be they could work little bit more to create more plain comedy rather than ""intelligent"" comedy to get that extra ""wow"" from the viewers."
"drylungvocalmartyr","8","1","3","4 January 2009"," At last the Coens' biting satire is back
","Following their hugely successful and equally brilliant No Country for Old Men the Coens have returned to their all too familiar territory: the black comedy. The good news is that their approach was different than in case of Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers, which were in my view lesser works for their mass appeal oriented humor. With Burn After Reading the biting satire is back: plastic surgery, internet dating, body building/shaping, the marriage-adultery-divorce triangle and even the CIA are all targets that get their fair share of the Coens' poisoned arrows. As always, a terrific cast supports this endeavor. First and foremost Brad Pitt has to receive special credit, not only for being the funniest of the lot but for willingly making a complete fool of himself for the role and doing it brilliantly. Actually this shouldn't come as a great surprise since he was equally hilarious as Mickey in Snatch and also as Jeffrey in Twelve Monkeys but this time he's funny in a completely different way. And this is a quality great actors share: always showing something new, something we haven't seen before. As for the rest of the cast it seems that the males got the funnier parts, Malkovich is great, Clooney is good (somewhat reminiscent of the character he played in O, Brother), while Frances McDormand could've been funnier (her name is spot on though). Other highlights include all the scenes that take place at the CIA (the concluding dialog between JK Simmons and David Rasche is a killer) and the first phone conversation between Pitt and Malkovich is deadly, too. So, what we get is a true Coen-style black comedy that provides numerous laughs and altogether great entertainment. And if you want to search for something meaningful beneath all this fun, you'll find that the movie is about how egoistic, lonely and lost we are when we elbow each other out of the way to accomplish our petty goals. It may not be as strong as The Big Lebowski but nonetheless proves that when it comes to sarcastic humor the Coens still stand way above the rest."
"spackard","8","1","3","2 January 2009"," One of the Funnier Coen Works
","I heard one reviewer say that this film is a ""Bubby Movie,"" yah know one of those films where every actor is friends with every other actor and the director (or in this case directors) and they all basically just dick around on camera for 2 hours and call it a movie. I wouldn't call it that necessarily call Burn After Reading that but I would call it a ""Hollywood Indie."" A Hollywood Indie is a mainstream Hollywood film with a big budget and a huge A-List cast, but whose script sounds like it was written by a struggling Brooklyn artist who previous experiences in film consisted of making Pods for Current TV about how great Barrack Obama apparently is.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers seem to be the kings of Hollywood Indies, since they directed half of the ones I can name off the top of my head. Burn After Reading will most likely be counted among the lesser of the Coen Brothers films, and rightly so since it does seem to lack the aesthetic appeal of their previous films, but I don't think this film should be counted as one of the their funnier films. Most of the Coen Brother's ""Comedies"" aren't really comedies, their more like movies that are weird in a kind of funny way. Yet the Invisible Pigeon Holeing Society must assign these films a genre, and since their not weird enough to be labeled surrealist or experimental, they get the title comedies simply because a few people in the theater may giggle a few of the ""Jokes"" in the film.<br/><br/>The point I am desperately trying to get to here is that, I didn't laugh at either The Big Lebowski or O' Brother, Where Art' Thou despite the fact they are rather funny, I laughed several times at Burn After Reading, and I laughed rather hard to. Burn After Reading is weird, as are all Dark Comedies, but it's not quite to the level as most Coen films, weather this a complement of an insult is a matter of interpretation.<br/><br/>What really impressed me in this film was Brad Pitt's and Frances McDormand's performances, everyone else's performances were ""take it or leave it."" Brad and Frances are like some kind of weird Fitness Center Employee Duo who stumble upon CIA secrets somehow and try to milk to cow for what it's worth. I knew Frances was a good actress, but Brad Pitt acting well is something new to me. I mean I always through his performance in Fight Club was good only because he really was playing the same character he usually does but this time in a quality film. I don't know if the Coen Brothers did something to him, or maybe he's been hiding something from us, but his character is by far the best in the film. But then again his character is a dribbling idiotic health nut with some mildly homosexual personality traits, so maybe Brad wasn't even acting, maybe he was just being himself (Ha Ha Ha).<br/><br/>What makes Burn after reading less of a film then most Coen Brother's work is that there is not any real thought involved. The second I pressed the stop button on my DVD I almost totally forgot about the movie, a good film is one can't get out of your head for a week after watching it, and most Coen Brother films do that. Listen, Burn After Reading is out on DVD now so it's defiantly worth renting, especially if you have Netflix. It's good for some laughs, and it's still rather Coen-y so go pick it up."

","I went and saw Burn After Reading, with my girlfriend and her parents. I suggested this movie to them because I like the partnership between Clooney and Pitt. After watching the Oceans 11, 12, and 13 series I knew these two had the necessary, dry comedic timing that is essential for a piece like this. It takes a story which, to most of us, and to Frances McDormand in this film, is an important issue and twists it a little. It is a good example of how something that might seem more important to us, can be blown out of proportion and turned into something that it's not. That's what happens in this film, and I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but, it's definitely a classic blend of comedy and tragedy. Having an ensemble cast, and using the soap opera/pulp fiction style story telling, so two seemingly unconnected plots, have an effect on one another makes this film a plus, for anyone pursuing a career in cinema.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up, four stars, and a must see.

","'Burn After Reading' is an interesting but uneven screwball comedy about greed, vanity, and the CIA. If that sounds pretty random, that's because it is. The film struggled to find an appropriate tone, juxtaposing funny and serious elements haphazardly. One might characterize it as one of the Coen brothers' minor works. However, it doesn't seem that way given the all-star cast. Thankfully, the efforts of Pitt, McDormand, Clooney, Swinton, and Malkovich aren't completely wasted. There are plenty of laughs and decent performances all around. Seeing Brad Pitt act like a tool is worth the price of admission.

"RResende","Null","1","3","20 October 2008"," Genre: Coens
","It's good to watch a film by the Coens, no matter what they do. They are clever filmmakers, who have their creations always embedded in cinematic reflections, which is to say, their films exist because other films exist to support them, and for us to fully appreciate a film by these brothers, we must have a knowledge of previous creations. So far, with that work of deconstruction of genres and previous films, they have created very strong and important films, like 'Miller's Crossing' or 'Big Lebowsky'.<br/><br/>Other times, they're just not so incisive, and they just make films to amuse themselves, and the audience. This is the case. We can understand how their previous 'serious work' influences this one, but this was made out of pure fun, and says nothing they haven't said before. But it is still fun to watch: <br/><br/>We have a story about people who follow people, plots and subplots. Everything twists around infidelities which cause chain reaction events. Each character thinks he controls the game he is trying to play, but everybody has somebody tailing him and something he doesn't know. These lives are observed, from an upper level, by someone who has the access to all the information but simply doesn't know what to make of it. This is epitomized by the initial and ending images, satellite captured images, 'google earth' type.

","First let me say that the movie was not the best comedy the Coens have created, but it is one of the best comedies of the year. The main issue I would like to address is a comment I have seen in many reviews: specifically that the Coens never create likable characters and that they are misogynists. It is true that the Coens do not create many knights in shining armor. Each and every one of their characters does seem to be flawed in one way or another. However, I for one find something to either like or admire in most of their characters. Does a character need to be perfect to earn our love and sympathy? <br/><br/>Francis McDormand's character is not smart and she has low self esteem, but she has motivation and drive to spare. Sure she has her flaws but A) I find it possible to love people with an IQ below 100 and B) why should we hate her just because she has bought the media's message that you must look like a runway model? If I looked down on every woman I knew that was overly influenced by societal beauty norms, I would have to look down on some wonderful human beings. <br/><br/>The Pitt character just likes to keep fit and listen to fun music. He isn't smart but his goals in life are simple (fitness & fun music) and having goals like that doesn't really harm anyone. I think he would be very surprised to learn that other people look down on him for his low aspirations in life. Is it not possible to be sympathetic towards a guy who just wants to have fun? I would rather have an unreflective fun-seeking friend than an always serious stick-in-the-mud friend any day. I see plenty of people who know how to work, eat, sleep, & talk about their stock portfolios but forgot how to have fun back when they graduated from college. I like these people, but they are no better or worse than Pitt's Chad. Both types have their good and bad points. <br/><br/>What about the Clooney character? He is a bit less lovable than some of the other characters. However, I think he truly loves his wife (unfortunately he is such a nympho that he also feels the need to get some on the side as well). He has charisma, and he has a child-like quality about him (note the strange way he unveiled his ""project"" in the basement. A 6-year-old would have revealed their newly built birdhouse to a parent in the same way). He can make people laugh and though his actions of necessity will cause the women around him pain, he seems like the kind of guy who really doesn't want to cause anyone pain (not that this is enough to keep him from his destructive path). Clooney's character may not be easy to love, but I don't think he is a villain and I don't feel that the viewer must hate him. <br/><br/>I will not waste anymore time evaluating the rest of the imperfect Coen characters. I certainly don't feel the need to hate or look down on most Coen characters and I don't feel that the Coens themselves feel that their characters are horrible individuals. Perhaps the misogyny is not in the Coens but in the critics who feel compelled to hate the characters that the Coens create."

","All of Burn's characters are completely absorbed by their perceptions of themselves, whether it be sexual deviant, blackmailer, or lover. Linda (Frances Mcormand's character) however, seems more obsessed with what she could be. Linda, a lonely late middle-aged woman obsessed with the notion that she needs plastic surgery, is constantly perusing the internet to find suitors to date. Her inability to find Mr. Right leads her to the belief that she needs several plastic surgery procedures in order to re-invent her self, and therefore her sexual exploits, hopefully landing a man.

This won't be one of them.<br/><br/>There were so many talented actors doing excellent work (though I must say that Brad Pitt playing against type just did not score and was ultimately a victim of miscasting). The script got off to a very slow start and gained very little speed. I kept waiting for the action to begin--thinking that we were going through a remarkably extended period of initial exposition, as the characters were established. And then, the film ended.<br/><br/>The most interesting character (for me) was J. K. Simmons, who had two scenes and did not do anything but comment on the plot (perhaps giving the audience someone to identify with).<br/><br/>After seeing this mildly entertaining way to kill two hours, I can't help but wonder if this project would have been given the green light had the script been pitched by a totally unknown writer.

","Not the Coens' most ambitious film, that must go to Country for Old men, but it certainly is a very pleasant viewing experience. More accessible to the spectator, not used to the Coens' very unique storytelling.<br/><br/>This features some absolute brilliant performances, especially by Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Nobody can quite make idiocy seem dignified quite as good as them. There is a terrible shocking visual about 2/3 into the movie, which might seem ordinary to people used to hardcore violence, but see it and think about who it happens to. Only the Coens' would have the nerve to let that happen.<br/><br/>Pretty much devoid of artsy stuff, which is also pretty rare for them, but still not a straightforward action thriller. Not an ordinary film by any means, but not at all confusing which some of their efforts have been. I really couldn't figure out Intolerable Cruelty, which sort of is in the vein of this film.<br/><br/>The best performance, though, is by Frances McDormand. You don't quite understand her character's motivations, but she is charming, funny and also kind of sad - everything a character should possess if you are to care about it.<br/><br/>So, absolutely worth watching and another shock is the end - I thought really, that's it? But in hindsight, how else could it end?"
"ackstasis","7","1","4","10 January 2010"," ""You are part of a league of morons""
","In my review of 'North by Northwest (1959),' I proposed that Hitchcock had depicted his F.B.I. agents as omniscient deities presiding over the affairs of Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), interceding sporadically in a Deus Ex Machina-like fashion. 'Burn After Reading (2008)' â€“ the Coen brothers' follow-up to 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' â€“ uses the government authorities in a similar manner. Unlike Hitchcock's Gods, however, the Coens' authorities are hardly omniscient. Owing to round- the-clock surveillance of suspicious individuals, the government is continually aware of the characters' movements; less complete, however, is their understanding of the characters' motivations, and, frankly, they don't want to know. ""Report back to me when it makes sense,"" orders a high-ranking C.I.A. official (J.K. Simmons), who's so befuddled at the behaviour of this handful of American citizens that he'd rather cover up their crimes than get to the bottom of them.<br/><br/>'Burn After Reading' is a send-up of the thriller, rather than a straight example of the genre. Gym employees Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are complete idiots who happen to stumble upon the memoirs of an insignificant government employee, Osbourne (John Malkovich), and attempt to blackmail him for them. Meanwhile, philandering charmer Harry (George Clooney) sneaks around with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton), and eventually gets himself into all sorts of paranoid strife. The Coens are no stranger to film noir, having incorporated the style into a good half of their films, and here the inevitable failure of greed is played for laughs more than anything else. This breeziness is only possible because the viewer is kept detached from the fates of the characters. Like the various institutions watching bemusedly from the sidelines â€“ government agents, divorce lawyers â€“ the audience is merely a curious spectator in a perverted game of chance."

","Outdoes your average movie and definitely Coen brothers best comedy since The Big Lebowski. Generally a great comedy that breaks a few clichÃ©s and will surprise outside the box.

John Malkovich is the man you love to hate and I love that about the guy.<br/><br/>Could probably with all honesty give the film a higher mark, but in the end I wasn't all that inspired with the movie, as the Coens have made better comedies and films in general. Also I think they overdid it a bit with all the swearing and the movie could have toned that down a notch. The end sequences with the 'cl&sterf^ck' would have been much more intense and memorable.<br/><br/>Definitely a suggested watch for anyone that's fed up with comedies that seem to be cardboard copies of each other and that are fully expendable.

"varundelpiero","8","1","4","17 February 2009"," Technically superb and complex Coen Brothers offering, but not without flaws...
","The Coen Brothers have touched upon so many film genres and combinations that it's getting harder and harder to keep track. Their follow-up to Best Picture of 2007, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is a delightfully complex comedy noir/thriller (that's the best description I could come up with) that won't win any awards but will live long in the memory.<br/><br/>The plot is complex, as expected, and filled with numerous twists (also expected), and most are done in an intelligent and complex manner. The cast is brilliant, with George Clooney (who seems to save his most hilarious performances for the Coen Brothers and Steven Soderbergh) leading the line in fine form. Frances McDormand is equally superb. Tilda Swinton apparently reprises her ice-queen role from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. John Malkovich takes advantage of his (apparent) semi-retirement to produce a quite captivating performance. Brad Pitt is good, but in my opinion there was a degree of (warranted?) overacting to his role.<br/><br/>BURN AFTER READING is not a masterpiece. At its worst it is an entertaining ride, full of unexpected plot twists and intertwining characters. At its best it can make for a delicious study of comedy noir/thrillers. The Coen Brothers rarely (if ever) disappoint. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Recommended, simply because it's the Coen Brothers, and it's (therefore) unique."

","Writer/directors Ethan and Joel Coen have already set their standard and BURN AFTER READING falls a bit short. There is just a notable absence of the substance that marked their previous mega-hits. Albeit the cast pushes forward and George Clooney and Brad Pitt are dangerously hilarious. Sex addiction, blackmail, marital infidelity, self-loving and murder occupy this outrageous spy comedy. John Malkovich plays a CIA agent that loses his job; so he decides to write his memoirs...as if anyone really cared. Two intelligence-challenged gym employees Pitt and Frances McDormand get their greedy little hands on a disc of irrelevant information believed to be CIA secrets and try selling such to the Russian embassy...as if anyone cared. Clooney is a sex addict that is being forced to leave his wife/girlfriend by his long-time friend and lover Tilda Swinton. Critics claim this effort from the Coens as smart and funny; maybe somewhat smart and at the same time brainlessly silly in place of funny.<br/><br/>Pitt and Clooney are not so disappointing, both have survived the trenches of mediocrity and are troopers..onward until you say wrap. And in my opinion Swinton could've been replaced with anyone. Also in the cast: David Rasche, Richard Jenkins and all-around favorite J.K. Simmons."

","If you start with the proposition that anything by the Coen brothers is worth seeing, you'll love ""Burn After Reading."" The leading roles belong to George Clooney, John Malkovitch, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton -- but the most noteworthy feature of this film may be the fact that Brad Pitt took on a secondary role and allowed himself to be portrayed as a brainless conspirator (with Ms. McDormand) in an effort to sell the Soviets a memoir by an ex-CIA agent (Malkovitch) dismissed for over-indulgence in alcohol. There are numerous plot twists and lots of absurdly funny scenes, topped off in this writer's opinion by J.K.

The movie had strong cast of Clooney, Pitt, McDormand, and Malcovich. All four of them did a great job: Brad Pitt's did excellent in his satirical role, McDormand and Malcovich didn't break character, and Clooney recovers from his last performance Leatherheads. When it comes to the story, viewers really need to ""read between the lines"" to full enjoy this picture.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock films since it had a clever storyline, interesting people, and similar camera motions.

","I just watched Coen Brother's latest film, and what a surprise. As I read somewhere this movie is about nothing at all and the premise is almost an excuse to make a movie.A great movie may I add...<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is a dark comedy which purpose is nothing more then to entertain, and this is entertainment at his best.Obviously the A-list actors push the movie to a different level. George Clooney plays (again), a charming womanizer but this time with a little twist, he's a bit paranoid and obsessed with sex. Frances McDormand does a hell of a job as the 40's gym employee who needs a ton of cosmetic surgeries in order to reinvent herself, and John Malkovich although he doesn't get that much screen time, he did well as the government worker and his ""wtf"" is priceless.But as I see it, Brad Pitt is the star of the movie,all his scenes are hilarious and who knew he could do comedy like this? He is one of the most accomplished actors I know and one of the most underrated as well, and I think he can pull off any type of role.In the end as the CIA superior says, ""we learned nothing""... but we sure as hell were entertained.<br/><br/>8/10"
"marcusdean118","8","1","4","27 October 2008"," Very Good
","I was distracted at the start. It didn't engage me. It was a bit slow and not much happened. I like Malkovich but i didn't really want to watch him anymore after seeing so much of how funny Brad Pitt looked from the trailer.<br/><br/>Don't read into it that much, the start was still better than half of the generic movies out there right now but it didn't match up to the rest of the movie. This doesn't mean that Malkovich is the short straw either as he and his character do get a lot better.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as I pretty much already guessed stole the show. Just as Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder and even though in a whole different context Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. If he doesn't get his 2nd Oscar nod (maybe 3rd if The Curious Case gets him one as well) for this then there is something cruelly wrong with this world. He's a shoe in for the golden globe nomination at least.<br/><br/>The plot is so Coen-esquire that you just can't help but smile the whole way through the film, even through some deliciously dark parts. Its laugh out loud funny and subtle funny at the same time. It's quick, sharp and breathtaking film-making.<br/><br/>Stellar performances from Pitt, McDormand and the minimally used J.K Simmons with apt help from Clooney make this the Coens best non serious movie since The Dude's last sip of his white Russian."
"pmdawn","8","1","4","26 October 2008"," The Burn Supremacy
","Burn After Reading is in many ways a typical Coens movie. It's filled with dark humour and quirky characters. But after No Country for Old Men, a fantastic movie, they decided to reinvent not only one but a few movie genres, including their own of course.<br/><br/>The A-list cast serves a well-defined purpose, which to an extent is to parody themselves. With the exception of Tilda Swinton, all of the characters were written with the specific actors in mind, and it works very well. In particular Brad Pitt seems to be having a lot of fun and Clooney plays one of his strangest and funniest characters ever. Coens ""Regular"" McDormand plays a cosmetic surgery / internet love obsessed gym staffer and Malkovich, well, he has had some experience with self-parody and it shows.<br/><br/>In fact the whole movie is a role-reversal of sorts, specially spy/thriller movies - Burn After Reading has all the right elements but twisted in the Coens own particular way. One of the reasons this movie works is because there is a constant feeling of ""what's gonna happen next?"", which keeps it interesting; and the constant surprising twists and turns the story takes. Even the McGuffin element here works this way.<br/><br/>This is a sometimes dark, but always humorous film - the CIA scenes in particular cracked me up. If you're a Coens fan, this is an obligatory treat.<br/><br/>However, if your first and only exposure to the brothers work was No Country For Old Men, be prepared for something very different in both scope and approach; perhaps a viewing of their previous movies would be in order for this to be fully appreciated.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is a really funny movie. It seemed like everyone in the theater enjoyed it -- there was frequent loud and extended laughter. The last line (spoken by the ubiquitous J.K.

Perhaps they saw some other movie titled ""Burn After Reading.""<br/><br/>These characters were not designed to be taken seriously. Part of the fun was in the repetition of bizarre behavior. Brad Pitt was especially funny, with his gum-chewing, head-bopping characterization of a naive, not-too-smart personal trainer. John Malkovitch and George Clooney are masters of this kind of stuff, and Tilda Swinton got laughs out of her trademark uptight persona, carried to the nth degree.<br/><br/>And what can I say about Frances MacDormand? She has been terrific in every part I've even seen her in. <br/><br/>Only Richard Jenkins seems to be in another movie, a more sensitive tearjerker, not this uproarious black comedy. <br/><br/>Back to J.K.

"Vishal_s_kumar","9","1","4","11 October 2008"," Brilliance shines once again in the Coens territory
","Throughout the '90s, Joel and Ethan Coen churned out riveting, unpredictable films that defied categorization, culminating in the musical-comedy-odyssey O Brother, Where Art Thou? in 2000. After that, the quality and quantity of their output dropped off until the critically acclaimed masterpiece, No Country for Old Men, last year, followed by Burn After Reading this year. While the former was the Coens' most serious work to date, the latter harkened back to the offbeat humor and trademark quirkiness of their '90s gems in a way that was fresh and deceptively frivolous. With Brad Pitt, George Clooney and John Malkovich, Burn After Reading certainly pulls together the heaviest star-studded cast ever assembled by the Coen brothers, who previously tended to work with a troupe of immensely talented lesser knowns, like Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. It remains to be seen if the film will achieve the recognition or cult following of the duo's most beloved dark comedies like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but it certainly should. At its essence, Burn After Reading is an exploration of greed, selfishness and alienation. With a spotlight on failing marriages, ""me-first"" protagonists and meaningless encounters, the film delves into the ludicrous ways people forge or fold relationships in today's world of demanding work schedules, cyberspace, gyms and self-improvement. Big deal, right? Many films focus on those issues. But what makes Burn After Reading unique and brilliant is the way it pushes mundane domestic issues toward the realm of CIA files, covert operatives and unforeseeable violence--all with the Coen brothers' trademark comedic quirks. To weave the plot, the Coens avoid a central character, and drive the pace of the narrative through several key figures: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) and to a lesser extent Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt). <br/><br/>After a dramatic camera shot descending from space into CIA headquarters, the film opens with Osbourne, a mid-tier analyst, stepping into his manager's office. He is being moved off an important case because he has a drinking problem. Ensuring his termination, Osbourne reacts with rage that he sustains throughout the film. He then goes home and fixes a drink. Osbourne gets an earful when he tells his bossy wife, Katie, that he is fired. We soon learn she is sleeping with Harry, and we soon learn that he loves his wife but will sleep with almost anyone he meets on a dating website. Meanwhile, Litzke is dating, too, but is obsessed with the prospect of plastic surgery, which she sees as the key to meeting a quality man and ultimate happiness. Litzke and her sidekick Feldheimer come into possession of a mysterious CD documenting intelligence findings, which had been left at their place of employment, Hardbodies. Katie's divorce lawyer had asked her to copy files from Osbourne's computer, and the lawyer's employee lost the CD at the gym. The rest of the film goes in unforeseeable directions. What a complex web the Coens weave. <br/><br/>While no character is totally sympathetic, Osbourne is probably the easiest to identify with. Though his rage can be a turnoff, it's easy to understand. He has been called into his boss' office and faced challenges with his cold wife as well as unfair demands from others in the film. But even if the audience can relate to Osbourne, characters are too quirky and unsympathetic overall, so Burn After Reading must survive more on the narrative flow and bizarre humor of the Coen script than on the audience finding common ground with any protagonist. Yes, two of the most charismatic actors ever to appear on screen have major roles in the film, but the Coen brothers make them into very odd creatures. Feldheimer is especially slow. Litzke is not much brighter. The actors show remarkable skill in adapting to the Coens' needs and turning in offbeat, performances. The role of Pfarrer is similar to Clooney's suave yet superficial character in O Brother, Where Art Thou, but Pitt's character is truly a first for him and he achieves a quirky yet understated demeanor that, while odd, seems to work for Feldheimer. No doubt it is not what audiences expect to see when they tune in for a Brad Pitt movie, and many of his fans will be disappointed with the film. But that's fine. No one should go into Burn After Reading expecting something ordinary.<br/><br/>A-rate cast and superb performances by all makes this compelling viewing. Catch J K Simmons as the head of CIA - the most ""clueless"" of all."

"Rsbakopoulos","8","1","4","2 October 2008"," Pure Coen genius!
","I just managed to watch the film yesterday and I have to admit that I consider it already as one of my favourites Â–not just among the films made by the Coens, but also in general. Sure, if someone compares it to last year's ""No CountryÂ…"", ""BWR"" might seem a little ""light"" or, as some fellow viewers have put it, ""pointless"" or even ""rather stupid"". I wouldn't like to disagree with the people that didn't like the film, since, when it comes to art, we all know that points of view and tastes can be as many as the grinds of sand on a beach. However -and in my opinion- two things could be universally admitted: a) Every and each member of ""Burn after reading"" all-star cast puts on a fabulous performance: John Malkovich as the ex-CIA analyst who's flipped out right after his firing from the ""firm"", Tilda Swinton as the cold-blooded ""career woman"", George Clooney as the ""classic"" womanizer, Frances McDormand as the insecure (yet absolutely determined when it comes down to getting her cosmetic surgeries done) all-American female and (my personal favourite) Brad Pitt as the totally clueless gym employee. b) Despite the fact that this flick is under the ""comedy/farce"" genre, it is actually one of the most ""political"" films of the Coens, in a very smart yet ""underground"" manner, covering a very wide variety of issues concerning the American society, such as the condition of ""holly matrimony"" in the USA nowadays (apparently, every married man or woman in US seems to be ""doing"" everyone else except their ""better half"" without any hesitations), the way that the American State behaves to people that seemingly have ""served well"" their country for many years (John Malkovich's character in this case), the fact that the average American (""Linda Litzke"" in the case) is willing to ""sell"" his/her country to the enemy (Russians) for something as simple as having his/her ass and breasts fixed and, finally, the annoying -especially if you are white and you belong to the middle/upper class of the US society, like all of the main characters in the movie- fact that each and every American probably carries a certain amount of pure stupidity and ignorance. In other words, ""Burn after reading"" Â–even though it does not really ""take off"" at any point during its 95 minutes- is perhaps the best way to say ""America, this is who you are, today"" in the most hilarious yet discrete manner imaginable.

A true masterpiece of standard form, and a good representation of how personality and your own personal touch can really change the same old into something brilliant.

","I'm still asking myself the question. . *did* I enjoy this film? I'm really not sure. What was the film about again? A leaked CIA disk is used as blackmail and a string of characters are strung together .. getting involved with each other and some of them wind up dying. . and it wasn't a pointless movie because I laughed as several parts of the film .. but the other parts? I am a big fan of No Country. I like the Coens humour. But I can't help feeling that I wasted an hour and a half of my time trying to decide if I was enjoying it. I was not 'entertained' as such. I like how the Coens bring the characters out, but this was obviously not filmed at any great expense. No special photography. No really engaging acting, save that the different characters were amusing.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give this film any stars because I truly have no idea if I care enough :) Not that it's a bad film. I would only recommend Coens fans watch this, other people may find themselves staring blankly at the screen as a scene ends leaving the theater in silence.<br/><br/>I think they relied heavily on the swearing to raise laughter, which to be fair it did but on more than one occasion I found it to be unnecessary. I also found one key sequence in the film a little overly violent. I don't need to see somebody getting brutally axe murdered in the street.<br/><br/>Overall, I am not left with a great deal . . only to wonder what I was watching, but maybe that is the point. Who gives a rats rear end about the plot because it was character driven idiocy."
"diac228","5","1","4","22 September 2008"," ""So what did we learn from this?"" ""Um... I don't know. ""
","There are movies that teach you absolutely nothing, no matter what anyone says. I've been taught that every movie has a theme. Not this one. Burn After Reading is an extremely quirky tale about several lives running into each other because of a lost disk containing slews of classified information. The CD results in several gym employees heading into trouble, several adulteries being unraveled, mysterious activities emerging, and Russians joining in on the mayhem. However, we still learn nothing. The Coen Brothers ease the tension and stock up on the laughs as they write and direct a very original and unpredictable story about stupidity, and the consequences that follow. <br/><br/>Like previously stated, classified information owned by a recently-demoted C.I.A. agent (John Malkovich) is found by a couple of gym employees (Brad Pitt, Francis McDormand). Seeing it as a chance to earn some money, the gym employees ask for cash but things become complicated when the employees threaten to take the information elsewhere if they don't get a certain kind of reward. Many other characters are dragged into the situation under different circumstances; ranging from martial connections to being at the wrong place at the wrong time. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have had quite a repertoire of unique movies, and this one is no different. Blending suspense with dark comedy, mystery, and sequences of gut-wrenching violence, Burn After Reading is unlike the typical movie with a coherent plot and a clear image of where the film is going. The dialogue itself is realistic, witty, but suffers from too much profanity. This sounds childish or like an overprotective mother, but if you don't need to curse, why do it? Why do f-bombs have to scatter all over the movie like bad dandruff? This was the biggest issue with The Departed; it's a great script embezzled with the urge to spew so many dirty words it leaves the film with a bad smell. There's not enough soap in this planet for movies like Burn After Reading. <br/><br/>The all-star cast in Burn After Reading carries this movie more than anything else, even the content material. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the klutzy Chad, and Francis McDormand also shines as the airheaded and superficial co-worker of Chad. Everyone else, from the small roles of J.K. Simmons and Tilda Swinton, to the larger roles of George Clooney and John Malkovich did a respectable job bringing the tale to life. The Coen Brothers are excellent in fleshing out good performances from their cast; as for over two decades they have been responsible for filming amazing performances. <br/><br/>So good cast, decent writing, interesting story, what's wrong then? Well, it's all rather boring. The story, concept is good, but the execution was rather poor. Even at 96 minutes, it feels a bit on the stretchy side as there are several scenes that weren't very necessary, and when we could have used more screen time, the flick is over. There are times in which we have minutes of footage that doesn't even progress the story forward. Last but not least, the more entertaining characters actually appear less than the more serious ones (the supporting cast pretty much). The quirky surprises and plot twists can keep your eyes open for only so long. Then there's the musical score, which doesn't quite mesh well with the entire movie. <br/><br/>The Big Lebowski this is not, Intolerable Cruelty was even slightly more entertaining thanks to the chemistry created by Clooney and Zeta-Jones. This movie was full of chuckles, but no major laugh-out-loud moments unlike in Lebowski. A bit of ""heh,""""hee-hee,"" but no ""LOL."" Yea, that previous sentence would get me fired from any newspaper but that's the best way to describe Burn After Reading: light fluffy laughter that doesn't exactly add up to a worthy comedy. Then there is the ending; which has subtle nods to the finale of No Country For Old Men. This is a hit-and-miss decision by the Coen Brothers, but it comes off as tacky, short, and underwhelming.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Good cast, good story, poor execution. This is nowhere near as strong as No Country For Old Men, nor is it worthy of being a cult comedy classic like Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona. This is best suited as a small rental when there is nothing else to do on a stormy Monday evening. All of the characters here aren't very likable nor are they quote-worthy, with the lone exception of Brad Pitt's character, which even then you don't see much of. It was a ""cluster****"" of a movie, but one I wasn't that heavily engaged in. Being different and daring to break the movie-making rules is good, but when you defer so far from the original formula you might create a recipe that is too foreign for even your biggest fans. Burn After Reading: Eh.<br/><br/>P.S. Where's Steve Bescumi?"
"jaredmobarak","8","1","4","20 September 2008"," His optometrist has a sense of humorÂ…Burn After Reading
","Last year's No Country for Old Men showed the world that the Coen brothers could make a great film. After a pair of not-so-good flicks, no one really cared about them, two creative geniuses that crafted some of cinema's best black comedies of the 80s and 90s. Then came the Oscar winner, showing an attention to detail and precision pacing worthy of the accolades if not, in my opinion, the best film of the year. But it was so serious and unlike anything they had ever done; yes it had some very subtle laughs, however, it was a drama from start to finish. So, when the trailers for Burn After Reading hit the airwaves, I wasn't quite sure what I would get. It looked as though the Coens of yesteryear were truly back, mixing their quirky brand of wit with an underlying plot dealing with crime and blackmail. Did those thoughts come to fruition? You bet they did. This ranks with Miller's Crossing and Fargo as one of their best dark comedies. The runtime may drag a bit at times, but I think that may actually enhance the humor, feigning suspense and hitting us over the head with laughter.<br/><br/>It's a very smart script with some really fantastic performances, many of which are somewhat against type for the actor. Richard Jenkins is possibly the most obvious, playing a gym manager with no backbone whatsoever. He exudes fear, curling up into a ball when the slightest inclination of danger rears its head; a definite departure for someone used to playing strong, intelligent men. There is also Brad Pitt as a gym employee and co-mastermind behind the insane blackmail plot that the film revolves around. The filmmakers do nothing to make him look any younger than his actual age, and yet they have him act as though he is a child. Constantly dancing and jumping and being absolutely giddy with excitement, he is a little boy doing rather than thinking. The little things like complaining when he must wear a suit, or his juvenile disappointment when his reward demands go unresolved, or even his contemptuous, pompous laugh when his bike is demeanedÂ—""You think that's a Schwinn?""Â—only makes the role funnier because Pitt is almost always the calm collected one in films.<br/><br/>Then there is George Clooney, who actually carries the film, something you wouldn't think from the trailers. When the credits began and he was first billed, I was a tad confused. I had thought he would be a small role compared to the trio of Pitt, Frances McDormand, and John Malkovich when in fact he is the common factor linking them all. Clooney is a mess of nerves, constantly paranoid, a security Marshall in the treasury department who seemingly does no work. If the CIA operatives that we cut to every now and then didn't mention his job, I would have believed he made it upÂ—the guy just walks around with his gun, (never fired in 20 years on the jobÂ…hmmm, that's not a bit of foreshadowing is it?), has relations with multiple women, and spends his time welding something very intriguing in his basement. Watching him off-kilter and not fully composed is a welcome change of pace in his canon of work, while being par for the course here as no one really has it all together.<br/><br/>It is the slight imbecility of each character that allows the story to push forward. As J.K. Simmons' CIA Chief constantly agrees with, everyone is confused about what's going on. These people are all out of their leagues, causing unnecessary trouble, bringing the Russians into the fold, and leaving dead bodies. One of the best lines is when he utters, ""well we learned something here, not to do that again Â… whatever it was we did."" Everything happens due to the random forgetfulness of a divorce lawyer's secretary. She accidentally leaves a disc at the gym containing the memoirs of her boss's client's husband, a former CIA analyst (Malkovich in a nicely dangerous and angry role). The utter stupidity of the morons working at Hardbodies cause a chain reaction that unravels the lies and deceit running rampant through everyone's sordid and sad lives. They are all self-absorbed in their own pursuits of happiness that everything becomes excellent fodder for intelligent comedy, not needing to rely on physical humor. Although those few instances of it, Malkovich punching Pitt for one, do succeed.<br/><br/>To speak about the multiple intertwining of players would ruin some of the surprises that occur, but let's just say everyone ends up meeting the others at some point, either face to face or by reputation. A comedy of errors, the lack of smarts for most roles rivals that in Raising Arizona, but the plot here is so much more detailed. There are some surprises, Clooney's invention and of course his encounter with Pitt, but mostly it is the waiting to see how far the farce will go that keeps you in the seat. We as the audience know that it all depends on a disc with unimportant information, so the real fun comes from seeing if everyone in the film will realize it as well. David Rasche and Simmons' brief interludes, (I really love the CIA scenes with the echoing footsteps and stark white walls), are the glue that keeps everything sane. Those two trying to wrap their heads around what is happening may be read into as a commentary on the stupidity of our government, but to me, because they just can't fathom what is going on around themÂ—not because they don't know the details, they just can't comprehend the ultimate goalÂ—it is more a comment on how stupid civilians are. Trying to grab cash anyway they can, people will do anything, especially things without any sound judgment at all."

","http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.com<br/><br/>Boys will be boys. The same goes for how the Coens will always be the Coens. Following their most successful movie in their career, No Country for Old Men, they return to their quirky selves with this goofball, spy-thriller, comedyÂ… or something like that. I don't know, I can never quite categorize a Coen brothers film.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the plot in a nutshell and I promise not to give too much away. CIA agent Osborne Cox (Malkovich) quits his job after being demoted because of a drinking problem. His wife, Katie (Swinton), is having an affair with an ex-secret service agent Harry Pfarrer (Clooney). Harry debates whether or not to leave his wife for Katie, but at the same time uses online dating for one night stands and meets Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand). Linda works at a gym with her bumbling friend Chad (Pitt) who stumbles upon a disc of CIA information that traces back to Osborne Cox. Their scheme is to blackmail Cox for money that Linda needs for cosmetic surgery.<br/><br/>Okay, is your head spinning? Because mine sure was during the film. Nonetheless, the Coens found a way to make this silly spy satire into something extremely enjoyable. All of the characters were memorable and it was just pure fun to see these actors in roles they have never played before (besides John Malkovich who always plays the foul mouthed, angry and bitter man). There were a number of minor plot twists to prevent this film from committing clichÃ©s, and a fair balance of comedy and depth to keep me interested.<br/><br/>If you're expecting another Oscar contender from the Coens, you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a smart, zany filmÂ… then Burn After Reading will please your needs. It's not the Coens' best work, but it's still pretty darn good."
"drew-kennedy","8","1","4","18 September 2008"," Post ""No Country"" comedy
","I would have given a negative review if I discussed this movie right after seeing it, at a screening. After seeing the trailer, I thought the Coens' would yet again follow one of their critically successful thrillers with a zany, nonsensical, off-the-wall, immediately critically panned, but destine-to-be-cult-classic comedies...and I was excited. So in comparison to the wackiness of ""Lebowski"" or even ""Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Raising Arizona"" in my opinion, this movie seems dull and the ""no ending"" ending seems like a cop out. <br/><br/>However, given the massive public and critical success of ""No Country"" this movie has a different audience then the previous Coen comedies. I think they try to cater to fans of old and new with this movie. <br/><br/>In comparison to ""No Country"", I think it must've been somewhat of a joke to use similar ""no ending"" endings to leave the audience with such different feelings. In ""No Country"" I felt a sombre sense of reality with the ending. Where as in this movie, I feel like everyone's time has been wasted by any work at all involved with this movie. This both drives home the absurdity of the intelligence community, and plays a great joke on me the audience member. <br/><br/>Again, as in ""No Country"" there are a lot of slow, suspenseful buildups to the action scenes. One of them involving almost seems like a practical joke from the Coen brothers, in the making for one and a half movies (I don't mind discussing the ending, but I think it is a SPOILER if I say what the joke is). Another scene is extremely graphic, it is out of nowhere, reminding us that the person, and the movie is nuts. <br/><br/>The movie might not have as many memorable quotes as previous Coen bros. comedies, but the running jokes involving swear words are hilarious. The Coens' could teach a course in film school entitled ""How to swear in the movies"" to screenwriters and directors. And if ""How to swear in the movies"" was taught to actors, I could think of no one to profess better than John Malkovich. At the very least, these running jokes will keep you smirking during the movie. <br/><br/>For the Coen bros. fanatic, this may not be the best, if you feel like watching the a movie like ""the Big Lebowski"", then just watch ""the Big Lebowski"" again - it gets better every time, right? However, if you are torn between ""the Big Lebowski"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" then try ""Burn After Reading"""
"projectmayhem1138","9","1","4","12 September 2008"," Minor Coen, but a worthy film in every way
","Brun After Reading is the kind of film that feels like a breath of fresh air at this time of year. Right after Labor Day, when studios dump all of their left-over garbage into theaters in preparation for Oscar season, comes a film both brilliantly original and character-driven. The characters and the film delightfully ludicrous plot drive this one forward as was the case in such previous endeavors as Fargo and The Big Lebowski. The film begins when Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich, in a role only he could pull off), a CIA analyst quits his job and begins to write his memoirs (which really interest no one). His wife (Tilda Swinton, cold as ice) is secretly having an affair with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney, who here mixes paranoia and suave womanizer stylings perfectly) who also gets involved with Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), a gym employee who desperately seeks to get a series of plastic surgeries to fix her looks, which make her miserable. Litzke and Chad Feldheimer (Bbrad Pitt, who steals the show, as expected) find a CD at the gym that they learn belongs to Cox ad which they believe is filled with sensitive government information. They proceed to attempt to blackmail him. Richard Jenkins is also very good as their boss who unsuccessfully tries to convey to Linda the fact that he is in love with her. There are a long series of twists and turns to this film, which is what makes it so interesting from start to finish. I really enjoyed it. It's not as funny as some of the previous films, especially Fargo, but the jokes that hit hit hard, and the characters are downright fascinating. The real show-stopping scenes for me were the ones featuring J.K. Simmons as the head of the CIA. Those parts were hilarious, and I'll let you discover them for yourself. The only thing I should mention as a real disappointment is the lack of Roger Deakins's cinematography. He has collaborated with the Coens since Miller's Crossing, and his absence is made obvious by the fact that this film's look is a lot less appealing and impressive than those with Deakins as the Director of Photography. A small bother. I really recommend this film, especially since it is the first great new film that's been out in the past few weeks. i hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

Apart from intelligence agencies knowing everything about everyone, potential divorcees gaining stalkers and the idiocy of suburban humans, I really didn't see much point to this. Having said that, its competently made and a pleasant watch. Explaining the plot is like battling Bobby Fischer at chess, you just don't do it. If you like the Coens, ensemble casts and dark humour then go for it and I'm sure you'll have a good time. But basically a bunch of people seemingly (or coincidentally...) are linked with a secret document being misplaced. Where might you ask? Just at the local fitness suite, no biggie. So the staff members hold the proposed recipient at ransom who's wife is cheating on a guy who's wife wants to divorce him but he is seeing other people in which one of them is a staff member at the gym and blah blah blah. It's all mental crazy stupid fun, but to a point where none of this is believable. Is that part of the humour? I guess so. Heck, all I wanted to see was John Malkovich shout profanity at everyone, in which he did so I was pleased. Brad Pitt was surprisingly funny. Frances McDormand had some of the best lines in what was a consistently witty script. George Clooney throws a dildo at the wall in a rage. Tilda Swinton was...present. Richard Jenkins was underused. Finally, JK Simmons leaves us with a summary of what we learnt: ""nothing. Or atleast never to do it again"". Whilst all the above performances were good with a darkly humorous script and solid direction from the Coens...it just felt messy. The first half which introduces all of our characters spontaneously really wasn't engaging at all. Consistently switching between everyone without establishing a plot. It's only when the characters start connecting that we ourselves connect with the story. However, with all the lunacy and outlandish events the film just abruptly ends. Underwhelming."

"nturner","9","1","5","9 January 2009"," A Dark Romp
","This is a real kick of a movie. Ethan and Joel Coen are noted for their dark humor and absurd situations, and in this film, they give the audience a witty satire on the security community - throwing in a neat stab at the attitude of those who man the exercise centers of our country. Be aware that just about everyone in this film is a dolt, and if not a dolt, a bastard or a bitch. Throw self-centered security and exercise nuts together and shake - you get Burn After Reading.<br/><br/>The basic plot is fairly simple - simple, that is, as the ultra creative Coens can make it. A security man has been forced out of his job and decides to write a tell-all memoir. His discontented wife is having an affair with another security man - a sex manic who seeks pleasure with every woman he meets. A disk containing some data for the memoir is found by a exercise consultant who thinks she needs extensive, very expensive plastic surgery in order to attract a man. She and her fellow worker decide to hold the disk for ransom in order to raise the money for the surgery. As I said, simple! Handled in the wrong way, this absurd plot would have been a silly, juvenile mess, but the Coens have taken this ludicrousness and made a highly entertaining romp. It is the directing and acting that bring this beautiful farce to its high altitude. Needless-to-say, the Coens are geniuses at this sort of thing, and they have a stable of super actors to bring their warped vision to fruition.<br/><br/>John Malkovich plays the disillusioned security man on his way out. He's a drunk, and a surly drunk at that. He pretty much hates the world and wants everyone in it to suffer. Malkovich has the unique ability to play such a character and still make the audience feel a little sorry for him.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton plays Malkovich's bitch of a wife who is having an affair with the sex-crazy guy. She is a pediatrician who hates children. What more needs to be said? Swinton plays this cold woman to the hilt.<br/><br/>George Clooney is the lover who can't get enough sex from anyone. Plus, he is probably the second biggest dolt in the film. Clooney is just great in this role - a real treat to watch.<br/><br/>All of the acting is superior - including all supporting characters - but Brad Pitt absolutely steals the show as a not very bright fitness nut determined to help his friend finance her plastic surgery.<br/><br/>That friend is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand. She has mastered the technique of making even the most outlandish character believable, and she certainly pulls out all the stops on this one.<br/><br/>It is beyond my belief that a large number of critics did not like this film. I can only assume that they have completely lost their senses of humor and absurdity or never had them in the first place. Burn After Reading is an absurd delight created by super directing, a very witty script, and exceptional acting. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't get one good chuckle after another from this one."

","At first I thought this was another George Clooney/Brad Pitt 'Oceans' style collaboration. Interesting but ultimately daft. I was right. It is also more than that.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where it would be nice not to worry too much about the plot. However, the plot is so convoluted and daft that it is almost too much to ignore it. Here goes: Frances McDormand's character Linda wants a lot of surgery and can't get it through her medical insurance. She has convinced herself that, without it, life is boring.Until she gets the surgery, she will carry on dating a variety of rather pointless men. Enter Oz Cox. Oz Cox is a frustrated CIA/G man who is about to lose his job. His bosses claim he has a drink problem and his only defence is to blame his Mormon colleague (who is sober). He eventually quits his job and decides to write his rather dull memoirs. Now here is where it gets complex. Oz Cox's wife played by Tilda Swinton is having an affair with George Clooney's character Harry Pfarrar. Harry Pfarrar is serial dating a couple of women besides being married. One day, Oz Cox's legal secretary leaves a CD of his memoirs in the gym where Frances McDormand's character works along with her somewhat dim colleague played by Brad Pitt. It is Pitt who discovers the CD and realises or rather thinks, it might be valuable. Linda (Frances McDormand) decides to get onboard, turning into the brains of the operation. The pair of them decide to blackmail Oz Cox for a lot of money, enough to pay for Linda's surgery etc. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the pair bank on the disk's importance. The CD, it turns out, contains nothing particularly interesting to the Russians, who they take it to. The Russians inform the CIA/FBI etc (Oz's bosses). They appear to be confused over the whole mess. With me so far!<br/><br/>So Linda decides to internet date Harry (George) who is involved with Oz's wife. In the meantime, Tilda Swinton playing Oz's wife decides to leave Oz and locks him out of their house. For some peculiar reason, Brad Pitt's character has to pay a visit to the house but only runs into Harry and ends up accidentally shot. <br/><br/>There are a lot of sub-plots in this movie. There is Harry Pfarrar who seems to be a sub-plot all by himself, played admirably by George Clooney who is a study in rather nicely dressed paranoia. On top of that, is the thing he is designing, which is a kind of 'love chair' which he shows to Frances McDormand's character. The Coen bros have a couple of lovely moments in the film where George thinks he is being followed by the Government which is a very nice nod/salute to George Clooney's politically motivated films and interests. Brad Pitt also acquits himself well as the nutty gym instructor with strange hair. But for my money, it is John Malkovitch as Oz Cox who really shines or rather tries to, with a character who should have been better written. Some of Malkovitch's lines are horrible, acres of the f-word. This is disappointing. Malkovitch is a truly brilliant actor, completely in his own league and very intelligent. Why couldn't the Coens give him better material to say? The same with Tilda Swinton. Again, brilliant, intelligent actress who has nothing good to say at all, her character being reduced to that of a red-haired sarcastic harridan. Again, please do better next time."

","The first thing which is noticeable about the movie is the cast- George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malcowich, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand & Richard Jenkins. Last years academy award director duo-Coen Brothers are back this year with what they are best at- wry dark humor & situational fix drama but this time burning their bucks on huge star cast (as you see the above list). CIA agent Cox was fired & his CD containing his memoirs became the object of turmoil in every character's lives. It's quite complicated & insulting for the film if I write anything further about the story because that will mar the mood for its viewers. <br/><br/>Well the movie is short & so every character has to play a limited time roll & scenes to show their talents within the complicated script. For example- Brad Pitt's character is just surprising & seems like a guest appearance. Apart of all the characters & actors here the script is the real hero. Out of all glossy star cast the full marks goes to Francis McDormand's performance that put a life in such a complicated character. Movie isn't brilliant piece compared to the early track record of Coen Brothers but it's definitely one of the fine attempts of the year representing the meaningless tragedy depicting human absurdity with black humor. Worth a look."

","The Coens are at it again. After No Country for Old Men, they have produced another ace. But both movies are highly contrasting. No Country was dark, but Burn After Reading is one hell of a laughter riot. Its been a long time since the Coens gave us something to laugh at. It involves some brilliant performances, including the paranoid George Clooney, the ex CIA Chief John Malkovich, the clueless gym employee Brad Pitt, and like always in a Coen movie, Frances Mcdormand. She has put forward yet another astounding performance. Even Richard Jenkins the gym boss was very impressive. Add to this useful cameos by J.K. Simmons, Olek Krupa.<br/><br/>On a serious note, the movie also has a subtle message. Just like most other Coen movies, the last scene was reserved to put forward this message. When JK Simmons says,""What did we learn from this ?? To not repeat what we did. But what did we do ??"" Amidst this laughter riot, and the twists and turns, there this one line which stands out. Heads up mates. A brilliant 8/10!!"
"LazySod","7","1","5","6 November 2008"," Not the Coen brothers' best ,but fun either way
","Mystery, mayhem, massive mix ups of people. Misunderstandings and wrong interpretations. Deceit, trickery and complete astonishment. That'd be the keywords for this film. It's not the first comedy done by the Coen brothers and I surely hope it won't be the last. After their previous, No Country For Old Men, it fell a bit strange and it might even have pulled a partly wrong audience to the cinema, but it works for me, I've been watching their films ever since I found myself crying with laughter over Raising Arizona and have been amazed at their combined talents quite a few times.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film starts rolling when two workers in a health/fitness center find a CD full of what they think to be government secrets. The trail of events that starts there is far fetched but not so far it becomes entirely unbelievable and the trail of people that is followed through the film is both long and highly varying. The effect of that is that there is always something to do on the screen, making the film rather entertaining. Some of the characters fall a small bit out of place but not so far that they become a true nuisance.<br/><br/>Finally, the show is stolen by three players: Brad Pitt who returns a small bit to the marvelous role of a madman he played in Twelve Monkeys by putting down a somewhat slow health-care/fitness agent here, Frances McDormand who spotlessly plays a somewhat neurotic coworker of Pitt and John Malkovich who puts down the angered special agent with a class only he can. The rest of the casting is very good too, but for me the above three really pulled the film.<br/><br/>All in all this is not the best work by the Coen brothers (for me Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski outclass this one as comedies) but it delivers and that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 secrets uncovered"

It has got a great cast so watching them is already a pleasure. Characters are introduced and developed well, and I care about them. Out of all the characters, I like Ted (Richard Jenkins) the best because he is the most sympathetic. He did not know about the plot until right at the end, but got dragged into it with a rather sad result. Chad (Brad Pitt) feels a little weird, I think Brad Pitt is not so suited to the gym instructor role.<br/><br/>The ending is a little rushed, as it wraps up the fate of all the characters in a short scene. I find that not so satisfying."
"freemantle_uk","7","1","5","20 October 2008"," Fun film for the Coen Brothers
","The Coen Brothers are some of the finest filmmakers around, and have shown to be able to make excellent serious films like Miller's Crossing, Fargo and No Country for Old Men to screwball comedies like the great the Big Lebowski. Burn After Reading falls into the comedy genre.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing, especially for people who are not use to Coen Brothers films, but I'll give it a shot. Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) quits from the CIA after being demoted and seeks revenge by writing his memoirs. His English wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) has a real dislike for Ozzie and is having an affair with a US Marshall, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), who is married to a children's author. Katie wants to divorce Ossie and tries to get a much financial information as possible and copies it and the memoirs onto a CD. However, her lawyers loose the CD in a gym and its found by gym workers Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand). They believe they found top-secret information on the disk. Linda is on the wrong sign of forty, looking for love on the internet and wants some cosmetic surgery. Both Chad and Linda decide to blackmail Ozzie for the sum of $50,000. At the same time, the audience finds out that Harry is a sex addict and goes on the same dating website as Linda to look for partners. He ends up dating Linda and form a relationship when Harry's wife is out of town. When Ozzie refuses to pay Chad and Linda both decide to take the information to Russian embassy and offer to sell it to them. However this leads to them thinking they need to get more information for the Russians and alerts the big-wigs of the CIA. As the web of sex and lies continue during the film it starts to have consequences for the characters.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading has a major trait of Coen Brothers of major characters who have separate aims and goals who end up interacting with each other. This happens in Fargo, No Country for Old Men and the Big Lebowski. As I said, it can be hard to follow if you don't know the work of the directors that well. Some people have described Burn After Reading as a parody of spy films. I didn't see it in the same way and I thought it was more a mick-take of the CIA and Washington D.C. because of their attitude and the bureaucracy. This was symbolised with J.K. Simmons playing the head of the CIA. It does make the CIA look pretty hopeless, which I guess quite a lot of people think is true. Americans may not know this, but in Britain they has been a issue about the intelligence services and government departments loosing sensitive information, and at the same time want to expand the amount of information they can hold on us. It adds a little topic humour to it. They are good acting performances in the film. Brad Pitt steals the show in this film, having most of the laughs and plays a total moron really well. John Malkovich is also going playing an easily angered, anti-social man who's life is falling a part. George Clooney is really good as a sleazy scumbag who is easy to dislike in the film. Frances McDormand is usual chirpy self, but is a little more downhearted compared to her role in Fargo. Tilda Swinton also offer a fine performance as a acid-tongued bitch who only thinks about herself and you wonder why she married Ozzie. The film is violence at times and its the only think that the Coen brothers know how to do: they are not filmmakers who are going to make a childens film in the near future.<br/><br/>The film is a funny, but I was a little disappointed because I excepted more. I was hoping for more laughs in the film. The best performances for comedy were from Pitt and Malkovich. As some critics have said, it looks like the Coen Brothers and the actors had a lot of fun making this film. As well, except for Chad and to a lesser exent Linda, they are no likable characters in Burn After Reading. It is a solid film but it could have been better. To sum up, its too serious to be an out and out comedy, but its too silly to be a serious film."
"fwomp","8","1","5","7 October 2008"," An Intelligent Comedy About Stupidity...
","Looking much more comedic by the previews movie-goers saw prior to its release, BURN AFTER READING isn't so much a laugh-out-loud film from beginning to end as it is a sneak-up-on-you-and-catch-you-off-guard style film that speaks to the intelligence of this film about ...well ...stupidity. Yes, stupidity.<br/><br/>From government higher-ups to health club morons, Burn After Reading shows us the ridiculous nature of those who want one thing, and those who think they know what's going on in the world but never really do. Let me explain...<br/><br/>Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich, THE LIBERTINE) is having a really bad year. He's just been relieved of his assignment desk at the CIA. His wife is having an affair. He drinks too much. And now he may have lost the memoirs he was working on.<br/><br/>Cut to a health club and we have Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY) looking for love on internet sites, but also under the impression that she's in desperate need of some serious plastic surgery (tummy tuck, breast enlargement, you name it). Her coworkers try to help by looking over her internet dating choices. One of her coworkers, Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt, BABEL) is a bit nutty but trying to be helpful. He also discovers that a CD found lying on the floor of the ladies room has ""secret sh!t"" on it (could this be Osbourne Cox's memoirs?).<br/><br/>Cut to Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney, MICHAEL CLAYTON), a Treasury Department employee who's overactive, extramarital sex life has him in deeper trouble than he could've ever imagined. Sexing it up with Osbourne's wife (played by Tilda Swinton, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA), Harry is somewhat of an internet sexual predator, not realizing that his wife is on to him and having him tailed.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>Linda and Chad try and blackmail Osbourne with his lost memoirs so that Linda can get some cash for her plastic surgery make-over. But Osbourne isn't having it. Chad is in for some rough times as he breaks into Osbourne's house, trying to find more ""secret sh!t"" to blackmail him with.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Osbourne's wife has kicked him out of the house and is prepared to move on with her life by hooking up with Harry (who's not looking to hook up with any one woman). Harry, in the meantime, is hooking up with Linda and learning some distressing news about Chad.<br/><br/>Back at the CIA...<br/><br/>CIA heads are trying to find out why Linda and Chad have gone to the Russian Embassy to sell Osbourne Cox's memoirs (Osbourne had nothing to do with the Russian sector of the CIA) and discovering that murder and mayhem have broken out since they released Osbourne from his position.<br/><br/>Whew! But the big question remains: Will Linda Litzke get her make-over? Sound like a lot? It is. But in the hands of master directors Joel and Ethan Coen (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) it is a wild and surprising ride.<br/><br/>The main thing I'd like to caution people with is that, again, this isn't a laugh-a-minute flick. It's subtle, very subtle, in the beginning. It builds on itself as the characters mesh and interact with one another. The Coen brothers show that they have the ability to surprise the audience with dramatic moments that overlap into comedic bits of interesting magnitude. Punches, gunshots, and skull-bashings are intermixed with lines of an absolute ridiculous nature, adding a unique flavor to this unusual comedy."

I enjoy Frances McDormand Â—she's terrific.I figured if she's in it, John Malkovich, J.K. Simmons is in it... then it should be interesting.

Fuming, Cox quits the cloak and dagger business and decides to write an autobiographical expose of the spy game. His wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton) is aghast at his decision but needs to run to the grocery for cheese to serve at their cocktail party. Coming to the affair will be her secret lover, Harry (George Clooney) and his author-wife. Harry works for the Treasury Department and, unknown to Katie, he is juggling several extramarital ""things."" Meanwhile, Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are much-poorer employees for a capital fitness chain called Hardbodies. Linda wants plastic surgery in the worst way, four different procedures, in fact, that up to thousands of dollars and her medical insurance won't pay. Chad is sympathetic, so when they find a disc at the gym, which happens to be the rough draft of Cox's tell-all, they decide to engage in a little blackmail. But, can these two less-than-brilliant fitness trainers really tread water in the vast ocean of espionage? We'll see, even as all of these players cross paths on the way to hush money! This is a lively, intriguing film which, nevertheless, may not be the Coens best work but which is certainly far above the Hollywood grind-em-out machine. The Coens have a great knack for creating memorable characters and this film is replete with them. From Pitt's wacky, dimwitted exercise nut to McDormand's lovelorn, aging fitness instructor and back to Clooney's needy, unfaithful government agent, here is a cast of characters to savor. Malkovich, Swinton, JK Simmons, Richard Jenkins, and all of the other lesser players are quite fine, too. The setting in Washington D.C. has been shot with care, showing the city at its best, and the costumes are very well selected. All of the film's production values are nice, too. Lastly, although the film doesn't quite come together for a ""big finish"", the writing and direction make the viewer swoon with admiration for the brilliant minds that create such stuff. So, although it is not a ""scorcher"", Burn After Reading is the kind of flick that gets everyone fired up about film-making."

","Many people absolutely adored last year's Coen brothers effort No Country For Old Men. It was praised both by the critics and the general public and won Best Picture. Facing a great expectation, No Country is no followed by the new spy thriller comedy ""Burn After Reading"". Despite the exciting premise and the excellent acting, the film suffers from fractioned storyline and some very annoying characters.<br/><br/>The story is definitely not something that can be explained briefly. It is very convoluted, layered and with many intertwining plots. The general plot of the film follows a disc that contains sensitive materials of an ex-CIA analyst. After a botched blackmail attempt, the events that follow creates a dark and humorous result.<br/><br/>The film's strongest point is the acting. The film is full of A list actors: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich and JK Simmons just to mention a few. Even when you cannot like the characters they are playing at all, you are still awed by their acting capabilities. Brat Pitt and JK Simmons are the best out of all in this movie.<br/><br/>Similarly, the film makes a good use of black comedy. Despite the fact you usually don't laugh out loud to horrific deaths in films, the excellently written, twisted dialogues cannot help but to bring a smile to your face. This film is a very good example of dry humor. The use of black comedy is a trademark in many Coen films. There are many parts in the film where you burst out laughing for long periods of time. The issue in connection with the overall picture of the film is that the humor is rather spread apart with frequent dry bits.<br/><br/>Similarly, despite the excellent cast and the inclusion of praised Coen film elements, the film's story stands on the weak end. There is a lot of things going in the film and it is not told in a very effective way. There are plot holes and many events in the film are left unexplained. Not only that, the film has a very slow beginning where the central ""plot device"" is not even shown until about 20 minutes in.<br/><br/>Finally, some of the characters are so irritating and bothering that they take some of the enjoyment out of the film. It is a bit of a shame to have talented actors and actresses playing such forgettable characters. The amusing aspect that you tend to notice and enjoy the performance of smaller characters. Brad Pitt and JK Simmons, again, are prime examples. The ending, despite its abruptness, is a very funny one. It does not explain everything but the humor is top notch and very well done. Overall, the advice when seeing Burn After Reading is not to think of it as a pure comedy. As I have mentioned before, you will not be laughing for the whole duration of the film and there are some serious parts as well. I suggest going to a matinÃ©e showing for this film due to the fact that I've noticed that many people found certain aspects of the film unappealing.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>MatinÃ©e"
"bopdog","7","1","5","12 September 2008"," J.K. Simmons stole the show-- and was hilarious.
","There are different dimensions to a film, of course. They could be great or so-so on their own, and appreciated thusly. How they all come together, however, makes the movie a good one or not. This film has great actors, all doing a marvellous job. But the plot is so oblique that I didn't quite ""enjoy"" the movie, despite the great bit of dark humour toward the end.<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons stole the show here. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovitch, and the others, did a splendid job--- no complaints. But J. K. Simmons' character was the only truly funny one. The interaction with him toward the end was actually my one nice memory. Malkovitch chopping the the gym manager up with a hatchet was absurd, of course, but completely appropriate, in a weird and perverse way, and totally apt. Sounds gruesome, but it wasn't--- it was hilarious. And Simmon's matter of fact approval of that deed was priceless. The rest of the film, though, was so dark and loony, and about total losers, so it was actually more depressing than funny.<br/><br/>Simmons, who played so many authoritarian and ""hard"" characters in his career, seems to have discovered a new vein of talent, and perhaps a new career for himself. First, last year he was the grounded and loving dad in ""Juno."" Now, while this character was ""blissfully out of it,"" he had a similar presence. One liked him in Juno, one likes him here for much the same reason."

","Without a doubt, Burn After Reading is one of the best movies The Coen Brothers have ever made. I say one of the best because it's hard to compare an out of control serious comedy like this, to something like No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant in every single aspect: the story, the characters, the actors, everything! Especially for those that haven't seen something like this before: it's so worth it! On one hand you have George Clooney taking his acting skills to whole new areas especially after he just made some awesome movies like Syrannia, Michael Clayton, and Leatherheads, Frances Mcdormand playing a total pessimist, John Malkovitch stealing every scene simply by his reactions to everything,he kind of reminded me of the character ""Seth"" from Superbad, only way older, smarter, and a bit thinner. Tilda Swinton's right where she should be playing the ""cold-hard bitch"", much like her recent roles in Narnia and Clayton. And Brad Pitt, whose role in the movie made me laugh almost every second he was on screen, it was something he's never done before, but that's what made it so perfect! <br/><br/>Above all, the movie is almost flawless, it's kind of hard to find a perfect comedy out there, but this one had almost everything work out for it. Whether or not you like the Coen brothers, or even if you didn't like No Country for Old Men, Burn After Reading is the perfect comedy for those that truly believe:, ""Intelligence is relative"". Good job Joel and Ethan! 10/10"

","A story about a bunch of idiots. It comes from the Coen brothers, headed by all star cast, and promoted as a crime comedy. That seems OK, if not super, but the outcome is disappointing.<br/><br/>It has cleverly made idiot characters and good pace. I loved that case of a twisty world, marrying noir, spy movies with dark sense of humor. So it's unusual mix, spoofing the idiocy of all, mostly the American middle class.<br/><br/>We have all cheater, haughty, rude, paranoid, ignorant, bad tasting, crazy about money, sex, or looks characters. Enough reasons to be idiots in the movie's conscience. The twisty nature of the story runs well till the third act, where sure the movie loses much of its power. Most of the viewers got turned off after the abrupt murder of (Brad Pitt). I didn't. Because it's a surprise, and it fits a black comedy. Actually, the problem is elsewhere.<br/><br/>Many important questions had been left without answers; what was in Malkovich's memoir?, what's the benefit of Malkovich not seeing McDormand?, what's Malkovich's telephone in the basement said to sadden him?, why Tilda Swinton copied her husband's memoir on a disk?, why the CIA is taking care of covering all the misses? Malkovich kills?? Ahh, because he's angry of many issues! The matter of discovering that Clooney's watcher isn't an enemy is copied from another Coen movie (The Big Lebowski - 1998). And then there is no action, only talks. The whole fates, rather the whole movie, conclude weirdly in just one scene between 2 men talking in a room in certainly one of the most cold, anti-climactic and stupid endings ever made in the history of cinema!<br/><br/>Look at a wicked hint like how all the story is about a woman who succeeds in collecting money for 4 plastic surgeries yet on many corpses along the way. Apparently, the Coens hate stupidity caused by mania over pure materialistic goals, seeing in the lousy criminal a perfect laughingstock to showcase that in many of their movies. But (Burn..) is not a perfect movie in the first place. It's headless, literally!<br/><br/>This time, the Coens want to show that today's world is absurd and full of idiots. However, the irony fades out due to a drama that went absurd itself at its end. And the waterfall of cursing and swearing didn't serve any drama or comedy; it served only being too nasty to stand! And in the end, they as if thought of us as idiots ourselves, punishing us for waiting things like satisfying ending or good movie for that matter. I still ask: How the Coens led their beautifully complicated lines into that sterile joke?!<br/><br/>What if Richard Jenkins's character had some secret around his strange past; being a retired spy, or major CIA man, which uncovers at the end? What if Malkovich turned out to be none other than the head of cooks in the CIA? Or what if the CIA execs are bigger fools; so the world is full of idiots and run by idiots? Originally, the movie, with no redeeming qualities, aborts anything like that, slighting its material and us, selecting to be - at the end - a tragedy of idiots, as if idiocy is the greatest slasher, killing all the stupid characters not even in smart ways. The Coens did it in (Fargo - 1996), and have been doing it many times lately, with (The Ladykillers - 2004), (No Country for Old Men - 2007) and (Burn After Reading - 2008). Aside from being repetitive, it's easy thing to do. And if they write and direct movies about characters that deserve to be killed, then they went so far and so bland!<br/><br/>There are some actors, with possibly interesting characters for laughing purposes, but both of the players and their roles were wasted. Malkovich is shouting, Swinton plays the awful image of her, Clooney doesn't add much to his history. The only winners, if I can call so, are McDormand and Pitt. The latter in specific made the car scene really funny, the sole funny thing in those 90 minutes! Naturally, these stars' names on the poster give such a frustration compared to eventually underdeveloped movie. The title does the same in terms of being an espionage spoof. The music is catchy for no catchy events. And no doubt that the best about it is Vladimir Putin's polished yet dark cinematography, which expressed polished yet dark world.<br/><br/>This is not a comedy, even black one. It promises and doesn't deliver. Builds and doesn't complete. Well, it's 2/3 movie then. And, most probably, that's because the Coens wrote it while writing (No Country for Old Men). I was quite shocked when I read that ""They would usually alternate every other day for each script"". Because simply when any artist, or any person, does 2 works in one time the assured outcome is whether 2 bad works, or - at the least - one bad work!<br/><br/>There is no system. This is what this movie believes in, and embodies for 2 acts, and then suffers from it at the third. It's rushed, mutilated and tepid. The worst thing though was that the Coens produced it too, releasing it as it was, thinking that it wouldn't disappoint by the way how it wrapped things up. This is vanity; which is a short way to stupidity if you ask me!"

","To me this movie is about desperate people correcting their problems wrong. Not because the're extremely stupid (...) but because they have never been taught better. There are similarities in the way the CIA (the highest power in the film) handles problems (just cover it up) with the way an unhappily married person (middleclass,an aggressive divorce FUELED BY HER LAWYER)and a physically insecure person (lower class,plastic surgery)do it. Left alone the way Clooney is ""correcting"" his ways by building the ultimate sex-machine for his wife. They all cover things up in an unusual way.<br/><br/>The troublemakers are all pretty paranoid. Some before,others in the process and others after the 'S' hits the fan. That's why I think it's more paranoia and unawareness than stupidity what drives these people. The only one doing it right is Malkovich because he is getting in all those situations without asking for it. After losing his job he resides to his boat to enjoy the real world and quality time with loved ones he doesn't cheat on his wife and has a very strong personality....though maybe he drinks a bit too much.<br/><br/>The one who is stupid for sure is the lawyer's assistant, she loses the disk in the gym. Every scene at the law firm is important because they show the way classified information is misused and get's a whole other meaning when in someone else's hands.<br/><br/>Very cool movie, critical and therefore maybe not a cinematic masterpiece but to me definitely a killer Coen!<br/><br/>Sorry for spelling errors................."

McDormand is rather touching as a woman determined to get plastic surgery while Clooney playfully spoofs his leading man image. Pitt steals the film as a dim-witted blackmailer. The script is absurdly clever and the dialog is full of zingers. Perhaps the most amusing scenes involve CIA agent Rasche trying to explain to superior Simmons what the heck is going on with the multitude of characters and subplots."

","I am easily pleased (too easily, alas) Â– after watching John Malkovich's performance in the first 3 minutes of the movie, I said to myself that I've already got the worth of my ticket. The rest is bonus. This Coen Brothers' latest movie is all about performance and there is such a wonderful ensemble of top performers effortlessly showcasing their brilliance. I'll come to that later.<br/><br/>The plot is no more and no less convoluted than what you would expect from the Coen Brothers and it hardly matters. But if you really want to know, it starts with an over-the-hill CIA agent Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) getting sidelined and quitting in an explosive temper tantrum. His wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), a dentist who gets little kids to open their mouths with threats that might have come from a torture-ready interrogator, is obviously not exactly excited about the news. But her mind is occupied with more important things, her affair with the couple's friend Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a married man and a treasury agent who goes nowhere without a gun which he claims, however, that has never been fired in all these 20 years he has been carrying it. Harry, obviously not content with just one wife and one mistress, meets through Internet blind date one Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) a health club employee who, on a quest to become a ""new person"", physically, is constantly after her medical insurance company to finance her 4 plastic surgeries scheduled. The plot thickens with Litzke and co-worker Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) stumble across a disk which contains a draft of Cox's memoir of his CIA days. Blackmailing and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>There it is, the plot, more or less. The most significant thing in all these is that Cox has only a ""level 3"" security classification. The Russian, after looking at the material offered by the perpetrators, calls it ""trivial"". The CIA honchos, when heard about the scheme, don't even as much as blink. While the background music (attention grabbing but not going overboard to be distracting) sounds ominous enough to suggest a thriller, the dialogue and ""action"" is all comedy. But there is indeed a ""dark side"" (in how many Coen Brothers' movie you do not see dead people?), making this movie a delightful black comedy that is comparable to ""The ladykillers"" (2004). <br/><br/>As I said, this movie is all about performances. But before I go to the 5 aforementioned top billed stars, there is a sixth who is equally brilliant: Richard Jenkins, who has appeared in many movies but is remembered most in a small indie movie ""The visitor"" (2007), if you've seen that one. Here in BAR, playing the health club manager in whom Linda eventually confides the blackmailing scheme, he is a crucial balance, with his understating portrayal contrasting the other 5 stars' delicious exaggeration. Malkovich takes this exaggeration to a hilarious height. Swinton takes it towards a different direction, surpassing in her contemptuous coolness her two recent roles, the Snow Queen in the Narnia sequels and her Oscar-winning role playing opposite Clooney in ""Michael Clayton"". Clooney, who purportedly can be persuaded to play the fool by only the Coen Brothers and nobody else, completes his ""idiot trilogy"" for said Brothers in flying colour (the other two being ""O brother where art thou"" (2000) and ""Intolerable cruelty"" (2003)). Another such complete transformation is his equally cool buddy in the Danny Ocean series, Brad Bitt. Playing the nitwit gym trainer who sucks at the water-bottle from the corner of his mouth, he is so incredibly fantastic that you hardly even recognize him. This is a Brad Bitt that you must see, and admire. But if I have to make a painfully difficult choice of the best, I'd have to say McDormand. She plays this singularly simple-minded but loveably determined woman with superb energy, gusto and flair.<br/><br/>BAR is much ado about nothing at its absolute best."

","This crime, thriller comedy is another coen film found hard to categorise by critics. Burn after reading is once again a brilliant crime based film by the coens. The film stars; Frances Mcdormad as the clueless gym employee looking for some plastic surgery money, George Clooney as CIA treasurer and womaniser Harry pfarrer. When Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is fired from the CIA and his wife (tilda Swinton)(who is having an affair with married man Pfarrer) searches for a divorce, cox's memoirs go missing. Pfarrer is also seeing Linda Litzke (Mcdormad) who is friends with other 'moron'/gym employee Chad Feldhiemer (Brad Pitt). Chad and Linda attempt to blackmail Cox without Linda Knowing Pfarrer's full story. The story line as you may have guessed is complex yet very enjoyably tied up by smaller performances from; J.K Simmons and Richard Jenkins etc. However every performance from the cast was great and the characters created by the genius of the Coen brothers and stylishly shown by their bizarre yet amazingly independent. I think every Coen film is a jewel in movie making but this one is definitely one of their bigger jewels. Also Brad Pitt was hilarious in this and so was everyone else. 10 out of 10"

","""I would tell students to make their characters want something, even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day. I thought that was wonderful."" Â– Kurt Vonnegut<br/><br/>This comedy, Joel and Ethan Coen's arm's-length scoff at the modern age, never started from ideas but from character. And what interesting characters they are, all embodied sharply by a dream team cast of some of the most wonderfully enjoyable actors and actresses working today. We have never seen Brad Pitt or George Clooney play such inane and idiotic characters, and they are in top form. Pitt just got finished giving a chillingly real and bafflingly evil performance as Jesse James. Now he is playing a happy-go-lucky fitness trainer with nothing but air inside his head and a pompadour on top of it. Clooney, who even in his least emblematic performances as the title character in Michael Clayton and Bob Barnes in Syriana, has always played cool, level-headed earthy 1960s throwbacks, here plays a jittery, quick-tongued swinger with a double life. As such, not only do we feel as if Clooney is making fun of himself but he does as well, and accordingly his character's paranoia and overreactions are squared and cubed.<br/><br/>I have not laughed as loud and as extensively in a long long time as I have at John Malkovich, a poised and sophisticated veteran CIA analyst brimming with frustration and stress, thus a drinking problem, whose therapeutic endeavor to write a memoir is sabotaged by a bunch of complete idiots. His enraged reactions and bloodshot peeks through the cracks of his elegance are some of the funniest comic acting in the world. He reinvents the phrase ""F***ing morons!!!!""<br/><br/>What you know of the plot from trailers and TV spots is enough. It is not a film that relies on plot. The plot hinges desperately upon the inanity of the unabashedly modern characters that screw it up to the point where the film itself basically resolves with two sideline characters, one of them a government man played with the trademark dry and straight-faced insensitivity of J.K. Simmons, implying that there really hasn't been much point to any of this. ""What did we learn? Not to do it again. I don't know what we did, but...""<br/><br/>The absurdity of its characters, with the exception of Malkovich's CIA rogue Osbourne Cox and his shady wife, played with Tilda Swinton signature brand of pompous feminine callousness, is silly in every way. Their reasons for doing the things that they do are regarded by them with such ardor and desperation, which causes you to find yourself laughing even when there is no verbal or visual punchline. And what makes this comedy what it is is that there is no real farcical contrivance. It is a farce sparked by the decisions of these goofy dimwits, the most determined and driven of whom is Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke, who has the same go-getter willpower of most of her characters. How does she always seem faultlessly cast in everything she does?<br/><br/>What is most admirable about this work by the Coen brothers, still spinning with the oomph from their inordinately brilliant landmark comeback No Country For Old Men, is that they initially intended to sit down and write a spy movie, because, what the hell, they had never done one before. But they came up with this, the only espionage-related traces of which are in the mere occupations of very few of its characters and the incidental effects of the rest of the characters on two CIA superiors and the very confused Russian Embassy. Joel and Ethan were fine letting the ideas come and the juices flow and letting the script go where it wanted to go. If they had worked through any doubts with what it was turning into and restricted it to the bounds of a spy movie, it would not have been nearly as good and we would never have been granted this skillfully pointless portrait of, as CIA analyst Osbourne Cox puts it, ""the idiocy of today.""<br/><br/>What the Coens have maintained is the sleek cinematography and occasional and completely unexpected outbursts of brutal violence that one expects from an espionage film, not to mention completely facetious typewriter-font captions as displayed by the main credits and location footers. This is really the scaffolding of the film's charm."

"cultfilmfan","10","1","6","21 September 2008"," Burn After Reading
","Burn After Reading is a darker comedy about several very interesting individuals who all cross paths with each other, which is not necessarily a good thing at all. We have a CIA agent who has just been fired and decides to write his lifelong memoirs, the ex CIA agent's wife who is having an affair with a womanizing playboy who is also having an affair with other women that do not include his wife and we have two dimwitted fitness trainers at a workout gym who one is pretty brain dead while the other who isn't very smart either, hatches a plan in order to raise several thousands of dollars to pay for numerous plastic surgery operations that she thinks she needs. Throw in some paranoia, the Russian embassy and the CIA and you have a lot of weird things going on. Pretty much all of the main characters I have listed for you in this film are very into themselves and in a sense they are all pretty nihilistic and with no morals or anything righteous about them. The only really kind, or nice character in it is a supporting character who works at the fitness gym. Having said that, I think that the characters are all the more interesting because of this. Burn After Reading is a very quirky comedy and I admit that within the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film, I was not really sure what would be happening, or what type of a film I had just walked into, but needless to say I liked it a lot. There have been some pretty original and unique films this year so far and I would add this one to the list as well. Everything is so over the top and unusual that I think it is hard not to acknowledge what an original piece of work this is. The actors all do a great job of playing their characters and I think that they really hold the film together because if it wasn't for this great acting ensemble, I don't think the film could have been pulled off as well as it did. Also the original script and direction makes for very entertaining viewing and this is definitely a very interesting watch. I myself am a fan of darker comedies and this one has elements of very juvenile almost ludicrous elements of comedy, yet at the same time it is also done with great writing skill and the darker elements thrown in also add a lot of neat twists, turns and surprises that for me at least, were very enjoyable and to say the least, unique. I admit that the advertisements of this film do make it look very stupid and the film deals with a lot of stupid people, but the material is razor sharp and once you watch it you will realize just how many brainy ideas and thoughts went into this film. Burn After Reading is certainly not going to be a good time for everyone, but those who enjoy the writer/director team's other efforts, should know what they are getting into and hopefully you will have an enjoyable a time as I did."

","Let me spark up this film review of the new Coen Brothers' offering ""Burn After Reading"" with witty pun banter in order for you not to burn before reading. The Coens return to their screwball dark comedy noir with ""Burn After Reading"" that, by the way, practices the cinematic characterization of ""no country for dull men"". The film's central characters possess an unremitting egoistic-burning sensation that intertwines swimmingly with their screwball behavior for supreme sheer entertainment value. These quirky characters nearly supersede and extinguish the plot of ""Burn After Reading""; because I would burn up with laughter every time they displayed their surreal eccentricities and not care so much on the narrative's developments. But there is still a plot to be told of ""Burn After Reading"". John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox, a hot-tempered CIA Analyst who writes a memoir after he wrathfully resigns from his CIA long-term employment. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand exercise their acting by portraying Chad & Linda, two gym trainers who inadvertently end up with a copy of Cox's CD memoir and consequently want to play the blackmail game with The Wizard of Mad Os. George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a neurotic U.S. Marshall whose mentally-deranged marshal plan is overflowed with profound paranoia. Harry is having an affair with Cox's domineering pediatrician wife Katie played by the stupendous Tilda Swinton. Character-actor king Richard Jenkins plays Ted Treffon, the reserved gym owner who craves for the romantic acceptance of Linda. David Rasche and J.K. Simmons play two CIA Operatives who are trying to unscramble all this burning mess into a concise, well-read depiction. Are you now burned out after reading the mishmash chaos of ""Burn After Reading""? Whatever the case, Joel and Ethan Coen continue their hot Hollywood streak by cleverly writing up characters which encompass scene-stealing qualities. I will be burning mad if the film does not garner a Screen Actors Guild ""Best Ensemble Acting"" nomination. All the actors were phenomenal. But primary props have to go to Pitt's hilarious performance as the dumbbell Chazz, McDormand's usual skin-deep wondrous acting as the cosmetic-surgery obsessed Linda, and Malkovich just being the great John Malkovich as the mad Cox Osborne. My only minor burning issue with the auteurs here was the slight overacting of George Clooney, but maybe I am just being too paranoid here a la his character Harry. So maybe you have read other film reviews that outmatch mines on the breakdown & analysis of ""Burn After Reading"", but I do not think you will find another ""Burn After Reading"" film review that has as many ""Puns During Reading"" as the one delivered by yours truly. Burn rubber today and book a visit to ""Burn After Reading"". ***** Excellent"

The Coen brothers' Burn After Reading is a forced comedy about a couple of fitness center workers (played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) who find a CIA memoir disc and attempt to extort $50,000 from the author, Osborne Cox (John Malkovich).<br/><br/>I say ""forced"" because even the best performance, Brad Pitt as knuckleheaded Hardbodies worker Chad Feldheimer, is wrenched out of an actor better suited to non comedy. Even George Clooney, who sharpened his comic timing in Three Kings, plays smarmy a bit too goofy ans sleazy for my taste.<br/><br/>Long gone are the outrageous characters of my fav Coen comedies Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, and FargoÂ—all of whom seemed to be underplaying compared to the attempts here.<br/><br/>But it's Malkovich who takes the prize for the actor who brings his acidic, loud-mouthed, sneering persona into every role. Frances McDormand is nowhere near the shrewd good ol' girl in Fargo.<br/><br/>Respite from the non subtle comes in the screwball comedic exchanges between Hardbodies employee Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad and a comical denouement with CIA brass scratching their heads over the absurd activities.<br/><br/>I just wish the Coens had brought their quirky, iconoclastic attitude into this one."

","After the Coen brothers won Best Picture for ""No Country for Old Men"", I hoped that they would follow it with something good. They did just that. John Malkovich plays an fired CIA agent - actually, he got demoted, and preferred quitting to getting demoted - who writes a memoir. The only problem is, his wife (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce, and so she copies his memoirs onto a disk and leaves it in a local gym, where two employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) get their hands on it! And the story snowballs from there! Seriously, don't get me started.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Brad Pitt's character is easily the best in the movie: he's an immature dope with a go-nowhere life. I'd say that George Clooney really has his moment right after he...well, if you see the movie then you can probably guess to which scene I refer. I should say that the movie probably won't induce belly laughs; it's the subtle humor that you have to catch. And you're sure to enjoy it once you catch it.<br/><br/>What's the movie's overall point? Maybe there's none, but there is one possibility that I interpreted. When I saw how Pitt and McDormand come across the disk containing Malkovich's info and cynically set out to use this rarity for their own benefit, it reminded me a bit of Chuck Jones's cartoon ""One Froggy Evening"", in which a construction worker finds a singing frog and tries to make money from it. But that's just conjecture, so don't quote me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I truly recommend ""Burn After Reading"". You're sure to like it. Also starring Richard Jenkins (Nate Sr. on ""Six Feet Under""), Elizabeth Marvel, David Rasche, J.K. Simmons (Peter's boss in ""Spider-Man""), Devin Rumer, Olek Krupa and Dermot Mulroney."

It has a lot of dark humor, it has a tone unlike anything I have seen in years. Comparable to their classic Fargo, this film has great writing and an amazing ensemble to back it up. Frances McDormand gives another great performance, one that is similar and different to her Oscar-nominated performance as Marge Gunderson more than 10 years ago. She deserves her second Oscar nomination! Brad Pitt continues to amaze me. After having his best performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, which is also his finest work and one of the best films of the decade, here he comes again, in a totally opposite performance. He will sure get the most buzz out of this movie, and as of now, he delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance. John Malkovich, never having really seen a lot of his work, gives such a great, cold performance. George Clooney, after also having a good year at the Oscars in 2007, delivers his best performance. I usually do not like him much, but in this movie, he proved he is a very versatile actor. Tilda Swinton is also very good, but has less amount of work to play with.<br/><br/>The script is just so well thought out and written. This is truly a film for idiocy and stupidity, and the script explores all of that. The ending is in a way as provocative as No Country For Old Men.The film has beautiful music and cinematography, in a different way to the Coens' other films.<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is just as great as the Coens' best films.

Instead of questioning his superior calmly and ""with our inside voice,"" he went OFF! I mean POWDER KEG! He started yelling and screaming like a petulant child! I NEVER gave my child a pacifier, but I was damned sure looking for one to throw likes a dart into HIS mouth to get him to shut the efff up!!! THEN we see him at home with his wife. She comes home from work, hew tells her what happened, she tells him what are his plans Foote money, because HER salary alone won't cut it, hew divulged that he'd taken himself on a shopping spree!!!! And he thinks his little ""hobby"" is going to be enough to support them! She laughs, to bite back the tears, and she tells him there's no way it could be enough to replace his income and insurance. Through Out, she's been calm, and he's been building up a head of steam, all of a sudden, he blows up on HER!!! He tells her about the job they offered him, but he quit of his own volition, so no severance, no unemployment, NOTHING! It's all because of HIS hot head, and SHE'S the victim, but he's being as verbally abusive as any bast---! I'd had ENOUGH! Half an hour in, no Clooney or Pitt, just a bizarre, insane Malkovich - NO THANK YOU! I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ONE BIT! AVOID!!!!"

","One really has to deaden their senses to appreciate this film; otherwise the quirky comedy is ruined by the over-the-top gratuitous profanity and the portrayal of clueless despicability as the run-of-the-mill norm. Of course, all of the characters are unbelievably idiotic characatures of themselves. Admittedly quite humorous, but at the same time pricks at the sensibilities so hard that it cancels out the levity. The repeated use of the Lord's name in vain, ultra-profane phrases was the last straw for this clusterjunk of a movie which thankfully ended after 96 minutes of much ado about nothing, besides possibly setting a record for the number of uses of the ""f-word""."

","So about 2/3 of ""Burn After Reading"" is terrific, classic Coen brothers, with stellar actors making the most out of their somewhat cartoonish characters. (Clooney and Pitt ham it up, quite agreeably, while Malkovich and McDormand tease out a little depth from their characters, but Richard Jenkins and Tilda Swinton are mostly wasted with throwaway parts). There's not a ton of suspense, which indicates maybe the brothers were a bit off their game, but there's plenty of tragic-comic premise to go around here in a tale of middle-aged burnout and false aspirations to change one's game while it's in progress.<br/><br/>But, without giving any spoilers here, the problem is the script really falls apart in the last third of the movie. Perhaps it was studio edits, but the scenes with JK Simmons as a senior CIA official in which he and an underling recap the plot and then, unforgivably, do the kind of wrap-up that is usually shown on screen about each of the characters, suggests they ran out of shoot time and just had to tack those bits in in order to give any sense of closure about the plot and characters' fates. (The one such scene in the middle reminds me oddly of the Santa Rosa policemen in ""Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", who connect the threads of the various characters' journeys by explicating a little with a map for the audience, although unlike ""Burn After Reading"" that was rather deftly done.) In the end, if you don't go ""what, that's it?"" like I did, I would in turn be surprised.<br/><br/>I'd love to find out the story (there must be one) about where this production went off the skids. But my rec is: don't waste your time."

","Now that I've watched at least ten Coen films, and seen them at least twice each, I feel inclined to draw conclusions about the oeuvre. A friend of mine in the film business told me that it's the director who makes the film. The actor may sell the film, since people often just want to see him/her. But the ultimate merit of a film depends on the writer. This is where the Coens may be lacking. Their scripts are said to be extremely well-prepared before shooting. But that doesn't necessarily mean they contain any substance. Coen films can give an impression of having been thrown together in the form of several episodic cameos, compelling or amusing, but somehow lacking unity. This is the case with BUR, I feel, and may account for those reviewers who express their dissatisfaction with it. <br/><br/>I would say the Coens' most solid and impressive production is No Country for Old Men, and that may be because it is based directly on someone else's book. It seems to mean something. The Coen remakes are not good, and one wonders why they were made.. The trouble with something like Burn After Reading, is that it seems ultimately pointless, although it is funny in parts. There is a tendency in many of these films for people to croak. Death is a joke. Perhaps most comedy lacks substance. Burn after Reading is a makeshift title."

","""Osbourne Cox"" (John Malkovich) is a low-level CIA analyst who is experiencing difficulties at the office in large part because of his drinking. Naturally, his poor performance hasn't gone unnoticed but rather than accept a lesser assignment and continue getting paid he decides to quit in a fit of rage. Needless to say, this doesn't make his wife ""Katie"" (Tilda Swinton) very happy because his income was the only reason she has put up with him. To further complicate the situation is the fact that she is currently having an affair with an agent for the Treasury Department named ""Harry Pfarrer"" (George Clooney) who she mistakenly believes is in love with her. However, before she files for divorce she decides to hack into her husbands computer and copy all the data pertaining to his finances onto a blank CD. What she doesn't know is that, in addition to his bank account numbers, she has also copied the first part of her husband's memoirs as well. Now normally this wouldn't be a big deal but when this CD is lost--and subsequently found by some employees of a local gymnasium--things get greatly convoluted after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had some good bits and pieces here and there with the performance of Brad Pitt (as the bumbling gym employee named ""Chad Feldheimer"") probably being the best. Unfortunately, in spite of the rather prominent cast, the overall film seemed more like a collection of scenes strung together which tended to give the picture a rather uneven feel overall. That being the case I have rated it accordingly. Average."
"Fuzagi","6","0","1","20 September 2016"," My two cents..
","I am late to this particular message board/thread because tonight was the first time I have watched this movie. <br/><br/>I initially was a bit nervous when I saw all the name stars (and who those particular stars were) in the opening credits, although I love these actors and many of the films I previously have seen them in. <br/><br/>But, it's been my experience that when you get this many talented folks of this caliber, unique styles, and given the types of projects/genres you usually see them in, together for an ensemble piece like this that takes on the ideas that it does, that there could be a higher probability that the film will devolve into being more of an artist's project for the artists' sakes, and that the script, the direction -- the acting, the emoting -- are going to be more intensive than may be needed at times, and that the story may risk feeling a need to be 'profound' or 'profound-like' in place of finer distinctions and cleverly-placed subtlety that would perhaps ensure a better overall film and viewing experience. <br/><br/>Woody Allen has managed to pull off this type of ensemble casting well in some of his films (although he often doesn't care to interject profundity or subtlety), but he also has a somewhat rigid direction style and he doesn't give many of his actors much time to mull over their roles, frequently giving them their scripts, or skeletal scripts to allow some ad lib, the very day of a shoot. <br/><br/>I thought Malkovich was suited for his role. <br/><br/>Pitt was miscast to the point that someone on this board thought that he was gay. <br/><br/>Jenkins was good but did not say much. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand was good but still miscast. Clooney despite being outshined by the other cast member was not miscast and thus fun to watch. <br/><br/>I almost expected Phillip Seymour Hoffman to do a five min cameo due to the cast heavy approach by the director. <br/><br/>I don't want to sound unkind by pointing out the high rates of narcissism that can be found in the acting profession because I have some dear friends who are actors, narcissistic traits aren't necessarily a bad thing when in this particular profession, and any 'downside' from this can often be ameliorated if there is good strong direction to help support when it can be of value to a project, but also to reel it in when it can be a deficit. <br/><br/>I just feel that you put too many of these types of folks -- folks who often play quirky or standout/standalone, and often unforgettable, characters in film -- together in a project like this, that there will be expectations, however tacit those expectations may be, of each one having their own unique, quirky, and/or profound character to play and lines to deliver, and after awhile this amalgam can morph into a 'herding cats' situation -- it can become crowded and non-cohesive. <br/><br/>Then, if you add layer upon layer of several intertwining metaphors (some very obvious while others were more subjective/projective 'Rorschach test' metaphors), drama-esque exchange relationships, stark punctuating events, the characters milling about in their foggy and/or distorted views of life and love and death, and most not being able to truly attach, or for any length of time, against the backdrop of an underlying message that 'everyone lives and dies alone', while simultaneously being the star in their own life drama AND while being an 'every man/woman', that you risk ending up with overly spiced mud soup. More is not always better. <br/><br/>As I said, there *were* parts of this movie that I did like, but the further I got into the movie, the more out of control the structure and direction seemed to be -- the more the characters came together the more disjointed they seemed to become, and not for any redeeming value that I could ascertain and I'm not sure that it was all that intentional. I suppose it could be yet another metaphor for something like the inevitable entropy of the life process along multiple dimensions, but that would be stretching it a bit thin. <br/><br/>A clever idea overall, but one I feel that had too many cooks and too many customers in the kitchen without enough structure, without enough reinforcing of 'less can be more' when needed, and I must say that it did come off a bit pretentious here and there. <br/><br/>I had a similar experience with 'Angels in America' â€“ I absolutely loved the first half or so of that series and there were certainly bizarre, unsettling, and 'swervy' scenes in the first parts, but the latter part just seemed to wander off and then over a cliff. <br/><br/>SoÂ….some people absolutely love this film while others don't think so highly of it. <br/><br/>I say: Enjoy a film if you like it! <br/><br/>Just my two cents. <br/><br/>Peace Out :)"

","The Cohen Brothers tend to appeal mainly to folk who 'think' themselves smarter than most other viewers or to those who seek-out movies they think are somehow 'different'. Perhaps they're only fooling themselves (I know, I used to be one of the deluded). These ultra cynical movie makers make films for themselves - showing their contempt for just about everything - including their audiences. Also seems maybe some audiences are often not smart enough to recognize most of their work is a recycling of what they've done before IE; settings, names, places, comedy, drama, are switched to camouflage the obvious. As the budgets get fatter the content gets thinner.<br/><br/>For the most part I enjoyed the quirky warmth of ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" but the majority of other Cohen efforts were simply callous, soulless, sensation seekers. ""Burn After Reading"" is simply 'trendy' empty-headedness dressed up as satire. Cheap writing by people with more money than integrity. Lazy, crude language masquerading as humour. Good performers being reduced to accepting inferior farce and cardboard cut-out characters just because it's a 'Cohen picture'. Honest reviews by Variety, The New Yorker, Time, etc, and a closer look at many of the comments posted by ex die-hard fans on IMDb - seem to be saying maybe the party's over and many of us over them!. The industries 'promo-awards' divisions might miss them but, maybe it's time to move on chaps while you still have an audience of any note...Could be the title referred to the script."

","Its harmless Coen brothers ""fun"" - I put ""fun"" in quotation marks because whilst it is easy watching and light, I was pretty bored for a lot of it and it definitely meanders like most Coen brothers films. Its not a lot to ask to have a cohesive ending. That's what I can't stand about Coen brothers films, they all end like an afterthought. The Big Lebowski ends without the Dude getting a rug back, Fargo ends with half the murders unsolved and both Burn After Reading and No Country for Old Men both have major confrontations go down off screen. Why do people forgive Fant4stic but throw praise at the Coen brothers?<br/><br/>Burn After Reading is redeemed, of course, by some great acting. Brad Pitt is a lovable goof and Francis McDormand gives one of my favourite performances as a vain, plastic surgery obsessed gym employee. I found Malkovich at his most Malkovichey - overacted shouting with contorted facial expressions. That doesn't prevent him being a likable character, and he gets us in his corner early on. I found George Clooney to be overdoing it a lot and Tilda Swinton was a bit bland and stuffy. I would've loved more of Richard Jenkins (who excels in a small role), Elizabeth Marvel and J.K. Simmons.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the resolution of the plot even if it would be nice of the Coen brothers to include me in these major events.

","With the Coen brothers you maybe expect a great film, filled to the brim with smart jokes and a super engaging plot. With Burn After Reading you kind of get both but just not as much as you'd like, sure the movie is funny and the story gets oddly thrilling after a little while, but I did feel maybe this was not what they were going for. Nevertheless the Coen's do create something intriguing and different and also add in a cast that is just top class really, I could say they squander the chance to use them fully but in any way, the movie is better having them in it.<br/><br/>The story basically revolves around a few different things, we have John Malkovich's character Osbourne Cox who knows his wife (Tilda Swinton) is up to something. George Clooney plays a player of sorts, married but definitely wanting some things on the side, Brad Pitt alongside Frances McDormand as gym workers who find some CIA files(but aren't really all that important). All the things that go on you could say are intertwined together and I think that is what the Coen's achieve well as they seem to be able to mix everything well but also fit it into the relatively short running time.<br/><br/>As for the brothers direction we see a kind of fast paced approach, the writing also means that the characters lines are really speedy, the plot does actually gain from this as it never gets bogged down in boring chatter. I think the best part of having the Coen's on this movie is that it can at times get weirdly dark humour and then seemingly seconds later a kind of silly joke backs it up too, they make it funny in a few ways, but it isn't always that hilarious. I can see why some people and critics disliked the movie, it starts very slow and after 20 to 30 minutes I felt maybe this would progress into a piece of pretentious movie making but I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong the movie isn't great and I was far from loving it but I did like it and I think many will too if you haven't seen it, worth a re-watch actually one day. <br/><br/>The Coen's achieve in this movie what I feel they wanted, to make each character a complete idiot, everyone in this has their own insane issues or stupid actions, it culminates at the end in which I felt was a strong ending. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography also gives us a nice vibe within all the comedy, some of the shots onto the stars faces are great and the camera moves fast quite a bit, it not only draws you into the picture but also lets you enjoy the little things the movie has to offer (Brad Pitt chewing gum is somehow engaging).<br/><br/>I think although this is not the Coen brothers best work it still stands up and shows us what they can do with comedy yet again. I think they wanted fun and they got it, not only is the film good entertainment but it also brings us characters that by the end whether we care about them or not, are still enjoyable to watch. I also just want to commend Brad Pitt and George Clooney for their roles here I mean Pitt is hilarious at times and really gets into the role; he makes ordinary scenes more lively. Clooney is at his comedic best and we don't always see it from him, the jokes the script gives him are delivered well and there is one seen when he is kind of a little shocked in the park (won't ruin the plot) and the faces he makes are just fantastic."

Simmons and Rasche are pretty (deadpan) funny and Manolo, as small as his role may be, is fantastic.<br/><br/>All in all, it feels like the Coens simply rehashed themselves here (note the similarities to their older work), without a story or hardly anything else that really stands out.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

","""What have we learned from this?"" ""I have no idea, sir.""<br/><br/>That pretty much sums up this movie, directed by the Coen brothers and featuring an all-star cast, including George Clooney, John Malkovich and Brad Pitt to name a few. The movie starts with Malkovich's character Osborne Cox retiring from CIA and deciding to write his memoirs. We get introduced to his family and friends, plus a couple of other characters from a local gym, and then... complications ensue. That's pretty much the only way I can describe the plot without giving anything away. I'd like to say that it's typical Coen wackiness with many complicated twists and turns, but even for them this is out there.<br/><br/>It honestly feels like a total mess, but it feels like a purposeful mess. It's complicated, but it's never hard to follow. It's unrealistic, but still plausible. It's weird, but that's what makes it interesting. You never quite know where the story will go next and when it starts throwing curve balls at you, you're both shocked and pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I also really like all the characters. They feel like movie characters in that they're very clear cut and a bit larger than life, yet their struggles feel real and you get their blights. Pretty much none of them is all that likable and those that are still do some questionable things, but they're sympathetic beneath all their misnomers.<br/><br/>It's also a very funny movie. Most of the humour comes from the absurdity of the situation and the desperation of the characters. They're all tragic personas, but in a way that's more amusing than it's depressing.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing if you like Coen brothers, crime comedies or farcical dramas."

No character is typically likable in this. The positives in this movie would include dark humor esp by Clooney but still not enough laughs.

There were witnesses to her hit-and-run on his diesel Benz. He also could have phoned in the extortion attempt and what he believed to be a break-in.<br/><br/>2. CIA would never pay Linda off in end There was nothing for the CIA to cover up. The CIA director admitted not knowing what the CIA did wrong, so why would he pay this woman for her silence? <br/><br/>3. Linda would be tried for treason and either imprisoned for life or executed for attempting to sell classified government material to a foreign power. <br/><br/>4. Osborne Cox could have fought Katie's maneuver to take control of joint bank accounts. In fact, banks require two signatures on both accounts before they could be completely emptied and closed. Oops! <br/><br/>5. BeWithMeDC.com is absurd. No dating web sites are set up to allow women to surf male photos without males being granted the same opportunity. <br/><br/>6. How did Harry Pfarer clean up the mess in Katie's bedroom without her knowing someone was shot in her closet? <br/><br/>7. While there are men stupid enough to bring a concealed weapon to a first date, I don't know of many women who would let a gun-toting stranger into their home.<br/><br/>8. Do the Coens expect us to believe people as stupid as Linda and Chad really exist? These are not ""morons,"" but morons. Linda is astounded her HMO will not pay for not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 cosmetic surgical procedures. She is also astounded her employer will not advance her salary. She also is under the impression Cox is obligated by some Good Samaritan Tax to offer her thousands of dollars in reward money for finding his disc. When he doesn't agree, she gets violent with him.<br/><br/>9. The disc itself is worthless. It's the info on the disc that WOULD be worth anything.<br/><br/>Why do Linda and Chad assume that even if the info were valuable that Cox would pay for the disc. It's not the disc that's valuable, it's the information on it. And he has it on his PC.<br/><br/>10. Also, the Coens arrange for all their serial daters to meet at benches around the Mall as if there are no other restaurants or trendy metro neighborhoods in DC/MD/DC for people to meet. <br/><br/>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.<br/><br/>Some of the critics who reviewed the film praised the Coens attention to detail and realism. I agree I enjoyed the scenes where Cox was terminated and where Katie conspired with her attorney, but no one in their right mind could ignore the gaping plot holes above.<br/><br/>WHERE THE FILM GOES OFF THE RAILS <br/><br/>Whether you like parody or farce determines how you felt about a pivotal turn 10 minutes into the film. I was looking for a parody, a satirical imitation of a special brand of psychopathology-of-everyday-life that runs through Washington's culture of materialism and self-importance, where puffed up jobs in dulling Federal bureaucracies lead to chronic dissatisfaction, spiritual emptiness, and a polyamorous form of infidelity facilitated by Internet dating.<br/><br/>This parody begins promising enough when the film appears to set up a cat-and-mouse game between ousted CIA analyst Oswald Cox (John Malkovich) and Treasury officer Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), whose promotion from the ""young man's game"" of personal protection into a desk job with the U.S. Marshals forces him to carry a concealed weapon out of vanity. How Malkovich loses his job and his wife makes for great comedy, and the Coens do not need to sacrifice realism -- or intelligence -- to deliver the laughs here. The build-up of tension during this taut and intriguing 10 minutes is some of the best filmmaking I've seen in years ...<br/><br/>... and then it all falls apart when we're introduced to one of the dumbest and most deplorable characters in film: Linda Litzski (Frances McDormand). This is the point at which the Coens give in to pop culture silliness and BURN AFTER READING devolves from Woody Allen dysfunctional into farcically dumb / destructive Tarantino (e.g., Pulp Fiction).<br/><br/>Woody Allen (e.g., HUSBANDS & WIVES) proves you can write female characters who are cerebral and mature yet whose existential angst and lack of insight translates into self-sabotage as well as unforeseen/invisible consequences to the world around them. Why the Coens feel they need to have their plot flow through a character (Linda) who reasons morally and intellectually at a 2nd grade level is beyond me. Just like a chain can only be as strong as its weakest link, so BURN AFTER READING is doomed to juvenile absurdity once Linda pops on the scene.<br/><br/>And Linda is a comedy-killer. You want to walk on screen and take a led pipe to Linda's head. That kind of tension is not good for comedy, especially one that ends well for her character. <br/><br/>To add insult to injury, I believe the Coens intend for us to find Frances McDormland's Linda adorable (much like we do McDormland's character in FARGO). ""Have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking,"" delivered in McDormland's signature schmaltz (along with ""little chitland's feet -- chicki chicki chicki""), is supposed to warm the cockles of our heart. Yikes.<br/><br/>George Clooney's Harry Pfarrer strains credibility when he reacts to every minor provocation with an absurd vocal intonation and facial contortion and in a way this breaks a tie between elements of parody and farce and drags the film into the realm of the absurd."

The only other plot element was that everyone was sleeping with everyone else. Really?! Someone could have taken these elements and written a good script and done a decent movie, but the Cohen brothers didn't bother with those steps. There really is nothing more to the movie. <br/><br/>None of the characters have any back-story or depth, so you couldn't really care less what happens to them. The dialog is generic and vague. For example, Frances McDormand's character wants money for some ""operations"". We presume they are for some sort of plastic surgery, but throughout the movie she just says ""I really need these operations"". It's as if the writers put in a filler phrase and never took the time to go back and flesh it out. It is almost painful to watch her deliver these lame lines.<br/><br/>Having said that- the stellar cast lived up to their talents.

","Have you ever seen a film? If so, what do you stand to gain by watching it? Did you unveil some insight into the meaning of life? Or maybe you discovered some revelation on the works of a political engine or society as a whole? Burn After Reading seemed a montage of these lessons and more in a satirical, comedic way. Burn After Reading was a movie of action vs. consequence and as we all know well, there is no action without a consequence. This movie started out in rural New York City and creates a setting of betrayal, dishonesty, self-consideration, and blackmail.<br/><br/>At first, the movie beings with Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) getting fired from his job for ""political"" reasons that the employer places blame on Cox's drinking problem. Os comes home to a wife full of complaints and a house party shortly after. At the party, Cox's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) meets Harry Pfarrer(George Clooney) and an affair with him develops shortly after. This affair initiates Katie's planning to divorce with Mr. Cox. Harry, a womanizer and a cheater, thinks he is impervious to consequence and has several affairs, even while being ""happily"" married. After Cox gets fired, he begins writing memoirs, which fall into the hands of a couple unlikely Hardbody Gym employees , Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzky(Frances McDormand), who think they have stumbled upon a gold mine of CIA information waiting to be held for ransom. After their failed attempts to get Cox to pay for the return of the memoirs, Chad and Linda take them to the Russian Embassy for a second attempt at easy cash.<br/><br/>Hilarity ensues as the duo continues their futile trek for ransom and reward along with several different scandalous acts of affair by Harry, most of his bedmates, AND his wife. When Harry discovers his wife wants to divorce him after he had plans to do so himself, he is devastated and creates pressure with the women he was seeing as well. And all of this wraps up at the potentially boring yet moot point about the daily lives of a large percentage of relationships around the world that wind up finding both parties being guilty of unfaithfulness. I mean come on, divorces happen to 2 thirds of the American populace so it's bound to happen. Just so happens this one gets two gym employee get tangled in the middle. As this is my review and narration I will be expressing my rights and say this movie was pointless and really had no plot with actual meaning.<br/><br/>That being said small themes can be drawn from this drab film but they are a stretch. The main one would have to be how things can come back to haunt you, summed up by ""reaping what you sow"". The action-consequence relationship bound to be involved in any affair relationship known to man. Several different affairs take place in the movie giving an overall feeling that a vast majority of relationships are like. Unfortunately today, yesterday, and all through the past, relationships have revolved around affairs all over the world<br/><br/>A secondary theme can be weaned from this film as easily as blood could be squeezed from a turnip. However I would have to say it would involve simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Chad, on a mission of espionage, takes a turn for the worse health-wise, after catching some lead between the eyes after spooking Harry in Osbourne's house while looking for more ""CIA Intel"". This would prove to be the only time in the movie my attention would be undivided. This can all tie back to the central theme because without breaking and entering, Chad would've never been shot. Similarly if the Wicked Witch of the East hadn't been such a witch, Dorothy's house may have never landed on her.<br/><br/>One scene in the movie brings Osbourne to his house, only to find all his belongings witting in the rain. With his current mood, due to the events prior, I am able to sympathize with his extreme anger and feeling the need to fling a slew of curse words towards his wife. These events mostly occurred because of his drinking problem and seemed to be a long time coming. The cinematic experience relates the weather to the anger and hopelessness felt after the consequences being received by the character. The motif central in the film is the poor decisions of people and the things that can go wrong with the wrong choices being made. One loses his wife and job and gets killed, another gets too nosy and is shot, and one more still loses every woman he worked so hard to influence his way under their sheets. This speaks volumes all by itself with relation to ""reap what you sow"""

","I love that BURN AFTER READING is an engaging, and often hilarious, spy movie without any actual spies. Sure, the whole premise is centered around a former employee of the CIA but he's no more than an analyst (and a pugnacious, raging alcoholic). The actual CIA of the film has no idea what's going on, what these people are engaged in, or whether it's worth their time to investigate. The movie comes from the Coen brothers, a writing/directing team that I've yet to see fail. BURN AFTER READING probably ranks towards the top of my favorite Coen films (but it's no BIG LEBOWSKI). In the film, Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is fired from his position as an analyst within the CIA when his alcoholism becomes a problem. Meanwhile, his wife (Swinton) is debating whether to leave him for her lover, a paranoid Marshal (Clooney). Falling into depression, Cox decides to occupy his time by writing his memoirs, a memoir that soon lands in the hands of two inept gym employees. Linda Litzke (McDormand) obsesses over the damage age has done to her body and formulates a plan with her gung-ho, hyperactive coworker Chad (Pitt) in a plan to return the memoir, which they've mistaken for confidential documents and a threat to national security, for a reward. When their plan falls apart, Linda decides that drastic times call for drastic measures and she'll get the money for her plastic surgery one way or another. And so begins an espionage adventure where no one involved knows exactly what is going on.<br/><br/>I love how clueless the characters in this movie are. I wasn't originally so keen on this movie and it took a few viewings to really get into my head. The marketing had painted this movies as a bit goofier and it wasn't what I expected to find when I sat down to watch it. Plus, I was put off by the movie's abrupt ending (the details of which I'll spare here in case someone who reads this hasn't seen it). I remember thinking, ""This is it? That's all there is?"" Now that I've seen it a few times, I really like it. It's a great ending for this particular movie. The Coens are fantastic writers and this movie is a prime example. It's sharp, funny, and tense. The characters are perfectly bizarre and the casting is perfect. The movies features a top of the line cast: John Malkovich, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, etc. These people are over the top and just a little insane. Linda and Chad actually believe they are trapped in a spy movie scenario and react as anyone would, with only TV and movies as a source of knowledge. Shady meetings, breaking into Cox's home, and even RussiansÂ…the two incompetent gym employees are in way over their head. Or not at all. I guess it depends on whose perspective. BURN AFTER READING is a subtler, darker comedy and might not appeal to people who usually prefer their laughs in the form of a Kevin James or Adam Sandler film."
"toll-8","3","0","1","20 August 2012"," Not up to the Cohen's usual brilliance
","Prior to Burn After Reading the Cohen brothers made the fantastic film that was No Country For Old Men, which scooped awards galore at the Oscars of its year. When their next feature was announced, and it was to be starring some of Hollywood's best acting talent, most people could be forgiven for thinking it was going to be brilliant. Unfortunately however either No Country For Old Men was that good it will make anything the brothers do look less than average, or Burn After Reading is that poor that it makes their other movies look amazing. Whichever way round it is it doesn't change the fact that Burn After Reading is a poor film despite the fantastic acting talent and the great directors and writers on show.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is all over the place for starters. It begins with John Malkovich being downgraded from his job in the CIA, to which he accepts by quitting. Instead of telling his wife that night, they host a party where we meet George Clooney's character who it is made clear quite quickly is having an affair with Tilda Swinton, Malkovich's wife. Once the party is over Malkovich tells his wife that he has quit his job and will begin writing his memoirs. Not taking this too well she heads out to begin divorce proceedings against her husband and hopes to run off with Clooney.<br/><br/>Alongside this we find ourselves in a gym, whose workers are Frances McDormand's lonely and unhappy with her looks Linda and scatty and off his head Chad played by Brad Pitt. Linda is clearly looking for love and spends her spare time searching internet sites for dates, which she seems to never find a perfect match, and being rejected for plastic surgery due to money issues. Her luck soon changes however when Chad finds a CD revealing Malkovich's memoirs in the ladies changing rooms, to which they use in an attempt to blackmail him. To bring the entire ensemble full circle Linda's next date from her website is with Harry (Clooney), with whom she begins a full blown affair. It is highlighted quickly that he is a serial cheat. From here the film twists and turns between the leads and the entire plot comes round full circle, although not everything seems to really be cleared up.<br/><br/>There are moments in the film that seem to make little sense. Unless I'm missing something I don't understand the point behind the invention Clooney has built in his basement, and if anything I found his character a little bit of a throw away. To me the main plot was with Pitt and McDormand blackmailing Malkovich, and Clooney never is involved with this story thread. The ending is also skated over, and practically omitted in the same way Llewellyn Moss's fate is decided in No Country For Old Men. Perhaps this is a typical director trait.<br/><br/>Despite the few issues with the plot the acting talent do help this story along. Each of them are brilliant in their roles and they do not disappoint with their involvement in the film. Special mention should go to Pitt and Clooney for their against type turns. The script is also a good part of the film with the dialogue being original and free flowing. The problem however is the mess of the storyline which seems to go off in unnecessary tangents and at times becomes slightly boring. It does have its moments but they are few and far between. It has been stated that the Cohen brothers were writing this at the same time as No Country For Old Men and would alternate the days for which one they would work on. It seems like one of them got priority.<br/><br/>What makes this film most disappointing is the actors and directors are great at what they do, but they all seem wasted in this film. The actors are actually what make this film a bit better than rubbish, whilst the directors don't seem to bring their usual excellence to the proceedings. It is a shame really as there is so much that draws you to this film and the problem is that you will watch it and feel slightly bored and over expectant of what is coming next, because quite honestly nothing ever actually comes about. The ending is also just thrown in and suddenly happens out of nothing. If you are a fan of the Cohen's you will either love this as you feel you should or you will be disappointed as it does not live up to their previous work. If you are unaware of these two great directors then hire the other film I have mentioned a good few times in this review, and give the film I'm actually reviewing a miss.<br/><br/>1.5 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","I am a big fan of the Coen brothers, and I was kind of hoping for another brilliant one-two punch after No Country for Old Men, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but Burn After Reading has the feel of being written and made quickly and without much thought.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's most like Lebowski, in that it's about a bunch of people mixed up in stuff that is beyond them, mostly nobodies finding themselves in a convoluted spy plot. The joke is that no one really knows that it's all much ado about nothing. The story has Frances MacDormand and Brad Pitt finding a CD with what they think is sensitive information on it. They think they can blackmail John Malkovich, to whom they believe the CD belongs. Meanwhile, George Clooney is screwing around with both Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton, and MacDormand, while being married to another woman entirely. Unlike Lebowski, Burn After Reading never bothered to involve me, or be very funny, for that matter. Brad Pitt is the only one who really gets laughs. His meeting with Malkovich, most of which you'll have seen in the commercials, was pretty great. Besides the goofy plot, there's nothing here even resembling the Coen Brothers; no stylish cinematography, little repeatable dialogue. Even Carter Burwell's score feels like it was written in an afternoon, and it sounds a lot like an earlier Coens score, I think Barton Fink. It's most likely their least memorable movie, with the possible exception of The Ladykillers."

","Joel and Ethan Coen won the market on strange, off-centered movies that toss out bits and pieces of nonsense and lets the audience - and the obviously wildly entertained group of actors involved - put it together as best they can. The Coen brothers have made some very fine films: this just isn't one of them. <br/><br/>What little plot there is pops along something like this: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an expert on Balkan affairs, is fired at the CIA: he begins writing a memoir of his past and his responses. His wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) - a philandering State Department marshal - to leave his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Bouncing along to the next episode, a CD drops out of a gym bag at a Georgetown gym and employees Linda (Frances McDormand), an Internet obsessed date seeker, and Chad (Brad Pitt) attempt to make it big by turning it into cash (Linda wants money for elective surgery, and Chad, a fluffhead goes along). Information on the CD leads them to Osbourne who declines to pay them for the CD so they visit the Russian Embassy as an option. Linda and Chad decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets to enhance their 'valuable CD'. Bounce to another sidebar: Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. The CIA (JK Simmons) is involved and the 'conspiracy' continues to blossom - all so that Linda can have plastic surgery to enhance her status on the Internet dating sites while her partner Chad just plods along in his own oblivious style for the ride. Looking for a meaningful interconnected plot? Good luck! <br/><br/>The film lacks sensitive editing that would make it easier to follow the myriad subplots but then that is part of the Coen style. The dialogue is full of puns - embarrassingly so - and instead of trying to make the film make sense it is better to just sit back and let the silliness of human foibles entertain. That is probably why so many of our top film actors sign on for Coen brothers film - to have fun and poke fun at not only the world we live in but also at us. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"bob the moo","Null","0","4","13 June 2011"," The Cohen's miss all their usual marks to produce an ""OK"" film but no more than that
","Although I've seen True Grit recently, I am a few films behind with the Cohen's and watching Burn after Reading was part of me catching up. The film has a deliberately complex plot as innocent blackmail by two gym employees sees them accidentally mixed up with two couples each going through divorce and the CIA. Everyone's motives and intentions are misconstrued and soon confusion leads to messy and bloody misunderstandings. Although I had heard mixed reviews about the film, it did seem like rather an open goal for them since this was the sort of thing they had done before to great effect in Blood Simple and Fargo: small people in over their heads as a simple crime spins out of control.<br/><br/>For some reason though, they get it wrong here and mostly their usual darkly comic is missing. The oddball characters are all here but the plot is far too messy and has far too many characters in the mix. This doesn't matter too much as the film passed the halfway point because by then it had a bit of momentum and all was clear, but as it laid out the plot everything seemed to be going nowhere and each character seemed to add little. Once the plot is clear the other problems start coming out. The first is that it is not as well written as previous films. The characters all have potential to be comic oddballs but they don't really come off and nobody here is a classic Cohen creation. The comedy doesn't really work as it should either and it didn't have that darkly comic feel that Fargo and other films did. It wasn't that I expected to laugh, but I just didn't have the otherworldly feel that they often give me.<br/><br/>I know that part of the point of the film was that the plot was a complex mess but for me it was also a problem because this messy aspect tended to detract more than it added. The additions were the couple of great scenes with the two intelligence heads trying to get a handle on what was happening â€“ these were funny and both characters were what I would expect. In the rest the mess is not funny or smart or engaging enough to stand up and, while amusing and able to hold my attention, still feels like it is the Cohen's underperforming. The many star names actually don't help as much as one would have liked. Clooney is amusing and works well enough but, while I liked Pitt's attempts at his character, I never once thought he was able to shake off the idea that he was Brad Pitt ""doing"" quirky. McDormand is good though, this is the sort of stuff that she does and she does it well. Malkovich, Swinton and Jenkins all add to the feeling that there are too many people in the film who are their faces first and their characters second. Simmons and Rasche are great though â€“ if the film had more scenes like theirs it would have been better for it.<br/><br/>Overall Burn after Reading is a sub-par performance from the Cohen's. It has aspirations to be the darkly comic crime film that they have done before and, on paper, all the absurdity and characters are there, but they just don't work as they should on the screen. The mess is part of it, but it also detracts, while the characters are not that good nor the film smart enough, engaging enough or funny enough. The Cohen's on an off-day is still worth seeing, but they have done better and will do again."

","From BAFTA nominated writing and director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Raising Arizona, Fargo, True Grit), I saw a few clips of this film on TV, and thought it looked worth a go. Basically CIA veteran and Balkan expert Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) is fired from his job, which he is very confused and angry about, and with nothing else to do he decides to start his memoir. His wife Katie (BAFTA nominated Tilda Swinton) meanwhile has been having an affair with lover, philandering State Department marshal Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), therefore she wants a divorce. She unintentionally drops a disk from her gym bag at the Georgetown fitness centre, and on it is Osborne's memoir, and two employees at the centre, amiable goof Chad Feldheimer (BAFTA nominated Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand) who wants money for some surgical operations. Chad has read through some of the stuff on the disk and when he get his contact details Chad thinks they blackmail Osborne to give them a big fee or face them handing the disk to the Russian embassy. To insure they can try and get something from him, they try to find out as much more about Osborne as possible, and their hair-brained half-baked scheme may be slowly working, with the help of Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins). They do manage to get into Osborne's house after some sort of deal, I can't remember why, but it seems most of the characters are led to this location. Chad sneaks into his house for some reason, and when Harry comes back to change and spruce up he hides in the closet, and when harry opens it up the first thing he does is shoot him in the head, only to find he is a ""spook"", a man with no identification. In the end, the CIA led by the Superior (Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons) try to sort out everything that happened, with Chad and Ted being dead, Osborne suffering an fatal illness, Harry being arrested, and Linda agreeing to co-operate to get her plastic surgery, in the end they learn from their lesson, although we don't know what they did wrong? Also starring Elizabeth Marvel as Sandy Pfarrer, David Rasche as CIA Officer and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Krapotkin. All the actors of the film do pretty well in their roles, Malkovich going over the top, Clooney looking cool and panicky together, Pitt being a doofus, McDormand being insecure, and Swinton being stiff lipped, and obviously the direction is as good as your going to get. I may not have understand all the elements to the story, the blackmail thing was obviously the most interesting part, but it was quite funny in most places, and it is supposedly the third part in the Coen brothers' ""idiot films"", following O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty, a worthwhile black comedy crime drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Good!"
"EdnaWelthorpe","5","0","4","27 December 2010"," Love the Coen Bros. but I don't like this film
","I would like to preface this review by saying that I love the Coen Bros. Millers Crossing is one of, if not my favorite movie ever made. I also love Barton Fink, Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou and of course, Fargo. How can anyone not love them? The films are gripping, the dialog sharp, smart and whip fast and my favorite, how genteel scenes can occur right after scenes of intense violence (Barton Fink is a prime example).<br/><br/>All that said, I hate this film. I mean I have seen far, far worse films (The Last Airbender, Dragonball Evolution, An American Carol) but while these films were pretty doomed from the get go (except maybe ATLA but I don't want to get into a Shyamalan rant here) this film had potential. It did not meet said potential.<br/><br/>The plot is this: a retiring CIA agent played by John Malkovich plans to write a memoir but leaves behind a CD containing his memoir that is picked up but two incredibly dumb trainers, one of whom played by Frances McDormand wants to get plastic surgery. Her and the other guy played by Brad Pitt think its government secrets and try to sell it to the Russians. While all this is going on, a character played by George Clooney is having an affair with the retired agents wife while also entering an affair with McDormand...AND also while growing paranoid at the realization he's being followed. Naturally given that this is a Coen Bros. film, things go spectacularly wrong and lives are lost.<br/><br/>Okay, now for my biggest gripe about the film -- the characters. For me, there is absolutely no reason to care about any of them. I mean films like Miller's Crossing and Fargo work so well because we care for the characters -- Tom as he tries to navigate his way through a dangerous underworld and Officer Marge as she moves in on our antagonists. We care about them and we watch to see what happens. In ""Burn After Reading"" there is no reason because all of the main characters are terrible people. McDormand's character is incredibly selfish and vapid, Pitt's character is just vapid while the other characters are just defined by their flaws which gets tedious after awhile.<br/><br/>Overall, there are worse films out there and apparently even worse Coen Bros. films (Ladykillers) but this one was just plain boring.<br/><br/>Now if you're done looking through this, go watch Miller's Crossing if you haven't before, it is truly special."

"pfgpowell-1","6","0","1","14 June 2010"," Where is the X factor? Well, don't ask the Coens.
","Why, I always ask myself after watching a Coen brothers film, can't I seem to warm to Ethan and Joel? After all, they make better films than many working in Hollywood, they are respected enough for the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of Hollywood actors to appear in their work again and again, and they are capable of working successfully in different genres. Yet still I find them and their films just a tad irritating. It's partly, I think, because every time I think of them and their work, I have a mental image of the two of them writing their scripts and chortling away, patting themselves on the back and telling each other how great they are. Now, I'm certain that has never happened and that Joel and Ethan are as modest as a row of peas. And yetÂ… Getting away from sheer gut feeling and into more intellectually-based criticism, the Coens remind me of that phrase of 'art which conceals art' although that is not the phrase which would describe their work. Quite the contrary: it is their inability to find the secret of concealing their art which is, I think, why however good they have been so far, they have never so far been great. There is also a certain heartlessness about their work which I find unappealing. I first thought that after watching Fargo. Everyone said what a funny film it was. All I felt was how despicable it was to make the utterly inept William Macy character such a figure of fun. The man deserved our sympathy not our ridicule. Despite what he did, he was not essentially a bad man. The same is true of many of their other films: there is a certain lack of humanity in their work which is alienating, or rather which alienates this viewer. In Blood Simple, the first of their films I saw, none of the characters in the least bit attractive. (When I first saw Blood Simple, I thought it was superb. When I saw it again more than 20 years later, I thought it was well-made but mechanical and certainly not brilliant. When I first saw Miller's Crossing I thought it was great. When I saw it again, I admired it as a piece of film-making, but it didn't seem half as 'great' the second time around) I have not seen all of their films, but that word 'mechanical' sums up the Coen brothers' work rather well. In detail â€“ the scriptwriting, the direction, the cinematography, the sound design â€“ the Coens produce great work. But there is a certain mechanical quality to it all, so that all too often the sum of the parts exceeds the whole. So with Burn After Reading. Great, silly plot, great acting, great cinematography, quite a few laughs, but at the end of the day you find yourself admiring a well-made film rather than enjoying a great film. And oddly, in other hands I suspect Burn, which is essentially nothing but a screwball comedy, could have been great. Every member of the cast gives a good performance, and the film keeps you guessing as to how it will be resolved. Actually, nothing is resolved but in context that doesn't really matter. But something is lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but there is a definite lack of something. Perhaps the Coens might consider writing scripts and then letting others produce and direct. Unlikely, but it's worth considering."

","At times funny, at times frenetic, at times foolish, BURN AFTER READING is mostly a lost opportunity with a great ensemble cast.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a goofball Valley Boy (ten years too old for the role), saying ""shit"" to his heart's content, as John Malkovich is a recently-fired CIA agent (perfect for the role), saying ""fuck"" to his. George Clooney is in magnum head-waggling mode as another Coen idiot construct, an ex-secret service agent with a proclivity for surfing the web for one-night stands; Frances McDormand is a gym employee (who works with Pitt) who is looking for love in all the wrong chat rooms and hooks up with Clooney.<br/><br/>Each character is an extreme stereotype and the plot is woven into their lives through Pitt finding a CD left behind at the gym, which he thinks is classified CIA material.

The comedy is so black it tips into espionage, and the espionage is so moronic, we're sure it's trying to be a black comedy.<br/><br/>But then it gets too black with one sudden, accidental kill, which freezes the smile on our faces, wondering whether this kill was meant to be funny - because the character who gets it right between the eyes is completely innocent and was in the middle of a throughline.<br/><br/>I like shocking as much as the next nihilist, but the Coens sabotaged their own movie by wiping out this much-loved character in the second act.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as some reviewers to state ""Burn After Viewing"" - just burn the third act and excise those unfunny CIA segments with J.K.

So he decides to quit, 'honor' and all that, and write his memoirs. He dictates his fictional story onto his voice recorder and eventually transfers them to his computer. This simple story is what gets mistaken for Russian secrets and sets the rest of the story in motion.<br/><br/>Linda's dim-witted co-worker at the exercise spa is Brad Pitt as Chad Feldheimer. When a janitor finds a computer disk in the dressing room, and Linda and Chad view the contents, they mistake Oz's fiction for real government secrets and Linda decides that is her way to get her cosmetic surgery paid for. They will contact the Russian Embassy and give them the disk in exchange for money.<br/><br/>The cast and relationships are very convoluted but include Tilda Swinton as the wife of Oz, Katie Cox, who is not faithful to their marriage. George Clooney as Harry Pfarrer, who also is not faithful. The always steady Richard Jenkins as the spa manager Ted Treffon. Elizabeth Marvel as Harry's wife Sandy Pfarrer, who also is not faithful. And J.K. Simmons (news editor, 'Spiderman') as CIA Superior who quits trying to make sense of all he hears about this case and just wishes everyone would disappear. Including the bodies! <br/><br/>Again, I don't know why they insisted that several of the characters, especially Oz, use such pervasive foul language, because it detracts from the story. But other than that it is a clever and entertaining dark comedy, as are all of their movies."
"rzajac","8","0","2","8 January 2009"," Even a ""bad"" Coen Brothers movie...
","...is better than other ""good"" movies.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'll admit that ""Burn"" is a little weak; not operatic, like ""No Country,"" which at least was based on a piece of well-turned literature.<br/><br/>I watched ""Burn,"" and felt that I'd been sort of burned. But over time it starts to grow on you.<br/><br/>There's a common thread to the Coen's films: They're all about the primacy of the human spirit. Sure, they tend to take up themes in which this truth is showcased in negative situations, but spirit continues to be the focus; the Coens see to that.<br/><br/>And that's the simple message in ""Burn."" There's one particularly salutary side effect of this emphasis in a spooked-themed movie. The anti-""Burn"" movie could be, for instance, ""Enemy of the State."" I mentioned this in another of my comments. ""Enemy"" commits the sin of hewing to the convention that what we really want is to be reminded that ""they""--you, know, ""them""--are out get ""us."" And ""Enemy"" goes to insanely high-production, high-dollar ends to drive that theme a mile into the ground.<br/><br/>The Coens will never do this. They will never, ever let us off the hook; that sharp little hook that is the eternal truth that we are responsible for what we choose to see, and are therefore responsible for who we allow ourselves to become. And for that, I'm thankful. And that is a redeeming aspect of ""Burn."" It's another notch on the handle of the crossbow the Coens use to shoot down the most sacred of the human race's sacred cows: That we can--nay, must!--point to someone else and blame them for our oppression.<br/><br/>So, I guess my net impression is that, ""Burn"" is a sort of yawpy romp, but in the Coen tradition; which means that this yawpy romp is better than other more ""serious"" films which nonetheless commit the error of encouraging us in our blindness."
"orangeisthenewawesome","6","0","2","7 January 2009"," Funny but not one of the Coen's best
","This movie boasts an all-star cast and all-star directors. I like the Coen brothers' work in general: Raising Arizona, No Country for Old Men, Fargo, Lebowski are some of my favorites. This movie, however, fell kinda short. The silliness of the characters and their antics gets a bit underscored by inexplicable violence. Once the movie took its darker turn (as most of their movies tend to do) I lost my enthusiasm for this film. <br/><br/>I guess I'd say see it if it's on cable and you can see it for free. It's not worth paying money for, even with this great cast and directors. As I've listed above there are better options if you need a Coen Brothers movie fix."
"OJT","9","0","5","28 December 2008"," Coens hilariously fighting the idiocy of today
","What a clusterfuck! The Cohens are hitting once more, building this to be a little gem all the way, making fun of both modern day idiocy as well as todays (American?) superficiality. <br/><br/>I understand that this won't fit everyone. I think some will have troubles understand why these persons are so criminally silly. None of the actors where put in roles they're usually casted in, and this ensemble hasn't been working together before. The Coens has tailor-made the persons to each and everyone, and will not reveal what this film is about.<br/><br/>Well, it's about ""the idiocy of today"" made by a ""league of morons"". I haven't laughed out so loud in a cinema for years! The fun is all in the acting. What a fine cast of morons they have found. OK, we're all superficial, and sometimes we have to take some things very serious. That's how it is, isn't it!?<br/><br/>The gallery of characters in this film is trying to make most of their boring lives, and as good Americans they are all suspicious about everything; cheating their spouses, sexaddiction, ready to sue after spying on them, trying to be fit running, making bodies at ""Hardbody fitness"", telling lies, wanting to have better lovers by internet dating, plastic surgery and easy money.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job both acting and fighting idiocy, and this film is Cohens most funny films up in the class of ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>""What can we learn from this"", that the CIA don't? Well, If you find something valuable enough to be blackmailing someone, and don't want to be a moron? Burn BEFORE reading!<br/><br/>Watch it, and have a good laugh!"
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","5","26 November 2008"," Well ""Fargo""
","Wonderfully quirky characters played by sparklingly talented actors pulse through a narrative on the interconnectedness and happenstance nature of life in this combination of tense thriller and black comedy written , produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>It all starts with the resignation of CIA analyst Osborne Cox (a truly scary and foulmouthed John Malkovich) who is married to Katie (cold and calculating Tilda Swinton) who is having an affair with federal agent Harry Pfarrer (a dark-bearded George Clooney). This would make for an odd enough cast but then we have the three staff of the Hardbodies Fitness Center: Chad Feldheimer (a blond=streaked Brad Pitt) who thinks that he can extort Cox, Linda Litzke (an edgy Frances Dormand) who would like a share of the proceeds for a series of cosmetic operations, and their boss Ted Treffon (Richard Jenkins) who really cares for Linda just as she is.<br/><br/>In pursuing their very different objectives, some of these characters are going to reach a sticky end in a tight tale of barely more than one and a half hours. For the Coen brothers, this is a world away from their previous work, ""No Country For Old Men"", and a successful and entertaining return to some of the territory traversed by ""Fargo"" in 1996."
"ed_two_o_nine","8","0","5","3 November 2008"," Craft of the highest order
","Right where to start. This in not one of the great Coen brothers movie's, but rest assured this is still so much better that most of what passes for a movie in today's day and age. It just does not hit the heights of their greatest movies but this is still a extremely well crafted movie than is really an enjoyable romp of a film. As usual with the Coen's you get great casting, direction and a script tighter than a gnat's chuff. The premises here is almost all completely a mcguffin with the supposed finding of some top secret documents and what they mean to all involved. But really with are left with a lot of unsavoury characters who all have their own agenda. All played to perfection with Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich's characters being particularly poisonous, where as the always great George Clooney and Frances McDormand are just needy. It is left to the superb Brad Pitt to give the movie heart and here he is ably supported by Richard Jenkins (the dead father from 'Six Feet Under') to give the movie its heart and soul. So life changing? No, but extremely enjoyable and full of treasures to enjoy again and again."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","3","25 October 2008"," The Coens' funniest film? Only if ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" were never made
","It's been almost two months since ""Burn After Reading"" was released in the Venice Film Festival (27 August 2008 according to IMDb) but just yesterday 24 October 2008 was finally released in mi city. So this year I watched two Coen Brothers pictures on the big screen, with the first one I was agree with anyone who loved it, certainly ""No Country for Old Men"" is in my top 3 of 2007. ""Burn After Reading"" has mixed comments in IMDb and as for today of the 211 comments in total, 94 are from people who loved it and 107 from people who hated it. I had big expectations and I really wanted to be one of the people who loved the film, hell I love ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" well actually I love most of the Coen Brothers pictures but I didn't loved ""Burn After Reading"", I don't hated it either but for sure I was expecting more.<br/><br/>The cast is full of stars, I found mostly annoying Clooney but he is amazing in my favourite Coen Brothers film. Malkovich is certainly good but his character complement the character of Swinton to make an annoying couple. Then Pitt enters and we have the best part of the entire film. His character is just fun and he will have a partner. McDormand's character is just like Pitt's and is fun however her story is sad, basically we have two kind of persons: the ""smart"" ones and the stupid ones. The ""smart"" and powerful ones f*cked Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) who is also one of the ""smart"" ones. Then you have his wife who is f*cking him and who will f*ck him really well. Clooney is Harry Pfarrer who practically f*cks everything. So we have Pitt and McDormand's characters, Chad Feldheimer and Linda Litzke, who apparently have a simple routine, a fine job and enough ""innocence"" to make us laugh. I really like Pitt's character, he is just fun and Linda could have been just that but her sad story and the sad story of Ted Treffon (Richard Jenkins). Linda wants to have a new face and a new body and she is f*cking Harry Pfarrer. For me one of the best moments is the action of taking the information to the Russians. Chad Feldheimer and Linda Litzke never knew a sh*t, they just knew that they could blackmail Cox, they knew they had some CIA sh*t so they bring the sh*t to the Russians! And when Pitt is killed all we have are the ""smart"" ones with power. Hey and J. Jonah Jameson, he is quite funny.<br/><br/>So ""What did we learn?"" Well, that those persons who claims that ""Burn After Reading"" is the funniest Coen Brothers film since ""The Big Lebowski"" are just lying. Also I felt in a similar way that when I watched ""The Ladykillers"", then I felt that the film was nothing special but right now I kind of want to watch it again so maybe a couple of years later if not more I will want to watch again ""Burn After Reading"". Hell, I have already, and finally, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" on DVD, just hoping it is as great as ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (just considering the comedies of the Coens)."
