","""When the most likable character in your film is an evil nazi, you've got problems,"" one reviewer noted of this film. He was wrong.<br/><br/>Honestly some critics have been doing his for so long and so dourly that they find it impossible to appreciate a story for what it is. Hart's War is an engaging story about the battle for a man's soul, and is a story told exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Tommy Hart, played believably by Colin Farrell is forced to defend a black man, Lincoln Scott in a court martial after he is accused of killing Vic Bedford (another effortlessly emotive performance from Terrence Howard). Tommy finds himself caught in a chess game between Col McNamara (Bruce Willis) and Werner Visser (a remarkable performance from Marcel Lures) which turns into a battle for Hart's decency and in the end his life.<br/><br/>Some scenes fall flat, but it's not hard to look past them and see the bigger picture. As well as being a story about becoming, it is also a story of betrayal, friendship and respect, the type of movie that would have starred John Wayne or Charles Bronson in the McNamara role back in the day.<br/><br/>Shunned by critics and audiences upon its original release, but deserves reappraisal and a second look now."

","If one were to place too great an emphasis on many of the smug and self-serving views expressed by various contributors here, it may well appear somewhat of an enigma that HART'S WAR still rates 6.3 overall. Obviously many who have voted have not posted a review. Equally obviously, to offset its many detractors...a significant number of people must have liked it. I'm one of them! <br/><br/>Let us agree immediately, anyone looking for a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE can expect to be disappointed. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach's excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor...and not necessarily in that order. A re-hash of the plot is unnecessary as every second reviewer has covered this aspect. It is a film to LISTEN to and to take from it what you are able. Negative comments such that the events portrayed are ""unlikely,"" that Bruce Willis isn't the ""star,"" that ""nothing happens except lots of people keep talking,"" are a sad indictment of viewers with a limited attention span. A lot of what is uttered during the ""court-room"" sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Farrell is excellent as is Willis in what admittedly IS a far smaller role. Willis' presence however is felt throughout the movie in much the same way as was Jack Nicholson's in A FEW GOOD MEN. (Another military court room flick)<br/><br/>Yes its longish and it would be fair to say it is extremely dark for the greater part of the film. It is ultimately though a worthwhile addition to other POW films. You could do a lot worse."
"hotdudepetey","Null","53","68","12 September 2002"," Doesn't give it all away but does give some hints
","Having grown tired of the typical action packed glorified war films (Pearl Harbor for example), I sought out more of a human interest story.  I wanted something that delved past the clich√© romances, battle wounds, and graphic violence we have become accustomed to.  To me, Hart's War exemplified exactly what others have failed to do.  It was an inside glimpse into the lives of a WW2 POW camp, but more so.  It dealt with the struggle for power, respect, and honor in an unlikely situation.  The stellar performances by Bruce Willis and Marcel Lures stole the show away from the title character, Lt. Hart (played well by Colin Farrel).  There are times when you don't know who the token hero or villain is, just by the way that each commands their region.  If you missed this movie in theaters (as I am guilty of), easiest way is to catch it is on pay per view - it's still going to be running for a while. Enjoy!"
"w2amarketing","Null","27","33","11 August 2003"," Not bad
","This film is absorbing because you are kept guessing until the very end. Hart, the lead character, isn't exactly an angel; and the Nazi Kommandant conjures up a measure of sympathy, with other motives of characters such as Col. MacNamara (Willis) truly unclear until the end.  <br/><br/>Thus, it's enough to keep you watching, although I wish I'd read the book first.  Also, it's not an ""action"" film in the Schwarzenegger sense, but it is fast-paced and holds your attention, as the plot keeps twisting and turning.  <br/><br/>Contrary to what others thought, I found HART'S WAR to be reasonably historically accurate.  It's frequently pointed out that by late 1944 / early 1945, the Germans were reeling, desperate and disorganized, while HART'S WAR portrays them firmly in control.  This is a fair criticism, but I would respond as follows:<br/><br/>1.  HART'S WAR coincides with the Ardennes offensive (Battle of the Bulge), which was the last major German offensive of the war and which came perilously close to succeeding.  Puffed up from that near-victory, not knowing (as we know today) that this was the last gasp of a dying reich and not a turning point towards victory, and now holding hundreds if not thousands of Allied POW's to boot, it's no surprise that the Germans are still confident of victory.<br/><br/>2.  Also, HART'S WAR takes place in a short period of time (I would guess 2-3 weeks between Hart's capture and the end of the trial, which itself is only a week).  The story does not drag into the spring of '45, at which point the Germans knew they were losing.<br/><br/>3.  The Nazi Kommandant epitomizes this German confidence, yet because he was educated in the US, he has at least a measure of sympathy for his American prisoners and treats them with an equal measure of military courtesy, with a few exceptions.  Other Kommandants during this time may not have been as ""humane,"" but, because of his background, Visser's lack of brutality (again, with exceptions) is understandable.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is clearly a supporting actor in this film, but I felt he had a strong and important role and was, arguably, the CENTRAL character while Colin Farrell is the LEADING character.  However, Willis gets top billing for one simple reason -- TO SELL TICKETS.  It worked for me, at least."
"buiger","6","7","7","18 March 2012"," Unrealistic to the very end...
","To me the movie was average, probably because I don't find it so mind shattering that it pictures racism in the US military during WW2. It was there, that is an accepted historic fact so I do not think the film should win too much praise for ""boldly going where no one has gone before"". The plot was OK in the beginning but after the first 30 minutes it started to become less and less believable. The life in the camp is unreal, the Germans, the German colonel, etc.<br/><br/>The culmination comes (and there I agree with the critic) at the end when all of a sudden almost everybody is competing in order to be the first to be executed, to die as a hero. Then Bruce Willis suddenly returns in a sudden change of mind, just in time to save everybody by getting executed himself... Nonsense, this just doesn't happen."

","I'm so glad I didn't miss this one - ordered it on pay-per-view the other day.  Not only does Bruce Willis give the performance of a lifetime, but I was able to be introduced to the talented Marcel Iures.  He was phenomenal as the sometimes you like him, sometimes you hate him as the German Colonel of the POW camp.  Both performances are intense and emotional.  And it was interesting to see a movie delve into the issues of honor and respect within war times, racism, and the courtroom drama story line."

","If you're looking for action in your war film skip this one. But if you don't mind an interesting drama about prejudice among Americans in a German POW camp, which although slow at times, leads to an interesting pay-off with a twist that (kinda) makes the whole thing worth it, then check it out. I especially enjoyed the subdued though ""grizzled"" looking Bruce Willis as Colonel McNamara and Marcel Iures as the camps' German commander."
"reggimann","8","17","23","4 February 2003"," Good if not great
","I don't know what y'all are complaining about: this is a good movie! It has fallen pray to mismarketing like so many good films before. Farrell is good (he'll be BIG soon, mark my words), Marcel Iures fills the screen with his presence and performance. Willis however, I must admit, play Willis. But hey; I like him for what he is.<br/><br/>The plot is well thought out, intelligently blending the lines between the war- and the courtroom genre. Don't tell me you anticipated every twist in the plot.<br/><br/>For all it's worth; the movie was very different in a great way from all war movies in last couple of years. Different in quite a smart way, too.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ruby_fff","7","34","51","5 May 2002"," It's all Colin Farrell - you see him, hear his voice, from beginning to end
","For what it's worth, I appreciate the film medium interpretation of a book's story, and not try to compare or expect how detail or more poignant the book's descriptions were. Viewing a film, audio and visually taking in the collaborative efforts of a film production is not the same as someone reading a novel. Reading also depends on the environment that you're in: while traveling with people around you, or being quietly by yourself. Reading is very much one person's own interpretation - as one reads, one can conjure up the possible sight and sound in one's mind and imagination. While in a cinema viewing a movie, we are exercising our senses - visual and audio - of what's presented on the screen. The experiences are uniquely different.<br/><br/>
In HART""S WAR, Colin Farrell who portrayed Lt. Hart is very much front and centered, while Bruce Willis' role of Col. McNamara, his (humane) attributes are more subtle and from within - his aching insides from the years of war and isolation. There is the struggle/conflict of the war veteran vs. the clean cut affluent background of young Hart. We see Willis' McNamara's treatment with Farrell's Hart more evidently, but for McNamara himself, say the quiet scene where he visited the flyer in isolation waiting for trial - more imminent of death, we simply see him giving Lt. Scott a book; when Scott opens it, it's the New Testament. It is later while Hart's talking with Scott outside the trial room just before the closing arguments, that we learned the book was Scott's own, with a picture of him and wife and child kept within the Bible's pages. So off camera, we may gathered that McNamara must have silently gone through Scott's belongings and took that New Testament to Scott, with the understanding that Scott may find solace in seeing the family picture again and as most soldiers would, felt duty above all else.or would he? And Hart, representing Scott as his defending lawyer, would he let him? Such are the subtle layers to the storyline.<br/><br/>Director Gregory Hoblit's previous films were no simple Hollywood plots. They all require some mind stimulating thinking: 1996's ""Primal Fear,"" the crime and lawyers film with Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and the fascinating debut 'hell' of a performance from Edward Norton; 1998's ""Fallen"", one devil of an intriguing storyline where Denzel Washington, along with Embeth Davidtz, tackling the many faces (Elias Koteas included) of the elusive Lucifer (music was by Tan Dun of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; 2000's ""Frequency"" was the mind-twisting time-bending drama of son and father team, Jim Caviezel and Dennis Quaid. Here in HART'S WAR again, there are no simple answers to the questions raised: moral dilemma, military honors, ravage and trying times of war and being POWs - no escape of endurance tests. It's a well produced film with fine cinematography of stark snowy scenes from Alar Kivilo (who also did ""Frequency"" with director Hoblit); score to this war film was complemented (unexpectedly) by British composer Rachel Portman; and performances by a talented cast. I did see ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"" again, but my sense is ""Hart's War"" stands on its own, it's not really a humor filled ""17"" not an action packed ""Escape"" movie, it's more of a humane story at its core, offering an aspect of life's outlook, military or not."
"nvincent","Null","6","7","18 February 2002"," Read the book.
","What a squandered opportunity.<br/><br/>Hart's War is yet another example of why movies rarely if ever live up to the book upon wich they are based.  The novel of the same name by John Katzenbach is so clearly suited for the big screen it is almost frightening, and yet one has to wonder whether screenwriters Billy Ray and Terry George actually read the entire book or merely relied on cliff notes.  The writers have taken an immensely engrossing tale of life in a German POW camp during WW2 and commercialized it with needless explosions and manipulative and improbable plot twists.  The movie's thorough lack of character development hinders the best efforts of the actors (Bruce Willis, Collin Farrell, and Terrance Howard all do comendable work with the restrictive material they are given) to make the audience identify with them - resulting in an emotional climax that is supposed to evoke sympathy and respect but instead falls flat on its face.  It is still beyond me why the makers of this film felt compelled to change the ending from the book - perhaps they feared it was too compelling and thought-provoking for their intended audience and felt obligated to dumb it down into as many cliche ridden speeches and improbable acts of courage and honor as possible.  Whatever their reasons, the resulting lack of subtlety in this film is nothing less than insulting.<br/><br/>
If I am being more harsh than other reviewers it is because I have read the book and know just what could have been accomplished.  Do yourself a favor and read the book - it is far superior to this film or any other recent Hollywood offering."
"artzau","6","21","34","10 July 2002"," Willis at his Scowling Best-- sort of...
","This film has its moments.  But, to buy into it, you have to suspend any knowledge about WW2, Nazi POW stockades or likely situations.  The action focuses on Willis as the brooding leading officer in a POW camp, Colin Farrell is the law student pressed into becoming a defender for a Black Pilot wrongly accused of murder.  What transpires is a Machiavellian game with the Commandant, well played by Rumanian Actor, Marcel Iures, with plots and subplots, motifs and counterplots.  But, it really does not go anywhere. There are some nice twists at the end but the ending before the final credits I found to be cheesy and unsatisfying (I've always found it irritating to switch to an ending narrative when there was none to introduce the story).  Viewers who like Willis will not be disappointed and Colin Farrell is sure to delight the ladies with his Irish good looks, dark ""little boy"" eyes and expressions.  Cole Hauser, back from getting eaten by an alien in Pitch Black, makes a wonderful sleazy villain but the rest of the cast seems to walk through their parts.  Also, Look for Joe Spano from NYPD in a bit part in the opening, but don't expect a lot from the rest of the show."

","I thought Hart's War was an excellent movie.  It touched a lot of areas, and was very entertaining.  Much better than We Were Soldiers (which was pretty unrealistic - - most of the soldiers in Vietnam were young guys barely out of kidhood who did NOT have wives) or Black Hawk Down (a standard horrors-of-war movie).  This movie was thought-provoking and had plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested.  Have to read the book, now."

","After seeing the trailers and commercials, this was not the film I expected it to be.  I expected a ""Bruce Willis kicks Nazi butt: film, and that is not what this is.  I'm not going to add any spoilers to this review, but Collin Farrell's performance isn't that bad.  Willis' character was played in what has become his commonplace style as of late, but it worked.  And Marcel Iures was a devilish but almost likeable Col. Werner Visser.  This film is more about internal conflict within the US Army than it is about conflict with the Nazi's."

","HI everyone! I just watched Hart's War on Pay-Per-View and I highly recommend those of you who haven't had a chance to see it to do so.  This film totally did not receive the recognition that it deserves; the performances by Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell were extraordinary, and I am sure we will be hearing much more about Colin Ferrell's career in years to come.  This film deals with the prejudice that existed amongst POW soldiers within the Nazi camps and takes you through an emotional-moral-roller-coaster ride when Farrell is asked to represent a soldier accused of ""murdering' another solider who was vehemently racist.  Meanwhile, Bruce Willis uses this distraction in order to seek justice for himself against the Nazi's captors.  If you are in the mood for a suspenseful and intellectually stimulating film then definitely catch this one before its too late."

","This is a very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story and fantastic performances!. All the characters are great, and extremely likable, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. The ending is very powerful, and quite sad, and it had a pretty cool unexpected plot twist as well, plus Colin Farrell surprised me here once again by giving another top notch performance!. The court scenes are actually pretty interesting, and this one works more on story then War action, plus it's very well made and written as well. Don't expect Bruce to be the main star in this film,granted he does have a fair amount of screen time, but Colin Farrell is definitely the star in this movie, plus Terrence Howard is especially good in his role as Scott!. I did find it a little strange that the Nazi's were so nice to the soldiers, and it did drag in certain spots, but it was never boring, and quite engaging most of the way, plus it will keep you guessing throughout. This is a very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story and fantastic performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Gregory Hoblit does a great! job here, with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at an engaging pace for the most part. The Acting is top notch!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is intense, very likable a very honorable man, and while he is not the star in this film, he still put on a very powerful performance, and the scenes involving him and Farrell were especially good! (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Colin Farrell is in top form here, he is very emotional, focused, had some standout scenes with Willis, had a great character, and this was his film, he is seriously beginning to grow on me!. Terrence Howard is very impressive here as Scott, he was really likable, and had some very good lines, I liked him a lot. Cole Hauser is very good as the asshole Bedford and did his job very well. Marcel Iures is good as the main villain. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5"

","It starts all right. The grey-tone scale in the prison camp is well photographed and you think you are watching a rather exciting war drama. But that's only what you think.

But Colin Farrell's puppy-like looks are not even a parody on themselves, they are only tiresome.

"robertjmr72","1","9","14","22 July 2011"," Started out promising but ended up terrible
","This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen, the reason I say this is because it started out really awesome and then slowly turned into a terrible movie that is totally forgettable. I would say that the movie is actually really good up to the point when the African-American prisoners are brought into the prisoner of war camp and then what started out as a really interesting movie about the conditions of POW's in WWII turns into some kind of misguided statement about racism. In the end, I couldn't really understand what kind of statement or message this movie was trying to make. On the one hand it seemed to be about the inequality of US soldiers during WWII but on the other hand that whole thing was just a cover-up for some clandestine sabotage operation. The ending was completely unbelievable but by that point I didn't care because I wanted to watch a ""War"" movie not a courtroom drama about racism that was just a sideshow to hide an operation that no one, watching the movie, knows about until the very end(and it wasn't one of those ""wow, what a cool endings"" either, it was just a ""WTF just happened?"" ending that was stupid. I seriously doubt that this movie was an accurate portrayal of how POW's, even of different races, would treat one another.<br/><br/>Conclusion, to make a long post even longer ;), This movie starts out really good and you think you are about to see a really awesome WWII movie but instead you have been tricked and what you end up with is a boring courtroom drama that in then in is completely meaningless because it was just a cover-up for some larger goal, and top off the stupidity the unarmed Bruce Willis character walks unopposed back into the prison camp, through the front gate...seriously, and basically let's himself get killed. This movie makes me mad because from the beginning you can tell this thing had potential and then someone, I guess the writers and director just quit caring about making sense and just told a complete fiction and nothing even remotely close to a good fictional WWII movie like ""Inglorious Basterds""."

","This film is so sappy I gave it a 3.  It has all the cliches, I have seen before.  Bruce Wills as the hard hearted leader who did it all for his men, the air man who just wants to make a difference, the officer who tries to make up for past mistakes, and the evil German commander.  This film is so sappy; it is time to get out the crying towel.  Everyone wants to sacrifice themselves.  The lead character is too preachy, and righteous, and I find the reason for this  is too hide the lack of story.  I left the theater and found no real point in the movie, it did not rap up into a big conclusion. Moreover, the court scene and the talking with his client was over kill. When we finally find out the plot twist, the movie dragged what should have been 15 minutes into an hour and an half."

","I recently had the good fortune of seeing an advanced screening of Hart's War. It took a good half hour for me to warm up to it but once the many plots twists took hold, I was pretty well hooked. Collin Farrell displays a good deal of screen charisma as Lt. Hart. Surprisingly, Bruce Willis is in a supporting role. Although the trailers I have seen would lead you to believe otherwise.<br/><br/>The story takes some surprising turns and that is one of the strengths of the movie. I won't spoil it by giving away too much.<br/><br/>As a student of history, particularly World War Two, I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie, not just for the original story line but the mood cast by the photography and the music score.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Hart's War as an intelligent, entertaining movie.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"
"micek","3","4","5","24 February 2002"," Don't be fooled, this is a courtroom drama, not an action flic!
","I suspect that poor test audience reviews pushed the studio to create a trailer that publicized Hart's War as an action film, but after the first 15 minutes you'll realize you're watching more of a courtroom drama than a WWII film with the same pace as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Dirty Dozen.""<br/><br/>The drama unfolds painfully slow and is handicapped by 2002 racial commentary awkwardly forced upon characters set in the 1940's.  Sappy diatribes about honor, racial tolerance and American patriotism detract from the film rather than enhance it because they exist as the story, not as a subtext to it.<br/><br/>Willis' performance is, as you would expect if you knew this was a dramatic role and not an action one, at its best, vapid.<br/><br/>The fact that Hart's War takes the departure from action to drama is a real shame, because the first twenty minutes or so had the makings of an awesome prison escape movie.  I just wish Hollywood would stop trying to dupe audiences into big opening weekend box office returns and give us a better idea of what to expect.  I think if I had known what I was getting into, I might have disliked it a tad less."
"FlickJunkie-2","5","20","38","27 July 2002"," A war story that defies credulity
","It is hard to imagine a more contrived story than this WWII POW film.  There are just so many unrealistic plot elements that the story loses all credibility.  Director Gregory Hoblit, (`Frequency', `Primal Fear') has delivered good dramatic films in the past, but this one simply loses its grip on reality.  While the production values are excellent, Hoblit doesn't seem to notice or care that plot and the behavior of his characters range from inconsistent to implausible.<br/><br/>Take Colonel Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  The workup on him shows him to be evil, intolerant, cruel and autocratic and those are his nicer qualities. Then suddenly, for no reason we can discern, he develops a soft spot for Lt. Hart (Colin Farrell).   This is a conniving, manipulative, hard hearted creature and just because he went to the same college as Hart, he becomes his avuncular advisor and benefactor.  Let's get real here.<br/><br/>Yes, and I am sure they are going to send a lieutenant assigned to headquarters and privileged to strategic information, who has never been in combat, to shuttle another officer to the front lines so he can get captured and spill his guts to the enemy.  That detail would have been given to a non commissioned officer with no exposure to such intelligence.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in this film is the acting of Colin Farrell.  Farrell combines rugged good looks and excellent dramatic skills to bring this film whatever shred of credibility it has.  He manages to make his character believable, despite the unbelievable nature of everything that is going on around him.  Bruce Willis gets top billing in this film, but doesn't log 20% of the screen time that Farrell commands.  Willis plays the hard shelled West Point officer well, although his switch from heartless malevolence to heroic nobility is just a bit too abrupt to accept.<br/><br/>Everything about this film stretches credulity.  By the end of the film, my eye sockets were sore from all the eye rolling.  I rated it a 5/10.  Despite some good performances and technical elements, this kind of drama needs realism to be effective and in this regard `Hart's War' fails spectacularly."

"noralee","3","5","7","22 December 2005"," Tired, Clich√© Mish Mash of World War II Movies
","To try and stay awake during ""Hart's War"" I tried to keep track of the number of movies, TV shows and books that it borrowed from, but I lost the battle. <br/><br/>There went ""A Soldier's Story,"" and here comes Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" and every WWII movie in the Pacific Theater that has the Japanese commandant say ""You are surprised I speak your language. USC 1938."" This grafts together at least four different military movies--battles, tortures, POWs, ""You can't handle the truth!"" court martials -- so there were a lot of clich√©s they could draw on. This is a male version of ""Charlotte Gray"" for a contemporary, uncredible approach to WWII. <br/><br/>I went to see it to monitor Colin Farrell's career whose debut in another military movie, ""Tigerland"" was electrifying, and I liked director Gregory Hoblitt's TV work. But Farrell as a Yale Law School student in 1944 was about as believable as Bruce Willis as a fourth generation West Pointer. I kept wondering how they keep their hair so neatly trimmed in the POW camp. <br/><br/>Terrence Howard comes out the best in integrating the story of the Tuskegee Airmen into the stalag part of the movie, though wasn't there a black soldier in ""Hogan's Heroes""? The German commandant, played by Rumanian actor Marcel Iures, was also non-stereotypical.<br/><br/>Rachel Portman's swelling music is really intrusive to any suspense.<br/><br/>The theater was virtually empty and I don't think it was due to the plot-revealing ads, as the director claims.<br/><br/>(originally written 3/3/2002)"

","This flick was underwhelming and totally average.  There were just too many plot points that were brought up and abandoned.  e.g. Senator's son, both went to Yale, Hart's lie, etc.  The German Colonel was almost the most sympathetic character.  None of the characters were very well developed at all.  I think this film was either edited poorly, or written without a cohesive point.  If it did have a point, I didn't get it.

"spencerdouglass3","1","13","24","26 April 2004"," Rubbish
","I thought this movie was rubbish. It was very disappointing to watch a film for which there were good reviews and find out that it was very poor indeed. Why did I dislike it so much? Well, the main story is fine, a sort of racial discrimination version of 'A Few Good Men', and the background military story (which is supposed to be the covered up main story) is alright too. However, the entire plot is completely unrealistic and the story far too contrived. The story is set in a German POW camp, presumably not a very comfortable place to live, yet the Americans happily stroll around the camp smoking cigarettes, playing American football and insulting their German captors freely. There is no sign of any hardship or suffering, no one gets ill in the freezing cold weather and the German captors are extremely friendly and accomodating. So when Colonel McNamarra (who seems to hold more power than the Germans) suggests a trial when one of the soldiers is killed and a black man suspected, the German colonel immediately agrees and gives them a building to use for it. Most of the film then revolves around the racially biased trial of the black lieutenant. This strikes me as a completely contrived and nonsensical backdrop to the war, as one would assume that the soldiers would be focussed on escaping, fighting back against the Germans or something else useful rather than discriminating against each other. In addition in a real situation, they would probably be under too much strain and discrimination from the Germans to worry about creating more problems of their own. Finally when the trial is revealed to be a farce even within the film you are once again reminded of Hollywood's desperate need nowadays to try and make their films more interesting or seem deeper than they are. The final scene when Bruce Willis exchanges his life for his men's and the German colonel bears his loss with a wry grin and a joke or two, stretches the boundaries of disbelief. Without even a drop of imagination, it must seem obvious that the German colonel would be furious and undoubtedly kill all the men involved, and should the great colonel McNamarra turn up to be shot with his men at the last minute this would merely be icing on the cake.<br/><br/>A completely ridiculous film, unrealistic and poorly thought out. Don't watch it."

","Typically Bruce Willis brings a bunch to any movie part and this is no exception, however from the director that brought NYPD Blue (1994-2005), 'Fallen'(1998) w/Denzel Washington and 'Frequency'(2000) w/Dennis Quaid two well set movies and a 'Hit' T.V. series, that are great additions to any entertainment library, I felt that this director, had one or two things missing from ""Hart's War"". <br/><br/>I would have been more interested if it would have been 'Hart Bochner's War' where Hart could have played the arrogant 'Ellis' and then the least end we could have had a few good laughs. Please don't take me wrong, I love and I mean love a good drama any day, but Hart's was just one of those maybe fall by the wayside in the movie arena type films. I enjoyed the activity and confinement, the trial and court drama that was the main push in this WWII story. but something didn't seem to draw me into a place that I could feel that I was sold all the way, as many Willis films are for me. I don't balk at much that Bruce Willis has made because he exudes that charm, style, strength and aloof that makes his character an essential part of American cinema. Hart's War, was almost there for me but I remember walking out, thinking about the story and the scenes therein, but not fully making that real connection that I have come to expect in a well done Willis Drama. I will watch it again at some point probably at a holiday, as some movies age better that others, some don't age at all. That is the test I have used most effectively for my final judgments on it.

Many of the viewers here commented on how unrealistic Hart's War was in terms of life in a concentration camp. I saw the characterization of Hart.<br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>1. Why is Bruce Willis the star of this movie? The title of the movie is HART'S War, not McNamara's War.<br/><br/>Plus the movie followed Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell), not McNamara (Bruce Willis)<br/><br/>It is Thomas Hart we see at the beginning. It was Thomas Hart we see driving the jeep and getting captured. It was Thomas Hart we see interrogated and imprisoned, even huddling completely naked in a cold prison cell. It was Thomas Hart we see in the POW train, shivering from cold and horrified at seeing his friend die. It was Thomas Hart we follow in the march. It was Thomas Hart we see reacting to the camp (the hanging, the rats). It was Thomas Hart we see becoming a leader and eventual defender. It was Thomas Hart.<br/><br/>McNamara is just someone who shows up from time to time, and is secretly working behind the scenes to liberate his fellow American soldiers. We didn't follow McNamara as he was doing this. We followed Hart.<br/><br/>2.  In the beginning, I saw a man who had a comfy job at what appears to be military headquarters. By taking on an assignment to transport an officer, he comes to experience for the first time the horrors of war. From there, he grows to be a leader of his unit and eventual attorney to another black soldier who was accused of the crime.<br/><br/>3. Hart seems to be ashamed to be a senator's son. When the soldier mentioned it in the jeep, Hart looked offended. I saw the shame again when he was talking about his family with the defendant. I wish they could explore this issue more (not necessarily in the jeep but later in the movie). Why be ashamed to be a senator's son?<br/><br/>4. Hart also seems to have been sheltered, that he hasn't really experienced the horrors of war until the jeep incident and eventual POW.<br/><br/>5.

It is almost impossible to even believe that the Nazi's during WW II, would ever have agreed to having a court trial for murder.

The way the German POW system was organized had the Wermacht (German Army) in charge of ground forces POWs, the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in charge of air forces POWs, and the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in charge of naval POWs.

Although headed by talented actors, most are wonderfully submerged in their characters. This is a complex work, with a plot that reveals itself cautiously, which is entirely necessary to make its' points. The truth must arrive slowly.

It was the first movie I have seen that made me feel that 1944 was modern times. Also the idea that everyone in the film had to deal with things they were not to proud of made everyone more human and made the movie something different then what Hollywood is putting out these days.

","This is one of those films that i never got around to seeing at the cinema, and being a bruce willis fan i had the chance to get the DVD.<br/><br/>First off before watching the film i watched the trailer. The trailer does'nt make exactly clear what the film is about, it depicts a epic war film set in a POW camp, i was expecting this film to be about a massive rebellion in the camp and people escaping, this is actually part of the plot, which i was happy to learn. But you only learn this at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The film is based around Lt Hart (colin farrell) who is captured and sent to a POW camp, this is where he is sent to the officers bunk and meets COl Mcnamara (willis) he is then told there is not enough space so is sent to be the only ranking officer in with general soldiers. The film is pretty slow up to this point and not much goes down, characters are built.<br/><br/>The film changes tone when two black officers are brought to the camp, this is where the film deal with racism, as there is no space in the officers barrack, they are sent to bunk with lt hart, so they are not the only officers in general soldier population. The film goes on and eventually one of the black officers is framed for murder. So instead of him being executed the German officer in charge of the camp decides him to be put on trail instead of executed. (this is the only part of the film where i rolled my eyes) i mean would the German in charge of a POW camp really take the time out to hold a trial.<br/><br/>So the trail begins and lt hart becomes the defendant of the acused, the two form a friendship and hart digs deeper into what the trail is really all about. At the end point of the film you discover the whole trail is stagged so that (willis) and his men can complete the escape tunnel they have been building and get away. The trail is stopped and the film comes to a end with a interesting development which once again gives bruce willis another honour roll.<br/><br/>In general i actually enjoyed the film, the train sequence at the beginning was very shot, the film is a bit slow at times, but what i think really makes the music , is the female artist who did the score for this film.

","I often check Roger Ebert's Movie Reviews AFTER I have seen a film to see how I measure up with the expert. After a few years of this activity, I am convinced that Mr Ebert has a social agenda which is clearly reflected in his reviews. ie. Hart's War. Mr Ebert rates this a 3 star film. I would have rated it 3-1/2 stars. Not much difference you say? The difference is significant and can be measured by the last paragraph of Mr Ebert's review:<br/><br/>""The movie worked for me right up to the final scene, and then it caved in. [The writers and director] put the plot through an awkward U-turn so that Bruce Willis could end up as a hero.""<br/><br/>After telling us how ""awkward"" this plot twist was, he goes on to say:<br/><br/>""How and why he does so, is ingenious . . .""<br/><br/>It is not important to my argument to know what that plot twist is. But it is of major importance to read how Mr Ebert would have improved(?) the plot ending:<br/><br/>""I would have liked it better if the far-off bugle had been playing under a black character at the end and not a white one.""<br/><br/>So, it looks like Mr Ebert would have preferred the continuation of the racist message the film has portrayed up to that point rather than let a white man be the hero. But, of course, if they had done so, the result would have been ""just another military courtroom drama"" instead of ""an ingenious one"".<br/><br/>Make no mistake. Mr Ebert sees this as a film about racism, which it is, and resents the altogether too rare plot twist that makes this film a winner. He would rather we left the theatre moaning about the plight of the black man which has been done endlessly over the last half century and, perhaps, done better elsewhere (ie. To Kill a Mockingbird)."

","Bruce Willis is back at the cinema, or is he? In Hart's War he plays the American commander in a German concentration camp near the end of WW2, but Willis seems to be holding back, reserved, muted. He's not even the central character.<br/><br/>Compared to say The Great Escape which would have to be the benchmark in the movie realm, Hart's War lacks dramatic punch. But it has virtues. Hart is played by Dubliner Colin Farrell. <br/><br/>He's a soft soldier, doing his duty as an officer's offsider, driving big brass about protected by the influence of his well to do family. He gets captured, in a scene that is truly dramatic, interrogated and sent to Stalag VI in very wintry Belgium.<br/><br/>Willis's character Col. McNamara, a fourth generation soldier, is suspicious of Hart because Hart emerged from interrogation far too early. Hart might have spilt the beans and McNamara places Hart into an enlisted men's hut.<br/><br/>Hart is soon joined there by Scott (Terence Howard) and Archer (Vicellous Shannon), two black American pilots and here's where the major plot element develops because the white American troops led by Bedford (Cole Hauser) react viciously towards black men being put amongst them.<br/><br/>It's not long before a rather improbable court martial is on for us, with a black man being tried by a hanging judge (McNamara) for murder. The German commander (Marcel Iures) plays his stereotype well, as do the rest.<br/><br/>The racist element is handled forcefully along with a rather intricate plot. There's plenty to think about as various relationships are developed.<br/><br/>What Hart's War lacks is dramatic flourish. We're in a dangerous prison with the men but we don't feel threatened. If fact the prison with its theatre, piano, football, B.B.C radio and trombone looks more like a very chilly holiday camp. I wouldn't have been surprised if there was hot running water.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell's character Hart, the center of the film in spite of Willis's top billing, handles his material well but it seemed he should have been back in The States at his posh law school, of that he really had never left.<br/><br/>We get glimpses of Jewish detainees on death trains, but it doesn't quite register as awful. We've seen it all before and it doesn't stir the Hart. Hart's War fell into that dangerous hole called the court room drama but even the court seemed vacuous. Except for the racist element we'd seen it all before.<br/><br/>3 Flaccid Flys Out Of Five"

","I saw again ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"" (both quite entertaining films in spite of the war premise) after ""Hart's War.""  My sense is, director Gregory Hoblit's film does stand on its own. It may not have the humor filled ""17"" atmosphere, nor the action packed ""Escape"" storyline, but it is a humane story at its core. It's about character building or disintegrating in times of hardship, offering aspects or the wisdom of life's outlook, military or otherwise.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell, who delivered an intense performance in Joel Schumacher's ""Tigerland"" 2000 (and looking forward to his appearance in this summer's ""Minority Report"" with Spielberg directing and Tom Cruise leading), once again demonstrated his keen acting portraying Lt. Hart, the central character opposite Bruce Willis' Col. McNamara in ""Hart's War.""  For young Hart who has an affluent family background and was educated as a lawyer, he is fighting the 'war' -- yes, his war at hand, inside the POW camp vs. the literal war outside the barb-wired compound. There's urgency and suspense revolving around his character's encounters, trials and learnings -- things are somehow fast happening in spite of the camouflaged unhurried pace.<br/><br/>
Willis gets to be subtle, sullen, and almost silent in his portrayal of Col. McNamara, the nemesis to Hart. He has delivered quiet performances (not so action hero-centric roles) in Robert Benton's ""Nobody's Fool"" 1994 (opposite Paul Newman), and Harold Becker's ""Mercury Rising"" 1998 (opposite an autistic child), prior to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" 1999 (opposite Haley Joel Osment). Here in ""Hart's War,"" the humane side of McNamara is unobtrusively noted when he's not having confrontations with Hart, for instance the scene where he visited flyer Scott in his cell and calmly handed him a Bible. Subtle persuasions, he has.<br/><br/>
This war picture is very much male dominated, however the film is complemented by the music score of British composer Rachel Portman. Cinematographer Alar Kivilo, who has worked with Hoblit on the film ""Frequency"", is masterful in delivering the bleak snowy tone of the film. It may be a court drama per se, yet there's no shortage of action and intrigue. ""Hart's War"" is a well delivered film, with no simple answers to the reasons why, of things happening, people reacting, circumstances changing¬Ö Like his ""Primal Fear"" 1996, ""Fallen"" 1998, and ""Frequency"" 2000, director Gregory Hoblit's films can be thought provoking.<br/><br/>

The director should have cut it from the script and started the whole damn thing inside the POW camp.  Although the first section is very well done, it misleads the viewer to what the movie is actually going to be about so that once the court scenario is thrown in, the viewer is left confounded as to its importance.

","When I first saw the trailer to Hart's War I was expecting two things: It was gonna be a shoot-em-up kill the Nazis war movie and that Bruce Willis was going to play the role of Hart.  And I have to say that I was quite happy that both my assumptions were wrong.  First of all... I am very impressed that the people who casted this move decided on Colin Ferrell for the lead role as Hart.  When I saw the movie Tigerland and had no idea who he was... but people should take notice of this guy because he is going to be the next big lead actor.  He did an excellent job in this movie and his role was very believable.  Bruce Willis, although not the lead in this movie, also did an excellent job.  He played the role who it was supposed to be played and I think he was the perfect pick for it.  All in all the acting was great in this movie.  Now when I first heard that this movie wasn't going to be a typical war movie, I was a little disappointed.  But with the recent release of the amazing Black Hawk Down, and not to mention the fact that both Nicholas Cage and Mel Gibson are coming out with war movies, it is nice to see that someone has tried to put a different spin on things.  Now I don't know for sure if this POW camp was run how a real POW camp was... but with the mention of the Geneva Conference and the reactions of the Germans at the end... it was believable to me.  So overall I don't think this movie is the caliber of a Saving Private Ryan WWII movie, but I think they did an excellent job in putting a new spin on things and I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes WWII movies and also likes dramas.  If all you are looking for is an action movie, or if you hate dramas, this movie is definitely not for you. 8.5/10"

","In 1944 Belgium, during World War II, handsome American lieutenant Colin Farrell (as Thomas ""Tom"" Hart) is captured by the Nazis and sent to a German Prisoner of War (POW) camp. He is a US Senator's son and Yale law student; this was not supposed to happen. After some hairy distractions, Mr. Farrell ends up in Stalag 6A. He meets the prisoners' hard-nosed leader Bruce Willis (as William A. McNamara), who puts Lt. Farrell in a less than worthy barracks; it's one for enlisted men, not officers. The demotion is likely because Col. Willis knows Farrell lied to him about not cracking under German interrogation. Next, two additional men arrive at Stalag 6A. These men cause racial tension among the POWs...<br/><br/>The conflict centers on Terrence Howard (as Lincoln A. Scott) and Cole Hauser (as ""Vic"" W. Bedford). A Tuskegee pilot, the former becomes an accused black man; the latter is his white racist enemy. These men perform their supporting roles very well. However, the most memorable characterization is given by Marcel Iures (as Werner Visser). As the Nazi leader, Mr. Iures has the meatiest role. He was educated in the west (Yale, again), served in World War I and plays American jazz phonograph records. That background connects everyone...<br/><br/>The main star, Farrell employs his Yale studies to defend Mr. Howard. The main co-star, Willis looks steely and determined. Director Gregory Hoblit and cinematographer Alar Kivilo make ""Hart's War"" a fine looking film, especially during the first half. But we should not guess the big revelation before Farrell, who seems like a fairly smart guy, and the ending is most unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>****** Hart's War (2/15/02) Gregory Hoblit ~ Colin Farrell, Bruce Willis, Marcel Iures, Terrence Howard"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","1","6 December 2013"," The director has done better, but you could do worse
","This takes place in a POW camp during WWII, and follows the events that transpire after a few black enlisted men are captured and put among the white prisoners. This has a well-written script, lines are great and well-delivered, the plot is interesting, engaging and develops quite nicely throughout. The editing and cinematography have some inspired moments, and are always marvelous. This is rather exciting and entertaining.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel, nor did I realize that this was based upon one until I watched it. This is the third of Hoblit's films I've seen, the other two being Frequency and Primal Fear, both of which I find to be excellent. Thus, in comparison, this is a little less impressive. I wouldn't call it poor, however. It certainly has a point to it, something to say, and it communicates it fairly well. The message is good, too.<br/><br/>The performances are impeccable, Willis does as well as we expect, Farrell makes reasonable use of his chance at doing a role that can prove he can do more than project his ""bad boy"" persona onto the screen, and Howard shines. This meeting and conflict between the experienced master and the up-and-coming student is further infused with the clever juxtaposition of that relationship being not only of their characters ‚Äì but of the actors, as well.<br/><br/>The DVD comes with two informational, compelling and amusing commentaries: one by Gregory Hoblit, writer Billy Ray and Bruce Willis, and one by producer David Foster, 10 minutes of good deleted scenes with or without director commentary and several photo galleries. There is relatively infrequent strong violence and language. I recommend this to any fan of dramas, and who enjoy movies that deal with history. 7/10"
"mlbou","5","1","1","18 February 2002"," Not what I expected
","I'll admit right here and now that I was not expecting this to be another JAG drama: I was picturing it more like a dramatic Hogan's Heroes, where the prisoners create havoc for the Germans. Instead, it felt a great deal like Stalag 17, except that the outsider/loner was an African-American soldier. Other than that, the two are very similar, except that I think Stalag 17 is much better done, deeper, more interesting than Hart's War.<br/><br/>Honestly, this story just worked too hard to get from A to B, because B was in no way the logical conclusion of A, no matter what turns were inserted into the script. So much evidence was glossed over: if there were mud beneath the floor board (enough to make the victim so dirty) why wasn't there a spot on the pilot, a fact ceded by the prosecution? (Hart had argued along similar lines just 5 minutes earlier, but now forgets it? I think not. Or that the criminal (when it was finally revealed) did not have any of that tell-tale sign left on him 3 minutes after the crime? I can see him scrubbing away frantically for all of 2 seconds? ""Out darned spot...?oh wait, I'm clean. Ok.""<br/><br/>My greatest problem with the movie is the message: that in order to be a hero you must die for your fellow man. While that can be a heroic act, I keep remembering a quotation by Gen. George Patton that ""No poor, dumb soldier [editing for profanity] ever won a war by dying for his country. You win wars by making the other poor, dumb soldier die for his country."" It just seemed to me that there were numerous ways to solve their problem without sacrificing anybody, if they had thought about it first but they instead all jumped up ""I'll die for you."" ""No, I'll die for you"" ?They never considered that there was only one person who had to die. Also, Hart's heroic act was actually among the most foolish things he could possibly do, speeding up what he should have wanted to slow down.<br/><br/>About the race issue here, some of the things that the pilots (both African-Americans) said were very interesting and worth listening too, but it really seemed like they were an otherwise superfluous wrinkle in the puzzle, as though a studio exec watched Stalag 17 and said, ""You know what ?I don't want to redo this movie, but I bet if we made the pilots black instead of white we could call this original."" To me that cheapens the film, if the crux of your film is ""heroism in light of a trial fraught with racism"" then racism should be an integral part of the film, instead if you took it out and changed a few words here and there it would be the exact same movie ?which disappoints me even futher.<br/><br/>I like war movies, and though I gave this a 6 I cannot say that it is a bad war movie I've seen. I do feel comfortable saying that it is a frustrating movie, that gets worse with time (the more you think about it, the more flaws you find in the story and your impression of it goes down). It has good moments and it is interesting at times, but if you want to see a WWII film about prison camps and conflict among soldiers see Stalag 17. If you want to see a Bruce Willis movie about heroes see Armageddon. This film just isn't original, interesting, or exciting enough to merit viewing it before those two films."

","I was expecting ""Die Hard with Nazi's"", what I ended up with a cross between ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The Flying Tuskagees"".

","Perhaps this film is underrated because it opened before screenwriter Terry George emerged as an important filmmaker with Hotel Rwanda, which he wrote and directed. It deserves another look. The script is smart, tight, with no shortage of morbid wit (""If I wanted to kill crackers, I'd have stayed in Macon,"" says Terence Howard, a lieutenant on trial for murdering a white enlisted man). It's also very ambitious, efficiently and engagingly exploring life-and-death conflicts without sentimentality. It works not only as a war movie (with harrowing sequences, and not forgetting that Russian POWs were treated even worse than Americans) but as a first-rate mystery complete with courtroom sequence and hugely satisfying denouement, layered with dramatic surprises. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie belongs not to any one actor, but to a character. There are dozens of truly great war pictures, but I can't think of another character, not even a real one like Patton, as fully explored as Col. McNamara (a solid Bruce Willis). He is the consummate career soldier, a constitute of courage, determination, leadership, physical and mental toughness, unflagging honor, and -- most impressive-- a commitment to cause that is revealed in strategic and resourceful military thinking that make this one of the most intelligent war pictures I can recall."

"scope_creep","2","3","7","5 October 2008"," Plot is contrived and the setting is unrealistic
","I just watched this film for the second time, and it was astonished how contrived the plot and overall settings were. As I started watching quite late into the start of the movie, the first thing that got me irked was the fact that band members/entertainers, in the mess hall, were all parodying Hitler, if somehow that would be allowed. Any passing Nazi, would have shot them dead on the spot, and more so, the camp commandant would have been relieved of duty, or at worst, shot by the Gestapo. It simply wouldn't been allowed to happen. The Germans at this time, considered themselves the Master race. Any sign of insolence from anybody, would be instant death.<br/><br/>There is a whole number of these plot/action points which happen throughout the movie, like the Willis character being insolent to the camp commandant. There seems to be a time-line, call it the time-line of forgetfulness. In the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, and even 90's there were still people about, who could give you first hand details about conditions in the camp like this. Now, sadly most of them are dead, so it quite hard for set/directors, to get good idea of how the camp would work. So we end up with films like this, which has strayed so far from what it would be really like.<br/><br/>The real contrivance though, is the trial. Holding a military trial, and commandant allowing it, is absurd to contemplate, almost laughable. The fact he is allowing it, would be seen on the part of the allies, as collaboration, by the Willis character. Instead, the camp leading allied officers would hold an internal military tribunal, if held at all, and the enemy, wouldn't even hear about, why, because they were at war. So we have this contrivance, with Farrell, with daft dialogue, saying i'm going to kill you, if you do that. It was war. No members of the Allies would threaten each other. Simply too absurd to think about really. I know you have to suspend belief, when watching films of this type, but there is a finer point, in the fact, that any such trial would have been used as propaganda by the Axis powers. Although it is the central tenet of the film, why would the plot provide for the Willis character to push for a trial. Absurd!. Keep it real. <br/><br/>I could list the duffers, like Willis drinking whisky with the camp commandant, the camp commandant alluding to a ""real American trial"", .... This is the German master race, the 1000 year third Reich, all that madness. <br/><br/>Its a pity really, the actors are first class, and are wasted on this absurd plot."

","Amid the heavy snows of the winter of 1944, near the Ardennes forests of what would later be called the 'Malmedy Massacre' lay the quiet, frozen bodies of 150 dead American soldiers murdered by the Sixth SS Panzer Army. Other Americans who survived were captured by Wehrmacht forces and sent to one of a dozen German P.O.W. camps. It was in one of these camps that Lt. Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell) and others are sent for internment. Here amid the growing number of captured Prisoners, he is introduced to Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) a serious, disheartened West Point officer who believes every leader must prove himself worthy of command. Settling in a non-com barracks, Lt. Hart meets Staff Sgt. Victor Bedford (Cole Hauser) a 'scrounger' and man of surprising resources. Aside from his talent, he is a myopic, hate filled bigot who angrily protests the inclusion of two captured black pilots sent to their unit. When one pilot is shot for allegedly trying to escape, Bedford is accused of betraying him and is subsequently murdered. The blame immediately falls on Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) who is charged and given a General Courtmartial. With his life in the balance, Col. McNamara assigns Lt. Hart to defend him. With little experience Hart begins to construct a defense when he learns of the restrictions place in his way by his commanding officer. However, Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures), the German officer commanding the P.O.W. camp seeks an opportunity to prove his superiority over McNamara, decides to help Hart. What the ulterior motives of both Commanders are becomes Hart's objectives as he realizes there is more at stake than a single man's innocence. The dark drama of this movie is filled with tension, anger and shadowy perceptions. I believe this film will be seen in the future as one of Willis' all time Classics and a silent tribute to the spirits which linger in the Ardennes Forests. ****"

Once at the prison camp Bruce Willis (The Cornel) doesn't like him. Hart must defend a black fighter pilot on a murder rap. But all is not what it seems.

","Hart's War is a bad movie. Its boring, it rips-off and tries to copy movies like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape without having any of their intellect or style. What makes it worse is that the film seems to feel it has a message. There are numerous sub-plots, not one them interesting or fleshed out. The trial is unimpacting and the end is a cop-out.<br/><br/>If the film were merely stupid and unoriginal, it may still be watchable on a quiet evening with nothing better to do. But Hart's War is boring. All the actor's - especially Bruce Willis - look totally out of place and wooden. Bruce Willis has lived out his career and may have done this for the money. Terence Howard was still up and coming (hopefully Crash will change that). But Colin Farrell! He is such a talented actor and appeared in a really good war movie called Tigerland. So why waste time with such a lame script. Skip this one."
"Boba_Fett1138","4","2","4","23 September 2005"," Bad script makes bad movie.
","The movie suffers heavily from its poorly written script that is filled with silly and odd moralistic moments and even leaves room for anti-discrimination statements. No, I did not enjoyed ""Hart's War"" and to be frank, the movie was too long, boring and left an overall pointless and perhaps even silly impression. There even are some totally pointless battle sequences in the movie that felt like a waste of money and could had easily been left out.<br/><br/>The movie is a true waste of talent. Director Gregory Hoblit obviously is a talented person which he also has already proved with some of his previous movies and TV-series episodes. He does his best and certainly provides this movie with a lot of style but he can't help to conceal the silly and bad story of the movie. I felt that Bruce Willis was miscast and please don't be fooled by the movie its cover people, Bruce Willis does not play the main character in this movie. Real main character of the movie is played by Colin Farrell who once more shows his talent. But why, oh why did they let the part of the German camp commander being played by a Romanian guy? You can obviously tell by his accent and when he speaks German that he is not a German himself. And c'mon, it's not like that there aren't any good German actors out there. Further more the movie is filled with characters we never really get to care about.<br/><br/>The movie does not provide a good or realistic view in the every day live and conditions of allied POW's during WW II. This is due to the silly moralistic, Hollywoodized story and moments in the movie. I also found most of the moments in the movie to be predictable and also the ending was no real surprise to me.<br/><br/>There are better POW camp movies out there and certainly better WW II movies.

"Rvrgm","8","2","4","19 August 2005"," Marketing the film as a Bruce Willis WWII action film is the reason less people enjoyed it!
","I finally got around to watching this movie last night (after buying it for $4 on DVD a few weeks ago) and I can say I was very pleasantly surprised by it after reading so many negative reviews.<br/><br/>The Problem: This film was marketed poorly - the trailers give an accurate idea of the content, but they give you the wrong impression as to the tone. Because Bruce Willis is in it, they chose to make it out to contain tons of action and heroic combat! They also chose to make it appear to be a Bruce Willis vehicle. Let me tell you, if you are renting or buying it for either of the above reasons, you will hate it! The ""combat action"" scenes are sparse (two scenes) and extremely short (though very exciting when they do occur. And Bruce Willis is really a supporting actor to Farrel - in fact, of the major characters, he probably has less screen time than anyone else, and is rarely seen outside of Farrel's perspective.<br/><br/>The Good: So, the first thing you need to do is lay aside your expectation of a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or GUNS OF NAVARONNE type movie. This is a drama! And it is a very good one. There are several layers to this story - one is that of Lt. Hart's (Colin Farrel) need for redemption after an early failure in the film. His assignment to defend the falsely accused marine gives him that chance. The main story is the trial of a marine who asserts he was framed for the murder of a fellow marine in the stockade. Farrel quickly learns that the cards are stacked against him as the presiding officer McNamara (Willis) seems bent on a guilty verdict. This sets up some very tense confrontations between the two.<br/><br/>Adding a second layer to this drama is the apparently misunderstood character of the commanding Nazi officer Werner Visser. Visser represents an aging officer who has wound up in a remote post and seems to have accepted this lesser role. He is a foil to Willis's McNamara, who wants nothing more than to get back to the war. The confusion as to why Visser suddenly wants to help Hart is that people perceive this as Visser suddenly becoming the nice Nazi. Well, anyone paying attention can see that Visser is ONLY motivated by getting back at McNamara. Hart is a convenient tool to do so - but there is not fondness for Hart from Visser, as you will see by the film's end.<br/><br/>The third layer is that of the racist motivation behind the original crime. Two of the confined officers are African-American, and they are portrayed in a very heroic light here - but the white enlisted men are very prejudiced to their presence (this is the 40s, remember). This gives ample opportunity to see racism as it truly is - these are fine outstanding officers, but their contributions are ignored by those who only see the color of their skin.<br/><br/>Combining these three threads takes a skillful director, and Hoblit shows himself up to the task. The film never loses momentum, but switches nicely between the various threads. The writing is crisp, the cinematography is appropriately drab and dreary in its own beautiful way (love the light beams coming through the barrack windows) and the few actions scenes keep the excitement level high. All told, this is an excellent movie, and one I am proud to own - it's a shame more people will miss out on it because of the critics who didn't get it.<br/><br/>The Bad: That is not to say it is the perfect film. I did have a difficult time following a lot of what was going on for the first hour, but near the end, when a plot twist was introduced, much of these scenes made more sense. Also, some of the dialog was either poorly recorded, or poorly delivered. But, my main gripe was covered above about the misleading marketing of this film.<br/><br/>The Summation: Think of it as a combination of THE GREAT ESCAPE, A FEW GOOD MEN, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - with the final sum being just a few notches below each of these titles, and you'll get an idea of what you're in for . . . give it a chance!"

The DVD case even goes out of it's way to paint this as an action movie... I'd have been sorely disappointed if I hadn't known better.<br/><br/>Hart's War was a real disappointment. The first hour is quite good and really sets the scene. Unfortunately the second half is absurdly implausible and poorly put together.

It reminded me of the old ""creepy uncle pulling his thumb off"" trick. The finger in front of the thumb doesn't hide anything - in this case the plot is incredibly transparent and unnecessarily so.<br/><br/>Had some judicious editing taken place, say trimming the second half by about 20 minutes (and I, despite knowing very little about editing, can even think of the exact bits to get rid off), Hart's War would have been quite a good movie.

","Hart's War may or may not be accurate portrayal of the setting & situations it draws on for its material. It's probably not a classic of the WWII war film genre or the prison camp film genre. But it fairly uses the conventions of the WWII & prison camp films in the service of the story it means to tell, and it tells a good story.<br/><br/>As story, Hart's War amounts to a complex, but in no way overly complicated, study of images of American ethical ideal, of American heroism. It plays American cultural images of courage against each other in such a way that the contrasts among them don't cancel them out but rather grant them each a validity loosely tied to the history we draw them from. The courage of the military commander risking death to strike a blow for a uniquely American societal freedom confronts the courage of the heir of American liberal education and wealth awakening to defend another against injustice bound up with the American way of life, and both are confronted by the courage of the pushed- aside, the oppressed minority, claiming his own standing & right in virtue of the supremacy of the law and its grant of equality under the American system. As such it's a story that demands deft character construction, the portrayal of individuals as fully formed -- not caricature -- in motivation, action, & interaction; and the script obviously makes its characters its heart.<br/><br/>As film, Hart's War is carefully composed: tightly paced, woven together with great streamlining camera & production work, unfolded with the inevitability of good storytelling and little of either the audio or the visual that could be called unnecessary or indulgent. It makes a great virtue of apparent simplicity and manages to richly evoke place and atmosphere of war-torn Europe without being fussy about detail.<br/><br/>It may not be one of the truly great WWII movies, but it probably wasn't intended to be. For what it seems intended to be, it impresses me each time I watch it. I recommend it."

But it ain't a bad movie, it just isn't your typical war movie where blowing a lot of stuff making a nice trailer and gets teenagers to buy a ticket.<br/><br/>In my opinion the script carried well enough and there were no clear flaws to complain about. This could have been another story if the cast had been different, now the characters and the tension between them kept the movie interesting even in scenes where the script otherwise might have been irrelevant.<br/><br/>Farrell, Willis, Howard and especially Lures all have great acting performances and the director also does a magnificent job. Watched it a second time and I still rate this 9/10."

","The beginning of the movie shows Colin Farrell leaving his army base with a fellow soldier, and on the way out, they're ambushed by undercover Nazis. His buddy dies, but Colin leads a desperate chase through the snowy forest, eventually getting caught after falling into a trench full of dead frozen bodies. It's a very violent and creepy scene, and since the entire rest of the movie never even references it, I have no idea why it was included. The rest of the movie takes place in a POW camp and has to do with a court martial hearing, and the upsetting first ten minutes could have easily been shaved off.<br/><br/>At the POW camp, Colin meets fellow soldiers Cole Hauser, Linus Roache, Maury Sterling, Sam Jaeger, Sam Worthington, and Colonel Bruce Willis, the head honcho who decides everything and even has a working relationship with the prison commander, Marcel Iures. If you keep your eyes open, you'll see Adrian Grenier for a few minutes, but don't get too attached to him. When black prisoners enter the camp, tensions rise and some of the soldiers turn on one another. Eventually, there's a court martial, but I won't tell you the reason for it, since it's almost halfway through the film before it starts.<br/><br/>For me, the most interesting part of the movie was the introduction to the POW camp. There's a very moving scene where the German train gets attacked by Allied planes, and the prisoners, freed from the compartment, fear they'll be mistaken for German troops. They scatter around in clumps, until finally the audience sees an aerial shot of their design: gigantic human-made letters of POW, and the planes leave them alone. The first impression of everyone's characters is also interesting, but once the court martial starts, the story turns pretty predictable and I found it hard to remain invested. The upside is you'll get to see some good performances, notably from Terrence Howard.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. The first ten minutes are filmed with a handheld camera, and some angles swirl, swoop, or zoom quickly without warning, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

","""Hart's war"" tells the story of a group of American POWs that is one day joined by two black soldiers. Soon tensions begin to rise between them and the other prisoners and when a man is found dead, one of them is the first to be accused. A young law student is appointed to defend him in an improvised court room and what he finds out is rather shocking.<br/><br/>In a way this movie felt like a modern day adaption of ""To kill a mockingbird"". I liked how it portrays the tensions within a group of men that actually share the same destiny and fight for the same goal. Had the film concentrated on this injustice, it would have been tremendous. As it is, it is still a great mocie but one with a unberably cheesy and nonsense ending that makes vilains to heroes and changes the whole message of the story. I'm quite sure there are a lot of historical inadequacies within this production, but that was the real disappointment to me.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend a watch nevertheless because it remains a film that is able to provoce a lot of emotions and anger and that deals with a topic that I feel is underrepresented within the genre."

","Lt. Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell) is captured during the Battle of the Bulge. He's interrogated for only 3 days by a notorious German. In the POW camp, the CO Col.

I think it would be better if we think that McNamara is a racist who wanted Scott killed. Instead, there really isn't much of a mystery. In fact when the twist is revealed, it's odd to me why Hart didn't realize it sooner. The story just isn't set up properly.

"sddavis63","9","0","0","13 July 2013"," A Courtroom Drama With A POW Twist
","After getting off to a little bit of a slow start, this turns into a pretty good courtroom drama style of movie, set in - of all places - a German POW camp during World War II, when Allied prisoners are given permission to set up a court martial to hold a trial for one of their officers accused of killing an enlisted man. <br/><br/>It is a bit slow starting, and, really, for at least the first hour or so you're assuming that the movie is little more than a depiction of the racism that existed in the US military at the time. In the story, the accused (Lt. Scott, played by Terrence Howard) is black - a shot down captured pilot (one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.) Although an officer, he's not given a place in the officers' barracks. Instead, he (along with a fellow black pilot also shot down) is sent by the senior POW officer, Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis), to bunk with enlisted men. The enlisted men are none too happy with the arrangement, especially Sgt. Bedford (Cole Hauser), who's openly racist. Also in the same barracks is another officer (Lt. Hart, played by Colin Farrell) who's been banished to the enlisted barracks because McNamara suspects him of breaking under questioning when he was captured and giving information to the Germans. The situation in the barracks is tense. The Germans discover a weapon in the bunk of the second black airman, who's summarily executed. Then, Bedford is found dead, and Scott is the prime suspect. McNamara orders Hart (who's a law student in civilian life) to defend Scott in a court martial.<br/><br/>Until close to the end of the movie, what you think you're seeing is a POW version of a lynching. Evidence that would help Scott is ignored. McNamara seems bent on getting a conviction. The deck is stacked against Hart and Scott. The POW setting made this a little more interesting as a courtroom drama, and it was effective is demonstrating the racism rampant at the time, but for a while I can't say I was getting too much more out of this than I would out of any courtroom drama. But as with most courtroom dramas, this one has twists and turns that arise as the movie approaches its end, and that actually made this a very compelling movie to watch - increasingly so as the end approaches.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail about the twists and turns, but ultimately what you think is a story about racism becomes a story about sacrifice, and giving yourself for the sake of others. By the time it closes it has almost a noble feel to it, and director Gregory Hoblit was effective in making that shift seamlessly. The lead actors were also very good in this. I quite enjoyed it. Although it is, yes, a bit slow off the top, it's nevertheless interesting. Set at the time of the Battle of the Bulge - the German offensive in the Ardennes in December of 1944 - the movie in its opening scenes offers a depiction of Operation Grief, the German plan to infiltrate Allied lines disguised as Allied soldiers, set up checkpoints and misdirect Allied traffic.<br/><br/>This is basically a well-done movie, taking a familiar concept and giving it enough of a twist to make it interesting and even catching the viewer by surprise when you finally realize what's happening.

","RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Gregory Hoblit, ""Hart's War"" is a war flick about a paper-pushing lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who is unexpectedly captured in Belgium and taken to a POW camp in southern Germany in the closing months of the European theater of the war. He eventually befriends and defends a Tuskegee Airmen (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the humane German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs. Cole Hauser is on hand as a racist soldier. <br/><br/>This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and ""The Great Escape"" (1963), albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of Hogan's Heroes but without the comedy, plus elements of ""A Few Good Men"" (1992). The film isn't really about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the criminal drama.<br/><br/>Some have complained that no fascist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial as depicted in the movie. But there are several reasons why the commandant would allow it: (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.<br/><br/>The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's packed with action and gripping drama. It's also ultimately quite moving. Although it failed at the box office, ""Hart's War"" is a very good WWII POW camp movie and, in some ways, great.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 125 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+/A-"

","The most fascinating aspect of Hart's War was the advertising campaign. Giant I-10 billboards don Bruce Willis's stubbled face.   Willis's Eastwood squint looks out from the sides of buses. Willis's name gets first billing on posters.  Hart's War seems like another Bruce Willis movie. And Colin Farrell, whose name causes furrowed brows of non-recognition, is pushed to the background.<br/><br/>The advertising deception works, and audiences enter the theater expecting to see Die Hard On the Western Front.  But what they see on the screen seems impossible.  They see Colin Farrell.  They see him a lot.  They see him as much as Bruce Willis.  Hart's War presents a unique blend of the star-vehicle and the ensemble.  Willis neither overpowers the screen with a constant presence, nor does he leave his stardom in the background.  A proper deus-ex-machina, Willis appears with pure persona, but then steps back and shares the spotlight with what's-his-face.  Surrounded by posters advertising stars with a movie attached, Hart's War, camouflaged in the same posters, provides a slightly more refreshing product. Slightly.<br/><br/>Under the gaze of two enemy commanders (Willis and Marcel Iures), Lt. Tommy Hart (Farrell) defends a Tuskegee airman accused of murder.  With such racial and patriotic themes abounding, the occasional clich√© proverb escapes, but this is aptly countered by the historically-accurate use of the N-word."

","SPOILERS FROM THIS AND 2 OTHER FILMS!!!!! I saw this with my son , who's about to go on his first overseas Naval posting. We both enjoyed this film and thought it well done and the acting uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>Some media reviewers, though, have not been as kind.<br/><br/>What I remember most is them saying the characters trip all over themselves toward the end in lining up to sacrifice their lives in the name of honor and courage. Because of this, the ending's hokey and cornball, they say.<br/><br/>I disagree. It's all well-paced, each character's motivation is different and each rings true. The common factor is they're all willing to die for their country in time of war. To call this ""cornball"" is rather odd when our guys are dying in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>I also disagree with another IMDB reviewer who says the first 20-30 minutes of the film was irrelevant. On the contrary, it showed the Hart's descent into hell: from pinpusher/gopher to freezing naked in an interrogation cell. Cut that out and Hart loses his motivation for his sacrifice (or chance at redemption) at the end. Then he'd just be cardboard, a Hart without a heart.<br/><br/>I also think the Commandant was totally in character by allowing the trial to occur. He set a ridiculous time limit, tried to bribe Hart and enjoyed McNamara's embarrassment.<br/><br/>Having said that, though, I don't remember hearing of any WWII P.O.W. commandants who were so quick with a gun. (In ""The Great Escape"", the prisoners are shot on Hitler's, not the commandant's, orders. Steve McQueen ended up in the cooler, not with a bullet in the head.)<br/><br/>My other quibble is that the munitions dump gets blown up a bit too quickly after the tunnel's discovery -- or even that there was a munitions dump at all. Why not just let the prisoners escape and have McNamara come back? And the commandant found that tunnel so easily.... hey, it's a movie.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, Hart's War"" is sort of -- but not quite -- a reverse twist on ""Stalag 17"", where William Holden earned his Oscar. There, a bunch of prisoners trick the camp guards into shooting a German agent. Here, the prisoner commander kills a stoolie.<br/><br/>I've gained much respect for our armed forces since my son joined up 3 years ago. Perhaps my thoughts on this film would be different if he wasn't currently serving.<br/><br/>View it with someone in the military you love and see what you (or they) think."

","I just saw this movie and although I went in under duress, I came away having been thoroughly entertained.  This movie was nothing like I expected it to be. What studio ad exec came up with that trailer? It has almost nothing to do with the movie I saw. Bruce Willis is the star in name only. (As his is the only ""household name"" in the cast.) He actually has a supporting role. The star, playing the Hart in the title, is Collin Farrell. An actor apparently thought of so highly despite his having appeared in approx. 3 American films, that he merits 'above the title' billing. I hadn't seen Farrell before, although I have been trying to rent the dvd of ""Tigerland"" for months. (My local store only seems to have 1 copy and it's always out.) He is very good here. I finally get the ""buzz"" surrounding him. This film was chock full of good performances, not the least of which was the German camp commander, Maj. Visser. This film is less a war movie than a courtroom drama set in a POW camp. And while court room dramas tend to be pedantic, they also, when done right, can keep you on the edge of your seat. It was directed by Gregory Hoblitt who managed to do just that with ""Primal Fear"". This movie will lose nothing in the translation if you wait for video or dvd but it will make a dandy Saturday nite rental."

","The movie kept me guessing up to the end as to what decision would be made. American POW's had an amazing escape rate from Nazi stalags/prisons, but plot seems a little forced.  The Nazi Colonel was not a stupid man and it is doubtful that he would overlook the necessity of keeping close track of his many, volatile prisoners.  A comment was made that it was ""highly improbable"" that Lt. Hart & the Nazi Colonel would have both gone to Yale. Check the history records.  Many of Germany's top Nazi officers and numerous Japanese officers attended prestigious colleges in the U.S. prior to World War II.  So it wasn't all unusual to find an American POW and a Nazi Colonel both being alumus of Yale or any other major U.S. college.  Several of the future Nazi officers studied military history at Yale, Princeton, etc.  Of course they failed in a number of cases to learn that American military both with/without college educations can be quite resourceful when facing with imprisonment.  At the height of the war, had the Colonel been so stupid to lose several prisoners, etc. as this one did, the notorious SS would have shown up and likely have executed him on the spot or he would have been sent to war's front line.  I think the willlingness of the Nazi Colonel to go along with farce of a trial was simply a ploy to annoy the American Colonel. They acted like two overgrown boys trying to best each other except they were playing with human lives.  Neither one really cared about what might happen to Lt. Hart or any of the other men."

","MINOR SPOILERS... BEWARE!<br/><br/>It's not often we get to watch a movie where a POW confine consists of such varied mind camps. Irrational mindsets perhaps, but credible! It's not a movie about romantic or gung-ho patriotism, nor is it about national victory. It's not even about the bonds of combat soldiers, or the foolish waste of valuable lives! Hart's War, clearly a `pun' play on the movie title, probes into the segregated cast, cultural and racial prejudices of Stalag 7A characters, as witnessed by a young lieutenant and former law student, seized and thrown into a Nazi POW camp. It examines a person's decision to accommodate one man's needs over a group's. And it brings to light the importance and proper definition of `honor.'<br/><br/>A well thought script, with powerful dialogue, that has kept me totally focused on the screen. The cinematic settings of dreary blue nuances and effective array of pyrotechnics, throughout the film, are coherent to the moods of conspiracy and chilling conflicts. Even the bouts of occasional humor seem necessary to provide momentary relief to the shady, intense and gripping circumstances.  Definitely a powerful drama that is visually attentive to heroism and sacrifice, honor and betrayal!<br/><br/>
This movie is a brilliant capture of a man's conscience and struggle to choose between his morality, his duty to his country, and his life. And it's a sophisticated and compelling tale that doesn't employ judgmentally empathetic imagination. Colin Farrell is superb in his role as the youthful Lt. Tom Hart. Will he become Hollywood's hottest property after this film? I should think so! In fact, the overall ensemble of actors is a fabulous choice for the electrifying roles, each given character with his personal motivation and individual perspective to make the plot work very well. A murder mystery with a racial twist that leads to a court trial under the rules of the Geneva Convention, only to expose the ethics, purposes and hidden agendas of all the characters in a multi-layered plot!  Intriguing, intelligent and definitely mesmerizing! But will the Germans have their last laugh, thinking that their American POWs are backstabbing each other? This film is certainly a must-see to get to the answer."

It is basically about a man who's father is a senator and he is sent to war.  Along the way he gets captured and winds up in a pow camp that is run by a surprisingly forgiving Nazi.  Then two black officers are captured and though they are soldiers, they are given no respect among the men.  One of them dies early in the movie and the other believes it a conspiracy plot from a racist soldier who involuntarily shared barracks with the two men.  When the remaining black officer is found over the corpse of the man he believed to cause his friend's death the guessing game of who is actually the bad guy starts.  There are plot changes and twists that were completely unexpected by me.  But all in all it's about brotherhood and honor, loyalty and trust.<br/><br/>I give the movie a rating of four out of five...mainly because I couldn't (without trailers or outside input) guess the ending.

Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans ¬ñ but for me, it is still all about the cinema.<br/><br/>War, really people, what is it good for? Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film ""Hart's War"", absolutely nothing ¬ñ do you need me to say it again? To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany. No brutality, no murder, no starvation ¬ñ just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other. Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his ""luxury"" suite. He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.<br/><br/>Did I hint towards ""The Great Escape"" ¬ñ please don't think the same thoughts with this film. What makes ""Hart's War"" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers. It comes in the form of Terrance Howard. One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way ¬ñ but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films. It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest. Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, ""You can't handle the truth"", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.<br/><br/>How bland.<br/><br/>""Hart's War"" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time. Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape. It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film. Willis is Willis. If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film. Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp. I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp. Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans? Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?<br/><br/>Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, ""oh brother!"". The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen. It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.<br/><br/>This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions. It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls. For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film. While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum. This is strange, because I loved ""Fallen"" so very much. ""Hart's War"" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.<br/><br/>So, again my friends, I must ask ¬ñ what is war good for? To my reply ¬Ö absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>I cannot suggest this film to friends or family. Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give ""Hart's War"" a<br/><br/>(wait for it ¬Ö) <br/><br/>BLAH!"

Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell), a military attach√©, is captured by Germans via a ruse: Those desperate German soldiers of a dying Reich who speak like Americans and dress in American uniforms. He is sent to POW prison, Stalag VI A in Augsburg, Germany. There he meets German commandant, Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures, in a marvelous performance). <br/><br/>Almost immediately, he is greeted by Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis), the highest ranking prisoner of war in the camp. After sniffing out Hart (Hart's reaction to a most grueling interrogation by Deutsch Officer Lutz), he assigns Hart to an enlisted men's barracks, Building 27, instead of the one for officers. Apparently the Germans did allow the highest ranking POW a degree of power in the encampments. Hart blends in fairly well as he learns the ins and outs of survival, like the value of cigarettes. Before long two African-American Air Force officers, recently captured by the Germans, are placed by McNamara in the enlisted men's quarters. Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford (Cole Hauser) makes no pretense of his displeasure. Not only is Bedford bigoted, but he also knows how to obtain favors from the German guards. <br/><br/>When Bedford is found murdered, suspicion is focused on one of the Negroes, Lincoln Scott (Terrance Howard). The other had already been shot for attempted escape after being set up (by Bedford). With approval of Col. McNamara, Scott is placed on trial by the Americans. The aim of the trial can be seen as a way for Americans to maintain their dignity under trying circumstances. McNamara assigns Hart as Scott's defense council, even though the former has only attained progress as a second-year Yale Law School aspirant. Col. Visser agrees and supports the trial, which consumes much of the second half of the feature. It soon becomes obvious that McNamara is at odds with Hart, and has motives that transcend justice. The privileged Hart has much to learn.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Visser is sympathetic to the lieutenant, with whom he discloses his graduation from Yale back in 1928. He even gives the conflicted Hart a copy of the American Manual for Courts- Martial to assist him. He knows that McNamara ""threw him to the wolves."" Privately he tells Hart that he enjoys American culture, like reading Mark Twain; he also plays his Negro jazz records, a collection that very much relaxes him even though it is ""verboten"" in the Reich. Visser is obviously not a typical nasty Nazi stereotype. <br/><br/>Towards the end we realize that there is a shifting of events: the trial really has nothing to do with Lincoln Scott. Much about the camp was a lie; Bedford was a known snake. There is something larger afloat, an act of greater military importance that is portended earlier. As this is a World War II movie, perhaps this fact should have been expected. But it is distracting to the viewer, and will not work for many. Some may even feel that the story-line is no better than mediocre. <br/><br/>The feature is produced by David Ladd, Alan Ladd's son. The cinematography, with its wintry bluish tone and stark, snowy scenes, works very well. The claustrophobia in each of the unheated barracks can be felt outside of the screen. In this writer's opinion, you can do worse than watch."
"davidbrowningroberts","9","1","2","28 January 2016"," Why are so many people confused by the possibility of this scenario
","As a Disabled Combat War Veteran of The Iraq War it seems fitting that this is my first review. Esp as i am watching the movie as I type this. I won't waste any time or space on explaining the plot as that is easily found elsewhere. <br/><br/>I will say that i think this movie is an incredible depiction of an... Amazing story. A story about war, racism, education, hope, and I BELIEVE, most of all, a movie about the ideas & ideals of A United States Soldier. (Please keep this mind).<br/><br/>I am completely blown away by all of these reviews by people that think the story is so stupid because it would quote... Never happen! Unquote. I am also very disappointed in all of the subsequent reviews stating that the movie is stupid and boring on the premise of its plot alone.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a war movie full of guns and battle scenes then watch a different movie. This is a movie about a prisoner of war camp... There were a lot of gun fights. This is after the battles... In between the waring and the fighting. <br/><br/>And most of all I just want to point out that every review then even once includes the word concentration camp is a complete waste of time. This is not a concentration camp this is a P.O.W. camp. And furthermore it is a German P.O.W. camp not a Japanese. P.O.W. camp. There is a big difference.<br/><br/>So many reviews that implausibility of the movie because the Germans were so nice to them and they would never let this happen... first off, the second apex and inciting incident in the movie is the execution of an American prisoner without cause or conversation.<br/><br/>Also, One of the most poignant facts about this movie is that the German soldier in charge is a Yale educated German. Meaning he spent time in America & understood American ways. Some German officers even did follow the Geneva Convention. & some POWW camps were not strictly execution camps (as were so many P.O.W. camps in the pacific... Now while I have absolutely no citing that this actually ever occurred (the trial w/in the movie) the reason that this makes perfect sense is that this German DID allow it to happen... As so many other German soldiers allowed other random things to happen in other pow movies. Whether it is because he is amused by the entire situation or he is simply trying to pacify the masses and keep the Americans busy... It's simply happens<br/><br/>I think one of the best comparisons to accurately portray this movie would be to the Great escape. As were that movie actually was about the prisoners and their escape plan & what followed. This movie is more about the prisoners...&... Their actual human emotions DURING the plot to escape. Racism during World War Two was real & very serious. Gentrification and separatism were very much alive... Even in... & especially sometimes soldiers minds.<br/><br/>I was especially surprised by some of the professional reviews and how disappointed they were in the finale of the movie. <br/><br/>HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie is not ruined, the plot or any of its points are not discredited, by the idea of, or the subsequent execution of Bruce Willis's character. As I stated in the beginning, this movie is about the ideas and ideals of a soldier. Or perhaps even more so, the ideas and ideals of what the United States Army considers a perfect soldier. The rules in a p.o.w camp were simple... If you try to escape you would be executed.<br/><br/>In the Great Escape almost all of the near dozens of men who participated in the plotting & action of, escaping were rounded up & executed. Which is exactly what is about to happen at the end of this movie. Until Bruce Willis stops it by offering up his life, the life of an officer, for the lives of his men. He is, by the Army's actual manual, every aspect of a hero. Of a true hero. Yes he's racist, No he wasn't exactly open to the idea of lesser educated officers... but not only do both of those thoughts change slightly by the end of the movie... But by sacrificing himself for his men he is, in that single action, showing you, the contrast of Colin Farrell's character & his actions in the opening of the movie. <br/><br/>When Colin Farrell is captured & interrogated, he is only released into the p.o.w camp after he gives up the location of other men other units & equipment locations. One of Bruce Willis's character's biggest problems with Colin Farrell's character throughout the entire movie is that he knows that. He knows Colin Farrell gave up other soldiers, possibly even their lives, for his life to be spared. Now, as immediately as Bruce Willis hates Colin Farrell's character for that, he grows to understand that not all men are the perfect soldier, & that some quote lesser perfect soldiers unquote can sometimes be better men.<br/><br/>This is, VERY SIMPLY Hart's war. Who is worth it? How many men, how many lives, can equal to just one life?<br/><br/>When is sacrificing yourself, or perhaps in metaphor... Sacrificing your very ideas and ideals, your belief system, and therefore your life as it was... Worth it?<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is not just letting a German soldier of shoot him in the head so that he won't execute 50 other men instead. Bruce Willis Is allowing Colin Farrell and all of the men watching, the opportunity to realize that all men can change. And that that change is worth it... If its for the greater good."
"LeonLouisRicci","5","1","2","6 October 2012"," Awkward Attempt
","This is a WWII film that has two things on its mind. The plight of POW's and the inherent racism that existed at the time, even in the military, even when the Black soldiers achieved to the point of becoming aviators and Officers. It seems they could not do anything to prove that they were of equal status.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in this partly successful socio-drama are terrific and realistic, but the conditions in the camp and and the interplay between the Nazi's and the POW's are not. Placing the racial elements in the middle of this movie seems awkward and never does ultimately mean anything and ends up being a fruitless effort of a diversion. <br/><br/>This off hand setup does not help either the entertainment value of the movie or the commentary on segregation, in fact, it demeans any attempt to maintain its progressive message. In the end it is a film that you are rooting for to be better than it is. A salute from the audience that is returned half-heartedly."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","2","30 October 2011"," A different and unique slant on the POW film
","This is a film in desperate search of a genre. It starts off as a classic WW2 thriller, with German ambushes in a snowy landscape and plenty of twists and turns within a short time. It moves into POW camp territory, with varying factions vying for power in a prison territory. Not content to stay there, HART'S WAR then turns into a murder mystery (with added racial commentary) before finally setting on its path as a courtroom drama for the rest of the running time.<br/><br/>The veering from genre to genre gives the film a bit of a disjointed feel, but for the most part I could forgive that because I found this to be an entertaining movie. Colin Farrell, back when he was making an effort to break into stardom and teamed up with bigger actors (Bruce Willis in this, Tom Cruise in MINORITY REPORT), doesn't put a foot wrong and Willis has the liberty to steal all of his scenes as the gruff, grizzled colonel. I've always liked Terrence Howard, too, and he bags a meaty role here.<br/><br/>The film isn't always engaging. Some of it, those cross-over bits inbetween the various genre bits, are rather dull, and there are a few too many CGI warplanes for my liking. But come the end, I was caught up in the story and the characters were the thing that kept me watching, especially as the latter moral dilemma plays out. Okay, so the excruciatingly sentimental ending (yes, it's as bad as the end of LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING) is way over the top, but until then HART'S WAR does its job and makes a refreshing change of pace from the usual wartime heroics."
"kennethcarino","6","1","2","21 January 2010"," Adult and war version of To Kill A Mockingbird
","Hart's War is one of the average movies that doesn't have an original story lines but make you enjoy the movie because of the twists and plot. What I like in this movie is the message about racism in the army. The story is about a lieutenant in a German POW camp asked to defend an African-America man accused of killing another US POW mate. I have seen many courtroom drama and I am pretty sure that this is an adult and violent version of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Even though this is a courtroom-ish drama, this is also a POW story. Like many POW stories we already have a slight idea in our heads how this ends.<br/><br/>About the performance, I'd say they were okay. Colin Farrell's performance is good enough for me. Bruce Willis' one is outstanding.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is likable but it doesn't leave a mark in our minds that makes us remember about this movie in our lifetime."
"AbeStreet","Null","1","2","14 January 2004"," Gritty POW film!
","This movie came and went relatively quickly at the theaters.  I was skeptical to watch it.  I finally rented this film and what a treat.  I am a big fan of WWII films.  As far as POW films go this was on par with STALAG 17 and THE GREAT ESCAPE.  The camp seemed have the same layout as the two movies I mentioned above but the buildings seemed to be worn down and more in line with what a prison camp would be like.  I've spent time in Norway. It seems that you are always in the shadow of some mountain and it creates a dark depressing atmosphere.  I thought the way the director captured the dark winter was just right.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Colin Farrell but thought he did a fine job as did all the actors.  Bruce Willis has worked hard to shed his action image and it has paid off.  For a movie just over 2 hours I think it does quite well to include a murder mystery, racial confrontations, prison escape and a courtroom drama.  This film is well worth a view!  I may try and get the book the film is based on and read it."
"eviled17","Null","1","2","3 October 2003"," Decent movie but loses reality at the end
","First, after reading what others have to say, I'm amazed at how little some of those people know about reality.  I may have an advantage since I'm probably older that most of them, and also I'm retired USAF.<br/><br/>
I never read the book, but I'm hoping it was better at conveying the concepts of duty, honor and courage (the themes supposedly espoused here) than the movie.<br/><br/>Lt Hart's emotions and the way he deals with the issues of race are straight out of the 1990's, not 1945.  This is one place where the screenwriter/director failed.<br/><br/>As far as people's complaints about Willis getting top billing, that's normal, the bigger the name, the bigger the billing.  Comments that the POWs had it too easy?  Sleeping in a wooden hut with all your clothes on, including boots, in a German winter is easy?  Some people have no concept of reality - this was a German POW camp, not Japanese.  This was a fairly accurate portrait of that.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>As for the comments on why escape or why blow the ammo plant because the war was almost over, 2 things come to mind.  First, they are POWs, they have no idea how much longer the war will last, and their DUTY as soldiers is to try to escape.  Second, going back the the fact they are soldiers, blowing the ammo plant is part of what soldiers do, fighting the enemy (and also denying the enemy some ammo that would be shot at fellow Americans!).  The point was made that the US Army thought it was a shoe factory and thus not worth bombing.<br/><br/>The issue of race is more understated than what probably would have happened.  The movie angered me because of the perception that Lt Scott was being railroaded, while at the same time kept me interested because of the interaction between Lt Hart and the Colonel and the German Commandant, and especially the plot twists.<br/><br/>The final plot twist was what took this from being an interesting and engrossing film, to just a Hollywood gimmick, showing that the writer did not understand the American mindset of 1945.<br/><br/>Lt Hart endangered the lives of many men and a mission against the enemy, in order to be noble?  As portrayed, Lt Scott and the Colonel had a far better understanding of the concepts of duty, loyalty, and country.  Lt Hart's motivation was somewhat understandable, if he were a 1990's liberal instead of a soldier in the US Army in WWII.<br/><br/>That's where the movie lost me.  An American Army officer would have done his duty and done as he was ordered, a concept Lt Scott understood, as he was prepared to die for the honor of protecting the 35 other men and the mission against the ammo plant.  The only motivation we see in Lt Hart is his selfish desire to save Lt Scott's life and to atone for his own guilty conscience at breaking when he was interrogated.<br/><br/>What a waste of an ending. The movie had a good story, good plot twists, and a decent concept of the reality of a POW camp and the American and German military at the time.  Then it was wasted with this pathetic ending. Honor, courage, duty, all concepts that most US military officers had, were foreign to the supposed hero of this film."

","This is not the action film that was advertised, but rather a taught drama about the realities of prison camp life in WWII. (Think Stalag 17) The acting is superb; Terrence Howard is a real treat, and Colin Farrel is excellent as always. Bruce Willis gives an understated but outstanding performance. If you're looking for lots of bombs, bullets and blood, this is probably not the war film for you.

","After watching this movie, I was very perplexed. By the next day, I<br/><br/>figured out what bothered me about the movie. In 1965 there was a TV<br/><br/>series called ""Hogan's Heroes"", Starring Bob Crane as a Colonel in a<br/><br/>Nazi POW camp, operated by the infamous Col. Klink, played by Werner<br/><br/>Klemperer. Hart's War reminded me of that TV series, complete with the<br/><br/>home made radio from parts, and the American GI's bartering with the<br/><br/>Germans for various articles of comfort, such as boots, etc. All the<br/><br/>while, the American Colonel Hogan was sabotaging the efforts of the<br/><br/>German war effort.<br/><br/>
The main difference between the TV series and Hart's War, was that the<br/><br/>TV series went on for 168 episodes, and Hart's War ended in just over 2<br/><br/>hours. Hence, the need for the plot twist at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>
There have been a lot of war movies released in the past several years.<br/><br/>Maybe this movie would have been better if it was directed by Steven<br/><br/>Spielberg, and starred Jack Nicholson instead as Col."

","First off, let me say I didn't hate this film, but neither can I give it high marks. It quite simply fails, mostly. It tries to be a war movie, but it isn't really about war. It tries to be a POW movie, but it fails (miserably). It tries to be a movie about racism and there it only partially succeeds, because the setting is just so wrong. The setting is a German Stalag (POW camp). There are Allied prisoners there, both Russian and American. The film is mostly set on the American side of the camp. The German guards are remarkably nice to the American prisoners, which is very unrealistic. Life in the camp is good for the most part and all the Americans look very well-fed (also unrealistic). Then two American fighter pilots, both black, are brought into the camp and the racism part begins. No one wants them in their barracks, which is realistic. One of them is set up by the other prisoners and is summarily executed. The other is then accused of murdering another prisoner. The prisoners are then allowed to hold an American Court-martial! LUDICROUS! No German commander would allow something like this to happen in their camp. He even helps the defending attorney (who had been a Yale law student pre-war). Turns out, the Kommandant is a Yale graduate - how convenient! In short, the entire plot is so full of holes that you could drain spaghetti with it. However, there are a couple of bright spots...look for good performances from Colin Farrell as Hart and Marcel Iures as the Kommandant.

"hodo68","Null","1","2","3 June 2002"," Courtroom drama in POW cage
","I actually found this movie really good at first, it visuals , story etc really seemed to be going places. It concerns a young deskbound officer who is inadvertently captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp in the final months of the Second World War. It is here he is involved in a court martial of a black airman accused of the murder of a fellow white inmate. Unfortunately as the action procedes despite introduction of some interesting plot elements it eventually waters down as a ultimately a routine mating between a courtroom drama/escape movie lacking any emotional depth from the performances.<br/><br/>Having said this there are things to admire in it: The first 15 minutes are so are quite compelling. The capture of the American officer and the killing of his offsider are quite horrific. And the scenes of the chilly winter and the pows transit through it by train & march are quite evocative. I also found from an amateur historian point of view quite surprising for an Hollywood film about captured Americans that at least touches on the appalling treatment of the Russian Pows by the Nazis & the racist philosophy behind it, the Commandant berates the the American Pows for saluting 3 executed Russians saying they are saluting criminals and 'sub-humans'. Likewise the racism of the fellow inmates towards their black comrades is not sanitised. I liked some of the moral ambiguitues of the characters. The young Hart is not really a hero, though he tried he couldn't withstand the interrogation by the Wermacht and revealed information, The Bruce Willis character in spite of his Christ like sacrifice at the end of the film still didnt accord the black officers the protection or respect they deserved. I found most interesting the German commandant as a character, though it wasnt well developed.While his actions are generally brutal there are glimpses that he may not be the total party man- he listens to the bbc, drinks heavily and listens to Jazz (ie racially suspect ) music. Indeed I thought the relationship between him an Bruce Willis could have been developed more. I guess the problem is that the character is both the dedicated (and unlikeable) Nazi and the honorable (likable) military enemy officer and as such any sort of relationship based on mutual respect may seem tainted to the viewer.<br/><br/>For these reasons alone its worth a look. But ultimately it runs out of steam. The old patriotic/self sacrifice ending I'm sorry doesnt wash with me as a film making device. To work I've got to feel some empathy with the characters, and the characters seem too bland, indeed Bruce Willis character inspite of some interesting early ambiguities seems to end up yet another strong silent type. Not enough ummph in the story or performances to qualify as a great film and not enough in it to qualify as an action film - an interesting and worthy attempt though."

","Hart's War is an old-fashioned problem movie.  A problem movie would, under the guise of a popular genre, ""fearlessly confront"" some timely social ill. These weren't necessarily bad films. Movies like The Defiant Ones, In The Heat of the Night and High Noon are great entertainment.  Often, though, the message would trump the medium and the films would practically scream ""Watch me Stupid, I'm good for you!"" Unfortunately Hart's War does its fair share of screaming.<br/><br/>Callow Lt. Hart is a desk-jockey hustler who finds himself in a German POW camp.  Col. McNamara, the senior POW, doesn't like the cut of Hart's jib and assigns him to the enlisted man's barracks as punishment. For less noble reasons two black fighter pilots are also assigned there. The reaction to the pilots is exactly what you might expect and soon the most vicious bigot is dead with one of the pilots standing over the body. Hart has some legal training and is ordered by McNamara to defend the pilot. Every thing seems clear-cut but, of course, there are wheels within wheels.<br/><br/>Hart's War is definitely compelling.  The cinematography and attention to physical detail are magnificent.  The few action scenes are well staged. Indeed, considered as just a wartime mystery movie Hart's War is truly excellent. Where it falls short is with its problem movie aspirations. The film wants to instruct us in the realities of race relations. To really do so it would have to give us three-dimensional characters with all the light and shadows of the human condition.  The message movie rules by which Hart's War operates won't allow that, however.  Human concerns and frailties muddy the message and so, to make sure we ""Get The Point,"" the movie is populated by stereotypes.<br/><br/>The actors do what they can with what they have. Most give pretty interesting performances but some can be seen struggling to rise above the caricatures.  Lt. Hart is a charming sleaze and, in years past, the role would have gone to James Garner or Tony Curtis.  Hart's War is saddled with Colin Farrell. It's not that Farrell is conspicuously horrible; he just doesn't show much spark or personality and never, ever convinces us that he is a W.W.II era officer.  Bruce Willis, on the other hand, looks perfectly comfortable in both period and uniform. Willis has always been underrated as an actor.  His strength is that he is a rock steady performer who doesn't strain for effect. He adds substance to most everything that he's in. He certainly does so in Hart's War.<br/><br/>Terrence Howard plays the accused pilot and does a pretty good job despite his role being less a character than a learning opportunity. European actor Marcel Iures is a standout as the prison camp commandant, a man worn out from ignoring the angels of his better nature. Cole Hauser plays the bigot. He initially does some interesting work but eventually the demands of stereotype overwhelmed his considerable talents.<br/><br/>You can't get angry with Hart's War.  The film works very hard to be entertaining as it tries to shove its message home. It shows a real concern for old time movie craftsmanship. I can recommend the movie but, unless you slept through the Civil Rights era, don't expect to be enlightened by the message."

","Hart's War is a complex drama with two very strong plots.  Both plots ran at the same time with one right out in the open and the second being covered up by the first.  The plot that is out in the open is events that lead up to a murder and trial of a black aviator in a German POW camp.  This takes most of the film and becomes boring as this is a plot line that has been shone many times before.  I feel this would have been much more entertaining if they had chosen a different set of events to cover up the hidden plot. <br/><br/>

","Review written by:  an average middle-class white American suburban Joe (a film intellectual)<br/><br/>If you love Arnold Schwarzenegger/Bruce Willis shoot-em-up action movies (such as Die Hard) with more violence than plot, storyline and value, then THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.  YOU'LL LOVE IT.<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, fans of those kind of movies can stop reading here.  Intellectuals read on.<br/><br/>This movie is TERRIFFIC.  Without giving away too much, I will tell you that this is one of those movies whose preview did not accurately portray this movie for what it actually is.  Perhaps that was the filmmakers' intent: to get a bunch of fans of violent movies to buy tickets, only to be completely shocked by something totally different.  The movie's trailer portrayed it as an action movie about a last-chance effort to escape a Nazi concentration camp.  That's misleading; the movie was intellectually stimulating, took unexpected twists and turns throughout (which NONE of them were predictable).  Unlike most Hollywood movies, you COULD NOT predict where this one was going:  not looking at it's poster or preview, not ¬º of the way into it, not even ¬æ of the way to the ending.<br/><br/>The plot:  some US soldiers are captured during WWII by the Germans and sent to a POW camp.  It's funny that while there, even in the camps, their authority structure remains intact (Colonel, Lieutenant, soldier, etc.) although of course all Americans, regardless of rank, are under the authority of the Germans running the camp.  Anyway, all the Americans are white, until two black pilots from the only `colored' air force are shot-down and captured, then sent to live in the all-white barracks that are full of white bigots.<br/><br/>One of the black pilots is framed for having a weapon underneath his bed, and upon inspection from the Nazis, one is found.  The penalty for a POW having a weapon?  The Nazis execute him.  But the weapon was put there by the bigot white who wanted him to die.  When the other black pilot finds this out, he avenges his friend's death by killing the white man who arranged the frame.<br/><br/>So Bruce Willis's character, Hart, steps in, asking the Nazi colonel for the remaining black man's right to a trial instead of being hung immediately for killing the white man.  A trial about racism inside a Nazi concentration camp?  You'd think that you could predict where the movie would go from there, turning into a morality play, but you'd never guess accurately. Now go see it yourself.<br/><br/>It's obvious that this is not one of those films that was written, filmed, and edited in two years like Charlie's Angels or some other garbage.  This film had the quality and depth that it takes four or more years to produce.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is that in some scenes the Nazi colonel is less racist than the bigoted Americans!  Now what a statement about segregated American society in the 1940s!  Us white people in that era were as racist as the Nazis we were fighting against!<br/><br/>One problem I had with this movie:  it's portrayal of Nazis is not at all the way that they have been portrayed in typical WWII movies.  In fact, the Nazi colonel is in fact NICE to many of the American POWs.  Now how realistic is that?  I wasn't a soldier in or even alive during WWII, but I think that a real Nazi would've put the black man to death outright without a trial.  And he wouldn't have taken any attitude from any of the Americans, which he does throughout the movie.  Still, a `nice' Nazi was needed for this film to show us white Americans that we were more racist than the Nazis in that era.  There are some teriffic lines of dialog about this not given here to spoil it.  Another example of unrealism is that this Nazi is an educated man from Yale who likes Black American jazz music.<br/><br/>The acting is FLAWLESS.  Colin Farrell, a newcomer to Hollywood who plays S. Lt. Hart, is (to quote Roger Ebert's review of this movie in the Chicago Sun-Times), `obviously destined for stardom.'  And Willis plays a convincing army commander, one of the best performances of his life.  The actor playing the Nazi is incredible as well, as well as the two black pilots.<br/><br/>Now a technical detail: the sound.  See it in a good THX-certified theater with 5.1-channel surround sound.  My review of it's sound is completely dependent on your seeing it in a theater with 5.1-channel digital surround sound.  There were a few fly-by effects into the speakers to your sides or behind you, but since this is mostly a drama and not a fighting movie, there weren't many of them.  However, as characters walked out of a room exiting a scene, doors closed behind them in the right or left channels, adding a degree of dimensionality/spaciality to the sound as if you were watching this as a play on a Broadway stage.  Dialog was clearly audible (although, again, this is dependent on your seeing it in a theater with digital surround sound and preferably THX-certified).  Music was ambient, with quite a bit in the rear speakers, adding to the depth of the drama.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD:  Perhaps the best thing about this movie is it's portrayal of honor and sacrafice.  My rating:  8.5 out of 10!  I think we're talking the 2003 Oscars here.<br/><br/>P.S.:  For those of you who've seen the movie:  wouldn't it be interesting if a remake was done, reversing races so that everyone that was black in the original is white in the re-make, and vice-versa?  It wouldn't be historically accurate, of course, but to see the original and then the remake back-to-back would be an interesting statement about racial double standards in our society."
"dbdumonteil","4","2","8","22 December 2004"," mission: escape
","The American film-maker Terrence Malick is sometimes nicknamed ""Hollywood's beautiful loser"" due to his large absence. I think it is unfair. It is true that Malick's filmography isn't very dense but his movies are much better than Gregory Hoblit's. I would (sadely) grant without hesitation the quoted nickname to Hoblit. After a first promising movie ""Primal Fear"" (1996) which owed a lot to Edward Norton, this director kept on discrediting himself throughout each movie he made. It is not this war movie ""Hart's War"" (2002) that will try to show the contrary.<br/><br/>I am writing to the people who didn't see this film. If you think that you deal with a war movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) well you are wrong. ""Hart's War"" is a war movie without war! There's the share of shootings and explosions at the beginning of the movie but after that, the movie especially focuses on psychological tensions between the American soldiers. On another hand, the main star isn't Bruce Willis as the poster suggests but Colin Farrell who offers a quite impressive performance but his character remains too confined in Hollywood conventions to be really terrific. To come back to Bruce Willis, during the most important part of the film, we wonder what is his real function in the story. The answer only appears at the end of the movie (it obeys to Hoblit's will to keep the best till last) and I won't reveal it.<br/><br/>What is wrong with ""Hart's War""? Simply, this movie is handicapped with glaring implausibilities which deals a severe to the credibility of the plan.<br/><br/>First the action of the film takes place in the beginning of 1945. It isn't the ideal time for this kind of story for the simple and good reason that the Second World War was almost finished in Europe. For German troops, it was the debacle and they didn't hesitate in setting the American soldiers free from the camps in which they were imprisoned.<br/><br/>Then, the Nazis were keen on Hitler's racist theses contending the supremacy of the Aryan race and the extinction of the Jews, the black etc... But if the black American soldier was charged with murder, why didn't they kill him instead of letting Willis organizing a real trial for him? I think Hoblit tried to avoid a tempting caricature towards the German soldiers and to grant them a little light of humanity. But it is hard to believe that one of the German leaders studied in Yale and is fond of Afro-American jazz music.<br/><br/>In another extent, the director offers a neutral and sanitized image of life of American prisoners in the camp. We see American prisoners playing cards, ball or having fun (whereas beside them there are Russian prisoners who are working). However, it is certain that life in those camps was tough and German soldiers were surely manhandling their prisoners.<br/><br/>As for the trial, I think it is only of minor interest and Hoblit has no hesitation in denouncing racial injustices through the lieutenant Lincoln A Scott. Behind this trial, an escape plan is setting in motion and it is a hare-brained one: how did the Americans manage to find the useful tools to dig their tunnel? By the way, the movie wouldn't be full without the inevitable (and very American) final moral which ends up tarnishing Hoblit's work.<br/><br/>What have we got at the end? A poor war movie with an artificial construction and where the politically correct is ""de rigueur"". It also testifies a sadder thing: the (definitve?) loss of a talent: Gregory Hoblit."
"SimonJack","9","1","3","19 November 2015"," Gritty WW II POW film is among the best
","""Hart's War"" is a WW II Prisoner of War film based on a novel by John Katzenbach. The film apparently differs quite a bit from the book. It isn't the equal of ""Stalag 17"" of 1953 or ""The Great Escape"" of 1963. But it comes close, and it introduces a couple of new aspects rarely covered in POW films. Those are interrogation before prisoner assignment to a POW camp, and racism among the American prisoners. <br/><br/>The clich√© ‚Äì all is not what it seems, surely applies to this film. Hart's War is a gripping war movie about the Allied prisoners in a Nazi POW camp. I think it does rival ""Stalag 17"" for intensity and intrigue. The situations are somewhat different, especially with the racism aspect. It's a solid, dramatic story that includes several issues -- patriotism, freedom, brotherhood, race, betrayal, sacrifice, murder and military leadership. And that's just among the prisoners. The Germans who run the camp don't stand out beyond the commandant. <br/><br/>This is a great story that to the very end may have you in doubt, as it did me. Had I known the outcome before watching this movie, I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much. So, I recommend that those who haven't seen it yet not read reviews that give the plot away. The best appreciation of this film comes from seeing it through the eyes of Colin Farrell's character. As the movie unfolds, we see and associate with his feelings, his dismay, his confusion, his anger and his disbelief. <br/><br/>""Harts War"" is a powerful statement about honor, courage, integrity and leadership. No one can ever forget the ending. The cast excel throughout the film. Bruce Willis is the ranking Allied POW ‚Äì Col. William McNamara. Farrell is the newly arrived POW, Lt. Thomas Hart. Romanian actor Marcel Iures is camp commandant, Col. Werner Visser. Terrence Howard is Lt. Lincoln Scott. Each stands out in his role, and the rest of the cast are superb. <br/><br/>This movie makes an excellent 21st century addition for any serious World War II film library."

This movie offers each main character ‚Äì even the Nazis ‚Äì the opportunity to play the role of potential hero and villain, and you get to decide whose side you are on.

","Fundamentally, Hart's War (2002) is an action drama, and not a WW2 action flick; the adventurous element is almost absent. So it resembles the aforementioned legendary '60s WW2 action classics by its shape more than by the content. As shape, it could of been made in the '60s; as content, it couldn't (as it is a politically correct sermon).Hart's War (2002) is a movie for boys, nicely shot, well scored ,thrilling, gripping (surprisingly so for a very conventional action drama), promoting virile values. It addresses primarily, I believe, an adolescent audience. The final frame, in the POW camp, after Iure≈ü' justice was done, and with the touching music, is impressing. It also speaks the language of the loftiest thing, and so it is also more refreshingly that it does so in an action drama¬óit remembers that class of acts that humans presumably hold most dear¬óthe act that is predicated of St. Joan of Arc, of the medieval bourgeois (from Callais) that were much later sculpted by Rodin, of St. MM Kolbe also, of Vulc√£nescu .This kind of fills the heart, warms it as well. A brave person offers his life for those of the others. A scriptwriter remembered that this is sometimes the salutary resort. The movie deserves the status of a lesser classic. <br/><br/>I've seen Hart's War (2002) firstly in a phase when I was eager to see as many Willis films as were available. I remember enjoying a lot this one. Yet Willis' role isn't one of his defining ones. Not the best introduction to his acting abilities (which are primarily comical). I thought Iure≈ü very good too (probably much better than Willis).

Wasn't he disturbed by a homier officer, which combined the Nazi lieutenant? Hart is trying to create an island of justice in a chaotic world, but providing information to the Nazis makes him guilty, and McNamara rightly hidden the tunnel from his knowledge. Not knowing the real reasons for the trial doesn't justify consulting with the Nazi, that might have unknown intentions. The movie presents Hart as the real hero and shows McNamara as a racist, who is willing to give away the colored guy.

In this film, the German captors are so liberal in their dealings with the POWs that it looks as if the American soldiers would've been better off in the Nazi POW camps living in the comforts of comfy beds, hot food and slacking off in their compounds rather fighting in the forests of Ardenne watching their toes falling off from frostbite.  We all know that Nazi Germany was losing the war by late 1944 and they were in extreme shortage of supplies.  In the winter of 1944/45, many of their troops even died of starvation.  But according to this film, the POW camps must've been among Nazi Germany's top priority... Seeing that the our heroes are getting by so easily under the ""tyranny"" of the Nazis, you never feel for the main characters.  Rather, you even sympathize with the Germans not being able to control their own prisoners. The American POWs are always complaining to their captors ""under the Geneva convention, we have rights for this,.. for that...."", etc..<br/><br/>
Putting aside the incredible misrepresentation of history, this film also has very slow pace in developing the story that in the end proves to be a lost effort.  The great cast and commendable acting by both Bruce Willis and Colin Ferril are the only bright spot for this film."

","There's scarcely a believable moment in `Hart's War,' a World War II POW-drama that concentrates more on the internecine squabbles among the American prisoners than on the conflict between the captives and the captors.  Such an approach might have lent the film a certain amount of uniqueness and distinction had director Gregory Hoblit not driven it into the ground by turning the whole thing into a long, windy gabfest.  Indeed, except for a few promising actions scenes at the beginning, most of the film boils down to endless conversations between various characters and a tedious, drawn out courtroom drama that defies credibility even from the outset.  <br/><br/>Even though Bruce Willis receives top billing in the credits, it is really Colin Farrell who earns both the lead and title character role as Lieutenant Thomas W. Hart, a somewhat pampered officer who has managed to rise in the ranks and to avoid real combat duty thanks to his influential daddy back home.  Riddled with guilt at everyone's seeming recognition of his own inexperience and cowardice, Hart soon finds himself a surprise prisoner-of-war in a German camp in 1944 Belgium.  There he is forced to finally prove both his mettle and his manhood when a couple of recently downed black army officers are placed into the prisoners' barracks.  Racial tensions quickly erupt leading to the deaths of two of the men under Hart's command.  Willis plays Colonel McNamara, a West Point careerist who, frustrated by his inability to participate in the `real war' happening outside, decides to wage a little war of his own inside the camp, using his very own men as pawns and weapons ¬ñ even going so far as to allow an innocent man to die ¬ñ in order to achieve his ends.<br/><br/>Beyond the fact that the trial itself seems highly improbable given both the setting and the circumstances in which the characters find themselves, the director just never seems to be able to generate any real dramatic tension either in the conflicts among the prisoners themselves nor from the threat posed by the German commandants and guards, who seem far too weak, befuddled and accommodating to be very convincing as real life Nazis.  Despite the personal agonies experienced by many of these characters, the audience always remains outside the film's emotional circle, becoming little more than disinterested, detached observers.  We never feel much personal stake in the movie's outcome.  Part of the blame goes to the bland performances by Willis and Farrell (who is much more effective in Steven Spielberg's `Minority Report.'), neither of whom register much beyond surface expressions.  But the majority of the blame goes to the writers and to the director for allowing the film to become so inert, plodding and tedious that we lose all interest in what they are presenting.<br/><br/>Despite its salutary dedication to the values of courage, honor and self-sacrifice, `Hart's War,' turns out to be a battle not worth fighting."

","Remarkable historical accuracy. There really was a battle of the Bulge in WW2.
Correct weather conditions, they put even the ravine of murdered american prisoners in the movie. Everything started well and especially looked in a perverse way fascinating and brutal for start.
After capturing the american soldiers and settling them on to the prisoners camp, rest of the movie was practically handsome guys smoking cigarettes and looking at each others for 90 minutes. The music in the film is mediocre compared to ""Platoon"" or ""Deer hunter"", but after watching there will be still considerable amount of cliches to be remembered, like a ridiculous amount of military salutes. There was a cultivated nazi who later showed his true nature, incredible cruelty. On the other hand, there was an american who at first glimpse looked hard-boiled, but in the end had a great heart. Sounds familiar?
The sense of realism collapsed when the trial started. You know, same kind of trial what we see every day in the american tv-series with the legal jargon ""prosecutor"", ""Your honor"", ""Objection!"" etc. (I have to admit however that the idea of trial in POW camp is fresh, like the theme of racism.)
Sorry, production team and fans of Colin Farrell, I simply could not swallow this. The film dropped to Hollywood coulisse soap-opera, prisoners spend leisure time in a cozy theatre, there was way too much cigarettes, too many grammophones, there was absolutely no sign of prisoner camp misery or shortage. (Also letters were written to the american families (?!), that feels silly when you start to think about it. At that time nazis really were worried about post delivery...)
Unexpectable endng: Bruce Willis returns to the camp after escaping, in german officer's uniform!

","I have to confess that one of the main reasons I was anxious to see Hart's War was because I was in the Czech Republic when it was being filmed there. I had hoped for glorious images of the beautiful countryside that I had seen last May. Because the majority of the film takes place in a POW camp (therefore a studio set) there is very little of the Czech landscape to be seen in this film. The film does offer a view of the American landscape from the not-so-distant past by focusing on racial conflict among U.S. military personnel during World War II.<br/><br/>I had expected a film in the tradition of Stalag 17 or The Great Escape. While there are elements of these films here, the heart of the film is closer to A Soldier's Story or Men of Honor. The film actually weaves together several different stories and is part hero's quest, part racial conflict, part courtroom drama, and part POW film. It is to the credit of director Gregory Hoblit (not Hobbit-different film) that the different threads come together reasonably well.<br/><br/>Initially, the film is about Captain Hart (Colin Farrell) and the circumstances surrounding his arrival at the POW camp. Because of a conflict with the senior officer (Bruce Willis) among the POW's, he is placed in a barracks with the enlisted men. He is just getting to know them and win their trust when two more officers are placed in the barracks-two black pilots who are part of the Tuskegee Airmen. The other enlisted men resent their presence there and the racial tension results in a betrayal, a murder, and ultimately the framing of an innocent man.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film is the irony of the U.S. involvement in fighting the evil perpetrators of the holocaust while tolerating ""ethnic cleansing"" at home in the U.S. In one of the more powerful scenes, one of the black officers tells the story of watching German POW's in the US being escorted into movie theaters where blacks were not allowed-not even blacks training to be Tuskegee airmen.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was very good and the visual elements were solid. The Rachel Portman score added just the right touches at just the right times. There are points where the drama is a bit contrived, and I have mixed feelings about the twists and turns at the end of the film. On the whole, however, if your only other options are a seventh viewing of Lord of the Rings, yet another thoughtless shoot-em-up, or Britney Spears in her screen debut, Hart's War is definitely worth a look."

","The movie itself is very good. The story is very refreshing and something new beyond all those WW2 movies with nearly the same plot. The only disturbing thing, especially because i'm from a German speaking country, is that there are nearly no German actors. Marcel Iures is Romanian, Radek Kuchar is Czech or Dugald Bruce Lockhart is Scot. That's pretty annoying if you're watching the movie in English, because when they're speaking in German, you can hardly understand them, because they've got their accents in it. So probably bad casting? Maybe, but nevertheless they are good in their roles, especially Marcel Iures. But it would have been great if they'd considered some of the great German speaking actors. So 3 points deduction for that, but all in all a good movie."

A court martial held within a German Prisoner of War Camp during World War 11 shall possibly allow for sabotage and eventual escape.<br/><br/>Prejudice was certainly alive and well within the armed forces during the conflict. We see how imprisoned minority officers couldn't stay with their own and the Germans viewed this with pleasure, citing the hypocrisy of the Americans- advocating liberty while pursuing prejudice.<br/><br/>When one of the black men is killed by a racist white soldier, mayhem breaks out and when the latter is murdered, it is assumed that the black surviving soldier carried out the dastardly deed. A trial takes place with the Germans looking on with glee.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is terrific here as the head of the group ultimately paying the price and he is equally matched by Colin Farrell, a soldier, who serves as the attorney for the defendant despite the fact that he hasn't received his law degree as yet."

","Since about 1975, films about World War II have not been as popular as they were in the three decades following the end of the conflict, although there have been occasional attempts to resurrect the genre. ""Hart's War"", dating from 2002, represents a return to a particular sub-genre of the war film, the prisoner of war drama once represented by the likes of ""The Wooden Horse"", ""The Colditz Story"" ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""The Great Escape"".<br/><br/>The action takes place in the winter of 1944/45. The title character is Lieutenant Thomas Hart, a young American officer captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge and taken to a prisoner of war camp. In civilian life Hart was a law student at Yale, and although he is not yet a qualified lawyer he is ordered by Colonel William McNamara, the senior American officer in the camp, to undertake the defence of Lieutenant Lincoln Scott, a black airman accused of murder. (The German Commandant has agreed that Scott may have a court-martial under American military law).<br/><br/>The murdered man was Sergeant Vic Bedford, a racist with a vicious hatred of blacks, and it is assumed that Scott killed him in revenge for his part in the death of another black officer, Lieutenant Archer. (Archer was shot by the Germans after a tent spike, which could be used as a weapon, was found in his bunk, and Scott believes that Bedford planted it there). Scott, however, denies responsibility for Bedford's death and Hart sets about defending him to the best of his ability. Hart, however, becomes suspicious of McNamara, who is acting as president of the court, and begins to believe that he may have his reasons for wanting Scott found guilty. A complicating factor is that Hart suffers from feelings of guilt after revealing intelligence to the Germans under interrogation.<br/><br/>Traditional POW movies could be divided into two categories. The first category, like ""The Wooden Horse"", were pure adventure stories concentrating on the theme of escape. The second, exemplified by the likes of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""King Rat"", were character-driven dramas which concentrated on more serious themes. Some, like ""The Great Escape"", included elements of both types.<br/><br/>""Hart's War"" is another film which attempts to straddle both categories. In the first half it appears to be a psychological character drama concentrating on the theme of racism in the US military. This could have been an interesting subject. Black servicemen joined the Armed Forces to serve a country which treated them as second-class citizens in peacetime, only to find that they were treated as third-class citizens in wartime by their white brothers-in-arms, who often hated them more than they did the enemy.<br/><br/>This first half is well done; we get to see that Bruce Willis (as McNamara) can play something other than ""Die Hard"" type action heroes and we get a good sense of the hardships suffered by the POWs at this time. With the war almost over, Germany was desperately short of food and virtually everything else, and feeding enemy prisoners was not a high priority of the Nazi leadership, especially as the winter of 1944/45 was a particularly hard one. (I did, however, think it was unlikely that the German authorities would tolerate the prisoners putting on a show which openly mocked their country and the Nazi leadership).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film goes downhill in the second half as it turns from a study of racism into an escape story. We learn, among other revelations, that McNamara knows full well that Scott is innocent, because he killed Bedford, an informer for the Germans, himself. Unknown to Hart and the other participants, the trial is merely an elaborate charade to cover up a plan by McNamara and a group of other prisoners to escape and destroy a nearby munitions plant, and McNamara seems unconcerned that this charade might result in the execution of an innocent man.<br/><br/>This part of the film became unconvincing and difficult to follow; there is an attempt at a discussion of the meaning of duty and the ethics of war, but this is too muddled to be really enlightening. ""Hart's War"" is one of those films which starts strongly but finishes weakly, and in this it resembles the Robert Redford vehicle ""The Last Castle"", another film from the early 2000s about soldiers in captivity. It is in nothing like the class of the great POW dramas such as ""The Great Escape"" or ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". 5/10"

","I knew the leading actor, that this was a war film, and how many stars the critics gave it, but it was up to me to try it, from director Gregory Hoblit (Frequency, Untraceable). Set in World War II, law student Lt. Thomas W. Hart (Colin Farrell) is captured by the Germans after a battle and put in a German Stalag Prison camp. He joins many other POWs (Prisoner of War), including the troops led by Col. William A. McNamara (Bruce Willis), quietly waiting to pounce on the enemy, and escape the camp. Soon the soldiers are joined by two African American pilots who from a crashed plane, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Terrence Howard) and Lt. Lamar T. Archer (Vicellous Reon Shannon), and the other take an instant racist dislike. In the middle of the night, Archer is murdered, giving McNamara the chance to get his plans in motion, but obviously Hart wants to find the man guilty. When Scott is accused of the murder, Hart demands a court case to both find him innocent and prove it was a white man responsible. Of course Hart doesn't realise the murder is a cover up to get an escape under way, and when McNamara is discovered as the murderer, it is hard to end the case. But in the end, the escape plan is discovered, and Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) holds McNamara fully responsible, which of course he is, and allows himself to get shot, Scott is found innocent, and of course three months later the war ends. Also starring Cole Hauser as Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford, Linus Roache as Capt. Peter A. Ross, Rory Cochrane as Sgt. Carl S. Webb and Michael Weston as Pfc. W. Roy Potts. I can see what the critics mean with Willis not being used enough, Farrell makes a reasonable lead with his not too bad American accent, and Iures gets his moments as the German Lt., it's not a brilliant war film, but you can try it if you want to. Worth watching, at least once!"

MacNamara (Willis) doesn't trust him - so they make so much of the Commandant being a Yale man - he may be old and tired and distraught because he has lost his son, but he, like MacNamara, is still fighting a war he wants to win because he takes his position as a soldier seriously. Visser, the Commandant, tries to get close to Hart because he suspects there might be more to learn. Maybe not about him, but about the camp itself.<br/><br/>Although the story takes place very quickly, and it is late in the war, there is no mention of escape attempts - it's all too clean that way. Visser is supposed to be a deep-thinking character - he always knew about the friendly trading between guards and prisoners, and he always suspected more - this was a chance to learn it.<br/><br/>I watched ""The Last Castle"" within days of seeing this movie - both are about prisons, with brutal though deep-thinking men in charge of those prisons. Their chief reason for doing anything strange - like allowing the POW's to stage a trial - is to manipulate them. They are given their sense of freedom, but it is just an illusion. Suppose the trial ended with a verdict of ""not guilty""? Were the German guards bound to that decision? They were always in charge, at least in their minds. MacNamara makes a huge gamble hoping that the commandant will agree to the court martial, because he would not give up the opportunity to manipulate the prisoners.

Also, they crammed two characters into one. In the novel, the Commandant is Oberst von Reiter. There is the chief of security at the camp who is Hauptmann Heinrich Visser, who has only one arm.

","This film went straight to being a rental in Finland. Maybe because it did poorly in the States. The beginning is good, but sadly the ambush scene doesn't really set the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Instead we get a familiar POW-camp-thing. Generally the acting is good (especially the German commandant, oberst Wisser). Brucie does his thing as usual, and Mr. Farnell looks a bit too frightened all the time. Maybe because he is supposed to be a senator's son...<br/><br/>Looking back, some of the twists in the plot are ridiculous. For instance, the Hitler-parody at the theatre and the trial itself. Although it is possible that the commandant may have been studying at Yale in 1928...<br/><br/>But all things considered, an acceptable movie. The best part was obviously how the black soldiers were treated in the US Army. Quite realistic. A bit too patriotic for my test, but without unnecessary violence."

","I was impressed with the trailer of this movie if only because we havent seen any decent WW2 flicks since SPR and Thin Red Line. It's almost hard to describe this as a war movie though because action sequences are limited. We have a memorable scene with the P-51 attack on a railroad site crammed with American POWs. Apart from the beginning there isnt much.<br/><br/>
The storyline is rather weak and contrived as well. We have a US lieutenant acting as a lawyer for shot down black officer who is suspected of murder in the camp. Is it just me or is this ridiculous? First of all, its a German camp, do you think any Kommandant would allow such liberties as this trial? Surely any 'suspects' would have been hung or shot anyway. And the Kommandant himself, though very well played, smooth, charming, when we first see this man he is indulging in a bit of gallows humour (literally) then he seems to metamorphise into some sort of kind, chilled out Stalag kommandant who allows US troops to hold a trial! However, I did admire the effort to portray the white US troops as racist rednecks which many were. They were a lot more brutal towards black soldiers than the Germans ever were, both in this film and in real life.<br/><br/>The shooting the bread scene seemed quite unbelievable as well. The desire of the men to destroy a neighbouring shell factory seems silly as well, given the devastation of bombing already inflicted on the industries of Nazi Germany by Dec, 1944. The camp conditions seemed reasonably accurate. Lets not forget that American/British troops were generally well treated by the German authorities, unlike the poor Russians. Willis performed decently enough though I think Colin Farrell deserved a better script. why is it that theres no POW based films that can tackle a subject without having some grandiose escape/tunnel backdrop. Most POWs accepted their fate, particularly at this stage of the war We've seen it before in 60s war films. So a lack of originality runs throughout the film.<br/><br/>Plus points would be the dark, brooding atmosphere, helped of course by the eternal swish of snow and the gloomy Northern European winter. The uniforms and weapons seemed up to date too unlike past WW2 films where any old piece of kit would do (i.e. 1950s American tanks as Tigers in 'Battle of the Bulge'). A few decent action scenes at the beginning but disappointingly leading to a predictable (to me anyway!) ending. Still though, worth a look on video/DVD."

","Colin Farrell plays Lt. Hart, a p.o.w. (and law school graduate) in a German Camp.  He is forced to defend one of his fellow prisoner's by the commanding officer of the prisoner's when the man is accused of murdering one of the fellow prisoners.  All of the court-room drama is designed to hide the attempts by the prisoner's to do their country proud. <br/><br/>
The pacing of the movie was well done.  It rarely dragged and both the outside war scenes and the court room intrigue kept the interest level high. The movie had a multiple levels of war throughout as there was the obvious war going on outside the camp, as there was multiple ones inside the camp dealing with racism and betrayal.<br/><br/>Performances were excellent by all involved.  Colin Farrell continues to impress and Bruce Willis, as the commanding officer of the inmates, continues to show how he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood."

","Hart's War was a pleasantly surprising World War II film. As one who generally tries to stray from the blood and guts of war movies, I listened to a friend's advice and checked this movie out. It was more like a courtroom drama than I was expecting√Ç‚Ä¶comparable to A Few Good Men. Bruce Willis and Collin Ferrel gave compelling performances, and often had the audience at odds with themselves, struggling over whether to love or hate the characters. I would encourage all to see this film, whether on video/dvd, or I heard that it will be out on pay per view in a few days."

","Lt. Hart is in a Nazi prison camp near the end of WWII.  The prisoners in there have a trial for a new black prisoner that is wrongly accused of murder.  I enjoyed the movie a lot, however unrealistic it may have seemed. Yes, the chances of a prisoner in a Nazi prison camp being allowed to conduct a trial may seem farfetched.  But the action is compelling and definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A friend of mine told me that the movie is coming out on payperview in two weeks!  I need to see the movie again because i think its one of those movies that you need to see more than once. Ciao!"

","It's a funny thing when... immediately following the movie your ready to give this a 9/10, and then reality hits and suddenly you have this silly aftertaste in your mouth.  I came to this silly conclusion and I pondered the movie for the last 7 hours.  The movie is extremely emotionless.<br/><br/>I had a hard time trying to figure out who to root for.<br/><br/>(spoilers??)<br/><br/>1.  Thomas Hart... perhaps the only actor in the movie is without a doubt the only person propelling the plot. 2.  William oh whats his name.  (Bruce Willis)... the way the trailer runs and most of the hype... he's the main character.  But his name's not Hart. 3.  I had 2 characters to root for in this movie.  And they weren't Bruce. There was Thomas Hart and our guy from The Peacemaker.  Nothing like figuring for most of the movie that the Nazi perhaps is a nice guy and William's a total loser.  Which he is except the last minute of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie really fails at telling any story except the trial.  So bado's for the script.  But it does have it's high of watching while your enjoying the film.  It is fascinating to watch.  But there is no suspense in this movie.  It may totally bore the sh** out of some people.  So my advice to you is..  Don't watch this movie expecting much if your 1.  a bruce willis fan 2.  A WWII movie fan . and 3 know absolutely nothing about what this story is based off of.  The dvd gives us no historical lesson here.<br/><br/>The dvd itself is a marvel of stupidity.  Giving the widescreen a 2 layer event with special features and failing to do it for those who like p/s. Course I like widescreen over p/s (pain & scream) but really...  why tick off those who like p/s?  The only plus of course with MGM's take on p/s is that the p/s side is single layer.  Hence no pause in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Quality: 2/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10"

","We have it all here... we have the obligatory Nazi Commandant, a man who is too old and tired for fighting, but not as funny as Klink. We have our equivalent of Schultz.

It never says anything to us, the viewer. It just went nowhere. Although some who have commented here thought it was a surprise ending, it wasn't. It was predictable and, sadly, boring.<br/><br/>The visuals were pretty, but hasn't the Nazi POW Camp theme been done to death? Obviously, I'm intrigued by the theme or I wouldn't have rented the DVD, but this movie was two hours of background for two minutes of meaningless nobility.<br/><br/>Sad, really."

","This movie has been greatly misunderstood.  What does it mean to be a soldier? A warrior?  A hero?  World War II was America's most challenging endeavor and the first test of its emerging warrior class. In war, there are two combatants.  On either side, there are two types of soldiers; Draftees and Career soldiers. The issues of equality, race etc. has absolutely nothing to do with this film.  This movie is about differences between Career Soldiers and the draftees.  To the draftees, war is merely a game.  To the career soldiers, Col's William A. McNamara and Werner Visser, soldiering is not a game.  It is a deadly serious profession, even in the POW camp. This movie should touch the Hart of anyone who has been in harm's way or has family that has been in military service."

This guy looks like a PERFECT Bullseye. A bit young looking, but I'm sure that he will be great.  And Bruce Willis was good, but the role given was not one that he could take much further then he did.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, a war movie, shortly before the end of WW2, but instead of being on the battle field it takes place at a POW camp .

","The movie was entertaining throughout with several interesting plot twists.  However, The plot seemed somewhat contrived.  It almost seemed as if the writer wanted to create the most captivating situation possible. What are the most trilling stories? War? Prison? Trial by Jury? Racial conflicts?  This movie has them all.  ""Hey, let's make a movie about one of the most infamous and pivotal war in recent history.  And just to make things even more interesting, the story will take place in a Nazi prison camp.  And just to make things even MORE exciting let's throw in a Military Trial.  To top things off, let's throw a racial conflict into the plot."" It worked for the most part. The movie was very enjoyable except for a few nagging points.  The first thing that really irritates me is the willingness of the Nazi Colonel to go along with the whole Trial.  Now, I was not in WWII, nor any other war for that matter, but it seems a little suspicious that the leader of a prison camp would allow any power to be taken from him and given to the prisoners. This just screams stupidity.  Also, there is the minor ""coincidence"" that both Ltd. Hart and the Colonel both went to Yale.  I'm not saying that it is impossible, but highly improbable.  The last is the little plot twist at the end.  I'm not going to give it away, but it reeked of selfless sacrifice that is all warm and fuzzy, but it seemed completely unrealistic.<br/><br/>The movie was for the most part an edge-of-your seat thriller, but It is by no means a classic movie, nor even a classic war movie.<br/><br/>
