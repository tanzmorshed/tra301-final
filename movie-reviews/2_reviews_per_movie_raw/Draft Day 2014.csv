","Give Kevin Costner a good human-interest role and he can bring his unique star power making it both entertaining and compelling. As an adult I've grown less enamored with pro football and in fairness I'm from Alabama where college football is all it can be and pro isn't a factor. That said, it's the corporate money machine mentality that, in my humble opinion, soils the things I fondly remember of the ancient NFC/AFC of the sixties (where loyalty trumped money often for an entire career). <br/><br/>Well, this movie makes that big-business drama work as something much more human. Where the general managers struggle like desperate children for some kind of immediate better future. When even in the last hours those gilded picks are subject to human-error and wild scrambling per last minute decisions and deals. The kind of deals that come not just from statistics, but deeper beliefs. I'd say Draft Day brings this kind of tense drama to the screen with aplomb Is it a true representation? I'd say it doesn't matter because this is a movie and it's a good one."
"cosmo_tiger","8","47","70","26 April 2014"," Costner's sports movie magic is back & this movie did the impossible. It made you root for a sports executive. I loved it!
","""No one can stop a ticking clock, the great ones always find a way to slow it down."" Sonny Weaver Jr. (Costner) is the GM of the Cleveland Browns and is getting ready for today's NFL draft. He isn't in good graces with the Brown's fans but that all changes when he makes a trade for the #1 pick. With pressure from the owner, his new head coach and his mother, Sonny isn't sure if what he wants is the same as what everyone else wants. His choices not only affect his job but everyone around him as well. I am a sucker for sports movies and I really like Kevin Costner so I was really looking forward to seeing this. Almost right away I was sucked in and enjoyed myself the entire time. This is very much like Moneyball so if you liked that movie you will like this as well. Costner is a perfect choice and there is just something about him and sports movies that is perfect. The movie is about the decisions people make when adding a player to their team, it may not seem like it but its exciting and keeps you guessing and wondering the entire time. You really root for Costner the entire time and want him to succeed. Again, it may be because I am a huge sports fan but I loved this movie and I highly recommend this. Overall, if you liked Moneyball you will love this one. I give this an A."
"TheMovieVlog","7","47","71","10 April 2014"," Like NFL Draft Day itself, it starts slow but the payoff works
","Sports films typically have a love/hate relationship with viewers - most never finding that honest middle ground that satisfies everyone's wants and desires. On one hand, you have the preposterous comedies that cap seriousness, sacrificing dramatic acting in exchange for a series of cheap laughs and feel-good moments, like Rookie of the Year, The Waterboy, and Caddyshack. Then, there's the beloved and devote dramas that live on in film infamy, which includes but is not limited to Rocky, The Natural, and Raging Bull. Finally, you have Kevin Costner's greatest hits, like Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and For the Love of the Game. And, even though Kevin Costner has left the baseball diamond and thrown his last fastball, he clearly has found a memorable position as the GM of an NFL franchise in Draft Day.<br/><br/>The only real complaint about this film is that it doesn't incorporate actual NFL players - at least not in the manner that Moneyball involved them. Players like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are still stars in the Draft Day universe, however, the Cleveland Browns are a team compiled of fictional players - which probably isn't the worst thing since the Browns severely lack star-power now that the former face of their franchise, Trent Richardson, is no longer on the team. However, this is a miniscule problem in the long run, and the plot progression of the fictional players is allotted the proper time to plant their seeds of worth.<br/><br/>Overall, Draft Day takes full advantage of telling an engaging behind-the-scenes tale using the world's most popular league as a vehicle. From the film's trailers, the film might appear to be one giant commercial for the NFL, but thankfully it turns out to be a well-scripted, charming experience. Draft Day is a fun-loving popcorn flick through and through, but it's also exactly the kind of perfectly balanced story that draws people to the movies, incorporating just enough drama, subtly placing humor in stressful situations, and fulfilling its promise to reveal a compelling mystery that will keep everyone on their toes. For anyone that loves football or is interested in the power-play politics that that place behind the proverbial curtain, you'll have an absolute amazing time watching this feature."
"utgard14","6","13","17","21 September 2014"," Entertaining, even if you don't like football movies
","Surprisingly good football movie about Cleveland Browns general manager Kevin Costner on the day of the NFL draft. I say surprisingly because I wasn't expecting much. These sports dramas, particularly the football ones, often bore me. This one started off kind of like that and I was worried at first. But it picked up and I was soon wrapped up in the story. That's in large part due to the fine cast, especially Kevin Costner. You might ask why I watched this if I typically don't like sports dramas. Well the short answer is because Tom Welling from Smallville is in it. My friend was going to watch it for him so I thought ""might as well."" Turns out his role is pretty small. Anyway, it's a good movie. If you're not into football and you think that might keep you from enjoying this, don't worry. You don't really have to be a football fan to follow along with the plot. It's more about the behind-the-scenes business of football than the game itself."
"theauntsavant","8","20","29","19 April 2014"," Draft Day, a Good Movie Pick
","With the NFL Draft season officially in full swing, if you haven't already, now's a great time to see ""Draft Day"" the movie! Even if it does stand to reason, foretelling whether or not it would be received more positively by non-football enthusiasts and resonate less with true football fans (as some critics have deduced), is nonetheless a rush to judgment.<br/><br/>In any case, the box office draw doesn't differentiate one over the other. The entertaining sports vehicle about the NFL draft not actual gridiron game play goes against formula.<br/><br/>We've seen football films that keep to standard rough and tumble field action, which fit the bill. However, the focus here in itself, is a good departure as a movie on the managerial side of the sport of interest for either group.<br/><br/>Being a non-fanatical Monday morning quarterback, I enjoyed watching a view from behind-the-scenes for a change of pace, and getting a crash course in the extraneous details of what occurs in a crucial 24-hour period-similar to TV series ""24""-leading up to the draft day ceremony.<br/><br/>As for the question of is it realism or Hollywood hype? Co-star and former professional football player now actor Terry Crews, who said he was an 11-round draft pick in 1991, in a pre-release call-in interview to the Steve Harvey Morning Show, stated that ""Draft Day"" was the first movie endorsed by the NFL.<br/><br/>So would the League sign-off on a film that represents a 'day-in-the-life of' a general manager played by sports cinema veteran Kevin Costner, managing the real-life Cleveland Browns, if it didn't measure up? Most likely not.<br/><br/>Sure, football fans will probably have a better understanding than will others of the evolving events being dramatized on the big screen, but I believe that's meant to give the rest of the audience a microcosmic picture of the high-pressured inner-workings and how it all comes together.<br/><br/>It presents an intimate look at the level of intensity that comes when the selection process rises to fever pitch (forgive the baseball reference) and how the lives of the hopefuls looking to get picked, as well as their families, hinges on the manager's final decision.<br/><br/>The film works well at drawing you into the thought-provoking/judgment-making job of Costner's character Sonny Weaver, while also keeping you glued to the countdown timer. The spliced boiler room frames meld cohesively to sustain moviegoers' heightened curiosity for the anticipated outcome.<br/><br/>Jennifer Garner is low-key as Costner's girlfriend, though a far cry from her starring lead role in TV's ""Alias."" Hers, along with Ellen Burstyn's portrayal, brings necessary added value to balance out the storyline.<br/><br/>As the father of a potential student draftee, Crews delivers a meaningful, non-comedic performance. The elements put in play, overall, make for a finely crafted sports entertainment feature everyone can enjoy."
"Shannonschaefer","10","66","110","10 April 2014"," Great movie for all sports fans.
","I really enjoyed Draft Day. Yes I am female and yes I love sports especially football but this is a movie anyone can enjoy. It made me think of the movie Moneyball starring Brad Pitt. A very interesting look at the madness, pressure and inner turmoil that one man has to endure in performing his duty of putting a team together. Kevin Costner gives an outstanding performance as Sonny, Jennifer Garner gives a top performance as well. This movie keeps you engaged the whole time, not for a moment did I feel it dragged or got boring. Some of the backdrop scenes of various cities and stadiums just takes your breath away, very much suited for the big screen, a must see in the theater."
"gregsrants","6","47","76","11 April 2014"," Second Round Draft Pick is no Moneyball
","Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports themed movies. The Tin Cup, Bull Durham, For the Love of the Game star has stared in five separate sports films and now rounds that number to an even six with the football themed Draft Day directed by Ghostbuster's helmer Ivan Reitman. <br/><br/>Taking on a role more his age (Costner is a football yard short of 60), Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL. The action picks on NFL Draft Day, the day in which 200+ young budding stars get drafted by big league teams in a huge televised event taking place in New York City. <br/><br/>Sonny's Cleveland team was a lowly 6-10 the season before – largely due to the injury to their star quarterback. The Browns are given the 7th round draft pick on draft day, but pressures from Brown's team owner (Frank Langella) and an aggressive offer from the Seattle Seahawks to swap the number 1 pick for future options leave Sonny with only hours to think of both his legacy and what is best for the city's revered team. <br/><br/>The film all takes place within the 24 hours on draft day and a running clock that appears a handful of times during the film reminds us that the time is ticking and decisions need to be made. Impeding such forward thinking are the films distractions which come in the form of two female characters with ties to Sonny. Jennifer Garner plays Ali, the love interest of Sonny and the lawyer and number cruncher who is responsible for keeping the Browns under the NFL salary cap. With the film only a few minutes aged, we learn that Ali is pregnant with Sonny's baby – a subplot that was hardly necessary to keep things moving. Also complicating things is Sonny's mother played by Ellen Burstyn. Sonny's father was a former Cleveland Brown's coach (fired by Sonny Jr. the year previous) and has recently passed away. Sonny's mother for reasons that were hard to understand considering she lived a life with football at the core of the family, decides that draft day is the day in which she wants Sonny to spend some time completing his father's last wishes as identified in his will. <br/><br/>Both female stories go nowhere and could easily have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, in a weak attempt to connect with a female audience, the two characters are awarded ample screen time to emote and distract Sonny on what is arguably the most difficult and focused day of his career. <br/><br/>When Sonny is not tripping over the estrogen pitfalls, he is struggling with his coach (Dennis Leary) and working the phones discussing trade possibilities with Jacksonville, Buffalo and Kansas City in an attempt to save the city the embarrassment of selling the golden goose for a few magic beans. <br/><br/>It is when Sonny is working his draft magic that the movie is at its best. His calls to and from potential and existing players had an authentic feel and the chaos of draft day is captured with tense complexity and legacy importance. <br/><br/>Draft Day wants to be football's answer to baseball's Moneyball. But the Aaron Sorkin written baseball film starring Brad Pitt had rocket-fire dialogue that catapulted the film to an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay. Draft Day instead is fluff, but it's good fluff. Costner consistently makes every film to which he is involved better than it should be and Reitman is smart to give appropriate cameos (Roger Goodall, Bernie Kozar, Jim Brown), he keeps the spotlight on his star heaving the film on Costner's shoulders in an attempt to score a box office touchdown. <br/><br/>Draft Day was a fun distraction. Browns fans will likely enjoy a fantasy film of their team making right decisions (the Browns have not made the NFL playoffs since 2002), and football fans should find valued entertainment in the behind the scenes peak into the day of a General Manager. But film fans hoping for a Moneyball or something smarter than Draft Day's trailers have revealed should look elsewhere."
"cbsharp42","8","12","17","22 April 2014"," Very interesting perspective into the business side of the NFL
","First off, I am a huge NFL fan.I love the business aspect and the many different components of the NFL game, such as free agency, the draft, etc. So I knew I had to see this movie.<br/><br/>The movie primarily focuses on the Cleveland Browns and GM Sonny Weaver Jr (played by Kevin Costner), but the movie began in the Seattle Seahawks headquarters, where the GM is hoping to cash in on the #1 pick by suckering some team into giving them a king's ransom for it. He calls up Sonny and gauges his interest in the pick. Initially Sonny isn't interested in trading for it, but after being told by the higher ups of the Browns that they needed to make a splash, Sonny eventually deals the #7 pick in the 2014 draft, as well as their 2015 and 2016 1st round picks to Seattle for the #1 pick, where they are assumed to be taking the hotshot, can't miss prospect, QB Bo Callahan of Wisconsin.<br/><br/>There's a few other draft prospects, however, who make it known they want to be a part of the Cleveland Browns: LB Vontae Mack of Ohio State, and RB Ray Jennings (played by current Houston Texans RB Arian Foster) of Florida State, who is the son of a Cleveland Browns legend. Amid these issues, along with hearing his salary cap manager Ali is pregnant with his child, and the passing of his father just days after he fired him (previously the Browns coach), Sonny has a lot on his plate on this draft day.<br/><br/>At first, Sonny decides to roll with Callahan, which makes Browns fans rejoice, and the current Browns QB on the roster quite angry, so much so that he trashes Sonny's office and demands to be traded. He felt betrayed by Sonny, and pleads with Sonny that he is the guy to lead the franchise to glory, coming back better than ever after a knee injury in the previous season. The move also upsets Mack, who tweets out that it's a bad decision to pick Callahan. Sonny also receives disagreement regarding the overall decision from the new coach, who would rather make a new deal with the Buffalo Bills to acquire a few new players and more draft picks for the future.<br/><br/>After doing some background checking and scouting and such, Sonny finds some character issues with Bo Callahan and changes the pick in the final seconds to Vontae Mack. The collective NFL nation is stunned. Mack is watching the draft at his home with his family and is left speechless after hearing he was the pick. It also causes the current Browns QB to rejoice in knowing he's the guy.<br/><br/>Sonny and the Browns weren't done yet though. After seeing the teams in picks 2-5 pass on Bo Callahan, the GM of the Jacksonville Jaguars, who own pick #6, calls up Sonny and asks why teams are passing up on Callahan. Sonny dances around the question, but answers that he simply believes Callahan will be a bust and eventually convinces the Jaguars GM to deal the #6 pick to the Browns for 2nd round picks in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Sonny then takes this opportunity to call up the GM of the Seahawks and threaten to take Callahan away from the Seahawks. After some back and forth negotiations, Sonny gets back all the picks he originally traded to Seattle, as well as a punt returner, for pick #6. Seattle gets its man in Callahan, and the Browns pick Ray Jennings with pick #7. Sonny goes from goat to hero in a matter of minutes, and Browns football appears to be headed in a great direction for the future.<br/><br/>There's plenty more going on in the movie. It has its fair share of football and non-football related drama, enough to keep you interested and wanting to see what happens next.<br/><br/>My only complaints about the movie ... well, as an avid NFL fan, most of the trades that occurred in this movie would definitely not happen in today's NFL. The original trade (Cleveland acquires #1 pick, Seattle acquires three 1st rounders) is not too far-fetched, but the other moves are just completely unrealistic. The Jaguars traded away a top 10 1st round pick for three 2nd round picks. That would never happen, and the Jaguars would have been mocked forever for taking a trade like that in today's NFL. Then Seattle trading back those three 1st rounders and an apparently very good punt returner just to move up one spot? That is also foolish, even for a ""can't miss"" prospect. Of course, that's just nit-picky from someone who is a die-hard NFL fan and knows better.<br/><br/>The other complaint is that the actions of Mack/Jennings as well as the current Browns QB and coach were unrealistic behaviors at certain moments. Mack and Jennings calling Sonny and telling them to draft them? Complaining about potentially not being the guy? That would never ever ever happen. If a prospect did that, he'd probably go completely undrafted, or at least been red-flagged by just about every NFL GM out there. When the current Browns QB got wind of the first trade, he trashed Sonny's office and demanded a trade. Again, that's a move that would get you suspended or ""blacklisted"" by so many teams. Then the coach having the nerve to mock the GM and repetitively call the GM's moves ""boneheaded""? You'd get fired on spot in today's NFL for comments like that.<br/><br/>Again, just some unrealistic things added to the movie to create drama and story lines, which is understandable, and didn't ruin the film for me at all, but true NFL fans will understand that sort of stuff would never happen.<br/><br/>To any football fans, particularly NFL fans, I recommend you see it. I don't know how much it would appeal to those who don't like football, though."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","9","12","4 September 2014"," Tightly paced 'Draft Day' comes out a winner
","There have been a number of films that have focused on the off the field and locker room drama of big time sports, but not many have taken us behind the curtain of the front office side. With the NFL draft now akin to a national holiday in the United States, the high stakes game behind the scenes is arguably more compelling than the one that takes place between the lines on Sundays.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner leads a solid cast, proving once again that though he may not have the widest range, when he's in his wheelhouse there are few who can touch him. The story is ultimately a complete fairytale, but then again most sports movies are.<br/><br/>Though its tepid romantic subplot feels tacked-on to cover all of the demographical bases, Ivan Reitman's 'Draft Day' still delivers a fast paced and well acted dramedy that should please NFL fans. For others, your mileage may vary."
"Buddy-51","7","21","33","21 April 2014"," First and 10
","Hollywood's Mr. Baseball, aka Kevin Costner, walks off the diamond and onto the gridiron (or, more accurately, into pro football's corporate offices) in ""Draft Day,"" Ivan Reitman's entertaining tribute to the wheeling-and-dealing that goes on behind the scenes at the NFL draft.<br/><br/>Costner plays the fictional Sonny Wheeler, Jr., son of the equally fictitious Sonny Wheeler, Sr., who has recently died and in whose shadow Sonny perpetually toils. You see, Wheeler, Sr. was a legend at the Cleveland Browns franchise, and, in his two years as general manager for the team, his son seems to be having a little trouble living up to the old man's reputation. To further complicate Sonny's life, his ""down low"" girlfriend, Ali (Jennifer Garner), who works as the lawyer responsible for making sure the team doesn't bust through the salary cap, has just announced that she is pregnant with the commitment-phobic Sonny's child. Amid all this personal turmoil, Sonny launches into full negotiator mode, making deals and forming alliances with other general managers in the league while working to assuage the concerns of the team's owner (Frank Langella), its coach (Dennis Leary), an assortment of high strung and disgruntled players (Tom Welling, Chadwick Boseman, Arian Foster) and even his own mother (Ellen Burstyn) who has views of her own that need to be taken into consideration before he can arrive at his final decision.<br/><br/>Although it probably helps to have some familiarity with how the draft pick works in order to fully appreciate some of the finer points of the narrative, writers Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman do a good job clarifying the big picture even for the less sports-oriented members of the audience. The movie proceeds at a breakneck pace as the clock ticks down to the moment of truth for Sonny. Will he accept the Seattle Seahawks' offer of the #1 draft pick, Bo Callahan (Josh Pence), in exchange for the Browns' #1 first-round draft picks for the next three years, or will he reject the offer in favor of some less stellar but still promising players? ""Draft Day"" is at its best when it's exploring the various and often contradictory interests - of players, coaches and owners, not to mention the millions at stake in salaries and corporate sponsorships - that those in Sonny's position must consider before rendering their final verdicts. Talk about pressure! The filmmakers establish a nice balance between the sports aspects of the tale and the personal moments between Sonny and Ali and Sonny and his mom, never allowing the latter to detract from the former. As a result, we care about the characters without losing our focus on the real reason we've come to this movie.<br/><br/>Reitman has come up with an interesting split-screen technique that helps to weave together a story that takes place over a wide range of geographical locales simultaneously. What might have been a mere gimmick in less capable hands becomes an indispensable narrative device here.<br/><br/>A few weeks back, while writing about ""3 Days to Kill,"" I lamented that Costner desperately needed to find some quality material worthy of his talents to work with, and he seems to have found just that in ""Draft Day."" Costner has a core of quiet stillness that lends a genuine gravitas to his performances. Because he can appear both confident and insecure in the same moment, he makes us want to root for the character he's playing. He's also blessed with a super supporting cast that includes, in addition to all the aforementioned, Terry Crews, Rosanna Arquette, Sam Elliot, and Sean Combs.<br/><br/>""Draft Day"" proves that not all the competitiveness and excitement of professional football takes place on the field."
"Robert_duder","9","11","16","18 April 2014"," Draft Day is very nearly stunning!
","Here are a few facts to ponder going into this review. First of all, I'm a HUGE Kevin Costner fan and am thoroughly enjoying his resurgence in theatres already in 2014. Simply because of my love for him I was eagerly anticipating this. Some were comparing it to Moneyball and that made me nervous because frankly I thought Moneyball was a stone cold dud. I am NOT a huge sports fan. I go to the occasional game for fun (Baseball and Hockey preferably) and outside of playing a little football in High School, I am not a football fan by any stretch of the imagination. One IMDb reviewer opened their review by saying that anyone who wasn't interested in football or the draft would find this boring...I couldn't disagree more. Reitman (a brilliant director in my books) has created a film that simply anyone can enjoy. You will find yourself enthralled by these characters and you will feel the amazing tension, the stress, the minute by minute thrill of being amongst these people making vital decisions to their team. It isn't about whether this time is successful (we don't even find that out) its simply about the Draft as the title implies and I was riveted to put it mildly. The script is brilliant, the dialogue is very smart and keeps you watching for each moment as it changes. Regardless of your football knowledge or expertise or lack thereof, you will follow this and just have a great time doing it.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is charismatic period. He certainly loves his sports film and name one he's done that wasn't good or is considered a ""classic"" now. Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, For The Love of The Game...they're all at least very watchable. Draft Day is deserving to sit amongst them but it is a very different sort of ""sports movie."" Costner's Sonny Weaver is a fascinating character. You will literally see and feel his stress and tension and what he's going through and then you watch the pay off as he casually yells ""I LOVE THIS JOB."" Costner was bang on. I find it hard to really sink myself into Jennifer Garner as an actress. She's cute and fun but when I see her in films like this that require a certain amount of intensity, seriousness and drama. She comes across almost bored and just doesn't seem to manage the role as deep as she should. She is okay in Draft Day, her chemistry with Costner is decent (and believable given their age difference) and I suppose her subtle performance leaves room for Costner to really shine. Another reason Draft Day is so good is the amazing whose who of character actors in supporting roles. Chadwick Boseman, Patrick St. Esprit, Terry Crews, Frank Langella, Denis Leary, Timothy Simons, Sean Combs and Tom Welling each deserve mention for their respective roles. I handpicked those supporting performances because small or big they each had a moment that was perfect. For most of them it was scenes exchanging dialogue with Costner and it was simply well done to say the least. Welling (whom I am also a big fan of from Smallville days) has literally one significant scene and it was enough for me to go...wow. Josh Pence was a little underwhelming in his role as coveted quarterback Bo. I think the role could have been great but he doesn't put much into it and is quite generic. I also don't quite understand the role played by Griffin Newman who might be some sort of comedic relief but is really expendable and goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Legendary director and producer Ivan Reitman very nearly always tells an incredibly entertaining story. He brings the most out of these characters and makes them so vivid and most importantly has a way of making you feel like you are right there...no matter how ridiculous the concept. Draft Day is obviously very realistic but he deserves such great kudos for crafting a story that I believe anyone can sink themselves into. He didn't disappoint me one bit and my expectations were decently high. Move over Moneyball (I don't care how much critics liked it and the ridiculous Oscar nominations it got) this was superior in every single way. Football fans will enjoy the myriad of NFL'ers playing themselves and the film is laid out in such a way to subtly explain everything to those of us not familiar with the sport. Draft Day is a must see and I guarantee will hold its own in the hall of fame for sports films. An absolute pleasure! 9/10"
"larrys3","7","5","6","17 September 2014"," Taut & Engrossing Sports Tale
","There are some highly implausible and nonsensical plot elements here, yet despite that I found this movie to be a taut and engrossing sports tale and it kept my interest throughout.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner gives another solid performance here as Sonny Weaver, Jr., the beleaguered General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, in the NFL. He has to contend with a meddling owner (Frank Langella), a combative head coach (Denis Leary) and a very angry fan base who are tired of losing. Additionally, his father has just passed away, as he was the former coach of the Browns and fired by Sonny Jr (we find out late in the movie the reason why). Finally, he's in a relationship with the team's capologist (Jennifer Garner), and has just found out she's pregnant with their baby.<br/><br/>With the entire film set on NFL Draft Day, Sonny receives a call from the General Manager of the Seattle Seahawks who hold the #1 pick in the draft, who's expected to be the hot-shot quarterback Bo Callahan (Josh Pence). However, the Seahawks are willing to trade their #1 pick for a very dear price in return.<br/><br/>Under threat of being fired unless he makes a big splash in the draft, Sonny reluctantly agrees to the deal. Thus begins a long series of ""wheelings and dealings"" by NFL execs, as the start of the draft looms, which I thought was realistically portrayed, although I'm not sure how much non-football fans who don't know the lingo may understand.<br/><br/>It all will culminate in what I thought was quite the dramatic ending. As mentioned, if one can get past the implausible script elements, it can be a good watch.<br/><br/>The acclaimed filmmaker Ivan Reitman handles the direction here, with a screenplay from Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman."

","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this story of a general manager of the Cleveland Browns who is played by Kevin Costner in trying to pick the right trades on the day of the NFL draft picks while also dealing with a pregnant associate (Jennifer Garner) he's in a relationship with, a coach who doesn't always agree with his choices (Dennis Leary), and a late father who was the previous coach that he had to fire beforehand due to age. I'll stop there and say I found much that was pretty funny and occasionally touching stuff about some of the players being considered. And director Ivan Reitman was pretty creative with some of the wipes involved in many scene transitions. So on that note, Draft Day is worth a look."
"ghost_dog86","4","18","30","15 April 2014"," The final 30 minutes was pretty good
","Short Review: This movie will mean nothing to anybody uninterested or unfamiliar with the NFL draft.<br/><br/>Long Review: How does someone make a good movie out of a subject matter that is as dry and corporate as the NFL draft? I'll let you know when I see one.<br/><br/>Going in knowing that the content would be painfully middle of the road, if only because a movie sponsored by the NFL (like any good propaganda film) must have been sifted through for any questionable or inflammatory content by every owner in the league prior to completion, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I am a fan of the NFL and thought (at the very least) it would be cool to see a football movie that used actual NFL team logos. But after about 5 minutes of that and the relentless barrage of corporate product placement, it all got old and I was forced to pay attention to the story.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Directed by Ivan Reitman (a man who is responsible for far more stinkers than good movies; stop trying to defend him) ""Draft Day"" tells the story of fictional Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver as he wrestles with what college prospect he will pick on Draft Day. Doesn't that sound like a riveting idea for a movie? Well, it is slightly more interesting than it sounds, but just slightly.<br/><br/>Right off the bat it is revealed that Sonny is dating a woman named Ali, played by Jennifer Garner; a pairing that not only lacks any chemistry, but is visually off-putting. And aside from an ending that I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed, Dennis Leary's performance as an unapologetic caricature of Barry Switzer and Chadwick Boseman's performance as a prospect wildly undervalued by NFL scouts, it's all downhill from there. Even the direction from this seasoned filmmaker is pretty awful, full of amateurish wipes and an over abundant use of the split screen effect.<br/><br/>Final Thought: While I was interested to see this film through, if only to find out what prospect Sonny selected, far too much of ""Draft Day"" is soap opera dramatic and stiff as hell. But I guess it's not all Rietman's fault. He does manage to coax as much theatrical entertainment out of an aspect of football that doesn't include the act of playing football."

","On April 11, treat yourself to a nearly perfect film: Draft Day. Ivan Reitman directs a star- studded cast led by Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner, and Dennis Leary. I scored tickets to a special pre-screening of the film and I haven't seen Costner this good since 1989's Field of Dreams. Draft Day is an amazing story for anyone who enjoys America's gladiator sport. It is also a brilliant hook for the NFL to use to attract new fans. In particular, those who have never seen the battles fought on the business side of the multibillion dollar franchise will find the story difficult to resist. <br/><br/>Several stories are told through characters who are all connected by one of the sport's holiest of days: NFL Draft Day. We see the worry experienced by a veteran quarterback who may lose his job if the press is right. We see a touching story of a son who wants to join the team his father played for. We see the conflict of a rookie torn between what is right and what is lucrative. We see a love story born from a mutual love and respect for football that clashes with a son's duty to his mother and the memory of his father. <br/><br/>No other film has ever looked so beautiful while capturing the excitement of football without centering on action sequences on the field. The beauty of this film is in the chemistry between Costner and Leary as they fight for control of the destiny of the Cleveland Browns, the looks exchanged and words unsaid between Costner and Garner as he struggles to be the man he wants to become, and in the struggle between Costner and Ellen Burstyn who is struggling to be the mother he needs. <br/><br/>Throughout the film we are privileged to see performances worthy of any prize yet the most surprising is that of Griffin Newman as Rick, the intern. He learns faster and bonds with more characters than any other cast member. He is simply brilliant and is officially on my list of actors to watch in the coming year. <br/><br/>Draft Day is everything we wish American football will be. We want the struggle, the fight, and the triumph of Draft Day. I only hope a sequel is coming soon because after watching what these characters endure just to make it to the draft, I desperately want to see how their first season ends."

","First of all don't confuse this for a ""Sports"" movie.<br/><br/>It revolves around the NFL Draft, an annual event where the NFL managers are selecting players to join their teams.<br/><br/>It is a USA football thing, so if you are living in another continent, it is rather difficult to understand the rules and even more the point of this whole charade.<br/><br/>About the rules is something of a Poker game. At least as it looks in this picture. The manager of team A is on the phone with the manager of team B and they talk things like ""I am giving you 2 of my first picks of the second round to give me your first pick for the next 2 years..."" and so on.<br/><br/>Again, this is NOT about who wins a game or a trophy. This is merely about picking players whom you think they might be useful to your team. In the actual games they may proved to be bad choices, or injured or whatever, and despite being happy about your choices in the NFL draft, eventually to lose games and the season.<br/><br/>Now as movie ""Draft Day"" is carefully designed.<br/><br/>The direction and editing are trying to be ""edgy"" with unique split screen effects during the numerous phone-calls between the team managers. You can see for example Kevin Costner (who plays the lead role as an experienced yet unconventional manager) in a split screen walking into the other side of the frame where the manager of the other team is.<br/><br/>The music has a certain triumphant feeling without being to much in your face and the whole production is carefully designed.<br/><br/>I point that out because in this movie you have constantly the feeling that you are seeing great things taking place. Like every little decision is something that could change the world. But in reality all these ""decisions"" are something of a micromanagement. In the end and if you actually pay attention, what is happening and what the characters are talking about is totally uninteresting...<br/><br/>...and for the rest of the world, outside the US, confusing and pointless."

","I'm always up for a good football movie and I'm pretty sure that hasn't been one since 2009 when The Blind Side came out. Now, we have a new story from director Ivan Reitman about that one day in the NFL offseason everyone anticipates, Draft Day.<br/><br/>The film begins hours before the NFL Draft begins, and Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner) is just getting ready for the day that may make or break his tenure as the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns. Sonny knows everything that is going on even before getting to the office. He has ESPN on his TV at home, and listens to all the sports radio talk. Early in the day, Sonny makes a deal with the Seattle Seahawks, who have the #1 pick and are expected to take hotshot quarterback Bo Callahan. The deal involved the Browns getting the #1 pick from the Seahawks in exchange for their first round picks for the next three seasons. Everyone is expecting Sonny to pick Callahan, but there are two other prospects Sonny is interested in: a linebacker with a good heart but a mouth on him named Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and running back Ray Jennings (Current Houston Texans running back Arian Foster), whose father Earl (Terry Crews) was a Browns legend. This move has made Browns fans happy put has angered some Browns personnel, such as head coach Vince Penn (Denis Leary) and starting quarterback Brian Drew (Tom Welling). Ultimately, the choice belongs to Sonny, who is also facing some personal issues with his father, a legendary coach, having passed away a week before the film begins and his girlfriend and fellow co-worker Allie (Jennifer Garner) is pregnant with his child. The film goes through Sonny's day with dealing all the pressure, especially from owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella).<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman has done an awesome job of telling a football story revolving around a big media frenzy every year. I like that he focuses the story on Kevin Costner's sunny and making about the GM of the team, a very tough job indeed. He and director of photography Eric Steelburg (who has shot Reitman's son's films) do a nice job of intertwining the phone conversations between any two characters, usually Sonny and somebody else.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is just excellent at the front and center of this film. He is great at being the man under pressure from every one and their cousin as his job is on the line. Jennifer Garner is good in her part as girlfriend Allie, but I think any actress could have played that part. Denis Leary is great as the coach who wants to win. Frank Langella was enjoyable as the owner, but my favorite supporting performance was Chadwick Boseman as hothead linebacker Vontae Mack.<br/><br/>Cleveland Browns fans will certainly be happy with this film being about their team. While I am not a Browns fan, I got a football movie I highly enjoyed."

","This movie is atrocious. Mind you, I went in with rather high expectations, but this movie literally had me cracking up with how awful some of the writing and story lines were. It's not a Football movie, it's not a Hollywood movie, it's a Lifetime movie.<br/><br/>Here's a list of stuff just thinking off the top of my head: <br/><br/><ul><li>Sunny (Kevin Costner) gets his girlfriend (Jennifer Garner) pregnant, who is clearly in her early 40's. Not out of the realm of possibility, but still..</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sunny makes a trade hours before the draft that no one in their right mind WOULD EVEN CONSIDER without conferring with his owner, coach, or even considering salary cap implications. He gives up three straight number one for the first overall pick in this year's draft.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After he's made said dumb trade, he then has his guys look deeper on the potential no.1 overall pick. ""Find me something."" Great strategy, considering he traded 3 straight first rounders for the right to pick this guy. Definitely realistic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Denis Leary is the coach. That should be all you need to know on that. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>JUST HOURS BEFORE THE DRAFT, his mother comes in insisting right then and there they go out to the practice field to spread his deceased father's ashes. Of course, his ex-wife also has to be in the room, and meet the newly knocked up girlfriend too. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Sunny refuses to spread the ashes, his mother somehow rounds up the rest of the Cleveland Browns office (about 50 people) to go out with her while she spreads the ashes. This is about two hours before the draft. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On the day of the draft, he of course picks the guy with the character and passes on the aloof quarterback. Of course there has to be a way to fix this right? So he somehow rectifies his bad trade by getting Seattle to take an EVEN WORSE trade so they can get the guy they want at the 7 slot. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After almost being fired by the owner minutes before, Sunny is greeted by a standing ovation after he pulls off said miraculous trade. </li></ul><br/><br/>I can't think of anything else specifically, but this is an awful, factually inaccurate movie. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
"ironhorse_iv","7","5","7","21 May 2014"," Movie presented a rough draft day of a General Manager. Yet the story could had been told better. Movie was just alright.
","This movie was no touchdown. Honestly, the movie could had work, better, if the producers retouch in some areas in the script to make it more entertaining. As a huge football fan, I found it to be a bit boring. Even some NFL fans, don't bother watching the Draft due to its confusing nature, and how dull & long, it can last. You would think a movie directed by Ivan Reitman, who known for his comical movies would at less make Draft Day, a bit funny or fun to watch, but this movie is void of humor and action. I'm not saying, this movie is bad film, it was just disappointing to me. The premise of the film revolves around the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, Sonny Weaver (Kevin Costner) whom is trying to decide what is best for his team, for the upcoming NFL Draft pick. I think the movie is indeed a poor man's version of 2011's Money Ball with its similar premise. While, Moneyball was based on real events and was captivating. This movie was so fictionalized that none of it, really matters in the end. Yes, the trade that Cleveland makes in the movie is similar to the real-life trade made in the 2012 NFL Draft where the Washington Redskins traded their 2012 #6 overall pick, 2012 2nd Round selection, 2013 1st Round selection and 2014 1st Round selection for the 2012 #2 overall pick in order to select the star, they wanted, but it didn't help Washington win the Super Bowl that year. Honestly, we, as the audience don't even see the results of what the draft in the film did for the team for Cleveland Brown, or the film antagonist, the Seattle Seahawks. If the movie show them, winning or getting somewhere, maybe we can call the draft, a success or a bust, but the film doesn't do that for us. They don't even play a game in the movie. So, what was the point? I feel bad for Cleveland Browns and football fans, because there is little football action in a football movie. I don't get how the film need to dumb down the movie, for the audience mostly made out for hardcore NFL fans. Does the movie really need to explain what NFL team play for what city? It's pointless, because most likely non-NFL fans are not going to bother, watching this movie, anyways! I love wheeling and dealing backstage thing, but it wasn't tense, enough. The first half of the movie was really slow and had horrible pacing. Lot of filler scenes with the sub-plots of Sonny's secret girlfriend Ali Parker, (Jennifer Garner) being pregnancy that has little to do with the main plot. While, the movie did have a timer, it felt that the only good part in the film were the last 10 minutes, when the deals were going through. It was pretty realistic and accurate, plus a good watch. Why couldn't the movie just be about that? I think, this movie concept would have work better as a documentary like ESPN 30 for 30 film series. Why couldn't this movie be based on the documentary, 'Elway to Marino"" an in-depth examination of the 1983 NFL Draft that was highlighted by a record six quarterbacks being taken in the first round, including future Hall of Famers John Elway and Dan Marino. Now, that was an interesting landmark draft. If not that, the infamous 1998's NFL Draft, where teams fought over Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. I love to see a movie that had some great draft bust and draft steals, which this movie sadly was missing. The acting is alright, but the movie mostly focus on the main character, so the film lacks development supporting characters. They are harden noticeable. I do like the cameos of real football stars like Arian Foster and legend Jim Brown. I give Arian Foster, some props. He can act. A lot of people might not like Kevin Costner's acting chops, but for me being a huge fan of Kevin Costner's early work, I have to say that, I find his acting in this film OK. Still, I think he was a bit typecast. I really don't know what the movie was going with his character. It felt like it was written for a much younger actor, and Kevin's presence make the film seem old and tiresome. Another thing, bothering me is the awful swap and cross cuts. The movie really went overboard with the transitions and it did become a bit repeatable. Lots of dialogue, but none of them were very noticeable. Give the audience more rocket-fire witty dialogue. I would pass on this movie at theaters or buying the DVD, and interception for a DVD rental price or wait into it aired on TV. Tackle it, if you really want to watch it, but just note, that while, it's describe as a football movie. There is little of it, in the end. Still, a very thought-provoking perspective into the business side of the NFL."

","In general I like sports films and I like Kevin Costner sports films, Field of Dreams and For Love of the Game are great, but in this film our little wolf dancer's film is about American football and not baseball. The film was written by a new script writing pair and Ivan Reitman is in the director's chair. It's interesting Ivan Reitman was one of the biggest starts in the 80s, with directing films like Ghostbusters and Twins, then he disappeared for a few years and the Reitman name is mostly known now because of his son. Because of all this this is typically the type of film that had me thinking I would be pleased, but I wasn't really expecting too much. And what did I get? It's interesting. Imagine an action flick about American football where we never see a ball once, and the whole thing is like an ad, with a genius main actor. That's Draft Day. So let's talk about the story: On the day of the fictionalized 2014 NFL Draft, the consensus number one pick is a University of Wisconsin quarterback, Bo Callahan, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. Cleveland Browns General Manager Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner), whose father coached the Browns and was fired by his son and passed away a week before the draft, are holding the seventh overall pick. He is given the opportunity to trade for the 1st overall draft pick, held by a fictionalized version of the Seattle Seahawks and his boss and owner. Weaver is also recently aware of the pregnancy of his girlfriend Ali Parker (Jennifer Garner) with his child. Parker also works for the Browns as a lawyer concerned with ensuring the integrity of the Browns' salary cap, and their relationship is intended to be secret from the rest of the Browns staff. The truth is, that the story just shows us what a Draft is in a split screen action film. I kept thinking about two things during the film. Moneyball, and kids sitting around trading baseball cards and talking about players. That's all. Is that enough for a film? It is  but The film is quick, it doesn't get boring and the actors are good. Especially Costner and Dennis Leary. And anyone who likes AFL will find it interesting and I think will enjoy it. The problem to me starts with the fact that there is no back story beside the action. Or I should say nothing too deep. Just think about For Love of the Game, it was just about baseball, but oh the story line behind the game A whole life. What's the story here? Nothing. It didn't make the film bad, it just could have been so much more, maybe seeing more of Costner's character's private life, his tragedies, but alas. I thought the storyline was the biggest problem. The script is written well, it's just the story that wasn't really worked out fully and you can feel it, with a little more work it could have been a fantastic sports film. All in all because I like sports films, and AFL and Kevin Costner I liked this film, but in my humble opinion if someone isn't really interested in the intrigue of the behind the scenes of the AFL, specifically the way the draft works I don't think they'll like this film. It would just be a boring film about things they don't really understand. That's why I give it a 6/10, but it would be less if I was an impartial viewer."
"TxMike","Null","2","2","13 September 2014"," NFL draft day, Costner is the GM facing difficult choices.
","This movie depicts one day, NFL draft day. This is where each team hopes to get the one or two college players that will help them get to the Superbowl, and where the top college prospects hole to become instant multi-millionaires. The movie includes many who really are in football, including the NFL commissioner playing himself, so I choose to believe that what it portrays, while fictional is also plausible.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is Sonny Weaver Jr., his father the former Cleveland Browns coach died very recently, and as Browns General Manager is faced with the #1 pick resulting from their dismal record the season before. The Heisman winner is quarterback ""Bo"" and everyone, including the owner, assumes that Sonny will pick him.<br/><br/>But as anyone who follows pro football knows, many trades are made on draft day, sometimes just minutes before a pick needs to be made, and that is largely what is depicted here. Sonny is not sure that ""Bo"" is the best pick for Cleveland, they have a good QB (Tom Welling of Smallville fame) that was injured last year and he seems to be stronger than ever after recuperation.<br/><br/>The other key character is Jennifer Garner who, in spite of the 17- yr age difference in real life, is Sonny's love interest. But also the person who looks after the Browns payroll and balances salaries so as not to exceed the salary cap. <br/><br/>Also Dennis Leary is good as the coach. But this is a Costner movie all the way and he is good in his role as the GM with his own view of the draft day scene, who gets what he wants and what his team needs, but has to do it with a series of unexpected trades.<br/><br/>Good movie!!"
"maurice_yacowar","8","9","16","14 April 2014"," NFL GM counts on human values to build his team
","Forget about the football. This film is about the importance of restoring humanity to the cold machinery of capitalism. It's about how someone with power should deal with people. In the calculation of a company's need, amid all the quantifiable criteria the overriding importance lies in character. Know your people, know their value, know their weakness, and give them the chance to realize themselves. Then it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You've made life as good as you can for your team.<br/><br/>That's the strength of Sonny Weaver Jr (Kevin Costner, touching and superb as a good man in a brute job). He carries his genius coach father's name so he feels an extra onus, especially since as GM he fired his dad (who has just died). But he's Sonny so even as a son he's upbeat, sunny. The weaver can weave dreams (like those of his NFL draft prospects, his team, the losing Cleveland Browned-off fans) or an entrapping, debilitating web (same list, plus his girlfriend, his own ambitions) or a harmonious creation (as at film's end the Browns seem poised to become).<br/><br/>This sensitivity is all the more important in a traditionally male industry — like politics and, yeah, I suppose to some extent like the NFL. As Sonny's team accountant/lawyer Ali (Jennifer Garner) observes, it's ironic that the top award in this ultra-macho sport is a piece of jewelry. That rings true, especially as Ali is also GM Sonny's main squeeze and is carrying his kid. Against the tradition, this woman is one of the grid-savviest characters in the film. She proposes the special teams Seahawk to complete the penultimate deal. And Sonny fired his dad at his mother's (Ellen Burstyn) request, to save the old guy's life. Women make key decisions here. Sonny's human instincts are definitely from his feminine side. Still, he's a guy in a guy's world (capitalism or its apogee, NFL) so he needs feminine sensitivity but not any indulgent sentimentality. That keeps him reticent when the women want him to talk.<br/><br/>Hence Sonny's maneuvering in the snakey plot. He's tempted to make the deal his macho team owner (Frank Langella) demands but balks when he gets an insight into the prize prospect's character. The guy lies. So he doesn't really command his teammates' respect. As there is less to this star quarterback than meets the eye on the win-loss column, so there's more to the passionate linebacker whom Sonny prefers. The QB racks up the gals but the LB was ejected for giving his TD football to a woman in the stands — his dying sister. Sonny opts for character. He even forgives the good man's indiscreet tweeting, given his fuller sense of the man. He keeps his coach despite his betrayal and opposition. And the GM is man enough to apologize to the intern, lowest on the totem pole.<br/><br/>The team owner is a showboat without the understanding his GM marshalls. He'll never know why Sonny made the decisions he did but he's happy here because he thinks they'll win for him. The bust QB's total commitment to winning disqualifies that value.<br/><br/>This is as good a film as Canadian director Ivan Reitman has made. The script is tense, concise, witty, suspenseful, full of interesting characters with a range of strength/weakness, equally valuable. <br/><br/>Reitman plays an interesting trick here. Phone conversations are often presented in split screens. That's conventional. Reitman's trick is to have a character in one screen lap over into the other. The characters are physically in different spaces, but that overlap reminds us of the essential unity of people across whatever divides them. That twist on the device enforces the central theme of the community and sensitivity that should bind the separate, even conflicting components in any enterprise, especially business, and --especially today -- politics.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the sequel. Sonny and Ali have their kid. With both parents so passionately steeped in football, the kid grows up — to espouse cricket. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

","Where do I start with this movie? First of all the NFL Draft is becoming a national prime time event full of last minute trades and enough real drama, how could you not find realistic material there right? Nope, not Hollywood. Instead they come up with this outlandish story of a GM under pressure from the owner to make a splash in the draft. And just for good Hollywood measure they throw in these cliché'd personal issues to the GM: girlfriend is pregnant, living in the shadow of his famous father, etc. etc. You know the LIFETIME movie treatment. Well I could stand that if they just showed the drama of the NFL draft...but nooooo Instead they have him make a deal that NO, and I mean NO one in their right mind would make who knew anything about Criquet, not to mention the NFL. So the rest of the movie he deals with the cardboard cutout coaches and NFL front office people that are such parodies, MAD Magazine wouldn't use them as they are too ridiculous. And how do they get him out of this hole? Well they drop the IQ of all the characters he deals with so he can outwit them into making even more ridiculous trades than he did to get himself into this mess. THAT""s IT, no clever twist, nothing like that, just all of a sudden everyone else gets real dumb~! Then he becomes the hero. And oh yeah lets all of the sudden stuff in a bunch of cameos of Brown's alumni for no real reason. If I was a Brown's fan (TG I""m not) I'd find this movie just another reason to be embarrassed about my team. The only thing this film got semi-right is the portrayal of the potential draftees and even then the interaction the main character was having with them prior to contracts and such would probably be against NFL rules...but Ill let that slide. Its been a long time since a movie disappointed me this much, because I know there is a wealth of material that could have made it great. I know Kevin C's career is waning, but he should have passed on this dog.<br/><br/>In closing just to show you how wrong this movie got it, they have the Seattle Seahawks with the 1st overall pick, which as anyone knows goes to the team with the worst record in the league, and of course the Seahawks won the Super Bowl this year.

Whomever he selects, his job, the job of Coach Penn (Denis Leary) not to mention the future of a billion dollar franchise and the hopes and dreams of a city ride on what he decides.<br/><br/>Draft Day is the latest entry in the sports drama from Kevin Costner, no stranger to epic sports films such as Bull Durham and Tin Cup. Draft Day is about the hours leading up to the NFL Draft and the turbulent drama, relationships and chaos enveloping the beleaguered General Manager of the Cleveland BrownsSonny Weaver Jr. The film opens with Weaver's girlfriend and colleague, Allie (Jennifer Garner) announces to him that she is pregnant with their child. As the day continues Weaver works the phones with various general managers, all of whom try to fleece him for draft positioning. With pressure mounting by owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella) Weaver succumbs to the rip off deal proposed by the Seattle Seahawks GM to move up to the top pick in the draft. As news of the trade is leaked via the Twittersphere, everybody and their brother is up in arms as the previously expected pick of fearsome linebacker Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) is now thrown into doubt and the projected top pick in the draft, Wisconsin Quarterback and franchise making player Bo Callahan (Josh Pence) is within reach for Sonny.<br/><br/>As the film continues, Weaver investigates the curious Bo Callahan via his head of security who uncovers some bizarre behavior by the top prospect. Meanwhile Weavers mother arrives at Sonny's office to honor her late husband (who died the previous week) Sonny's dad and former coach of the Cleveland Brownswhom Sonny fired. Through the day Weaver is left to resolve his issues with Allie in between screaming matches with his owner, players, coaches and basically any body he makes eye contact with. There are plenty of cameo appearances with real NFL players and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, including a rather pointless appearance by Sean ""P-Diddy"" Combs as Bo Callahan's agent<br/><br/>THE VERDICT: Draft Day is ultimately a story about choices, their consequences and ultimately redemption set again the wheeling and dealing of what has become an important day for sports fans. Comedy directing legend, Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Stripes) takes a departure into the realm of the sports drama to helm DraftDay. Reitman expertly guides his characters through the standard sport films clichés and keeps the film at a high level so that hardcore sports fans as well as non sports fans can appreciate the film.

","With another season of the National Football League about to get underway, I thought it would be the perfect time to sit down and watch the Kevin Costner film, Draft Day. The plot isn't anything special here but, it does give a nice look at what might be going on behind the scenes during these drafts. This is my review of Draft Day.<br/><br/>The story here is fairly basic as it follows Cleveland Browns General Manager, Sonny Weaver Jr.(Kevin Costner) as he is testing the waters in the NFL(Nation Football League) draft. Some trades and exchanges happen throughout the lead up the their pick in the draft, and some twist and turns happen throughout the story. There is some boring downtime in the film but, with the run time being fairly small, it doesn't hurt the film all that much. This story was written by Scott Rothman and Rajiv Joseph. While this is the first writing credit for Rothman, Joseph has done some writing on a couple television shows like Nurse Jackie. Sure its a completely different story than what he is use to writing but, it seems both gentleman got the basics of the game locked down. For the sake of a good story some of the General Managers are made to look completely dumb, not to say all General Mangers in the NFL are smart. With a fairly basic story and nothing glaring in terms of this story, both Rothman and Joseph get a barely above average grade for their work on this film.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Ivan Reitman who is a legendary director known for the classic Ghostbuster films. While his efforts haven't been so successful in recent memory, this film is a nice addition to a solid overall filmography. With some high rise shots of major cities like Seattle, Buffalo, Cleveland, and others, Reitman brings an enjoyable atmosphere that is the NFL draft. With a different type of film like this it can be hard to know how it will turn out and received by the fans. Without legendary actor Kevin Costner, I really don't know how well the film would have been portrayed. With a lot of secondary actors popping up for smaller roles, there is a lot to focus on but, with the script being otherwise barely above average, and Reitman not bringing much in way of helping the script, it doesn't leave us with a great film by any means. With this film being different as it follows the events of the NFL, it can be a good film for fans like myself but, those who do not follow the NFL likely won't get much from this film. Reitman does a manageable job directing this film, and since the acting is nothing special, and minus some nice shots from Reitman, this was not one of his best outings as a director.<br/><br/>In closing, fans of the NFL will likely watch this film and mostly enjoy it. Those who really don't follow the league or the sport that much should likely just pass on this film for the time being. Maybe a rental or stream down the road is the best option but, there is no need to rush and watch this film. If you are an NFL fan, this might be a good watch as the new season starts this upcoming weekend.<br/><br/>7/10"

",". . . DRAFT DAY distinguishes itself from lesser gridiron dramas by carefully avoiding ANY football action on the part of its actors. No concussions for this crowd--No Siree, Bob! While such an inactive approach would doom a baseball or basketball flick out of the box, it turns out to be the perfect tactic for a film focused on the game with goal posts. I must confess that for the past ten years or so, if I heard that Kevin Costner was in a movie, my gut reaction was, ""Yuk!"" Ditto for Costner's co-star\lover, Jennifer Garner. Strangely enough, two ""Yuks!"" make a right here, akin to the crazed good fortune experienced by Costner's Sonny Weaver, Jr., character. Sonny avoids drafting everyone's #1 overall pick--Wisconsin Badger QB ""Bo Callahan""--because of subtle doubts about whether Bo's a ""good guy."" It turns out his hunch probably is warranted, and he parlays his avoidance of one bad apple into picking up three future stars. This makes him even luckier than me (my football ""career"" consisted of just one play at linebacker, and I only scored a single ""pick six""--thanks to the opposing QB throwing the ball right to me). On the flip side, during my much longer coaching career, I told just one athlete to his face that he was in danger of becoming a sociopath (due to his tendency toward chronic misrepresentation, like ""Bo"" in DRAFT DAY). As far as I know, he's the only one of my guys who went on to become nationally famous. Only in America."
"c_rojas15","8","5","9","11 May 2014"," Solid movie
","It would be nice if reviewers knew something about football and pro sports in general prior to writing. Character counts, just ask the GM's who drafted Ryan Lief and Matt Leinart, athletics, even in college, are not about athletics, but about making money, and personal issues cloud thinking, just ask Donald Sterling and the drama surrounding his LA Clippers.<br/><br/>All that said, DD depicts managing a pro franchise not as a science but an opaque art, where the answers aren't seen at first, nor second glance, but with gut reactions. Costner's character manages the Cleveland Browns, after they've returned to the city, having been ripped out by the former owner. The current owner, played by Frank Langelle, has taken a huge risk in getting the franchise back to its original birthplace, and he needs to make money. The supposedly safe/sage pick is taking 'sure thing' qb from Wisconsin. Costner knows better, his dad, a former head coach, taught his the intricacies of the game, and defense and character make teams successful. But defensive players don't fill seats, and the game is played with throat slitting sentiment. The drama lies in that Costner won't do what's supposedly needed, he has to make the decision to play by the rules, or by his own standards.<br/><br/>It works, though many will get sidetracked by his relationship with Jennifer Garner, who plays a franchise functionary. It makes sense because Costner is going to have to speak about feelings, and he isn't going to do it with the other guys, he needs a female character in order to get that across. That's why JG is there, as a lyrical device needed to get that point across. Why? Because women watch movies too, and they don't give a crap about football, but about the story and relationships. That's why the movie works, because ultimately, it does what it's supposed to do, give you an insight into the arcane, often deranged, messy, convoluted world of running a pro sports business..."

","Costner's best in a good while. The movie was confusing at first, throwing around a lot of unfamiliar names; but by the end, the packed audience I saw it with was all in. It was like a high stakes poker game (bid, bluff, dodge) with the whole world watching and using football trading cards instead of the standard poker deck. My main negative was the obligatory, Jennifer Garner love interest distraction. Chadwick Boseman is very charismatic. And since they were fictionalizing the 2014 draft, they could of at least come up with a post season summation to spice things up during the credits--like for instance, ""Browns make it to the Super Bowl, but loose....to the Cardinals....in Phoenix."" Yaaaaaaah! I'm a casual NFL fan, and I'd have to be a lot more involved to even care about following the draft, but the behind the scenes drama is what draws me in here. The NFL mystique will only be abetted by this movie."
"jtindahouse","5","4","7","12 December 2015"," Would've been better if it wasn't so unrealistic
","'Draft Day' is one of those films that on first glance appears to be an inspirational sporting story with nicely weaved elements of drama and feel-good moments. Until you actually step back and consider the implausibility of what you've just watched that is. It deals in small elements of truth that have happened over the years, but is far from being 'based on a true story' (not that it ever claimed to be). Therefore the scriptwriters were able to take huge liberties in the way they went about telling their story. Sadly this probably worked on the majority of viewers because I imagine not a high percentage of people know how the NFL draft works and therefore were clueless as to just how realistic the trades being made were, and thus just accepted them. For them this was probably a great movie. For the rest of us in the know, it was anything but.<br/><br/>You're probably wondering whether a film simply being unrealistic in this way can actually ruin it. Afterall there are very few movies ever made that are entirely realistic. The difference with 'Draft Day' is that it is based on a very specific and very real event held every year. The reason this isn't based on a true story is because nothing like this ever has or ever will happen. A love story on the Titanic, absolutely could have (and probably did to some extent) happened, liberties taken around fact. Ridiculous deals being made in the NFL draft, leaving the Cleveland Browns looking like absolute geniuses and the Jacksonville Jaguars look like the biggest chumps in the history of sport? Not acceptable."

","I was able to catch an advanced screening of this movie and at first I was disappointed that this film would be the first one I ever saw before it was released but I kept an open mind and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Now before you see this film, know that it has a completely different tone than ""Moneyball,"" this is much more comedic, does not involve that much footage at all of football actually being played, and is extremely cheesy/clichéd but there are a ton of laughs to be had to balance it out. The entire environment of the draft was captured, I remember sweating and being so anxious last year when my team was up to select their pick and I remarkably I felt the exact same emotions here. There is comedy in most of the scenes and most of the laughs don't come from the main stars like Costner or Garner but by the supporting cast. The factor of romance was luckily not that big in the film, it is weird though to see Costner and Garner together, there doesn't seem to be any chemistry or connection. Keep in mind that I'm under the effect of the movie being free, but I would have paid for a ticket too. This film is open to viewing for everybody, personally I like watching football but someone who doesn't will easily get it, the movie does a good job of explaining everything.

","I was tempted to give this movie a 1, but then I bumped it up to 2 because it succeeds as a feel good movie. <br/><br/>My girlfriend is a football fan, and she liked it. So I think that's pretty much who this movie works for. Anyone who isn't so serious about movies that they puke at all the clichés. And also someone who isn't so serious about football that they become enraged at the lack of realism. Unfortunately I'm both of those things...<br/><br/>Where this movie suffers is that it doesn't try to be unique at all. Instead of relying on the actual drama that is the NFL draft, it takes the cheap route and focuses on all this personal nonsense that no one cares about. The characters are thin, and the cast (outside of a few) isn't strong enough to pull off what little they have to work with. <br/><br/>The Browns GM and staff is ridiculously dumb. People are saying that the trade he made was unrealistic, but that's not true. The real life Browns almost traded 3 1st for Andrew Luck, who is what Bo Callaghan is suppose to be a version of. What makes the Browns GM so inept is his lack of communication, his whole staff's lack of preparation (you scout EVERYONE, not just the guy you expect to take), and how indecisive he is...<br/><br/>The ONLY thing that bails him out after he digs himself into this great big hole, you guessed it, conveniently dumber adversaries. They make the Jaguars GM the dumbest human on earth! Not only does he get fleeced (and if you blame it on him being a rookie, the safe pick was taking the QB) but he's so dumb he doesn't just call the Seahawks and cause a bidding war for his pick. The Seahawks GM should've already been on the phone with the Broncos, the Jags, etc if he wanted the QB so badly. No one just waits for a player to fall, all GMs are proactive, it's the nature of the competition. Because there's no telling which one of the other 31 teams will trade up ahead of you. It's not as simple as ""the Broncos wont take him because they have a QB"" they wont, but they will trade the pick to someone who will. If the kid is valued worth 3 1st, then someone would've offered at least 1 to take him at 4. <br/><br/>Seriously, this movie is just painful if you actually follow the draft... and I'm assuming that's the demographic they were going after when they decided to make a movie about the draft. <br/><br/>I really do hate movies like this. They are fun enough when you're watching them. But as soon as they end and you reflect, it's like swiss cheese, so many holes."

The movie takes place entirely on NFL Draft Day as Costner's character-the Cleveland Browns' GM-pulls off a huge trade with the Seattle Seahawks, and the ""big prize"" is a big-named quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy. He has hours to decide what to do, and he is also impressed with a linebacker who is eligible for the draft.<br/><br/>After wheeling and dealing with some other surprising moves, dealing with the difficult head coach and the other employees, and some hard thinking, Costner finally does what I somehow figured he would. Other things he later did surprised me though.<br/><br/>Any sports fan will like this movie.

","""Draft Day"" is a beat-the-clock comedic drama that nobody should miss! It really is great to see Ivan Reitman back to doing what he does best. Ivan always excels when it comes to directing a bunch of different characters all together at once. You will notice that he is very careful with the casting and that every single part in the movie no matter how large or how small is perfectly cast. The flick really worked for me because the football players played by Foster, Pence, Welling, and Boseman really bring the drama to life and you want to see what happens to them. Boseman is especially strong here and you just know that you are watching an actor that is going to become a superstar. Frank Langella is fantastic and it's easy to see why Reitman keeps putting him in his movies. He is hilarious. Ellen Burstyn, Denis Leary, and Jennifer Garner are also entertaining. The writing here is very good because it builds up very carefully to the exciting final 30 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Holding it all together here is Costner. Costner is just as great as ever and was born for this role. He is always great in sports movies and of course this is no exception.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for both sports and non-sports fans. I look forward to seeing it again.

","NFL GMs aren't as dumb as depicted in this movie. Kevin Costner plays, Sonny, the new GM of the Browns, taking over for his deceased father. They have the 7th pick but are interested in a hot shot QB that is expected to go No 1. Now Sonny waits till draft day to do a little digging on the QB. As if a GM would wait till the last minute. Anyways he trades 3 NO 1's to Seattle for the NO 1 pick. There's a running back the coach wants and a linebacker with a heart of gold on Sonny's radar.<br/><br/>The draft starts and Sonny selects the linebacker. Other GMs contact him and want to know what is wrong with the QB. They show the new GM of the Jaguars to be a complete idiot. Sonny trades for their NO 1 pick at 6. He then contacts Seattle and says he'll trade 6 for the rest of their NO 1's back and a punt returner. So Seattle excepts and gets the QB for a cheaper price that Sonny never wanted. Sonny gets the running back at 7 plus the punt returner and all the Brown's picks back. So as you can see no GM is that dumb to get played like that.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I'd say this is for football fans only. It is rather dull and why did Sonny have to have a pregnant co-worker 30 years his junior as a side plot."
"estebangonzalez10","6","3","5","23 August 2014"," Is Draft Day the Moneyball for football fans? Not exactly
","""How is it that the ultimate prize in the most macho sport invented is a piece of jewelry?""<br/><br/>Draft Day seems like a film aimed towards a specific target audience considering it takes place during one of the most important days for NFL fans. However, it actually spells out everything in such detail (Cleveland home of the Browns, and so on) that it seems its trying to attract audiences who aren't really familiar with the NFL draft or what it all means. Why they decided to take this approach I don't know. Perhaps they were aiming to attract Kevin Costner fans around the globe and hoping that the American Football theme wouldn't be too heavy handed. That explains why the screenwriters tried to introduce familiar dramatic elements such as giving Costner a love interest and having him go through the struggle of dealing with the loss of his father a few days ago. I wish they would have focused this exclusively to NFL fans and didn't spend so much time trying to spell out the rules of the league in order to attract a wider audience. I mean why go through all the trouble of acquiring the rights to use the NFL franchise players and names if you are later going to aim it towards a wider audience that may not know the difference. As a follower of the NFL I would have enjoyed it if they didn't spell everything out, but it was just a minor issue I had with this enjoyable film. Despite not liking the subplot surrounding Costner's character and his relationship with Jennifer Garner's Ali, I really enjoyed the premise revolving around the draft and the tension created as the clock was winding down and a decision had to be made. I think I'm just a bit biased towards sport movies, but I actually had a good time with this film despite all its major flaws. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner comes through in his role as his character has to come to a crossroad in his professional and personal life in less than 24 hours. His charisma comes through and saves a premise that may turn viewers off. With a stronger subplot this film could have been great, but it was just too generic and predictable. Jennifer Garner's character had no depth and she could have been given a stronger role. The film basically relies on Costner's lead performance and he manages to make this movie enjoyable enough for a mild recommendation. The few attempts at comedy involving the intern (played by Griffin Newman) also failed. Draft Day may not rank amongst director Ivan Reitman's best work, but it is an improvement from his recent films. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the football version of Moneyball, it isn't even close, but it's still a small enjoyable film and an opportunity for Kevin Costner fans to see him shine again in a sport film (with which he's had success in the past). Reitman overuses some technical shots at times, like the split screens which had a novel feel to them at first but he repeats them over and over again. The build up surrounding the events of the draft is very intriguing, but the subplot involving the family drama is what pulls Draft Day down."

","I am very surprised by such positive reviews of this movie. Let me start by saying I love football, I love Kevin Costner, and I love Cleveland (although I am not from there). This movie was slow, and the plot was somewhat predictable. I work in athletics (college) and thought that they did a very poor job or portraying the assistant coaches. They made them out to be sexist knuckleheads who were more interested in checking out women than scouting the players. I know men love women, but this was not realistic at all. The female character stories were not interesting at all (although I do like Jennifer Gardner). <br/><br/>I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell short of my expectations."

With that being said, I'm surprised at home much my girlfriend related to the movie (she hates football)! I thought this movie did a wonderful job of meshing both the sports world and all of the pressures on these high paid executives with the challenges and problems they face in everyday life. To me, it helped you feel more like they were people as opposed to highly paid executives. I am no fan of Kevin Costner, but he did a great job in this movie. I always felt like his delivery and everything was weak and in a power position like the GM of the Cleveland Browns, I never thought that would work. But, he pulled it off. With that being said, I think there were much better people for the role.<br/><br/>The storyline is very easy to follow, and while you think you would be able to predict the ending easily, it has some very nice twists. The main thing that I took away from this movie was that there is so much more to the life of a GM then making that pick. From other things on his mind, to keeping his job, it is a constant struggle.<br/><br/>The storyline went from strictly being about the draft and preparation to the second half focusing on more of a love affair and family and how to juggle both.

The draft deals he makes are so confusing I'm still trying to figure them out. But he somehow gets two first round picks and sticks it to two other teams while getting who he wants. Lots of Cleveland scenes and the Browns fans depicted in a bar are a hoot. Don't know why Jennifer Garner's character was even needed and her acting didn't cut it. Her emotional expressions are limited and becoming hackneyed. This story doesn't need a romantic side story and her inclusion didn't add anything. The Browns owner (Langella) and coach (Leary) were much better supporting players and so was Ellen Burstyn as Costner's mother (although her little subplot could have been skipped).

","Oh well, this film is nothing special to rave about, but it is a good time waster and although an obvious aging Kevin Costner (62) who like many aging actors choose to color their hair in an unrealistic vanity color has an unrealistic sexual relationship with the much younger Jennifer Garner (44). I guess that was one way the producers were able to secure Costner in the lead role playing Sonny Weaver Jr., the GM for NFL's perennial losers the Cleveland Browns. Ms. Garner plays the teams financial guru Ali, who besides keeping the Browns books straight, Ali has also been keeping Sonny straight to the point that she is carrying his baby. As I said earlier this must have been another vanity project for Kostner as the stud GM porking the much younger and hotter bean counter Ali. I would have found the story line much more interesting and a lot less jaundiced if Kostner's love interest was someone more around his own age, someone like Michelle Pfeiffer, Jamie Lee Curtis or maybe Kim Basinger. I know this is just a sports film but if I am going to watch a film I want to at least feel as if the story line is somewhat realistic.<br/><br/>Okay so now that Kostner's irritating vanity has been addressed I could not help but be reminded of the player/agent Jerry Maguire in the film of the same name (Jerry Maguire-1996) played by Tom (snooze) Cruise who stuck by his injured wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and so I quickly drew the comparison between Rod Tidwell and that of actor Chadwick Boseman as a college linebacker Vontae Mack. Boseman played his role to perfection not trying to be a scene stealer from the star Kostner but I must say my attention was on Boseman's performance more than anyone else's.<br/><br/>It is also difficult for me to believe that competing GM's could actually pull off the scenario on draft day that Cleveland Brown's GM Sonny Weaver Jr. pulled off in this film. I don't want to have to add this as a spoiler but I will end my review with a common statement made by many sportscasters including that made by ESPN's sportscaster Chris Berman who opened up the film and what he should have said was ""Come on Man!!!!"""
"lmiller-51048","10","2","3","23 July 2016"," What goes on for the teams, players, and draft day in the NFL.
","Draft Day is about the second biggest day in the NFL, behind the Super Bowl. Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner) the general manager of the Cleveland Browns has big decisions to make to draft the best players for the team and the future of Browns football. While this day is occurring many other story lines are playing out including the relationship between Sonny and Ali (Jennifer Gardner) the salary cap manager for the Browns. There is a couple of themes in this movie, however, I think the main theme is the character that we demonstrate and live by is how we are judged. This film has many star actors and real life sport and commentator stars portraying themselves. Coach Penn (Dennis Leary) numerous times projected symbolism with showing his championship ring and saying ""this is what everyone and the Cleveland Browns want."" Winning and being a champion was projected by these scenes. Throughout the movie there are great aerial shots of the cities and stadiums of NFL Teams, in addition to breathtaking skylines captured also. The movie also utilized visual techniques of having side by side shots of two scenes showing the conversations taken place between the actors. There was even a four screen shot during a critical time for the negotiation between the Seattle Seahawks, Cleveland Browns, the war room of the Browns, and the time clock. There were many examples of character observation in Draft Day especially, the $100 story in the playbook where the player the Browns already had demonstrated the strongest character by having the actions, vision, and investment by sending back the money and reading the playbook. Which no one has ever done. One of my favorite observations is the line that Sonny tells his coaches to do. He says, ""figure out what the player has and figure out if it matters or not."" I think he was referring to the character of the prospects they were evaluating to join the team. That line reflects of the actions of Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and the actions he demonstrated in the video they were reviewing. Mack just made a sack and returned the ball for a touchdown. He then gave the ball to his sister in the stands and was penalized for that. His sister died six months later. It was the character of Mack that seals the decision for Sonny to pick him as the first player picked. Once again, character is being conveyed in this film with his action in the game and Sonny's original decision to pick Vontae Mack by the mystery note he writes at the first and is not revealed until he picks Mack. He did what he wanted to do in the first place and not pick the star winning draft pick that everyone wanted him to pick. The game of football is held by the strong characters in which play the game. It's not always what they can do, but who they are and how they act that makes them winners on and off the field."
"feveroftiger","7","2","3","22 December 2015"," Certainly not a typical one!

It focuses on the manager, and it fairly succeeds in being different.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner did a nice job acting in this one, and I really can imagine him in a job like this. He takes the role of Sonny Weaver Jr., general manager of Cleveland Browns, who had finished last season with a really poor record, and the fans are getting tired of it. Though the owner and the coach and pretty much everybody have an idea of what he should do, Costner's fictional character follows his vision through the movie as he ends up being a hero. Nothing less. <br/><br/>This movie is entertaining, unusual, the acting is fair, the football world is well described, and the best of all, it is indeed inspirational."

","Review: I found this to be quite an average movie which is basically what it says on the tin. Kevin Costner plays the manager of the Cleveland Brown's who fights for the top players on Draft Day. After cutting many deals, which everyone doesn't agreed with, he has to trust his  instinct to make the right deals. I'm not a big fan of American Football so I found a lot of the jargon uninteresting. There is some intensity to the film because they have a certain amount of time to draft the right players and there are a lot of people relying on the managers decision. I was left feeling a bit empty when the film finished, but it was good to see Costner back on the big screen, along with some decent cameos. The witty script worked well with the intense situation but I did feel that you have to have some love for the game to really appreciate the film. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Kevin Costner has really been climbing a steep hill to get himself back into the limelight. After flops like Waterworld, The Postman and Swing Vote, he had to take some time out to recharge his batteries, but Hollywood has changed since he last made it big with Robin Hood. He still has screen charisma and a unique style of acting, which worked in this movie, but he's yet to make a big impact. Anyway, this movie really does show how these agents are playing with people lives, without a thought of the impact that there decisions will make on there families. Costner does show some heart by trying his utmost to please everyone, but he still has to crush some individuals dreams in the process. <br/><br/>Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $30million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their intense sport drama/comedies about a NFL manager trying his utmost to get the best deal on Draft Day. 5/10"

","n the most recent of Kevin Costner's sports-based movies, here Mr. Costner plays Sonny, an age-appropriate General Manager of the lowly Cleveland Browns. The movie is set entirely in the day of the annual college draft. Despite the distractions of a recently deceased father (and beloved former Browns coach), a mother who chooses draft day as the only day to hold the memorial service, and a relationship with a office colleague who tells Sonny of her pregnancy on draft day, the film wisely minimizes those tangential subplots (they could have been lost entirely in my opinion) and focuses on the pressures of the wheeling and dealing and the last minute decision-making of the General Manager. Even more wisely, the film lets Mr. Costner do what he does best – serve as the center point for calm amongst all the chaos.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are fictional although some notable cameos are made by players, sportscasters and the commissioner all appearing as themselves. I was a little concerned when I learned that it was the first film endorsed by the NFL (as evidenced by the commissioner's ample screen time) but the endorsement seemingly did not impact the storytelling to any real degree. I suspect if the NFL endorsement had not been obtained, some of the players may have had some more negative traits (PED history, crime and the like) which would not impact the story anyway. While there are no dirty tricks played, there are some wilely negotiations that ring mostly true in style and spirit. The excitement and pressure of being ""on the clock"" are wonderfully portrayed."

","I would not select ""Draft Day"" as the best movie of 2014, especially of what is still available on the cinematic board that we still have to see. Nonetheless, Director Ivan Reitman's sports flick is still worth scouting. Kevin Costner stars as Sonny Weaver Jr., the NFL Cleveland Browns General Manager, who must make some crucial decisions on the team's draft. The film follows Weaver as he weaves himself into a wide array of conflicts & dilemmas during an entire draft day that include not only NFL draft personnel decisions, but also personal agendas of his much younger pregnant girlfriend Ali (who also happens to be the team's CFO) and conflicts with his overbearing mother Barb. Jennifer Garner and Ellen Burstyn did not really score too many thespian points with their mediocre performances as Ali & Barb. However, I would not trade Costner's impressive performance as Weaver for nothing. On paper, the film is not a brilliant piece of filmmaking; which the same could be said of NFL Draft prospects. But if you are a NFL fan, you will touch down and relate to all the football jargon, dealings, and excitement. Oh one extra point before I leave, if you are a Fantasy Football fanatic (present company included), you will even like ""Draft Day"" a bit more. I think you should feel a draft coming in, and don't turn over away from ""Draft Day"" **** Good"

","I remember when my Vikings decided not to pick Warren Sapp in the first round because they had concerns about some marijuana use at one time. They ended up getting some other sap who lasted one year. The former is Hall of Fame material. So when we get to see Kevin Costner, the general manager, wheel and deal on draft day, it's not so far fetched. What bothered me were that among the other general managers such weak kneed, fearful characters. Granted, they are under tremendous pressure, but they seemed pretty poor choices for this job. That said, it was really fun to watch the whole process unfold in a kind of docudrama way with the likes of Chris Berman and Mel Kiper around. The big show at Radio City Music Hall. The interaction between Costner and players he is interested in, the tradition in his family (he once fired his own father, but that's another issue) and the ""friendships"" among the general managers trying to outfox one another make this fun. There is a sappy romance and a bunch of family pressure that I could have done without. The scene concerning the father's ashes on the day of the draft is idiotic. Things are also a bit contrived but aren't most movies? Costner is fairly convincing, butting heads with his head coach and the other members of the Cleveland Brown brain trust. It is suspenseful and worth watching."
"DareDevilKid","8","2","3","27 August 2014"," A Triumphant Sports-Drama
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.9/5 stars<br/><br/>A highly inspirational sports film in the truest sense. ""Draft Day"" has all the archetypal characteristics of a good sports tale without resorting to the usual clichés plaguing such films. Well, it does have a few clichés such as the triumph of the underdog and the never-say-die attitude of the protagonist, but then again, is it possible for any sports film to leave an impact sans certain clichés. The sports-drama is one genre where filmmakers find it most difficult to steer clear of certain kinds of scenes and moments, but a good writer knows how to construct such scenes and a competent Director knows how to handle their narration, so that the audience is left with a distinctive presentation of something they've seen before. It's here where Director, Ivan Reitman, and writers, Scott Rothman and Rajiv Joseph, score big time, as they've shrewdly pruned many familiar, unavoidable scenes and presented them in a revamped manner. Sample this; when Costner is giving the all too familiar motivational speech – a staple in sports films – he doesn't do so before the climax, but during the climax itself; at the very end. And he delivers it with with some unique quips, witty dialogues, and some memorable one-liners thrown in for added measure. More importantly, the speech is as much for himself as it is for his coterie; something arguably never seen in a sports film before, and this is just one of many well-written, brilliantly-directed scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>""Draft Day"" tell a fictional tale of America's popular event, the ""NFL Draft"" - now almost a part of the nation's folklore – and how it can change the lives of both young football prospects and also seasoned professionals – for better or for worse. Sonny Weaver, the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, has the opportunity to rebuild his team when he trades for the number one pick. He must decide what he's willing to sacrifice on a life-changing day for a few hundred young men with NFL dreams. Along the way he also has to settle issues in his personal life with his pregnant girlfriend, Ali Parker - a financial lawyer also working with the Browns – his mother, who's only wishes are her son's attention and his responsibility to fulfill his father's dying wish, and finally his own reconciliation with the unresolved problems he faced with his father. To know how all this culminates on one fateful night and results in life-changing repercussions for a number of individuals you'll have to see this immensely entertaining film.<br/><br/>What elevates the drama, overall feel, and those familiar goosebumps we get from watching a great sports film are its performances, and ""Draft Day"" boasts of a number of fine, crackling performances by a top-notch ensemble cast (the casting director deserves special credit for this). Led by the ever-dependable Kevin Costner – who's lost none of his effortless, infectious charm – the cast draws us right into proceedings and ensures that we care about the outcome of their story arcs. While Costner competently shoulders the weight of the film as its leading man, he's surrounded by an impressively talented assortment of supporting actors such as Chadwick Boseman (you literally feel for his hopes and emotions), Denis Leary, Wade Williams, and legendary actors like Frank Langella and Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn. Even Jennifer Garner is surprisingly good as Costner's love interest. The entire cast seems to feed of each other and the cracker-jack of a script handed to them to effectively bring out the Director's vision on screen.<br/><br/>""Draft Day"" is an exceptionally enjoyable film with immense repeat value. Though it's simply constructed and follows a by-the-numbers routine, it still takes a highly unconventional route for a sports film, as in all the drama happens off the field, and moreover, it packages itself as something fresh and revamped. The only other sports film that comes to mind, which took such an unconventional route yet triumphed was ""Moneyball"". ""Draft Day"" is a treat for fans of American football, fans of sports-dramas, and just about anybody who loves inspirational movies."

","Just when you think Kevin Costners career is on a downward slope he turns it round again in the right way possible with one of the best sporting movies I have witnessed, I rank this alongside another Costner great in field of dreams and Brad pitts brilliant moneyball. Costner was fantastic in this role he was obviously made for and ably supported by many other great cast member performances. The story of the 2014 Nfl draft where he dares and risks his job to get the team he wants. Its an original film focusing on the final 14 hours leading upto the draft, the deals and backroom politics what takes place behind the scenes the loyal fans never see. It was tense and a joy to watch from start to finish."
"shoobe01-1","7","1","1","7 March 2019"," Nearly great sports procedural. Nearly.
","I have long thought that ""procedural"" is a broader category than it is given credit for. Everyone believes in police procedurals, a few admit there are medical procedurals, but I think there can be anything. This is a Sports Procedural.<br/><br/>And it works as such. A drama, wrapped around and constrained by the minutiae of the process such as the time constraint.<br/><br/>It even has a sort of ""mystery"" of discovering what the right choice is, and why. It works for me.<br/><br/>I assume it was set up for an international market as some clever plan to make everyone love American Football, by over-explaining stuff, but I think the intros to each city, etc. worked well actually. I assume some are annoyed by this however.<br/><br/>The core actors do a pretty good job. Costner is a bit too typical Costner but pretty good, Garner is... well, her best role is certainly credit card commercials unfortunately, but Denis Leary is excellent (and not too much like himself), Frank Langella is surprisingly nuanced for the Evil Businessman. Aside from Sam Elliott who is always awesome, the supporting cast is really, really hit and miss, with way too many misses. I suspect - knowing nothing of football - a lot were stunt casting, or gifts to the league. A few people even seemed like they should have had lines, but were edited out because they were just too awful.<br/><br/>All in all, a pretty good story, a pretty good script, but let down by some poor acting, and some odd editing choices (oh lord, that split screen crap)."
"hmservant","6","1","1","23 October 2015"," Slightly above-average film with limited appeal
","As much as it pains me to write, this movie is not all that great. I bought the blu-ray disc because it had so much going for it: it is about the Cleveland Browns football organization; it entails a draftee from the Ohio State Buckeyes, and it was apparently the previously top un-filmed script on blcklst.com, a website for film scripts. Sounds really, really good paper, which is why I was left a little flat after watching it. I think there were a couple reasons for this. One, the movie isn't at all about the triumph of the Cleveland Browns on the football field. Rather, it is about a victory for the Browns in (as the title of the film would suggest) the NFL draft wars. Exciting stuff? Uh, no. Contrast that with ""Major League,"" the beloved movie from 1989 about the Cleveland Indians baseball team. That movie, much to the delight of us Ohioans, culminated with Tribe victories on the baseball diamond. ""Draft Day"" ends as the new draftees get set to take the field with the rest of the Browns. This is somewhat akin to what ""The Avengers"" would have been like if the film had ended immediately after Nick Fury assembled the superhero team: a little anti-climactic, to say the least. Another reason ""Draft Day"" fails to generate much excitement is that the majority of the film is predicated on phone calls. Guys in Cleveland are talking to guys in Seattle, Kansas City, Madison and elsewhere. Who wants to watch guys doing business over the phone for two hours? Even though the filmmakers acknowledge this and did some innovative things with editing, it is just a bad way to forward the action of the movie. One more aspect of the movie I found a little hard to swallow was the enthusiasm the draft picks show for playing in Cleveland. I was more than a little incredulous: I mean, no one really wants to be a Cleveland Brown. We fans love the team, but let's be honest about that. No other fans deserve the moniker ""die-hard"" more than Cleveland Browns fans. The Browns haven't won a championship in fifty years and, for all we know, it likely won't for another fifty years. We hope for the best, but realistically cannot expect our Browns to attract a following outside Ohio. Despite the aforementioned infractions, I more or less enjoyed the movie. Because I live in a suburb of Columbus, where the Buckeyes play, and have been a fan of the Cleveland Browns since the days of Brian Sipe, Ozzie Newsome and Dave Logan, the appeal of this film was obvious. How can one really go wrong with a film about the Buckeyes and the Browns, has unprecedented access to the NFL and even features cameos by Jim Brown and Bernie Kosar? I recommend the film really only for die-hard Browns and Kevin Costner fans."
"Sandcrane","6","1","1","3 September 2015"," Scores a field goal
","This evenly paced sports film will not rank as one of the best movies in its genre but it is overall solid as a stand alone movie. I enjoyed the acting of Costner, Leary and the athletes depicted as being the draft picks. The visuals on panning to the stadiums and front offices of Buffalo, Houston, Kansas City and Jacksonville was a nice touch. The background stories away from the football theme did not gain traction and the personal relationship between Costner and Jennifer garner did not seem real. If you are not a football fan I would skip the movie all together. The biggest issue for me is that that the draft pick interaction between Seattle, Cleveland and Jacksonville seemed way to far fetched. I do not believe it to be realistic. I will give it the benefit of doubt however since I do know that the trades on draft day can be amazing and one sided.(Hershel walker to Vikings from Dallas as one example) Draft day marches down the field well but it needs to settle for a field goal.

","Draft Day is completely successful in bringing in a never before seen take on the NFL Draft, one of the most important days in the NFL season. The movie takes us to different locations and shows us what happens behind the curtains during the Draft. And I thought it was interesting as hell and the parts of the movie regarding the football aspect were very enjoyable.<br/><br/>But I can't rate this movie higher though for many reasons. The main reason is that the story is both ridiculous and predictable. No spoilers, but by the first 10 minutes of the film I already knew how it was going to end. Most of the acting is pretty mediocre, too. You get good performances from Kevin Costner and Dennis Leary and some other ones too, but for the most part, the people that play the players and managers were pretty awful, for the most part. I hated the guy that played the intern, that guy was terrible in the movie. Draft Day also tends to drift into the sentimental sappy side, when it really shouldn't. Some things really should have been cut out of the movie. This is a football movie! So gives us more football and less sappiness, please.<br/><br/>Overall, Draft Day, although heavily flawed, is still pretty entertaining for football fans, in general."

","The title doesn't lie. This film is all about the NFL draft and draft day to a mind numbing degree. Being a true fan that actually watches all rounds of the real draft, I was interested but I could see non-football people's eyes just glazing over. <br/><br/>They tried to hammer father/mother and relationship issues in to Costner's character along the way but it feels tacked on. It's as if the producers pulled the writer aside and forced it in to the script after it was finished. It's clear that the NFL was in full support of this movie but that spun in to an almost propaganda type cooperation. Also, the actual draft moves made by Costner are insane but they call it out themselves as if that makes it more plausible. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is an interesting effort but one long ESPN/NFL commercial with no depth."
"avsroxbronxfan","1","4","9","1 October 2014"," A MAJOR slap in the face to football fans anywhere.
","I am a major Denver Broncos fan, and when I went to see this film, I was with plenty of other Broncos fans in the theater. I don't know what they thought of it, but I strongly feel this is a slap in the face to football fans anywhere. All that happens in the film is the Cleveland Browns GM Sonny Weaver (Kevin Costner) felt under pressure to make a splash in the draft, so he trades 3 first round picks for the 1st overall pick to draft Wisconsin QB Bo Callahan. My problem with this part so far is that GM's are supposed to do what's best for the team; they're team first executives. But here's the film's biggest problem. Between the time the NFL draft starts and when Sonny made that trade with Seattle, and that is quite a lot of the film's running time I will add, he does more research on Bo. He even says in the film ""We're still gonna have to take another look at this kid and everything there is to know about him before I can feel good about what we just risked."" So he traded 3 first round picks to draft a player he doesn't know much about, and after doing more research on him he decides not to take him. NO YOU STUPID WRITERS!!!!! GM'S SHOULD ALREADY KNOW TO DO MUCH RESEARCH ON PLAYERS BEFORE TAKING THEM IN THE DRAFT, LET ALONE TRADING UP FOR THEM!! Draft Day is a badly paced coming of age story which doesn't work for my stated reason. Sure, there's a subplot about a pregnant girlfriend and his dead dad, but those subplots go absolutely nowhere. You could edit them out of the film completely and it wouldn't change a thing. We also have the draft where Sonny cons other stupid GM's, and even gets his draft picks he traded to Seattle back. How did he do that? He got the 6th pick in the draft while Seattle had 7, Bo Callahan was still there, and Seattle traded 3 firsts to move up ONE SPOT. MORONS!!! THIS FILM IS SO UNREALISTIC. There's also another element that annoys me. They have made-up players as well. The Cleveland Browns starting QB in real life as of October 2014 is Brian Hoyer. In this film, it's Brian Drew. All the players in the draft are made-up as well. Even Arian Foster, an ACTUAL NFL player, is playing a fictional character known as Ray Jennings, and the Browns draft him. (Yes, they end up putting Arian Foster on the Cleveland Browns. BITE ME!!) If this happened 40 years later in 2054 or something like that, I could excuse that. But the film's biggest error in this step is their continuity and lack of football knowledge. They have a scene where they blatantly mention Peyton Manning. They then talk about the Denver Broncos and say we have a made-up player at QB named Harrett. Contradictory much? Why not have New England or Green Bay with Harrett? Neither Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers were mentioned in the film, so by their logic, they can not exist. They mentioned Peyton, then acted like he doesn't exist. This film is pathetic, stupid, and really didn't need to be made. This isn't just one of the worst movies of 2014, nor is it just one of the worst sports movies ever made, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen PERIOD. Skip this trash and watch Moneyball."

He has a chance to get a first draft pick from the Seattle Seahawk but has to give up a lot to get him. That is far from the end of the story. As the day progresses deals are made and unmade.

"Michael-s-dugan","1","3","6","30 January 2015"," Terry Crews and Sean Combs couldn't save this
","I will start with the things I found accurate in this movie. I find it very believable that the Browns would have an owner that is a twit and would be willing to make silly transactions to get a QB in the 1st round that is destined to be a bust. I found it wildly believable that the Browns would trade 3 years of first rounders to take a guy they could have gotten had they done nothing or (gasp) still have gotten had they even traded back a few spots. I find it incredibly believable that Jacksonville would have a GM that is totally clueless and panics like Dewey is loose in the coliseum. Dewey loves sugar! <br/><br/>Nothing else in this movie was believable or likable. <br/><br/>The script was terrible from the perspectives of character development, NFL knowledge, conversation, tension, and plot development. There are no characters in this movie to which you want to develop an attachment. All are flat and two dimensional. Several characters are in the movie for no reason other than distraction like Mom, girlfriend, ex wife, intern, etc. The NFL stuff, where to even begin? I won't get in to it. If you are an NFL wonk you see all the stupidity. If you don't care about football you won't care about the lack of realism. <br/><br/>For the rest of the script where is the central conflict? Is the conflict sticking with a decision you had already made while your mom is in the building? Perhaps the conflict was how did the Browns owner get from midtown to Teeterborough, catch a flight to Cleveland and then drive to his office in a matter of 20-40 minutes of real time? Perhaps he was having a gun battle with angry fans along the way? Perhaps I just wrote the script for Transporter 8? <br/><br/>To go with the bad script the direction and acting were stiff and formulaic. Granted what can you expect when you cast Crash Davis in the lead? And I refuse to believe Ivan Reitman directed this. I believe he took the check and then sent the neighbour kids out to direct. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this. If you need to see a football movie that then throw in The Program."

","I like sports, but I really love the athletes(or anyone who makes a living in ""human performance"")and coaches and managers. What separates the good from the great? Where does fierce competitiveness come from that turns a mildly talented athlete into a superstar? And coaches and managers--without STRATEGY, even the most talented athletes can't win, whether it's one-on-one in a boxing ring or an entire team on a playing field (and on the bench). I'm one of those people that DOES like the ""up close and personal"" bits during the Olympics. I like to read articles in SI about high schoolers and college kids and follow them in later years.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is superb in this role, but like some other reviewers, I could have done with a little less soap opera. I really didn't know that much about the NFL draft, but this was almost a nail biter. the director and actors make you feel the tension, the anguish, the joy, and at the end, most of all the HOPE. This doesn't wrap up nicely with the Browns going to the Super Bowl--after all, it's not about the game, it's about the DAY.<br/><br/>It would be nice to think that there are more GM's out there like Cistner's character, Sonny Weaver. I have know many, but I have known many more of the other ilk, as we probably all have. And Sonny's no angel--he has his strengths and weaknesses, just like the athletes he is considering and everyone else around him.<br/><br/>The photography of the stadiums is stunning and the editing keeps you engaged throughout. Don't think TOO hard about this being a football movie and enjoy it for what it is, a day, a REALLY IMPORTANT DAY, but just a day nonetheless in the lives of those connected somehow, in many different ways, to the NFL Draft."

Sam Elliott (Hulk) as Badgers Head Coach Moore also Stars Ellen Burstyn(Iron Man 3) as Barb Weaver, Tom Welling(Smallville) as Ryan Drew ,Rosanna Arquette(Pulp Fiction) as Angie, Terry Crews(Get Smart) as Earl Jennings,Frank Langella(Frost/Nixon) as Browns Owner Anthony Molina, David Ramsey(Arrow) as Thompson, Chadwick Boseman(42) As Vontae Mack, Josh Pence(The Dark Knight Rises) as Heisman Trophy Winner Bo Callahan also featuring Special appearances from Houston Texans Runningback Arian Foster, NFL Network Anaylst's Jon Gruden,Rich Eisen,Chris Berman, Jim Brown, Bernie Kosar and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The film was great it showed that drafting isn't a Player isn't simple as is to us fans there are whole lot variables a pick can be First Round Gem or Bust also really enjoyed seeing the inter workings of the front office that most the NFL General Managers are key in teams success as well and get a lot pressure from not only the Owner(s) but by the fans themselves it was also it was interesting to see when A Team Trades Picks to To Another Team that both teams hinges on that and it's not a split second decision many variables are needed to see if these Picks will help determine the Teams future in terms of winning,Playoff Appearances.it was also cool seeing the veteran Players and coaches perspective of the draft knowing if someone drafted a first rounder Quarterback he might take over that players position also seeing A Coach might want to stick to his veterans than draft a rookie quarterback also it was interesting to see sometimes The General Manager / Head Coach have different Opinions on the teams future and success. The film was one of my favorite Sports Movies also great direction by Ivan Reitman(Ghosterbusters), Great score by John Debney(Iron Man 2) and Great Costume design By Frank L. Flemming(Machine Gun Preacher) all in all its one of my favorite Sports and Costner films and great seeing the inter workings of the Front Offices of The NFL 7/10"

"fioril-13031","7","0","0","30 April 2020"," A dramatic look into the NFL draft from the view of the Cleveland Browns GM
","Draft Day is a sports movie that allows the viewer to get a ""behind the scenes"" look into the National Football League and its annual event of drafting college players into the NFL. While this film has elements of drama/ love story genre, it still is a sports film at heart.
We follow the day in the life of the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns Sonny Weaver (Played by Kevin Costner) on the day of the NFL draft. Throughout the film, you get insight into all the decisions, people, and outcomes that Sonny must consider while the future of the Cleveland Browns hangs in the balance. Do you take the risk of the player who has been in trouble while in college? Do you replace the aging but proven quarterback on your team for the hotshot college rookie? Do you go with a defensive player or focus on offense? It is during this roller coaster of a film that we delve into all these questions and more.
And don't worry if you are not a sports fan because there are elements of drama and sexual tension between the General Manager Sonny and his salary guru Ali (Played by Jennifer Garner). Not only that element, but you also have the proven Head Coach Penn (played by Denis Leary) clashing with the GM Sonny over which players they think is best. It gets so intense at one point that Coach Penn lights Sonny's desk on fire!
You may have seen other sports movies like Hoosiers, Bull Durham, or Field of Dreams, but the drama and storyline in this film have a completely different feel than those films had. One of the most enjoyable ways the director (Ivan Reitman) was able to capture the drama of the back and forth conversations on the phone between teams and players and even parents of players, was a unique fade in and out between the people involved in the discussions. It is a method that I have never seen in a film, and it really helped show the reactions on both ends of the calls.
If you are looking for a movie that has sports, love, and drama with an insider's look at the NFL, then you can check all those boxes with this great question of who would you pick for your team in the NFL draft?"

","I've been an avid fan of the NFL for most of my life, and find great joy whenever watching a game. However, I've never been one of those guys who follows the off-season stuff, especially the draft. Since I'm not a college sports fan, I don't know any of the players, so watching a draft feels pointless to me. As a result, I was not all that hopeful that Draft Day (the film) would click for me. The NFL draft has always seemed like such a dull process and I could not see how they would make an interesting movie out of it. I should have trusted the magic of Kevin Costner in a sports film, which has only failed me once. I found this movie delightful. It presents the draft as a fascinating chess match that requires a ton of planning, and a team of advisers who try to explore every possible angle. Even with all that preparation, when the clock starts ticking it can rattle even the most seasoned professionals, and require a lot of thinking on your toes. I know dramatic twists like we see in this film are probably few and far between, but it's still fun to explore the possibility.<br/><br/>There were a couple aspects of Draft Day that didn't click quite as well for me. The biggest problem was the family relationship subplot. It worked to show some of our main character's history, and it did establish one more point of pressure that he had to contend with while trying to do his job. However, it didn't quite have the impact on the central plot that I would have liked, and the payoff with his mother at the end lacked the strength of the other dramatic moments. It didn't bother me that any of this was included in the film, but I wish it added more to the story. My other minor nitpick is simply the Cleveland Browns of it all. Believe me, as a lifelong Detroit Lions fan, I know what it's like to root for a franchise that can never get it right. But having the Browns as the central team in this story had me chuckling more than once. It's just hard to buy into the fact that any manager (even in a fictional film) could do something special enough to make them a winning team. Needless to say, these are fairly minor nitpicks. I loved Draft Day, and I'm considering a re-watch soon."

","An American friend of mine had recommended this to me to watch a year or so ago when I was talking to her about the Aussie Rules draft period that was going on at that time. I finally got around to doing so recently.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie, which gave insight into the huge pressure people in the sports industry can be under sometimes - especially with American sports that are incredibly wealthy, compared to our little Aussie Rules com. It also had the personal side which Costner's character was having to balance with that pressure of work.<br/><br/>There is really some 'wizardry' that seems to go into draft and trade periods in Aussie Rules, and the same can be seen in this movie as well. It shows that people must do their due diligence in investigating potential draft prospects, and it'd be very easy to make mistakes that will turn out to be extremely costly (both on a personal level and at a team level, which can affect millions of fans).<br/><br/>It's funny to think that something that might seem completely uninteresting to some (how players are drafted into teams) could be made into a great dramatic story, but this movie achieved that."

","If you are a football fan, NFL not MLS sorry, you must watch ""Draft Day"". It must be one of the most exciting, heart pounding, teeth grinding sports movies I have watched in a long time! ""Remember the Titans"" level. The story line is great, the drama feels real and just an all-around feel-good movie.
It THE day. Draft day, to me, is the second most important day in football. The Superbowl being the first. This is the day your team decides its future. The gamble of your first pick on any available player that can make or break your franchise. What a rush!
Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner), is the General Manager for the Cleveland Browns. With the major pressure of the draft, after a mediocre year, there is more problems in his life than just the draft. The owner, Frank Langella, wants to make a splash in the draft. Well Sonny has his own ideas. Add that along with the new coach and it's a perfect combination of someone's feeling being hurt! What do you do? Go with your boss or please the coach of the team? What about your own thoughts on the player you want? Well today is the day. Crunch time!
My favorite part of the movie is how realistic the draft chess match is. Trading picks, trading players, and making moves! That what excites me about the draft. When that clock starts, will you be ready? With ten minutes given to each team, the first round of the draft has to be heart stopping for some teams.
What makes this movie so great is how easily relatable it is. Even though these are people of power and money, you feel connected in the real life struggles they face. Even the players being drafted come from so many different backgrounds. I can only imagine what it would be like to sit at the table at the draft as a player waiting to hear your name called."

Them moving to the cast; The Black Panther, Electra, the father of Gwen Stacy, and the man who raised Superman. So many recognizable and respected people just abound. A film where a perfect Dennis Leary is nearly forgotten means there must be a lot else going on.
And for the record, Kevin Costner is a treasure. If there need be evidence; I could say Untouchables, Silverado, For Love of the Game. I would then bring up his own masterpiece, Dances With Wolves. My heart would then send forth Bull Durham, maybe his best work. Of course, saving the best for last, Field of Dreams must be regarded as a stunning achievement in the medium. How many legendary scenes can one movie contain? It reminds one of the The Dark Knight, which had so many transcendent times that blow all other works away."
"Uriah43","8","0","0","26 September 2019"," An Exciting Film which Keeps the Tension Going from Start to Finish
","This film begins with the general manager for the Cleveland Browns by the name of ""Sonny Weaver Jr."" (Kevin Costner) being told by his girlfriend ""Ali"" (Jennifer Garner) that she is pregnant. It is then learned that the Cleveland Browns have the seventh draft pick and that Sonny's secret plan is to select a linebacker by the name ""Volante Mack"" (Chadwick Boseman) at that time. However, the owner of the Cleveland Browns, ""Anthony Miller"" (Frank Langella) essentially tells Sonny that he expects him to excel in this year's draft which subsequently puts pressure on Sonny to do something dramatic-or else. As a result, Sonny accepts an offer from the Seattle Seahawks to acquire the number 1 pick overall for Cleveland's first three draft choices next year. This infuriates a number of people in his front office who believe that he has traded away the Cleveland Brown's future for a quarterback that they didn't necessarily need. To make matters even worse, Sonny secretly believes this as well and becomes determined to fix the problem one way or another. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that those viewers who are unfamiliar with the intricacies and pressure of an NFL draft may not quite appreciate the high stakes tension that goes into this particular situation. Fortunately, Kevin Costner puts in an excellent performance and maintains the tension start-to-finish. In addition to that, there is an interesting twist at the end which ties many of the loose ends together quite well. In any case, I really enjoyed this film and because of that I have rated it accordingly."

Kind of Transfer Deadline Day: The Movie, this watchably slight sports drama finds the manager of mid-level football team the Cleveland Browns taking risky chances to land the wisest picks of the college draft while his personal life collapses around him. So it's Moneyball directed by Ivan Reitman, light on its toes, but missing the bite and smarts of that Aaron Sorkin-infused cracker.

A more fun film could have been quirky die hard draft fans showing up expecting their team to get Ricky Williams and winding up with McNabb.

","""Draft Day"" is a movie with Kevin Costner, telling the story of a NFL executive working for the Cleveland Browns who prepares for the annual Draft Day and gets in real trouble when he agrees on what seems to be a fabulous deal but turns out to be a dangerous trade when the prime candidate shows some dark sides and the coach disagrees on the deal.<br/><br/>This is indeed a strong movie because it manages to create a thriller out of seemingly rather usual executive actions and makes you root for a main character that is, objectively spoken, not the most sympathetic guy. Personally I would have preferred had they taken an actual example of a real draft rather than create a fictional scenario but nonetheless this turns out to be a better thriller than many titles that include horrible crimes and chasing scenes. Of course this one also comes with a set of A-class actors but it would also work without them and that deserves respect.<br/><br/>All in all I was never bored and really wanted to see how the plot turns out in the end. Of course you should have some basic knowledge of the sport or at least some interest but this could also be a good way to introduce you to the fascination of the game and everything that surrounds it."

","This film was well-acted and competently shot, but it definitely can't be called a great sports film. Great sports films transcend the sport they portray. At many points, Draft Day finds itself challenged to even transcend the annual event of the NFL draft. <br/><br/>Indeed, at times the film felt like a mere vehicle for promoting the TV extravaganza that the NFL has made of its annual rookie selection process. <br/><br/>I was certainly entertained by the concept and plot, as I'm a fairly engaged NFL fan and an avid follower of the off-season moves that NFL personnel offices make in order to improve their teams. However, I think that this film is entertaining to people like me and no one else, which is unfortunate. There was real human drama and consequence that could have been added to the film if a few of the other characters were better developed. While Costner's character was fairly well fleshed out, Chadwick Boseman's, Dennis Leary's, and most importantly Jennifer Garner's were not, and instead felt like mere placeholders (and at times even sports movie clichés). <br/><br/>In my estimation, the director and writers missed a prime opportunity to show the personal stress and grueling work hours that can accompany the high-profile positions these characters each hold in a multi-billion-dollar industry. A few scenes of how the demands of professional football impact their family relationships and how their lives are seasonally consumed with the work of running the organization (and in the case of Boseman's character, of trying to break into an industry that will batter his body but allow him to acquire wealth and security for his family). The scenes in Draft Day that attempt to touch on these issues are superficial at best, and didn't effectively convey the struggles these people face, even while they are scrutinized and shamed by the general public, and hounded by the media. POSSIBLE SPOILER: the scene that did partially touch on the fan reaction side was so detached as to be comical, with fans protesting outside the stadium of a GM who made a decision they didn't like.<br/><br/>In all, I would call Draft Day a missed opportunity - The script was good, the cast was excellent, and there is a hint of the high stakes that the NFL Draft can encompass, but the movie fails to do anything to get the attention of those who aren't already at least casual fans of the NFL and it's Draft event. And in that, I would say that it even fails in its attempt (and I would argue that this is the real goal of the film in the first place) to attract an expanded viewership to the NFL's Draft Day event. For my part, even as a staunch fan of NFL football and professional sports personnel machinations, I was mostly bored while watching Draft Day."

That is what Draft Day does as well. This is maybe not a 10/10 movie, but I think it desserves some support out of all the bad reviews in here. It doesn't desserve a rating under 7.5.

","There are some holes in the story, such as the owner, Molina, being able to travel almost instantaneously hundreds of miles, and having an unexplained change of mind regarding Weaver's moves, but all in all, this is a good movie. Kevin Costner gives an excellent performance as a football general manager who has to weigh loyalty versus expediency as he tries to put together a winning team. The movie does a good job in conveying the sense of pressure as teams compete with each other to parley draft picks. The movie shows how a mere rumor can effect the draft, and the critical role of the general manager in trying to separate fiction from fact when determining who to select. The movie also does a good job in dramatizing what happens when confidence in the general manager erodes. The movie shows the general manager, Weaver, making some really questionable moves, such as trading away THREE future number one draft picks for a number one draft pick that the GM has not fully vetted. Also, other stuff that's pure Hollywood is the quarterback trashing the GM's office (never would happen), one GM calling another GM an expletive, the GM's mother berating her son while he's deal making, the head coach negotiating behind the GM's back, and the GM having a sexual relationship with the team's financial officer (who just so happens to be a young and attractive lady). Nevertheless, the movie's basic story line, a general manager operating under pressure to make decisions that effects an entire football team, remains intact. For that reason, this is a movie that is worth watching. Just remember, however, that this movie is fiction."
"Ben-Hibburd","7","0","0","27 September 2017"," Draft Day Review.
","Draft Day is a quaint, feel good sports drama, that focuses on the more mundane backroom elements that go into running a professional sports team. The film stars Kevin Costner as Sonny Weaver Jr. the general manager of the Cleveland Browns. At the start of the film Sonny is given an opportunity to trade his number 1 pick for three consecutive years, to have the ability to sign a highly rated Quarterback in this years draft. After getting cold feet upon accepting the deal, he spends the rest of the day wheeling and dealing with other GM's to get the best deal for his team and come out on top by days end.<br/><br/>Right away it's safe to say that this film will alienate a large chuck of its audience. Especially those outside the U.S or those that don't follow the NFL. Ivan Reitman who directs this film understands this, so to compensate for this he uses a-lot of exposition to educate his audience. This is a useful tool for some, but for me, as someone that is a fan of American football I found it ear-gratingly cheesy. The fact that a GM needs reminding what number Tom Brady was picked at, felt silly. There were a couple of exposition heavy scenes like this that had me rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>Whilst the exposition at times was irritating, I do understand why it was needed. The fact that Ivan Reitman was able to make a sports film that contained no sporting action, as fun and engaging as this film was, is a fantastic achievement. The screenplay whilst fairly standard manages to run along at a decent pace. Never at any moment did Draft day feel boring or dull, even if it was predictable in it's resolutions.<br/><br/>Where the film triumphs is in Kevin Costners performance. Costner is at his charismatic best in this film. He brings warmth and empathy to his character that makes you root for him to come out on top by days end. He's also surrounded by terrific performances from a great supporting cast that features Jennifer Garner, Dennis Leary, Frank Langella to name but a few.<br/><br/>Draft Day may be lacking in dramatic tension that most sports films have, but what it does do is shine a spotlight on an aspect of sport that isn't as sexy or cool to talk about. The fact that Reitman was able to have me root for the backroom staff is a wonderful achievement in my book."
"SimonJack","8","0","0","15 August 2017"," Realistic look at wheeling and dealing on NFL draft day
","""Draft Day"" is quite unusual as a sports movie. It doesn't show any of the cast actually playing or coaching in practice or a game. It does have some film clips of great NFL games of the past. What it's about is the behind the scenes big business of building teams each year during the NFL draft. It includes aspects of caring about players, talent scouts and searches, player agents, owners, coaches and team managers.<br/><br/>And, for the realism of this film, it includes scenes that show some of the NFL stadiums around the U.S. Other realism is added with the on-site filming of the 2013 NFL draft in New York City, and scripted reports by TV sports show hosts Chris Berman and others. While some may be put off by the backstage wrangling and big business aspects of professional football, this gives a glimpse of what that must be like. Without the NFL draft to regulate and help level the field for various franchises to build their teams, the sport would be chaotic and probably dwindle to just a few teams that had the backing to afford the salaries and costs. <br/><br/>The cast all perform well. Kevin Costner, as Sonny Weaver Jr., gives a real sense of the angst a manager must go through around the time of the annual NFL draft. All of the cast give good performances. I thought it somewhat strange and out of character, though, for Sonny's mother to insist on spreading her husband's ashes on the field on the most trying day of the year for her son. As a football wife and widow, she surely would have waited until the next day. <br/><br/>The film has a sense of reality about it. It's refreshing for not being laden with foul language. It has romance without the frequent Hollywood nudity or sex. It reflects the growing modern view of intimate relationships, including having children, with no thoughts or commitments for marriage. <br/><br/>Most sports fan should enjoy this film, and others should find it interesting. It may help non-enthusiasts to a little better understand the scope of professional football. My favorite line in the film is Ali (played by Jennifer Garner) telling Sonny, ""There's no such thing as a sure thing. At the end of the day, all that matters is what do you think?"" (sic)"

","Draft Day (2014) is a film for which is mainly centered for the most avid of sports football fans alike. Being described as a ""sports"" film but this is technically not a sports film in that it is more so based on the event of the draft than the actual sport of football. Football is mainly very popular in American and the box office numbers of this film very evidently show that, as this film was non- existent in the foreign market (making less than $1 million). This is a main reason why this film has been considered a box office flop since most of the money it made was domestic, and with a considerable large budget of $25 million it was difficult in making back the money. Had this film had a better outing, it most likely would have been greenlit for a sequel as the ending of the film and overall tone suggested a sequel could have happened.<br/><br/>About the film, Draft Day is quality in entertainment and the writing is quite well. Centering on Kevin Coaster, portraying a general manager of the Cleveland Browns (a team with many misfortunes within the last decade plus). Draft Day shows the behind the scenes of how much pressure is on the GM as well as the team in making the right choice to better their football team. It plays out somewhat of a documentary but remains entertaining and intriguing due to well thought out subplots and overall interest of the event. <br/><br/>Being better than expected, there was a certain level of drama and intrigued throughout and the results did leave audiences well put. Such as we are engaged in the decisions the GM was to make for their team, even though we are not fans of the particularly team. We wanted to know which player Coaster's character would select in the draft, and it was not as predictable as one though, which is a plus. Another good thing is there wasn't any forced cheesy humor that we see a lot in these type of sports drama, this film kept it authentic and it worked. Memorable quote said by Coaster: ""No one can stop a ticking clock, the great ones always find a way to slow it down."" Overall, since Draft Day did not perform as well as it could have, this film remains for quality avid football fans and is quite underrated at that."

","This is one of the better efforts I've seen that depicts what goes on behind the scenes in the National Football League during the actual draft. The film starts with a quote which describes everything you need to know before digging in:<br/><br/>""32 Teams, 7 Rounds, 224 Young men who today are about to become players in the National Football League. A day where lives are changed, fates are decided, dynasties are born. And the clock is always ticking. Of course, I'm talking about draft day.""<br/><br/>Kevin Cosner is the real star here, giving an outstanding performance as the General Manager of a losing Cleveland Browns franchise. He is under an unbelievable amount of pressure to choose the best plan of action AND draft picks in order to correct the string of losses and inevitably save his own job.<br/><br/>That's really all there is to it. This is a very accurate rendition of how a draft works behind the scenes, showing how coaches and GM's call one another to negotiate deals in a far less formal way than you may imagine. They all have a deep passion for this game, as many Americans do.<br/><br/>What really won me over was the way that this builds up from the days before draft day right into the actual draft picks as the clock ticks. I actually felt the tension and was noticeably stressed out while watching them debate what to do next. The film was one giant crescendo to the very end.<br/><br/>REGARDING THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH FOOTBALL:<br/><br/>In much the same way that many Americans will watch films about soccer, rugby and cricket, this is no exception. I've watched the likes of ""Death of a Gentleman"" (Cricket), ""Invictus"" (Rugby), or Becoming Zlatan (European football) and managed to follow. Draft Day is no exception.<br/><br/>Here are a few things for the unfamiliar that might help when watching:<br/><br/>the way all these teams get talented new players is largely through a system set up by the league. Just like soccer teams have junior divisions, in football they take their picks from the best players on American college football teams. There really is no other way of finding high-quality athletes who can compete in this sport unless they were on a college team (generally, but there are exceptions).<br/><br/>So on draft day, all football teams are given a number which determines the order for taking turns picking the best players all college teams across the country. This order is determined based on how well a team did the previous season (the last place team will pick first the following year, often getting the best college talent).<br/><br/>This is of course is just the general idea. From that 1st pick, the teams all take turns selecting from remaining players to fill the positions they are in need of stronger talent. It's a giant game of strategy, trying to get more quality players that are needed at different positions before someone else comes and takes them.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps. There have not been any films that I have seen depict the strategy that goes into the draft (selection process) in the NFL. It is also a big deal for the players who want to be picked, because they are not allowed to make any money while playing football in college (don't ask why, it just works that way). So to be picked is likened to finding out you have won the lottery (finally going to make good money).<br/><br/>And finally, regardless of opinion, this was made for just $25 million (USD) which is next to nothing comparing to your average run-of-the-mill budget.<br/><br/>----- 7/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"

","I really am amazed that Costner is still right out there as the star of films and not instead settled into the supporting actor parts that typically begin to collect in his career at this point considering his age. Star power is star power, charisma is charisma, I guess. You know, for a guy who never ""overreaches"" as an actor, he just remains so watchable and compelling to me. Draft Day really held my attention. I was rather surprised it did. Think of it as a few days in the life of a manager of a football team, a struggling-for-ages football team with a fanbase dying for success. He has to endure intolerance from the owner, his new coach, current quarterback (who returned from injury and is not happy with his ""fall from grace""), and learning of a pregnancy from his current lover (and ""numbers cruncher""). His father recently passes (a legend in Cleveland), he has only been in Cleveland two years fresh off managing San Francisco to a Super Bowl, has a mother even questioning why he'd trade three #1 picks for a ""could be great"" star collegiate, Heismen winning quarterback, and a radio station calling for his resignation. Yeah, a lot going on in this busy plot. Costner is like this anchor, doing so without overstepping dramatically. He is just Costner.<br/><br/>Key casting includes Jennifer Garner as Ali, Tom Weaver, Junior's (Costner) love interest, Patrick Esprit (as GM of Seahawks) a fun rival of Weaver's, Chadwick Boseman as a potentially strong defensive player who is able to steer Weaver into looking harder at the presumed ""next sure thing"" (Josh Pence), Ellen Burstyn as Weaver's mom, Sean Combs as Bo Callahan's agent, and a feisty, opinionated Dennis Leary as Weaver's head coach. Frank Langella, as owner Anthony Molina, really has this persistent need to run things without much approval from Weaver, which causes some serious friction between the two. The film hinges on the various dramatic dynamics on display between Costner and the cast of characters that make his life difficult."

","I am not a fan of football but was channel surfing and Kevin Costner, who is always terrific, was the star. Well, I loved this movie. It's one of the few that has been made in recent years with adult themes, adult outlooks and about adult concerns without getting into sex, nudity and murder.<br/><br/>I don't even understand football but that is secondary to the plot of a man who is under tremendous stress with the stress getting tighter and tighter. His reaction to the situations is compared to the players who are all under tremendous stress as well and through it all we see what they are made of and why his choices are what they are. We see how a mature adult deals with this type of pressure, how a hero deals with it.<br/><br/>If moral strength and character are truly elements in such a time of life changing events as this one, I have misjudged the sport. If not, well it's too bad that they aren't because it would truly enrich the game and erase the black eye that professional sport now has."

","I'm not a big fan of sports, but usually enjoy sports films for some reason. ""Draft Day"" is no exception. Kevin Costner stars in one of those roles that just works so well for him. He must decide what gut-wrenching decisions to make on the day of all days for the NFL- for the Cleveland Browns. The whole film is set in 24 hours, and Costner works his way through a bunch of different characters, trying to reach the right conclusion- with a great cast including Jennifer Garner, Ellen Burstyn, Denis Leary, Frank Langella, Chadwick Boseman, Terry Crewes, Rosanna Arquette, etc... I had forgotten until I reached the end credits that this film was directed by Ivan Reitman, and realized this was quite a different film from the guy who gave us such classic comedies as ""Stripes"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""Dave"", etc...?? This is certainly more of a character study/dramatic piece. But overall- a definite recommendation..."

","Even for a Sunday evening, you still have to do your homework before choosing a movie to watch, and I didn't. My bad! Draft Day may be interesting for die hard NFL fans, but for a European boy like me, it felt like a bit of a torture. I kept asking myself ""why am I watching this movie?"" approximately every 5 minutes. But once I start a movie, I stick to it.<br/><br/>However, and beyond the fact that I don't know much about the NFL, I really felt that the movie had zero tension, no matter how much they were trying to create it with constant back and forth phone calls between protagonists. Furthermore, even though it's his most important day of the year, Kevin Costner has to deal with his pregnant girlfriend and an annoying mother who thinks that Draft day is the best moment to solve family issues. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the last 10 minutes lift up the movie a little. Still not enough for me to consider this memorable by any means. So once again, if you're an NFL fan you could potentially find some interest for this movie, but if that's not the case, go for something else."

","It's less than 13 hours before the start of the NFL draft. Seattle Seahawks Walt Gordon (Chi McBride) is looking to trade away the number one draft which is sure to be quarterback Bo Callanhan. Cleveland Browns GM Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner) has the number seventh pick and is under tremendous pressure from owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella). He struggles in the shadow of his legendary father coach and against the loud-mouth present-day coach Penn (Denis Leary). Ali (Jennifer Garner) just told him that he's going to a dad. Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) is desperate to get picked high and is Sonny's preferred candidate. Earl Jennings (Terry Crews) is the father of lineman Ray Jennings (Arian Foster) who got into some gang trouble. Chris Crawford (Sean Combs) is Bo's agent. Then Sonny's mother Barb (Ellen Burstyn) comes with his ex Angie (Rosanna Arquette) to sprinkle his father's ashes on the field.<br/><br/>I don't know how a real NFL teams operates but these guys look amateurish. Maybe that's the compelling part about the story. It's a movie about a dysfunctional messy team. The deficiency here is in Sonny. He should be flawed but he shouldn't so flustered. Every move he makes is a struggle. Instead of working the draft or working the deals, he gets sidetracked by everybody and everything. Kevin Costner is trying squeeze every moment of melodrama. It is simply too over-written like a football soap opera. The draft drama is pretty good and salvages it from being completely soapy. It's no accident that Costner's character seems to come alive at that point. It's where the real drama occurs rather than some of the made up ones before then. The worst being his father's ashes like his mother wouldn't care that it's a horribly important day."

","Avid NFL football fans will likely be familiar with the annual draft of college players, although even they may be surprised by the Oscar-like ceremony at Radio City Music Hall on ""Draft Day."" Non-fans may find this film difficult to follow at first; they may also find it hard to comprehend the importance attached to this day by both team managers and potential draftees, who dream of an NFL contract. However, after the initial confusion clears, patient non-fan viewers will be rewarded with a generally entertaining film; the wheeling and dealing over potential draftees and draft positions intensifies, the clock ticks down to the deadline for making a pick, and genuine suspense rises. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports movies, and he plays Sonny Weaver, general manager of the Cleveland Browns, with expected ease in a solid performance. Unfortunately, the female roles are gratuitous in what is essentially a male-centric film. Jennifer Garner has little to do as Costner's associate and love interest; the couple show little chemistry, and their romantic problems and trysts in the supply room add little to the film. Rosanna Arquette has a fleeting and unnecessary appearance as Costner's ex-wife. While Ellen Burstyn is always welcome, her brief role as Costner's mother borders on annoying; she appears callous and oblivious to the pressures on Costner, and her urgency to spread the ashes of Costner's deceased father on a playing field, when an important deadline approaches for her son, seems insensitive. Frank Langella is also welcome in a small, but key role as the owner of the Cleveland Browns, and he too delivers professionally. <br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman keeps the story moving and builds tension towards the end as Costner weighs the pros and cons of two potential draftees, while the minutes tick down. However, Reitman liberally utilizes split screens, sliding scene shifts, and occasional sequences in which a character will pass from a half screen on the right, cross in front of another scene in the center, and enter the first scene again, which is now a half screen on the left; sounds confusing, and it is. With viewers focused on the process, rather than the action or dialog, these splashy graphics distract rather than enhance; however, when used to introduce a city, its local stadium, and the name of the NFL team, the effect works well. <br/><br/>""Draft Day"" will likely appeal more to football fans, who understand and are excited by the back room drama behind NFL drafting. However, the film should also grip non-fan audiences after an initial catch-up learning the rationale, mechanics, and lingo of the draft process. Good Costner performance, and generally entertaining, if unexceptional, film."

","But that doesn't mean it's a bad story. This movie has a lot of elements at play, and as I review the movie, I like to break it down by specifics: Plot, Cast, Acting, Presentation and Reception.<br/><br/>Plot: A GM for an NFL team begins to prepare for a draft that evening. As the day unfolds, the GM makes trades and deals that begin to make the audience wonder if he's going to make a complete donkey of himself and the team, or if he can pull off some kind of miracle. As far as a plot goes, it's fairly boring, it's essentially a football-less football story. If you watch this movie believing that you'd watch a football game, you'll be sadly mistake, although, you will get to watch a few plays where an Ohio State Buckeye takes down a QB...O-H! The story is much more interesting than described, and to be honest, had I not seen the trailer before renting the movie, I would have never rented it. Once you see the movie in it's entirety, you'll become entranced with the main character, Sonny, and wonder if this strategy is actually going to work. Although, this movie is not based on a true story, there was an instance of life imitating art, it was oddly similar to a situation that happened in the 2014 NFL draft (which happened after the movie) in which Johnny Manzel struggled to be drafted, despite strong belief that he would be the #1 draft pick, and was eventually picked up by none other than the team spotlighted in ""Draft Day"", The Cleveland Browns. **SPOILER Because it's a fictional work, Sonny predictably comes through with several first round picks, fixes the issues with both the Head Coach and his pregnant girlfriend, and in the end has a renewed spirit for his job. Before you pick up this flick, you knew that this would happen. I can't blame the writers for wanting everyone to feel good at the end.<br/><br/>CAST: The cast primarily focus' on one person, Sonny, played by Kevin Costner. The rest of the cast was B-list celebrities, including love interest, Jennifer Garner and volatile head coach, played by Denis Leary. The cast was a mix of people you'd probably recognize but wouldn't know their names and of course, people you simply don't recognize. As with each sports film, the cast also included former NFL stars as well as former and current NFL broadcasters and staffers. <br/><br/>ACTING: To me this was the down side to this flick. The acting by Costner was okay, when he's in the heat of things, I believe his skills were great, but the emotional scenes...well...not a fan. I'm not a fan of Jennifer Garner and I think this movie highlights why. Garner's facial expressions throughout the whole film were either lacking or overly expressive. Most of the time, she had the expression: Shocked. <br/><br/>Presentation: I thought the film's overlays and the constant shots overlapping were a very interesting choice. Most of the time, when having a phone conversation, the director uses cut shots, and it can be a very choppy cut. This movie showed both sides of the conversation and had movement. It was a very interesting choice and I personally enjoyed it. The movie would have been horrible if it had all cut scenes. <br/><br/>RECEPTION: This is how I received the movie. How did I like the movie? I personally am not a big football fan, but I still found myself very engaged in the plot. As I lead into this review, it is an action-less, football-less sports film, but it's still a good sports film. I believe that it's a film that even someone like my wife, who does not like sports, or even understand what a draft was or how it worked, was able to watch and enjoy it. I don't believe everyone will enjoy this film, but a target audience will be for adults, likely to be those who enjoy football at some level. Overall, I think most will enjoy this film, which is why I rated it a 7, and would recommend to anyone above the age of 16."

","Starring- Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner, Denis Leary, Chadwick Boseman, Ellen Burstyn, Frank Langella, and Terry Crews<br/><br/>Draft Day 5/10- I am going to take a guess and say that there are at least fifteen boring cliché sports movie that have come out in the past three years. I was almost sure that Draft Day would be a prime example for those. Fortunately, I was wrong. Draft Day may not be as good as Field of Dreams, but it delivers on a well-thought out plot given a decent amount of laughs the whole way through. Also, it has Kevin Costner at the helm delivering his best performance in five years. <br/><br/>Let's clear up a few things first. The trailer makes it seem like that the director is an idiot because it says the Dallas Cowboys are winners. This film is set more like a couple years in the future where all of these things like the browns playing well and the cowboys actually winning are possibly (though it is extremely unlikely as long as Jerry Jones is there.)<br/><br/>I would like to begin by saying that if you are not a sports fan, particularly football, Draft Day may not be for you. It does not really explain all of the workings of football that someone who does not a whole lot about football would need to know in order to enjoy the film. It also still has some of those cheesy sports scenes that we have seen a hundred times before, but even great sports films have these flaws as well. <br/><br/>For those of you that do know a little bit about football, this movie is perfect for you. This film shows us all the work that goes into putting those all-star athletes on the gridiron. I have been a die-hard football fan my whole life and even I was surprised at all the inner- workings that happen before opening kickoff. The last-minute trading, the very well thought picks for different players, all of the pressure the general manager and his staff are under, etc... All of this was very entertaining and eye-opening at the same time. Honestly, the best part about Draft Day was the fact that we have not really got a refreshingly original football movie in a long time and Draft Day gave that to us. <br/><br/>The thing that was the best part of the film for me was the directing. I really believe that he knows all of the ins and outs about football because i do not see how a movie like this could have been done without that knowledge. I would not be surprised if the director has been a football fan his entire life. The screenplay is also very well written and if you decide to see Draft Day, you will probably think there are a few holes in the script but they are addressed and actually give you an ending you do not see coming. Kevin Costner is the perfect guy for this film. He has this kind of role mastered at this point. I feel like he will be making a come back from that stream of awful movies he has done lately. Jennifer Garner does pretty well, but the role did not really demand much from her or the rest of the cast for that matter. I would like to shine a spotlight on Chadwick Boseman for getting in tremendous shape for this film. I easily believed he was an all-star defensive end about to be going in to the NFL. The whole cast does a good job a giving solid sports humor throughout the entire film. <br/><br/>If you are not a football fan, this is not for you. But, if you are one you are going to love Draft Day guaranteed. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"bob the moo","Null","0","0","14 November 2014"," A solid movie which has a good cast and delivery to make it more than it is – still only decent, but everyone puts their back into it
","This is a sports movie in the tradition of the films that Kevin Costner used to make when he was great – Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup; all films that blend aspects of sport into characters and relationship drama. This is not to say that Draft Day deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those films, but just to mention that Costner is on home ground here. The plot centers around the piece of socialism which is Draft Day – where essentially the worst teams in the league get first pick of new players, but of course with lots of horse trading and deals done all around this system. So, basically a sports film about contracts and rosters – not on-field action.<br/><br/>Despite this it works well because it recognizes the drama of the day, with fans eagerly awaiting to see who their new star player will be – teams are made, as are young athlete millionaires. The film balances this well and has good forward motion; I mean, these are fictional players in a fictional draft but the drama of the trading is well done and you do tend to get drawn into it and enjoy the twists and the tension (even if you know generally that it will probably end well for those we are following). The split-screen conversations and the movement of the camera and the use of realistic sets and TV talking heads, all add to the feeling of realism and I enjoyed this aspect of it.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so well is the film trying to take this drama and fold in some personal drama in the way that the aforementioned films did so well. In this case it doesn't really convince and feels like it is part of the film because it has to be, rather than it genuinely being part of this character's day. This is a shame because it takes up the time, so why not make it work just as well as the main drama? Either way, it doesn't – it is not awful but it doesn't work. This is a shame for Garner in particular, but her male counterparts eat up the drama of the draft – with Costner leading the way well with this slow drawl adding a calm urgency and loads of starry supporting actors giving the feeling of quality and depth.<br/><br/>It isn't anything remarkable or special, but it is a perfectly decent sports film with an enjoyable sense of tension. Shame the human stuff doesn't work, but for those of us that enjoy listening to the drama of the last day of the transfer window on Radio Five Live (even though our teams are not involved) then this film catches that pretty well."

","Be warned off the top: this movie is a little bit niche-ey. It's about the pressures and the wheeling and dealing that takes place on NFL draft day. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this, but it does help a little bit. I'm not much of a fan of the NFL to be honest, but I am a hockey fan, and draft day for the NHL has a similar feel to it, so I could easily get into this. My wife, on the other hand, isn't a sports fan at all, but she enjoyed the movie, periodically asking me questions about the draft and how it works. So, this being a bit of a niche-ey movie, my advice to a non-sports fan who watches it would be to watch it with someone who knows a bit about how draft day works and can explain a few points now and then.<br/><br/>The story itself revolves around Sonny Weaver, Jr., played by Kevin Costner. In the context of the movie, Weaver is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns. He's got a high draft pick, but not the top draft pick, when an unexpected opportunity arises to trade for the top pick. He has doubts, but he's pressured by an owner who wants him to make a big splash at the draft, and he's pressured by a head coach who wants to win now and not build for the future. In the midst of it all he's also dealing with his girlfriend, who's pregnant and also works in the Browns front office, and he has his mom on his back, with his father (a former Browns coach whom Sonny, Jr. actually fired) having recently died. So, while this is mostly about the ins and outs of the draft, there's also some personal melodrama involved.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. It presents a realistic look at exactly what goes on in a team's ""war room"" on draft day as decisions are made regarding young players who are about to become very wealthy young men. It also has a really good (and even exciting) ending as Sonny works on the big deal and makes his final decisions. It's a bit niche-ey, perhaps, but it still has enough for everyone to enjoy.

","Before I begin I have a confession to make; I'm a fan of the NFL or Gridiron as Australians know it. In fact I'm a huge fan and have been since I was a teenager. The simple explanation is some people love country music, some love Shakespeare well I love American Football and everything about it.<br/><br/>Over the years I've watched films about this sport on the field which shows owners, executives and coaches off the field but this film, Draft Day, is different. For the 50-odd players on a team their biggest day is the Super Bowl but for the hundreds of executives and coaches behind the scenes their biggest day of the year is Draft Day because similar to the beating of a butterfly wing it can have massive repercussions on the future.<br/><br/>NFL is about parity. They want every game to be as competitive as possible. There's an old saying in the NFL which goes, ""on any given Sunday in football any team can win"" (its also the name of an Olive Stone football film from a decade ago). To ensure this happens and avoid one or two teams forever dominating the game the NFL brings the best new players from college and distributes them to the worst teams first. With 32 teams in the league, the team with the very worst record last year gets the first pick the next year so they potentially improve themselves by adding the best young player in the country. The second worst team gets the second best and so on until last years champions get the last pick. There are seven rounds but the first round is the most important.<br/><br/>Does that make sense or am I talking another language? It can get even more complicated than that because teams can trade picks to move positions up and down the draft and this is what our star Kevin Costner has to do as the Cleveland Browns General Manager Sonny Weaver Jnr. The Browns had success back in the 60's but have had very little to cheer about since then in fact they have been so awful, incompetent and success-starved are referred to by some sources as ""A Factory of Sadness"".<br/><br/>The conflict in our story comes from Sonny wanting a defensive player but the Browns coach Denis Leary wants a running back while eccentric owner Frank Langella is demanding a superstar Quarterback but they can't get them all with the seventh pick. Everything is on the general manager Sonny to make the impossible happen on this day with the clock ticking as well as dealing with his workmate slash girlfriend Jennifer Garner and his difficult mother Ellen Burstyn.. who's husband the esteemed former coach of the Browns Sonny Weaver died in the last week. Talk about your tough days at the office? The film is well directed by Ivan Reitman (Stripes, Ghostbusters 1&2 and Kindergarten Cop). He draws humour, drama and sincerity from his actors and keeps the pace rolling until the climactic moments. Because executives, players, coaches and managers are in constant communication there are dozens of phone conversations in this film so the producers came up with some very original and ingenious ways to play with these scenes.<br/><br/>As a longtime football fan I really enjoyed Draft Day but I would. If you like modern sport of any kind and appreciate that the top levels are really businesses or corporations now then you will get something from this movie. If you're not into sport but can enjoy a film which is part underdog story, part mystery then perhaps you should pick Draft Day."

","It's draft day, and as general manager of the Cleveland Browns, Sonny is forced to come up with a big move. <br/><br/>After trading for the number one pick, Sonny has to choose between a lower-ranked linebacker with a questionable past or a celebrated quarterback with a questionable future. <br/><br/>All the while, Sonny is walking in the footsteps of his father and personal complications force their way to the surface.......<br/><br/>Now I don't have the first clue about the NFL, or as it's called here in the UK, American Football. Come to think about it, I don't know the first thing about football, or as it's called across the Atlantic, soccer.<br/><br/>But there's a thing with me and sports movies, they follow this by the book tick box that make them work.<br/><br/>First off you have to have someone who is on there last chance. Secondly, there has to be a love interest, who too loves the same sport. There has to be a family history with the said sport. And of course, you have to have that very tense, against the clock scene right near the end, where the main character swears.<br/><br/>Don't forget your support. We always get the angry coach who shouts a lot, the boss who threatens everyone with the sack, and of course the players. One will always be charming, and one will always be overconfident.<br/><br/>This ticks all these boxes, but what makes it just that little better is Costner, of whom I am a huge fan, and he's been in more sports films than Jackmans been in X-Men films.<br/><br/>It doesn't offer anything new, but its a solid drama that hits all the right spots, and when you realise that this was directed by the guy who gave us Ghostbusters, the curiosity just gets the better of you.<br/><br/>Go on, look at the poster of Costner holding the football, smug as anything, and not get a little excited...."

","Yeah, I spent the good portion of the last three decades hating on football. It was an amusement I played and social media made it all the more easy.<br/><br/>That saidI joined a fantasy football league this year because a good friend/coworker of mine was enormously enthused about it. After a day of useless and backless – albeit fun – smack-talk, I vowed to learn more about this game.<br/><br/>Step one: Draft Day. And what a way to start. <br/><br/>This movie had its issues and clichés. The predictability level was at an all-time high, and still, it was a ton of fun.<br/><br/>Granted, I still don't know all I need to know to get ""into the game,"" but I definitely got a good idea.<br/><br/>Sonny Jr. (Kevin Costner) recently lost his Sr. and still must keep his job by drafting for his Cleveland Browns team. Meanwhile, his job's on the line, the fans despise him and a baby's on the way with his coworker. He's got a lot on his plate. Oh, and he's expected to pick the most obvious first round choice for his traded first decision.<br/><br/>Audiences, even ones not as familiar with football as I am, know what the REAL choice should be and it takes the better part of two hours to come to that conclusion. <br/><br/>While I like this Moneyball version of football film – a lot, actually – it was so foreseen, I just needed to spend my time keeping up with the trade aspects and the football technical terms. <br/><br/>Honestly, this is a good movie for both football fans and casual fans, alike. It's well shot – and the overlapping scenes were actually pretty cool – and the acting dead on for real-life characters. I'd still recommend Moneyball tenfold over this, but hey, you could certainly do worse concerning a movie based on football that shows very little real-time plays.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: True, my friend's enthusiasm and request got me involved in a Fantasy Football league this 2014 season. Because I had little invested and I do love great looking bears, I made my initial picks based on looks. In my defense, I went to the top 300 ESPN player's list and selected from there so that I would have both good looking guys and ones in the elite.<br/><br/>This did NOT fare well considering my projected points were in the 40s and everyone else's was in triple digits. On Monday, before the season opener, I added/dropped a bunch of players and basically rejoined the league in time for the 2014 opener with my favorite team, the Seahawks and the Packers – a team I should love. <br/><br/>I now match them with about 122 points projected, but with a less good-looking team. Ha. Regardless, this movie did open my eyes to a lot of the behind the scenes and showed me more of the passion my peers and friends have for this game.<br/><br/>So without being the superior Moneyball, it's still highly recommended for my friends and football fanatics."

I wanted some freaking football. More action, diagnosis of players.<br/><br/>Character development.<br/><br/>The film, in order to make any sense, should have started with Cleveland and Seattle's season before to explain why they were in the draft position they were in.<br/><br/>Have Costner and pals in the film room diagnosing why their team sucks and why they want to move up in the draft to fill a needed position with a potential star to begin with.<br/><br/>It makes no sense. Especially since the Seahawks won the freaking Super Bowl this year. They have the LAST pick in the first round.<br/><br/>But no, a bunch of rudimentary split screen conversation that is complete BS and uninteresting.<br/><br/>By the way, Costner just wouldn't wake up on draft day at 9am and mess around talking to people.<br/><br/>He would have been up all night and if he went to sleep at all would have woken up at the teams complex.<br/><br/>'Draft Day' blows, whether you're a football fan or not.<br/><br/>Watch a daily soap opera, it's more interesting and dramatic."
"jgeorge4","7","2","5","18 April 2014"," Great Concept, Should Have Been Better
","Few things hold quite as much fascination for Americans than the NFL, and rightfully so. The competition, the athleticism, the violence, the personalities, the glamor, the rags to riches, the emotions, the obscene money at stake...well. It is an amazing world. And all of the extremes of this world are borne out on one day like no other...draft day.<br/><br/>As such, the NFL draft is such a powerful premise for a movie, it should have been quite easy to crank out a terrific story. Draft Day had the right idea and the right set-up: A desperate team led by a desperate GM, a needy, demanding owner, a head coach and GM who hate each other, angry fans screaming for change, top-talent players with their own agents and agendas, dirt-digging private investigators evaluating every inch of a player's life, and franchise-shattering, blockbuster trades on the table.<br/><br/>Wow. The movie should have blown us out of our seats, but just didn't quite deliver. One part ""MoneyBall"" and one part ""Any Given Sunday"", the recipe was terrific, but the execution was flawed. The fatal flaw in my opinion is the trades executed and the conduct of the GMs were just too implausible to be believed. Minor tweaks to the storyline could have paid huge dividends.<br/><br/>All in all an enjoyable movie that borders on a big fat advertisement for the NFL. Definitely worth seeing, but definitely could have been so much better."

This is a sports fans' movie. There are cameos-some that even I recognized, such as Jim Brown- and there are clips of former football greats from their hey-days. It's directed by Ivan Reitman, who also directed No Strings Attached, Kindergarten Cop, the 2 Ghostbuster movies and one of my favorite comedies, Stripes, among a few others. The movie covers about 12 hours and starts off about 12 hours before the NFL Draft Day picks are chosen- there is even a clock that counts down every so often on the screen. Kevin is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns that is also the man that picks his future football players. After, of course, weighing all other opinions from his team owner and boss, Frank, and his coach, Denis and anyone else that wants to put in their own two cents worth. Jennifer is his love interest that also knows as much about football as he does. The movie pretty much covers everything you would want to know about the process of picking the players. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are a football fan, you would probably love it. For me, it's a rental."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","6","2","5","11 April 2014"," Draft Day Review
","My Thoughts: Draft day is a movie that gives us a peek at what goes on behind the scenes during the NFL Draft. The movie opens up with 12 hours before the Draft begins. I will admit that I am a die hard football fan. When football season starts, you better not plan anything on a Sunday because I will probably not show up, especially if my Denver Broncos are on TV.<br/><br/>So, the general principle of the movie is that we are following Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner), the General Manager, of the Cleveland Browns who have the number 7 pick. Coach Penn (Denis Leary) is the new head coach of the team; he came from the Dallas Cowboys who seems to have won the Super Bowl within the last few years and was brought on board to help the Browns get to the big game. We also see Ali (Jennifer Garner) who is the CAP specialist and the love interest for Sonny. We also get Anthony Molina (Frank Langella), the owner, who wants Sonny to make a splash in this draft day or things might not be good for him.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this movie is nothing more than a NFL advertisement. I think the NFL went to their big name network stars and said you will be making a cameo in this movie–no if, ands or, buts. They also must have reached out to some of the players and said that they would really like to see them on screen. If you are a Baltimore Ravens fan, you might like one of the cameos that pops up during the NFL Draft.<br/><br/>But even with that being said, this is a pretty good movie; it keeps you entertained while watching the wheeling and dealing of Sonny throughout the last twelve hours before the draft. We see him dealing with an owner that wants the big name that he thinks will help him get into the Super Bowl. We also see dealing with a new head coach that wants the players he wants and not the ones the General Manager thinks the team needs. Sonny has to deal with some personal matters that are popping up on a day that he really needs to just focus on what is going on at the job.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: If you are a big football fan and just need something to hold you over until the real draft takes place, then this movie will do that for you, but if you could careless about the behind the scenes stuff, then just wait till this movie comes out on DVD. I will also warn that this is what the title claims: a movie about Draft Day, so don't go in there expecting you are going to see football games, though you do see some highlight reels.<br/><br/>You can find more of my reviews at www.shepfromtamp.com"

Behind the glamour is a hollow pantomime, stuffed with eyeball-rolling character moments and bland dialog, completely missing the points that made MLB's effort click.

Kevin Costner, at his most washed-up and wooden, doesn't do anything to move the bar, and the climax may as well have flashed the words ""dynasty"" over the Cleveland skyline... subtlety is not its forte."

","I looove the NFL and my country more before some people say something about the kneelers so let's don't go down that road this a movie review not a political push page. I read one review that said he loved pro football and the draft but thought this was a ESPN/NFL infomercial, well DUH!!! Who you think host the The Draft,ESPN, and also said the trades and picks were unbelievable , it's fiction, it's a movie and a damn good one at that. I'm a draft and college recruiting nerd so to speak and this movie scratched my itch! It was well acted and well written, I've seen it a 100 times and still get chills when watching Sonny(Costner) work the phones in the ""war room ""(not political). This was a different sports movie that everyone can enjoy even if you're not a huge football fan or know nothing about the draft, you don't have to be a expert draft analyst like my friend who seemed to not like it because he didn't find it believable because he's seen every minute of every draft. I got news for him Al Pacino isn't head of the mafia either though I loved The Godfather, another great movie!"

This proves to be a challenge since he is on the verge of being getting fired. Weaver proves to be the man for the job through his perseverance and tenacity. He manages his career with his personal life and although somewhat strained in the beginning, the love and kinship felt between them is adorable.<br/><br/>Overall, the film starts off pretty strong letting you know why football is so important in Cleveland. With great acting and good dialogue, the movie definitely lives up to its name. Even if you're not a sports fan or a football fan, watching the movie makes you want to get into the game. ""Draft Day"" is a great sports drama that shows you why this particular day is important, In addition, the entire cast is great.

","After watching the movie ""Draft Day"", I was amazed at the detail the producers were able to put in the movie. I am a die-hard football fan and was blown away with some of the information they were able to get out to the viewers. The movie really took the viewers into the the daily life of an NFL general manager. The producers did a great job at highlighting the pros and cons of being an NFL general manager. They showed actor Kevin Costner at his highest and his lowest throughout the film. <br/><br/>Many people believe that the people who work in the front office for NFL teams have huge mansions and sip on margaritas all day. While the first part of that statement might be true, many don't understand the constant stress general manager's are under every day. Throughout this movie, we get a close look at how Sonny Weaver is constantly under pressure. Failure to make a big move could take away everything he has worked for. <br/><br/>""Draft Day"" shows the human side of NFL general manager's and how they are no different then any other hard working employee in the United States. This movie isn't exclusively for football fans. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good drama and a lot of action."
"Desertman84","8","1","2","11 March 2015"," Costner Lifts This NFL Human Drama
","Draft Day is a sports drama which narrates the events that transpired in the NFL Draft Day in the General Manager's office of the Cleveland Browns.It features Kevin Costner as Sonny Weaver Jr,the head of the front office of the said NFL team,who makes a decision whether to select the no.1 draft pick or make a trade of the said pick with a group of players for both talent upgrade and team rebuilding.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of the movie includes Jennifer Garner,Denis Leary,Frank Langella,Tom Welling,Sam Elliott and Ellen Burstyn which provides additional interesting characters that shows the other aspects of Weaver's life from his love life,his relationship with his parents,the surrounding personnel in the front office as he makes the decisions needed during the Draft Day and the risks that he takes to the team personnel to finally call it his ""own team"". Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman wrote the screenplay and Ivan Reitman directed the film.<br/><br/>The movie was obviously in the same sports genre of Moneyball wherein most of the action takes place inside the front office instead inside the football stadium.Too supplant that lack of action,Kevin Costner provides a great performance as Weaver as he uses both his talent and charisma to provide the necessary character changes and transformation needed as he deals with crucial decisions needed by Browns as well as the different aspects of his personal life.Sports fans looking for intense and exciting football action will definitely be disappointed for the lack of it.While the film could be somewhat slow especially in the first half,it manages to provide excitement in the end when Weaver makes the decision in the end and how the team benefited from it.One could even classify the film somewhat corny and definitely far from being realistic from the NFL perspective.But Costner's performance makes the necessary effort to lift it from being an average film to a movie with a better-than-average rating."

Okay, okay, it's somewhat like the MONEYBALL movie. <br/><br/>There are fabulous shots of various NFL stadiums and there were many split-screens throughout and this gave credence to the story. The way it was done was impressive. The photography all around was excellent. Kudos. <br/><br/>We see many nationally recognized football analysts (Jon Gruden, Chris Berman, Dion Sanders, Mel Kiper, Mike Mayock, to name just a few).

As you would expect the pace picks up near the end and it is here that Kevin Costner earns his money. He did a good job. <br/><br/>All in all a good movie, maybe a little slow, at times, but when you see the pressures an NFL General Manger goes through you will understand and enjoy this.

","'DRAFT DAY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another sports flick starring Kevin Costner. In this one he plays the general manager for the Cleveland Browns and the movie all takes place on the day of the NFL Draft, when he trades for the number one pick. It costars Jennifer Garner, Denis Leary, Frank Langella, Ellen Burstyn, Josh Pence, Tom Welling (of 'SMALLVILLE' fame) and Chadwick Boseman (who also stared in the baseball flick '42', from last year, as Jackie Robinson). It was written by first time film writers Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman and directed by Ivan Reitman. I'm not a fan of football (or sports in general) but I still found this flick to be interesting and entertaining enough.<br/><br/>The story is set all on the day of the (fictionalized) 2014 NFL Draft. Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the Cleveland Browns General Manager who's father coached the Browns (for many years) and was a legacy. Sonny Jr. is notorious for having fired his father (a year earlier) and his dad just passed away, a week before the draft. Sonny is also not popular with fans and doesn't have a good record with his team (who's been losing regularly). On top of that he just found out his girlfriend Ali Parker (Garner), who he's been seeing secretly (because she also works for the Browns), is pregnant. He's at odds with his head coach (Leary), his current quarterback (Welling) has been out of commission due to an injury and the Browns owner (Langella) threatened his job if he doesn't ""make a splash"". Under pressure he trades his team's next three years of first-round draft picks, to the Seahawks, for the number one draft choice. Everyone thinks he's going to pick the most desired college player Bo Callahan (Pence), a quarterback from the University of Wisconsin and Heisman Trophy winner, but he spends the rest of the day (all the way up to the draft) contemplating it.<br/><br/>Like I said I don't care about sports or football so of course I knew little about how the NFL Draft works but I still found the story easy to follow and involving. That's due to adequate directing from Reitman and a clever script (these writers obviously know football). Credit is also due to the all-star cast though, especially Costner (who's having a decent year). So I'm really impressed that a movie that's all about football, in all it's boring detail, kept me that entertained. To me that's a well made film and deserves some respect for it. It's not a great sports flick but it's definitely a good one. Some of the thrill isn't there because it's all behind the scenes stuff; it's kind of like 'MONEYBALL' but not quite as good.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ"

","Kevin Costner returns in one of several ""comeback"" vehicles Not long ago he was a slowburn action hero in THREE DAYS TO KILL, and now he only has one day, that's right, DRAFT DAY, where Costner's brooding Sonny Weaver Jr., the Cleveland Brown's general draft manager and son of the recently-departed beloved ex-coach, has to make an extremely important decision Although you'd never know Junior has anything on the line, at least not during the talky first half as director Ivan Reitman – in revitalizing the split-screen device by having characters invade the frame of the neighboring square – centers more on glossy aesthetic than moving the story along.<br/><br/>Weaver's peripheral romance with Jennifer Garner's executive lawyer, Ali, is dull and pointless, as are the conversations with his opinionated mother (played by Cult Film Freak's favorite actress, Ellen Burstyn). In the lead, Costner remains in the kind of mellow mode he's gotten away with in the past, and now just seems lethargic, hardly commanding the screen at all.<br/><br/>But Kevin and sport's fans alike, have patience: behind the phone-calls there's an actual plot unraveling, which, surprisingly, is more like Clint Eastwood's TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE than MONEYBALL: when a lucrative quarterback seems the all too perfect candidate to save The Browns, not only is there a light at the end of the tunnel, but an actual tunnel is formed <br/><br/>Thus DRAFT DAY gets somewhat intriguing: as the minutes tick down to the televised event the film's named after, we learn more and more about the desired QB's Achilles' heel (which only Weaver can spot), adding a mysterious element to a story that's all talk and no play otherwise."

","The movie is very relaxed than what I would have imagined. There was not as much tension or drama as I thought, making the job of General Manager for a Sports team seem not so stressful. I was expecting the same tone as a movie about politics or the stock market, or something, but I felt while disagreements happened, everyone seem too laid back on one of the most important days of the NFL. Though a lot of the movie takes place a day before the Draft, when it finally gets up to that day, the excitement does not pick up.<br/><br/>The thing about a good sports movie is that you really don't have to know anything about sports to really like it. I know people who love Friday Night Lights and hate football. I guess the story of a General Manager is too specific, making it only interesting to die hard football fans. I got a small kick out of the movie. I'm not a huge sports fan, but I have a favorite football team and I like to see how they are doing and where they're going. So in that sense, watching Sonny Weaver, attempt to draft the best player to help rebuild an NFL sport team that's not doing well, was something that I could get behind, but watching him make that choice was very boring.<br/><br/>Sports movies centered on players seem to be more universal. Even movies center on coaches, like Remember the Titans, are more enjoyable, as eventually it becomes a movie about players. Then again I love Jerry McGuire which was focus more on a sports agent, which that movie made seem like a more interesting job than a General Manger.<br/><br/>This Ivan Reitman project should have been more of a hit, but it was just unexciting for me."
"mm-39","6","2","8","20 April 2014"," okay but sappy movie!
","Draft Day is well written, and directed movie. The story and characters are okay. Kevin Costner deals with the pressures of the owner, coach, and personal problems when dealing with the N F L draft. The question of can the General Manager create his own team? Costner is forced to deal, and create more deals to get the team Costner believes will win. Rival general managers try to out wit each other. Personal clashes, and questions arise. Is the first pick overall Callahan the real deal or a bust? Will the injured quarterback be able to return? These are the un-measurable x factors of sport. One experiences the pressures and uncertainty of N F L management. One sees the manager's success is based on both skill and luck! Six out of ten stars."
"crimewriter34","5","2","9","22 April 2014"," Cap Manager
","Speaking of Cap Managers, the mythical–-in reality nonexistent—-job title of Jennifer Garner's character, I wonder why a Cap Manager didn't just come in and say, ""No, we are not going to waste forty to fifty million on this movie and pray it does well..."" Where would it do well? Overseas? Asia? China? Europe? None of these sensible people could care less about the boring business machinations of a mono megalomaniac and his cynical/ wet dish rag/ tension-producing-for-the-vacant-script boss.<br/><br/>Must Jennifer Garner always play the stern, throw a wet blanket on the fire of wild Bill Costner character redux, like she did in Juno, Dallas Buyer's Club, et.al.<br/><br/>Personally, I haven't liked her in anything since 13 going on 30. Wow, that was a long time ago. So, she still manages to land forgettable roles in good pictures. But, is it her or the script that prevents her from portraying any kind of memorable supporting character? Bit of both I would imagine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the script does not even come close to portraying the NFL today, tomorrow, next year, or anywhere but perhaps in some weird, parallel universe where if you say something with a lot of conviction on the phone, eventually everyone just bends to your will. Sort of.<br/><br/>And that's the end.<br/><br/>Wow. So glad I saw it on the discount.<br/><br/>Has Costner made anything other than a total flop the last ten years or so? Seriously. Perhaps now we can finally look at the next Costner film as a seal of bland mediocrity at best.<br/><br/>At least with Mrs. Garner-Affleck, we can see her supporting role as a sign it's fifty fifty that the movie will be good.<br/><br/>(Actually, I forgot that I liked her in the horrid Arthur opposite Russell Brand, where their what-seemed-to-be-genuine dislike for each other really worked for me.) At least she's not coming out with another sad rom-com every April anymore like laying a rotten Easter Egg. Thank god for 42. I'd like to see her go back to action adventure and a big steaming bowl of whoop ass.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kevin should go back to inventing oil spill removing machines, saving the world from BP and other corporate evils, and leave the heavy lifting of acting, and make believe to CIA shills like Mr. Affleck and his wife.<br/><br/>I'd give Cap Manager, whoops, I mean, Draft Day (is there a draft in here) a solid five. But, honesty, who even cares.<br/><br/>Not me and over a billion Chinese."
"palavitsinis","7","1","3","26 July 2016"," Classic sports' movie! Nice!
","I usually love any movie that is sport related, no matter the sport. This one was not an exception! Kevin Costner, was brilliant as was the remaining of the cast. I loved the countdown to the draft and especially how the movie was really intense during its final moments.<br/><br/>A movie well-made with all the personal relationships being in the epicenter of the developments along with the cruel and pragmatic world of the draft. It was amazing to see how this process affects the life of everyone involved. <br/><br/>The characters were depicted brilliantly by all actors and especially Kevin Costner and Denis Leary were awesome. A really nice movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of related films, but a movie that is also easy to watch by the non-fanatics, even if they have no clue about the sport itself."
"edwagreen","10","1","3","19 September 2015"," ****
","Terrific Kevin Kostner film dealing with the General Manager of a football team, recently losing his father, the latter having coached the team, and when you find out why the son had fired his father from the position, you shall have a greater understanding of the film.<br/><br/>The film goes into every intricate detail of how a manager decides who to draft for his team when the draft time comes. It is not only through actual play, but we see the human side of decision making as well. Not to be omitted is the wheeling and dealing that goes on among teams as the drafting proceeds.<br/><br/>Jennifer Garner portrays Kostner's assistant. She knows the game well and is carrying his child. Ellen Burstyn plays his mother, a woman in the know, who shows a human element after recently losing her husband.<br/><br/>A real gem of a film."
"statuskuo","3","1","3","23 March 2015"," Skating For The NFL
","There hasn't been a movie that used the NFL brand since ""Heaven Can Wait."" That's all you need to know about the Nazi behavior of the NFL protecting the so-called ""Shield."" You guys play a kids game with people with less intelligence than a child. I find it pretty insulting you try to class it up with rules.<br/><br/>Incidentally, white owners with white coaches illicit the ideals of slavery. Million dollar payouts of not, this is the true ugliness of the sport. Honesty.<br/><br/>Anyway, politics aside, I knew going in this was going to be milquetoast movie about the sport. Costner plays this GM who hires an UNBELIEVABLE coach in Denis Leary towards the draft day. Supposedly a moment that changes young men's lives. There is no dirt to uncover here. The gleaming white QB with prospects higher than God, is on the shopping block. And there's a mad push for Cleveland to ditch the ineffective veteran (again a miscast of Tom Welling) for brand spanking new toy. They allude that he's already spent 8 years with the Browns and had it not been for the injury the previous season, he may've taken them further. THAN, as a matter of painting him to be a man of high moral character, they speak about him like he has a strong moral backbone. We never see it. But people talk about him in this weird mythical being who FAILED 7 of those years. This should raise the temp of any Browns fan. And also remind them of their futile effort of idiocy.<br/><br/>I think you do have to be a football fan to understand the coming and going of these types of moves. They inject it with a ridiculous Jennifer Garner character and this oddball relationship between Costner and Burstyn to get some type of female audience to sympathize. They completely wasted Frank Langella as the owner of the Browns who is a one dimensional clod. Who clearly knows zip about football. Who is this suppose to be (in the real NFL)? I would find him more insidious bug if it he played it like owner Mike Brown. The owner of the Bengals, who is a true oily dirtbag. Making moves to undercut the coach, but never in public. And never verbalize his idiotic decisions but lives under the shadow of football royalty.<br/><br/>The story is stupid. And most likely not to the fault of writers/director. It seemed like their hands were tied by not portraying the business side accurately. I kept thinking...this was an excuse movie. A chance for the NFL to say ""Well we got a few rotten apples, and a few good apples"" Never mind the rotten apples' character flaws were something as dumb as not reading a playbook. Try spousal abuse, and brain injury next time."
"crass-austin","3","1","4","17 September 2014"," Not a football movie, a Hollywood movie
","My dad and I shut this movie off after twenty minutes. It was clearly just an opportunity to make another Hollywood movie. Football was just a setting. The unnecessary drama of Costner's girlfriend played by Jennifer Garner being pregnant. The fact that they cast Dennis Leary as the coach. Dennis Leary burning the draft analysis and dropping it on Costner's desk. The GM making deals with other teams alone, without consulting the owner or head coach, and before considering cap space. <br/><br/>I like most movies. At 6.8 on IMDb, I thought it would be worth a shot. But, I couldn't even finish it. I disliked everything about this movie. Especially that they used fictional players.<br/><br/>Take a pass on this one."

However, it is a movie than I could watch over and over again and I do not even watch football.<br/><br/>I changed it because compared to other non-masterpiece than I can watch forever, I do not laugh at the movie but is actually immersed in. The acting can be goofy at time but give it a look, the pacing is great and if you don't like it, trust me I can totally understand, I just cannot not love it."
"Dextronix","8","0","1","5 December 2017"," Great film - very exciting **NO SPOILERS**
","I've now watched this film three times and have enjoyed it just as much as the first.<br/><br/>I must admit I'm a sucker for American sports films even though I'm English. I'm also a Kev Costner fan - in spite of a fairly large consensus of people who find him cheesy. His performance in this is pretty spot on.<br/><br/>The film is fast paced and exciting in the kind of way that The Social Network is. It's non-stop movement and there isn't really any time given to reflection or contemplation. The clock is ticking on Draft Day and that's represented well in how the film's made.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's not quite up there with Moneyball - but it's highly exciting none the less. Kev's great, Jennifer Garner is really really good, this is very watchable even if you aren't into sport.<br/><br/>A racey 8 out of 10 for me"
"clearthinkernow","8","0","1","20 November 2017"," A Surprisingly Good Move for a non-Football Fan
","I watched this movie finally because it was made here in Cleveland and I know people who were extras in it. I want you to know that I am not a football fan, nor am I a Browns fan. I do not watch the games and could absolutely not care less who wins or loses. However, being a living- breathing being who does listen to the radio, I know a slight amount about draft day and am familiar with the hype surrounding certain players and our ever-hopeful for next year fans here.<br/><br/>That being said, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much. It's not really a ""sports movie"" as other reviews have said; it's more an inside look at the big day, the rules and conventions, how life goes on for others despite this day and how the ""perfect choice"" is different for different people. You hope your coach chooses your guy, but what does he know that you do not? It's like choosing a spouse, in the long-run who will be best for the team?"

","I actually barley Know a thing about The American Football and it was difficult for me to get what is happening at first but nearly to the end I understand it totally. The movie will but you in what really happens during The Draft Day with a lot of excitement and expecting.<br/><br/>It's fun to watch it at the end for calm day while you are resting and eating some snacks and don't want to tire your mind with a heavy movie, It's simply an interesting light movie.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner was great as always but I really didn't felt him as guy who still in a new relation ship with Jennifer Garner who is more than 10 years younger than him but it's OK, It's Kevin Costner after all."
"slightlymad22","6","0","1","3 November 2016"," Costner Is The Only Reason I Made It To The End
","Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Kevin Costner's filmography in order, I come to his third movie of 2014. Draft Day <br/><br/>After his attempt at a Liam Neeson-esque, late-career action star reinvention in 3 Days To Kill, KC is back in more familiar territory (a sports movie) in Ivan Reitman's football film Draft Day. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: At the NFL Draft, general manager Sonny Weaver (KC) has the opportunity to rebuild his team when he trades for the number one pick. He must decide what he's willing to sacrifice on a life-changing day for a few hundred young men with NFL dreams.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't really do anything for me, I don't think it's to do with my lack of interest in American Football as I enjoy the Burt Reynolds movie The Longest Yard, Any Given Sunday, Rudy and The Waterboy despite not knowing what a first down is. As the title suggests, this is not your typical sports, much less football film. The large cast, which includes the likes of Frank Langella (who normally makes everything better) Jennifer Garner, Chadwick Boseman, Josh Pence, Tom Welling and Ellen Burstyn all get varying amounts of screen time. However, not for nothing does KC stand alone on the film's one- sheet. He is the only reason to see this movie. He is certainly the only reason I made it to the end."
"mheinrich-16377","4","0","2","14 May 2016"," Not worth the time it took to make; barely worth the time it takes to watch
","Kevin Costner mailed in his performance. Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, even Liam Neeson would have brought the needed passion and range of emotion to the Sonny Weaver, Jr.'s character. Kevin Costner plays it like he's Dennis Weaver. So, surprisingly, did Denis Leary. I can only guess that Denis had no input as to his dialogue and the director refused to allow any ad lib's or spontaneity. I expected more energy and intensity from a life long football man. Only in the finals 10 minutes is there any sense of draft day excitement in Costner's character. The other actors playing GMs do a much better job. So did the supporting cast of Cleveland Browns scouts and execs, (except Leary). Jennifer Garner is wasted in this movie. There is no visible chemistry between Costner and Garner: no sense of why these character's even like each other, much less took the time to make a baby. Frank Langella is excellent, and visibly having fun with his role."
"reisen55","8","0","2","8 June 2015"," Surprising and quite good
","Sports films always seem to revolve around THE GAME or BUILDING THE TEAM FROM NOTHING or a baseball field in a cornfield in Iowa. Well, this one is different, a behind the scenes look into how the NFL teams manage the draft day picks, an unknown subject to almost anyone. Which makes it interesting to start with. True, plot could be better in some ways, like Costner has to come through, he has to win his love, etc. These are the givens in almost any film. Put these things aside and you find a well crafted, thoughtful film about ego and pressure, severe at times. It shows you what a lonely job life at the top can be. Cast is 1st rate save the mother who can wear on your nerves, as she is supposed to. Ah well for that. Costner plays, well, Costner and that is always time around a good friend. The direction is crisp and the scene cuts and swipes are brilliant, a fine way to advance the action or non-action in this case. An aspect of a game we rarely see. Recommend. Gave it an 8 just because I knew nothing about Draft Day inner-workings and it was an educational film as well."
"g-bodyl","9","0","1","13 March 2015"," A Surprisingly Good Football Film!
","As someone who is starting to gain appreciation for football and someone who completely ignores the draft for all sports, I wasn't sure how I was going to take this film. For one, I found the movie to be educational in regards to teaching me basics about the draft and the drama behind the draft. Secondly, I found this to be an oddly sentimental film with a high level of characterization when it comes to our main character, both personally and professionally. In short, I must happily confess that Kevin Costner created another winner. <br/><br/>Ivan Reitman's film is about the general manager of the Cleveland Browns named Sonny Weaver Jr who gets a chance to rebuild his team when he seizes the opportunity to trade for the number-one pick. But he must deal with people such as his unhappy head coach and an owner who is threatening to replace him unless he makes a big splash. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner is known for his roles in sports films and it is no surprise he is in this one. I thought he did a very good job and he had some tense scenes, especially when the draft began. Jennifer Garner was solid as the salary cap analyst and Sonny's lover. Denis Leary had some good scenes as the head coach and Frank Langella likewise as the team's owner. <br/><br/>Overall, Draft Day was a fun sports film to watch as we see Sonny change his team around with pressure from all sides. In my case, this film proved to be educational and I can truly see how passionate NFL fans can be about the draft. The story was very good as it focused on the character of Sonny and how his personal life threatens his professional life. This is a different kind of sports film, but I liked it very much. <br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
