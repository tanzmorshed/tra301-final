","It seems to me that the ultimate moral of this story might be that in war everyone is a casualty in some way, shape or form - even those who are never wounded and stay personally above the brutality. ""Casualties Of War"" is a depiction of an actual (and sickening) event that was first reported in the New Yorker magazine in 1969 in which a squad of American soldiers kidnap, rape and murder an innocent, young Vietnamese girl.<br/><br/>The two main protagonists in the movie are played by Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn. Penn is Meserve - the sargeant in command of the squad who develops the plan for the kidnap, rape and murder. He represents one type of casualty - a kid, promoted way beyond his years, in a situation he should never have been in, watching friends and comrades dying on a daily basis, becoming jaded and unfeeling as a result. You feel no sympathy for his character, but you recognize the tragedy of his character - and of the other members of the squad who let themselves be pulled into the plan. Fox, on the other hand, is Eriksson - the squad's conscience. He knows this is wrong, and he refuses to participate, even trying to help the girl escape, only to be derided and ridiculed by the others as either a coward or a homosexual. After the girl is killed, for no real reason, he reports the incident to his superiors, only to hear repeated variations on the theme ""let it go. War is war."" This is probably Michael J. Fox's most powerful movie role ever - a definite change of pace from the teen-oriented comedies that had made him famous. He's also a casualty, of course - haunted forever by the sickening scene he had witnessed. And of course, there's the real casualty - the young girl dragged out of her home and away from her mother who endures a nightmare before being killed.<br/><br/>This is most definitely a powerful, disturbing and brutal movie that definitely makes it point."

","Although Platoon may have gotten more acclaim, by far the best film on the Vietnam War is this one. Casualties Of War is going to leave Platoon way in the dust when history has its verdict.<br/><br/>Though Sean Penn's got several great films to his credit, by far this is the best work of Michael J. Fox on the big screen. His soldier with a conscious who can't live with himself after witnessing an act of barbarity that the other men of his squad commit should have brought him an Oscar nomination. In fact there could have and should have been a few of them for this film. <br/><br/>Fox plays a young soldier only a few weeks in Vietnam. On patrol Sergeant Sean Penn saves his life, but then on a second patrol because Penn and friends could not get leave to bleed the lizard as they say, they kidnap a young Vietnamese woman and take her on patrol. All the men on the patrol, Penn, Don Harvey, John C. Reilly, and John Leguizamo all gang rape the girl, but Fox refuses. Later on he's got a crisis of conscience.<br/><br/>Kids who grew up on World War II movies and westerns with clearly defined good and bad guys were ill prepared for a war in Vietnam. So was our government which had been involved in more or less degree since the end of World War II and the breakup of French Indochina. The subtleties of the regional politics eluded our policy makers in Washington. It was mighty hard to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy. You treated anyone with a yellowish pigmentation and slanted eyes as an enemy, the only friends you knew were the ones wearing the same green jungle fatigues as you were.<br/><br/>The war twisted Penn and Harvey. Leguizamo and Reilly were essentially followers, only Fox who hadn't been there long enough to have his sense of morality impaired could see this was all wrong. That's the frightening part of Casualties Of War. None of the four could see anything wrong, even Leguizamo who sees his first duty as to stick with the guys who have your back in the field.<br/><br/>As good as Fox and Penn and the rest of the Occidental cast is, the best performance in the film is Thuy Thu Lee. As the bewildered and frightened young girl she will positively break your heart with her one and only film performance.<br/><br/>Casualties Of War was shot in Thailand so we're seeing actual Southeast Asia locations. Brian DePalma's direction of his stellar cast is right on target. Don't ever miss Casualties Of War about the ultimate Vietnam experience."
"mcfly-31","Null","41","49","17 November 2000"," gripping tale of war
","The odd thing about this film, is that it could've taken place with any background.  War, college campus, neighborhood gang.  The real plot is about the affects of rape and murder on the good guy and the bad guys.  The Vietnam war just happens to be where it really took place, so we are entered into that gritty world of sudden violence, if not sudden death.  Fox is a rookie soldier joining Penn's squad.  Penn sort of casually mentions that they're gonna find themselves a girl to ""keep up morale"" while they are on their journey.  This involves abducting a young farm girl from her villiage in the middle of the night, not affected in the least by the girl's hysterical mother.  Each man (it's a group of 5) has his different reaction, Riley as the dumb ""go along with anything"" soldier does exactly that, Harvey, in a terrific wacko performance, loves the idea, with Leguizamo and Fox opposed.  But Leguizamo, feeling the equivalent of teen peer pressure, does not back Fox when the two want to approach Penn about his antics.  So Fox is left in an awkward position the rest of his stay in the field with his squad.  There is of course, a confrontation, in a drawn out scene, where toughies Penn and Harvey accuse him of being gay and not doing to the enemy what they deserve.  This is the core of the film's impact, as they quarrel, the girl is raped, and then Penn demands that Fox kill her!  When she becomes ill, Penn fears her coughing may give away their posistion, so he berates Fox to stab her.  He refuses, and in an ensuing arguement, the girl tries to get away, which ends up leading to a chaotic scene in which she reaches a slow, painful demise.  The rest of the film deals with Fox trying to bring attention about what happened to his mostly deaf and incompotent superiors.  That brief summary, though, barely scratches the surface of the emotionally charged scenes you will experience in the movie.  There are many sad moments even before the girl is introduced.  And then audience anguish when we think that maybe these men will get away with what they did.  The key to the impact is, of course, the performances.  Penn is his usual out of control self, who you may feel bad for, seeing how he's such a dedicated soldier and even decent guy before the kidnapping.  An underrated and hardly known Don Harvey, I think somewhat outshines Penn with his always angry, scary corporal whose dark eyes and contant scowl give him a great intimidation factor.  Riley makes you roll your eyes with his convincing moron, a guy who baffles as to why he'd get into the army, with his I.Q. seeming to be below 40.  Leguizamo you try to forgive because of how he's afraid of being attacked verbally, or even physically, by his partners. You can understand his dilemma.  Le, as the girl, as expected has little to say, but in her facial expressions, shows us the fright and terror that's enough to jar us.  And as far as Fox is concerned, a PERFECT performance and choice for him to show us his dramatic side.  He did so sometimes on ""Family Ties"" and in a couple of cinematic bombs (i.e. ""Light of Day"", ""Bright Lights, Big City"") but those works did not nearly approach the powerful scope that this film exhibits.  And he puts his dramatic talent on full blast, displaying the mental exhaustion so well, from the disturbing events he went through. It was a very big key to his career when he decided to take this.  Some might say how can you make entertainment out of rape, but the one scene of it is only 2 minutes long, with the real story here of how people handle themselves in crisis.  The only mis-steps were the sometimes overly violin-ey score, getting a little too weepy here and there.  And also the fact that even though Fox is the one good guy of the film, we never find out his first name!  But there are too many hard hitting moments of realism to sink this, with the best highlight being the strong acting."
"khatcher-2","Null","68","87","31 October 2001"," << Thuy Thu Le is central to its success >>
","`Casualties of War' belongs to the same year as that other anti-war film `Born on the Fourth of July'. From about the mid-eighties American feeling rose bitterly against the aftermath of the Viet Nam war: the price had been too high. Too many young men killed or wounded and, worse perhaps, too many young men psychologically scarred for the rest of their lives. `Casualties of War' does not point any accusing fingers at anyone: the film is an anguishing account of a horrendous series of actions based on real facts. Even so, our interpretation must go a little beyond what the film tells us, what we are seeing. We must ask how many more service-men lost their nerve in the middle of that jungle inferno which was Viet Nam?<br/><br/>Brian de Palma obliges us to enter into that indescribable hell, so that we might, with a bit of luck, if our feelings can bear the torture of witnessing such inhumane irrationality, understand a little more the agonising palpable naked terror which so many men had to go through.<br/><br/>
However, whether Michael J. Fox or whether Sean Penn played their part better seems to overlook an obviety: without that performance by the Vietnamese girl, Thuy Thu Le, this film would have been forgotten years ago. My first seeing of that fragile creature  some years ago  left me nauseated, my stomache churned and I had bad dreams for several nights. That pathetic little face and her screams of anguish haunted me for days afterwards. Her performance was so compelling, rivetting, anguishing, it had me hating being a man. I only just stopped short of throwing up. Perhaps nobody expresses this better than `Tony's Corner: a Fan's Notes' (www.colba.net):<br/><br/><< the performance of a young actress, a woman named Thuy Thu Le. It is to my mind, one of the bravest, most courageous, and one of the most heartbreakingly real pieces of acting that I've ever seen the intolerable suffering that Thuy's character Oahn endures, her emotional intensity... searing power, of blistering emotion, and raging despair, the outstanding performance of Thuy Thu Le is central to it's success >> (end partial quote)<br/><br/>Amen. <br/><br/>It is one of those performances that no Oscar can ever pay for: indeed such a triviality would have been an insult. The film is cruel, sickening, loathsome, heartbreaking; but something humane, something I can't explain, something deep inside me, compelled me to see this poor `wretch' again, compelled me to witness once again her tremendous scream of despair against the bestial inhumanity of war  any, every and all war. I have no love of morbidity: I shun such ridiculous programmes. But this poor creature called Thuy Thu Le forced me to see the film for a second time.<br/><br/>Enough: I will never see this film again. I have seen naked desperation and fear so realistic that my soul seethes to boiling point and is about to burst thus twice. That will do. In the end we are all casualties of war.....<br/><br/>No vote: I cannot reduce this to a simple vote. It just would not have any real meaning, would it?"

"wezzel","10","38","47","1 July 2002"," One of the great American movies
","Coppola, Stone and Cimino did their best, but the award for best Vietnam movie goes to Brian De Palma. One of the only directors working today who still knows the meaning of 'cinema', De Palma uses all his favorite techniques (the long shots, split-focus)without being intrusive. There are so many fantastic moments in this film, so many images that stay in your mind long after the credits rolled by. Who could forget the death of the girl on that railwaybridge? It's truly one of the most chilling images I've ever seen on screen, also thanks to the haunting score by Ennio Morricone.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic. Sean Penn makes it very easy for you to hate him, John Leguizamo as the pathetic Diaz hits all the right notes, John C. Reilly is wonderful as always. And then there's Michael J. Fox, in a rare dramatic role. As Ericcson, he's the beating heart of this film, the only human creature on screen. His attempts to save the girl are heartbreaking and deeply tragic. <br/><br/>It's a mystery why this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Maybe the Americans don't like the way some of their countrymen are portrayed here. Maybe the idea of Marty McFly as G.I. Joe turns some people off. The IMDb rating this movie gets is a joke, albeit not a very funny one. This is one of Brian De Palmas finest movies (it's so hard to choose a favorite he has made so many classics), the best war movie I've ever seen and one of the greatest American movies ever. <br/><br/>You simply HAVE to see this!"
"mermatt","Null","49","62","19 August 2001"," ""Nobody cares""
","This is a true story of what happens in war when morality and ethics are tossed aside. The killing that is involved in war gets mixed up with murder, bigotry, and revenge in this factual horror story.<br/><br/>Fox is excellent as the naive but ethical young man exposed to a ""Nobody cares"" atmosphere in the midst of war. The film not only shows what can happen to human beings when they let go of any sense of conscience, but it is also a metaphor of the amoral mentality that was behind the Viet Nam conflict and its aftermath.<br/><br/>The struggle depicted here is between going along with the group or maintaining one's own integrity. Are there rules of war? Are there rules of living? These are the profound questions which underlie the action in this disturbing film."
"Lupin-9","8","24","29","29 January 2001"," Tragic and haunting
","While not as good a Vietnam movie as Platoon or Apocalypse Now, Casualties of War nevertheless delivers the emotional punch through DePalma's depiction of how war can truly bring out the worst in people. Similar in content to the village massacre scene of Platoon, Casualties actually hits home with greater force the horrific conduct and depravity of how low these GIs had been morally reduced to. You almost cringe at certain scenes such as Corporal Clark's callous crooning of The Door's ""Hello, I love you"" while escorting their victim on the march. By being able to fully empathize with Erikson, we feel appauled and helpless as we witness his uncontrolable situation, and can't but help feel a bitter satisfaction when he lays into one of the soldiers with a shovel back at base camp. I felt angry and depressed at how any human being could act the way these soldiers did, and was haunted long after the movie's conclusion.                            Based on a true story, we realize the true tragedy of what has occurred at the movie's end, when Erikson returns to the present from his flashback and the girl suggets that he had had a ""bad dream"". The painful reality is that it wasn't just a dream, anymore than the whole Vietnam War was.                                                                 DePalma examines in great depth not just the ethics concerning warfare, but the values of right and wrong & good and evil, which every single one of us on this planet faces. Just as in Platoon with Charlie Sheen's concluding helicopter voiceover, and Saving Private Ryan's portrayal of the aged Ryan asking his wife ""have I been a good man, have I led a good life?"", Casualties of War highlights a similar concept when Erikson states that one should never abandon their sense of morality-to cease caring- just because they are surrounded by the possibility of death. Overall you are left with a harrowing feeling that is akin to the likes of having watched Schindler's List or The Killing Fields."
"rmax304823","Null","37","47","7 May 2004"," Maybe De Palma's Best
","It's the only film of De Palma's that I've seen that doesn't imitate Hitchcock, engage in shameless self indulgence, or pander to its audience. (""Pander.""  Interesting word, from a character in Chaucer who acted as a sexual intermediary.)  <br/><br/>This is structured more like a three-act play than a traditional movie.  (1) Fox is introduced to the other members of his squad and gets in a fire fight.  (2)  The squad kidnap a girl, take her into the bush, rape her and kill her, and engaged in another fire fight.  (3)  Fox tries to blow the whistle but the higher up the ladder he goes, the more angry the resistance becomes, until he finally sees the four criminals brought to trial. <br/><br/>
It is not an epic war movie full of majestic music and heroic acts and a cast of thousands, but it belongs up there with ""Platoon"" and the others. It's quite well done.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good.  Fox is fine as a short, shiny faced, humanitarian newbie who answers to a higher authority than he can find easily in the military chain of command.  Penn adopts a New York accent that is so thick that it's sometimes hard to follow, but he puts a lot of energy into the role of sergeant, almost to the point of hamminess.  His men are well-differentiated by the script -- one a savage and stupid killer, one a remorseful Hispanic, and another newly arrived grunt who goes along willingly because he's been led to believe that this is the way things are done.  The Vietnamese girl is as good as any of the men.  She appears in two roles, as the victim and, later, as a college student who has a brief, understanding exchange with Fox.<br/><br/>In many ways this is a far more shocking movie than any that De Palma has come up with, before or since.  The girl is beautiful, fine-boned, and has long black Asian hair with reddish highlights.  Her suffering during the trek into the bush, in her bare feet, carrying the men's gear on her bleeding back, is palpable.  After being gang banged she huddles in a dark corner and sobs abjectly.  Fox approaches her and she is jolted upward with fear.  And we see not the face of the pretty young girl but a battered bloody swollen toothless mask.  The scene is light years away from Angie Dickinson getting slashed with a razor in an elevator while the audience thrills.<br/><br/>There is another scene that is outstanding, a kind of denouement.  Fox is drunk and is queried by a friendly chaplain.  Having been ignored before, he spills out his hopeless story once again.  De Palma dissolves from Fox's stricken face to the court martial of the four men.  It's another shocker, the more effective for not being underlined.  Instead of the four men we have seen before, sweating and unkempt, in dirty fatigues, swearing abominably and threatening Fox, we see them cleaned up in starched kakhis, wearing their campaign ribbons and insignia.  And we are forced to the realization that these murderers and rapists, whom we have taken to be nothing more than an anarchic group of bums, are in fact representatives of the U. S. Army and are subject to its laws.  (De Palma doesn't show the court itself, just the defendants responding to questions.)  They have changed, and yet not changed.  The uncomprehending stupdity remains, and the simmering desperation.  Penn's sergeant is only twenty years old.<br/><br/>The scene with the Vietnamese student at the end is a necessary catharsis. Fox is on a train and after she gets off, he notices that she has left a scarf behind.  He retrieves the scarf and hurries after her, calling out in Vietnamese.  She smiles and asks him, ""Do I remind you of someone?""  His distress becomes plain, and she guesses its source and asks, ""Did you have a bad dream?  I think it's over now.""  Brief but touching.<br/><br/>De Palma should get a decoration too because he has disregarded his cheesier tendencies as a director.  Another De Palma might have handled that rape scene quite differently, as an opportunity for the audience to identify with the rapists and a chance to display some succulent female flesh.  (Here are her nipples.  See how purple they look?)  But not here.  It's a movie made by a grown up, for grown ups."
"ReelCheese","8","7","7","1 August 2006"," Outstanding, Emotional Drama
","It's not the battle scenes that make this outstanding war drama at times difficult to watch. Michael J. Fox plays PFC Eriksson, the lone voice of morality on an American military squad that kidnaps a frightened young local woman during the Vietnam War. Eriksson finds himself alienated from his fellow soldiers for his objections and refusal to, like them, rape her. After the woman is killed, Eriksson sets out to ensure the truth comes out and that justice is served.<br/><br/>Director Brian De Palma pulled no punches in his handling of the brutal subject matter, based on a true story. It's incredibly emotional, indeed terrifying, to watch the innocent young woman endure this torture. Covered in blood with pain inside and out, her death scene ranks as one of the most agonizing of any war picture. Adding to the tragic power of the film is the fact that we don't know anything about this woman other than the cruel twist of fate dealt to her. She could be your sister, your daughter or your best friend. The mastermind of the kidnapping, played by a scathingly hateful Sean Penn, further intensifies the horror we feel for her.<br/><br/>""Casualties of War"" is not quite on par with the all-time great war pictures, but it is guaranteed to stay with you."

Filmed with typical cinematic bravado by master craftsman DePalma, the movie uses every inch of the scope frame to convey both the duality of the landscape (vast swathes of breathtaking countryside, where sudden death lurks around every corner) and the moral vacuum which stretches the two central characters (Fox and Penn) to breaking point. Crafted with blistering simplicity by screenwriter David Rabe (himself a Vietnam veteran and author of the acclaimed stageplay 'Streamers'), the soldiers are depicted as brave individuals whose principles are shattered by their traumatic combat experiences, leaving Fox to essay the role of peacemaker in a world where all the rules have been turned upside down. Thuy - a model with no prior acting experience - is truly heartbreaking as the soldiers' terrified prisoner, and her ultimate fate is so horrific (arguably the most disturbing set-piece of this director's entire career), many viewers will be too appalled to see the film through to its inevitable conclusion. All in all, this uncompromising drama emerges as one of DePalma's strongest films to date."

"Quinoa1984","10","12","16","21 February 2010"," the brutality of any war - inhumanity
","Casualties of War is one of the most powerful anti-war movies. Note that I didn't mention Vietnam in that sentence, but just anti-war, period. Around the time of the mid to late 1980s many Vietnam war movies were flying out, The Killing Fields, Platoon, and best of them (not counting Apocalypse Now from the 70s) was Full Metal Jacket. What a lot of these movies have in common though is that they're not simply about Vietnam, but about the war experience. Of course sometimes the context of the times has to be taken in, such as it being the 'baby-boomer' generation where drugs and rock and roll were apart of the down-time. That and getting some Vietnam women for sex on the side. The themes are meant to be universal, or at least capture the nature of a platoon mind-set, of what it's like to be a soldier.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma's film is set in Vietnam, like those films, but it could take place during any war. It peels an uncomfortable layer of the soldier's experience that does need to be told - it's not pretty, it's not sentimental, it is what it is. Some soldiers during wars, not just Vietnam but others, take out casualties that are not really the enemies. And for De Palma the brutal rape and murder of a girl, an innocent one, was just such a horrible story that needed to be told. His film is full of heartfelt emotion, but it doesn't show on the actor's faces, save for Michael J. Fox. It's about an ugly subject, and so the actors (Sean Penn, John C. Reilly, John Leguizamo) play precisely unsympathetic characters, to one degree or another. They don't start out that way though, and that makes it too complex to ignore as a polemic.<br/><br/>It's about a squad, led by Penn's Sergeant, who decides to take a leave for a short while of the usual soldier duties to take a girl into the jungle and rape and murder her. Fox's PFC thinks he's kidding, but boy he isn't. They drag her miles and miles, and it becomes a morality play. Again, this is complicated: earlier in the film we saw two crucial things, that Penn's character saved Fox from death by the enemy in a tight spot, and that one of the squad's best people gets killed quite suddenly as everyone's just standing around talking (this is, truly, a shocking moment to have in any film from it coming at a mundane moment). He doesn't start off rotten, Penn's Sergeant, nor even the other guys like Don Harvey's Chuck, but as they get closer to the inevitable situation ""out there"" as they say, it takes on a ghastly inhumanity, and the kind of peer pressure that one might see in a DARE drug video, only here there's no messing around. Especially in the aftermath, with a ""don't care"" policy the army takes, for at least a little while.<br/><br/>Casualties of War is skillfully directed and unflinching in its emotional reach. When we see Fox, in some desperation of not being able to save the Vietnamese girl from the rape, try to help her and, subsequently, fail to escape, it's really shocking. Not because of what doesn't happen, per-say, but that after all of these scenes of the troop in this group-think, and the torture of this woman, there's humanity again, or something close to it (it was hard for me not to tear up a little when he finally communicated with her, ""Mama-san""). But, interestingly, De Palma and his actors don't need to do all of the heavy lifting in the dramatic department. Ennio Morricone comes on in many scenes with a musical score that, in a way, confronts the audience. Do we dare not be moved when the music swells? Is it manipulative? Possibly. But it takes a master like Morricone to do it so well in this context - only Days of Heaven can come close or top it to its haunting elegy of the heart.<br/><br/>This is an important film to look at, and it hasn't dated. Not to mention a fantastic performance from Michael J. Fox, whose subtlety in many scenes, his restraint, his character's face just pained in looking on at the horror of the situation unfolding, is just as great, if not more convincing, than Penn's surly hero-cum-villain. Another war is hell movie? Sure, but directed and acted with a modicum of believability and humanity."
"jzappa","7","10","13","5 July 2009"," Compelling Pivotal Subject Matter Out of Context In De Palma's Context
","I want to say Scarface, The Untouchables and Casualties of War are Brian De Palma's best films, because they are his most serious in subject matter. But the truth is that his best work is in films like Sisters, Snake Eyes, Femme Fatale, The Black Dahlia. It is one thing to make a hyperstylized erotic thriller, because there doesn't have to be anything sincere about the film. But he brings the same sort of stiffly disassociated acting, point-of-view-shot set pieces, stock characters and melodramatically contrived dialogue to the story of a platoon in the Vietnam War and the rape to which they subjected a village girl. The movie's structure is not so much about the act as about the climate building to it, the dehumanizing authenticity of battle, the way it advocates brute force and rejects those who would try to live by a superior gauge.<br/><br/>The pivotal sequence of the kidnapping, the march, captivity and gang rape of the girl is excruciating because it makes it so distinct how ineffectual Michael J. Fox's character's ethical fundamentals are in the face of a weapon cask. The other men either never had any issues about what they are doing, or have lost them in the bastardizing course of combat. They will do just what they want to do, and Fox is basically impotent to stop them. Based on actual events, this film makes it apparent that when a group histrionic of this kind is astir, there maybe is veritably nothing that a ""good"" person can do to save the day. And its analysis of the actualities of the scenario is what's best about the movie.<br/><br/>What is not so good are the scenes before and after the compelling pivotal subject. The movie begins and ends some time after the war, with Fox on a subway, where he sees an Asian woman who reminds him of the victim. The dialogue he has with this woman in the movie's last scene is so bound and stilted and tries so hard to manufacture a buoyant denouement into a grim movie, that it's as if it belongs in another movie.<br/><br/>Defiant encounters with two commanding officers, Dale Dye (what a shock...) and Ving Rhames, are persuasive, but then the result appears half-baked and almost annexed. More than most films, mostly on account of the vital element of peer pressure, it relies on the potency of its performances for its impact, particularly on Penn's performance, but no one is a real character; everyone is an over-the-top caricature. Penn, with unmistakable conviction and enthusiasm in spite of the cartoonishness, is the bombastic leader of the bullies; John C. Reilly makes his movie debut here as the eager, dim-witted follower; Don Harvey is the sadistic right-hand enforcer for Penn; John Leguizamo is the quiet, sheepish guy who's not as bad but has no backbone. Although Penn's self-dramatizing comes from his deep sense of integrity to the frugal standards of De Palma's style, it seems that Fox is the only player whose capacity to turn ideas into realities and translate experience into words is not affected by the affectedness. Perhaps he's perfect for a De Palma leading man, as he does away with the frivolous.<br/><br/>Objectivity is not De Palma's strong suit, which I don't necessarily see as a flaw: Who's truly objective, really? But maybe the movie would have been more impactful if it had just preserved the account as realistically as possible, devoid of De Palma's idiosyncratic artifice, his perfectionism too private and defensively preoccupied. That much would have included everything necessary that the movie has to show us."
"sindellemorte","10","6","7","8 February 2010"," A powerful social statement
","Two words made this movie unforgettable, in my opinion: Sean Penn. Sean Penn's performance as a young and disillusioned army Sergeant in the Viet Nam war is absolutely perfect. He is utterly believable as Sgt. Tony Meserve, basically just a kid who loses the only person he cares about fighting a war he doesn't want to be in and then just doesn't care anymore. As he says, ""Sometimes you hate the enemy so badly..."" He is angry at the war, he is angry at the enemy, he is angry at the army that sent him there. He is just angry. He decides to fight back and take his own little personal revenge against the enemy, focusing it all on one girl, whom he plans to rape and abuse at their discretion. Surrounded by boys no older than he and far less intelligent and dominant and one man who is obviously unbalanced and violent anyway, Meserve's act is perceived as far larger and more grand than it actually is. The only hold out is Eriksson (played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox), a young family man who has not been ""in country"" long enough to become so jaded. There is a pivotal scene in the movie where Eriksson believes he has found a kindred spirit in Diaz (played by John Leguizamo), only to find that Diaz is weak and will not stand against the ridicule from the other men.<br/><br/>Eriksson is true to his convictions and does not participate in the rape of the girl and so he is labeled a traitor and not trustworthy by the other men. He is threatened, attacked and abused by the other men but does not deviate from his course. He vows to bring the men to justice for what they have done and for what he allowed to occur, not through his action but through his INaction. There is a very moving monologue by Eriksson in which he makes a statement on whether what you do before you die matters more or less because you could die soon (paraphrase), ""...everybody's acting like we can do anything. Because we might be killed at any second, maybe we gotta be extra careful what we do. Because maybe it matters more. Maybe it matters more than we even know."" This film is a statement about war, yes. But it is also a hugely profound statement about people and what we can become if we are exposed to a society with no rules for too long. If we are exposed to too much violence for too long. The fact that it is based on a true story only reinforces this statement. It is also a statement on how allowing something to happen makes you just as culpable as those who actually participated. There is, perhaps no such thing as ""an innocent bystander."" This film also speaks about the apparent futility in righting a wrong sometimes and how it can be quite difficult to be ""a good guy"" in the middle of a bad business. While not quite on par with social statements such as ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Casualties of War"" has earned it's place in this genre honestly. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>One of this reviewers all-time favorite movies. 10/10 stars."

I was so moved by some of what I saw there and what I experienced that I wound up making 7 round trip flights from West Palm Beach Fla, to Saigon Vietnam and ultimately moved to Vietnam on a full time basis in 2000 and stayed for a couple of years.

His young squad capture a local girl and things turn ugly. It is at times brutal but always compelling. It features a great young cast headed by Fox and an impressive Sean Penn. <br/><br/>I am surprised that this currently has a rating of just 7.0 as for me it is one of the better war films of recent decades.

","Masterpiece! This movie is magic and makes me sad that our country was ever involved with that vile war of nothingness, and no I am not against the troops. I think Johnson was an idiot and that he should never have sent the soldiers they did not know what they were doing they were just doing what they were told. At that time the vast majority of the people over their could not even vote, how sick is that. What makes it even sicker is the way the American public treated these heroes upon their return, and yes they were heroes even though it was an unjust war they are still our soldiers and they were fighting for us, and they should have been respected as such. Michael J. Fox does a great job in this showing the naiveness among the soldiers at the time and Sean Penn does a good job showing how bad a persons psyche can go when pushed to the limit for something they don't believe in. I do not condone what Sean Penn's character does in the film and he was rightfully punished but I can see what drove him to it. Brian De Palma does another stellar job with his visual style that will never be toped and the lighting is great in this movie. I hate that it bombed at the box office, because everyone should see this. Great movie."

","This is one of the most effectively disturbing war films, (I dare say) ever. De Palma's use of violence, once again, is at once completely too much, --and necessary.  And so far its impact has withstood the test of time better than PLATOON, HAMBURGER HILL, or even De Palma's other works (the overrated SCARFACE comes to mind).  <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Michael J. Fox on film (he has that one good trademark, I'm-out-of-my-element-frustration in every single role he plays), but in this one he is very well cast.  And that goes without saying for the rest of the skilled cast.  Sean Penn's Meserve is evil-incarnate, but one for which the audience feels a certain pathos.  You get a sense he would be an upright citizen in another life, were it not for the trauma of war in this one that has turned him into a genuine psychopath.  In a lesser film, the supporting cast would have either been caricature or less.  But each support performance is sincerely memorable.  They range distinctly from complete reluctance, to ambivalence, to complete indifference; it's an accurate study in group mentality as any ever depicted on film.  <br/><br/>
The ending has been criticized as being too tidy.  I don't believe it to be so, though.  Sentimental?  A little.  But it's still done just right, IMO. Notable:  Ving Rhames in his minor part delivers what is effectively a very memorable monologue."

","This is a very gripping movie. Michael J Fox is excellent as the anguished young GI who keeps his integrity and grows in determination and stature; and Sean Penn's sergeant is frighteningly realistic. The combat situation is caught very effectively early on, and the characterisation of the men in the early scenes is deft and economical - and adds a great deal of depth to what happens later. The presentation of the group dynamics of the unit which abducts and rapes the Vietnamese girl is thought-provoking throughout, and convincing both in its sense of almost casual reality, and in its increasing intensity.  The moral complexities of the situation and its aftermath are never ducked - we hear from all sides, and are implicitly challenged by the actions of all the characters. At the end we also see the cost to the Michael J Fox character of the stand he took. It seems he will remain haunted by the incident for life - and the film will surely stay with those who watch it, and disturb us with awkward questions. What would we have done?"

","CASUALTIES of WAR is one of the very best of the late 80s Vietnam films. Being all about the rape and murder of a young Vietnamese girl by U.S. troops, it's understandable why this film produced much controversy and why there are so many quasi-political reasons for liking/disliking it. CASUALTIES of WAR is ""based on"" something that actually happened, and I'm sure there are some departures from how exactly it all happened. While the critical aspects are obviously factual, I'm appraising this film simply as a drama and will let others quibble about how true or untrue the specifics are.<br/><br/>Though he comes across as just a little TOO squeaky-clean, Michael J. Fox is decent in the lead role of Private Eriksson. I've noticed a number of criticisms of Sean Penn's portrayal of young charismatic Sergeant Meserve, but I find him to be an utterly convincing and memorable character and think this is one of Penn's very best performances, which is saying a lot. Those who play the other four soldiers in the understrength squad are similarly real, as are many of the supporting cast, particularly Dale Dye as Captain Hill and Ving Rhames as Lieutenant Reilly. Thuy Thu Le's strong performance as the victim is also noteworthy.<br/><br/>Viewed simply as a war film, CASUALTIES of WAR has all the elements that anyone would look for in that genre. Before the pivotal event occurs, there is a lot of gripping combat footage of different types in different locations and situations with all the necessary plot, character development, and sense of place. Fine script too, believably quirky without falling to the stereotypical ""soldier-talk"" we often encounter in films of this sort. There are also many themes to analyze if you're into it, especially in what this film shows us about the ironies of military ""justice."" And let's not forget the basic conflict of CASUALTIES of WAR. A crime of this nature can never be justified, of course, but this film does the best that can be done in showing the how and why of it all. Some have objected because they think it makes our troops look bad. It's an unavoidable fact, however, that a number of crimes of this magnitude did in fact occur during the Vietnam War, and they occurred more often than we'd probably like to think. At the same time, I do not think it's ever suggested that all or even most American troops in that war committed acts like the one shown here.<br/><br/>Finally, CASUALTIES of WAR has a darkly beautiful ending."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>With Kubrick and de Palma, the image comes first. The script is an excuse, and the actors are either collaborators or unwitting victims. Fox is a victim here. He was chosen precisely because he is clueless.<br/><br/>With de Palma it is the eye, always the eye. But here he lets the story frame the eye more than in the past. He had just come off the Mamet-authored `Untouchables' to acclaim (lines like `stinks like a whorehouse at low tide') and was to disasterously rely more heavily on the text in `Vanities.' This is between the two, also by a celebrated playwrite. Framed by the bus, with inner framing of the tunnel scene and the bridge scene.<br/><br/>
These two scenes are the backbone of the vision. de Palma likes the notion of worlds under and over worlds. The tunnel world gives no contribution to the story per se, it is the filmmaker's statement of the cherry's entry into unknown levels. Later, the levels are the bridge and river, where his real story ends. In between the camera is constantly moving up and down, often beginning or ending completely out of frame. If you love visual narrative, you gotta love that.<br/><br/>Also the four-house deal: how the camera lives in these four spaces: the hooch of the abduction, the hooch of the rape and later the assistance, the destroyed temple of the interview with the Captain and the `courtroom.' The camera knows these spaces -- they have character, which are defined first and then only reflecting on the persons within. This is a Welles trick, one which de Palma does more subtly and effectively I think.<br/><br/>de Palma has chosen to make an anti-war film. And he is intelligent enough to know this means making an anti war-film. War-films are by their nature reductionist. You need to not only undercut war (a trivial job for an artist) but the simplicity implied in the genre. Malick was to do this better, but by recourse to a philosophy probably not reachable by most (additive abstraction). de Palma's solution is less intellectual, and as with Malick relies on collaboration with Penn.<br/><br/>This is Penn's first truly multidimensional role, where he plays several characters at once. Here he plays the Sgt., as John Wayne would. But he also plays the playwrite/filmmaker and the actor playing the filmmaker. It is his birth as an artist, and one not missed by screenwriter Rabe. He would rewrite his `HurlyBurly' as a more multileveled project and similarly collaborate."

","I like war films when done well. Platoon was fantastic and I'm gonna put Casualties of War right up there with that multi-Oscar winner. That may sound a little haughty from me – but this film is deserving of such an accolade. The story is harrowing, the material itself shocking at times – but the overall result is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot details here in this review as it has been well covered at this stage but I will go into certain specific elements of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting: Fox is fantastic here – never better. Fox is a good actor anyway, we all know that, but I feel he does not get the credit he deserves sometimes. To some he will always be Marty McFly from the BTTF movies (to be honest he will be to me too) but he really puts in a great shift in this flick. His naturalistic, everyman style makes you want to root for him no matter what. He carries the film in my view as the only true upstanding character in the army who sticks by his beliefs no matter what. Actually – the fact that this incident took place in the Vietnam war is a side issue if you ask me – it could have happened anywhere at any time. It is truly about humanity's morality as opposed to being about a war or those who took part in it. But for me – Fox is terrific.<br/><br/>Penn is brilliant too. An angry, tobacco chewing 20-year old Sarge – dumped in a world of pain and suffering. You can see his motivations and where the frustrations have caused him to carry out the horrible act in the film. Penn is another brilliant actor in my view – in so far as whenever I see him, I believe he 'is' the character and not just 'acting' as that character. Here is the ultimate proof of his abilities. Some reviewers say that he 'overacts' a little here – but to me it is simply his intensity.<br/><br/>The girl who plays the rape victim - Thuy Thu Le - is also terrific. A true testament of finding a talent out there without a background of acting who can turn in a performance amongst the best that Hollywood can offer. It's such a pity that this film was her one and only performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast varies a little. Erik King as Brownie hams it up a little in a couple of scenes (just look at his facial expressions as the unit walks into a Vietnamese village for pure contortion) but does well in others (when he gets shot). Don Harvey as Clark is a parody of a evil persona within the movie – an OTT performance. John C Reilly is okay. Ving Rhames is okay. Leguizamo is good as the conflicted Diaz. Dale Dye is terrific – intense and totally believable, his one-on-one with Fox superb.<br/><br/>Cinematography: De Palma's style runs through this movie like a river. He is a genius. The angles he uses (Fox's chat with Dye), the foreground/background shots (When Fox is traumatized from Brownie's shooting in the foreground and the background shows the villagers helping the VC soldier to escape), the courtroom scene (where we see the accused soldiers one by one and only ever hear the prosecutor), the long tracking shots (Basecamp Wolf) and the superb Leone-like close ups (Fox in the rain) are all beautiful. And there is so much more also – VC tunnels, burned out fields, the kidnapping itself, another background/foreground shot when the girl is stabbed – that are used to tremendous effect. The brutal nature of the story and the action is still magnificently displayed through a masterclass of cinema-making techniques from a truly gifted director.<br/><br/>The screenplay, music, production values are all top notch and the story rattles along at a nice pace. This is a movie in which anyone who was remotely involved in it could be extremely proud. Well done all.<br/><br/>9/10 – I deducted the point for the sometimes ropy acting of some of the periphery characters and for one emotional speech from Fox which was simply too preachy and overlong."

What makes this hated by some it its subject matter, but in some cases you have to look past what is happening and apply the general circumstances to other things that may happen in other places. Do this with Casualties of War, and you see exactly why it is so good.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox abandons his comedic charm as Private Ericsson, a newcomer in the Vietnam War. Some people say that Fox was wrongfully cast and ones that did not see this were unsure of how he could pull off such a serious role. He may not be funny, but he is still like a little like he was in Family Ties. The role of Ericsson needed to be a young underdog, so casting Michael J Fox was good.<br/><br/>As a newcomer to war, Ericsson quickly sees how scary battles can be. Luckily, his loyal platoon has his back 100%. The leader of the platoon is the insane Sgt. Meserve, played disturbingly well by Sean Penn. Most war movies focus on how war changes people for the worse, ultimately turning them into sadistic killing machines. Meserve and some other members of the platoon personify the different levels of this, ranging from scared to animalistic.<br/><br/>Just as Ericsson begins to question why he is there, the platoon kidnap the most beautiful woman in a Vietnamese village and aspire to use her as their sex slave. Ericsson and Diaz (John Leguizamo) want no part of it, but Ericsson is the only one willing to stand up to his men. The rape is briefly shown, but all the implications and extreme fear in the girl makes the movie disturbing enough. Ericsson is bullied for his refusal and he eventually tries to help her escape. It eventually leads to her extremely brutal death that is heartbreaking. Ericsson is haunted by the events and is determined to prosecute the men that protected him but murdered her.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie deals with a soldier trying to stop rape. I saw it as a young man who was faced with a dilemma to stay loyal to the men that protect him and his own country, yet preventing such barbaric acts. It is about a man who must go against the crowd for his own principles. The torn loyalty could be applied to many different real-life situations, not just war.<br/><br/>4/4"

","I have always been mystified as to why this movie has not gotten greater recognition. Maybe because Penn's portrayal of Meserve seems like over-acting. Or maybe because Ericsson seems too clean. In any case, I did a research paper (for a film/literature class) on this movie a bunch of years ago.<br/><br/>For those of you wondering how close the film is to the original report in the October 1969 edition of the New Yorker: the answer is ""pretty darn close."" Even the names used in the film match the ""fictional"" names used in the magazine article. And, believe it or not, Ving Rhames' speil about his 'hospital experience' was actually reported in the article.<br/><br/>Without making this a ""spoiler"", the main differences are: 1) There was no one named ""Brownie"". But it is easy to figure out the dramatic reason he was included in the film. 2) There was no ""Hatcher"". Instead there was a second ""Diaz""...apparently they were cousins. 3) Captain Hill was not quite the jerk he is made out to be in the film. He was reluctant to do anything substantial...but he did have an occasion to tear a strip off of the guys in the squad. 4)There was no railway scene and the dramatic act that is presented there actually happened one day later than the film would have you believe.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just think that this movie is perfect because it shows so well (at a micro-level) why Vietnam was a war that couldn't be won. You can't win a war (serve the political objective) when you don't have the support of the people. Watching this film, it is easy to be sympathetic (or at least understand) how each group felt...even Meserve. The underlying politics meant nothing to either side (the US soldiers or the South Vietnamese). The result was a total disregard from each side and for each side (and they were supposed to be on the same side). This movie shows that perfectly."

","De Palma's heroes often fail to rescue women from their ill fated destinies. In his blood soaked worlds, women are objectified and then cast aside, often killed by phallic tools (drills) or manly instruments (shaving blades). The high school rituals in ""Carrie"", the low budget exploitation films in ""Blow Out"", the porn flicks in ""Body Double"" and ""Black Dahlia"", all portray women as tokens of capitalist exchange. In ""Obsession"" this exchange revolves around international business, in ""Blow Out"" and ""Snake Eyes"" it revolves around national politics, in ""Scarface"" it revolves around organised crime and in ""Dahlia"" it revolves around Hollywood.<br/><br/>Critics have used this to label De Palma as a masochist who hates women. It took Pauline Kael, who championed De Palma as a feminist director who targets, not women, but rather, the patriarchal order, to lay the foundation for a slew of feminist writers embracing De Palma's films.<br/><br/>""Casualties"" replaces Kubrick's metaphorical rape of a female sniper with the literal rape of a Vietnamese civilian (called Oahn). Both director's treat war as the defiling of the Feminine Other, though Kubrick goes one step further and internalises it (""death of the Feminine equals loss of self"" becomes a Kubrickean dismissal of Jung: ""there is no self""). In ""Casualties of War"", the rape is thus not only a single incident, but symbolic of a larger patriarchy threatened by national and racial difference.<br/><br/>Tellingly, the film opens with a train drawing to a halt. Only women and 2 black men leave the carriage. They've been dispatched and so we zoom in on Erickson (played by M. Fox), who sleeps against a window. His head occupies the right of the frame whilst the left of the frame is distant and out of focus. This right-left composition will be repeated throughout the film, firstly when a black trooper (called Brownie) is killed, secondly when Sean Penn recounts Brownie's death and thirdly when Oahn is killed. These deep focus shots work as a moment of contrast, recollection and mourning. In the first, we see Fox in the foreground, asleep and oblivious to his surroundings. In the second, we see Brownie dying in the foreground, while Vietcong hide in the background. In the third, we see the reverse. Oahn is stabbed to death in the background, while Fox fires at Vietcong in the foreground.<br/><br/>De Palma also uses the notion of vertical space to separate each portion of the film. The first act is subterranean, Fox linked to underground tunnels. The second act is above ground, De Palma stressing dry, flat landscapes. In contrast, the third act takes place on a series of hills, whilst the fourth act takes place on a high-rise bridge. The tall bridge and the underground tunnel frame the rape story. We watch as Fox ascends further and further into hell.<br/><br/>De Palma uses the first act of the film to set up genre conventions. Here, Sean Penn is the hero. He rescues Erickson, kills the savage Vietnamese animals and prances about like John Wayne, spewing tips and wisdom of the jungle. The fast talking black guy, the noble sergeant, the new recruit, the dirty Vietnamese...all these genre conventions are quickly set up, only to be reversed twenty minutes later.<br/><br/>Sean Penn, in his first piece of meta-acting, plays his character as a cross between John Wayne and De Niro's Vietnamese psycho from De Palma's ""Hi Mom!"". After the death of Brownie, he chooses to take his men to the local brothel. They plan to hook up with some whores and vent their anger, but learn that the village is off limits, as the Vietcong troops are busy visiting the whore houses themselves. This drives Penn mad. ""Charlie is getting my pussy!"" he yells. What follows is the group's attempt to win back and conquer the Feminine Other. They want ""her"", simply because the enemy has ""her"". To have ""her"" is to deny the enemy.<br/><br/>The scenes in which Oahn is dragged from her village and later raped are some of the most powerful moments in De Palma's filmography. When her battered face is revealed, it's hard not to cry. Later, De Palma cross-cuts Oahn's death with a POV shot down the scope of an American rifle. The point is clear: every shot fired, in every war, is a knife in Oahn's chest (in Vietnamese, Oahn means ""injustice"").<br/><br/>De Palma is a smart guy and he knows that making an anti-war film means making one in which the audience gets no visceral kick out of violence. Like Kubrick or Jancso, his violence has a dry detachment. And like ""Come and See"", it's often subjective and stretched to operatic lengths. This morbid tone is largely why the film has failed to capture audiences. Man wants the excitement and primal bloodlust of a ""Platoon"", ""Black Hawk Down"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"", most of these films functioning as ""war porn"", a form of catharsis or gratification (violence always has a sexual element). The existential disappointments of a ""Casualties of War"" or a ""Come and See"" are unsettling and no fun at all.<br/><br/>After Oahn's death, we watch as Fox tries to get the ""bad apples"" jailed. Significantly, this portion of the ""dream"" begins with Fox ""waking up"" back in camp. With the release of De Palma's ""Redacted"", this much derided final act now seems only more powerful, allowing us to empathise with the gang of rapists, to balk at their harsh sentences, even as we despise their actions. <br/><br/>Fox then wakes up a final time, sees Oahn leaving the train and notices that she's left her scarf behind. He rushes after her. We briefly recall Oahn's mother handing her daughter a scarf prior to her being kidnapped. The camera then cranes upwards, taking Fox to one final level. The credits roll.<br/><br/>8.9/10 - Masterpiece. Requires several viewings, if only to properly attune yourself to what De Palma is doing."
"phd_travel","10","5","8","29 January 2014"," A courageous movie - deserves more praise
","Kudos to Brian de Palma for making this brave movie. There aren't many movies that show war crimes by U.S. soldiers. Most Vietnam war movies focus on the impact of the war on the U.S. soldiers. The effect on civilians in Vietnam is often too painful and unpopular to deal with. It is a movie that shows Vietnam as tragedy for everyone involved not just the combatants. <br/><br/>The true story of the rape and murder of a Vietnamese farm girl and it's exposure by a soldier who refused to take part is shown in a straightforward and unflinchingly direct way. The rape and murder itself is beyond heartbreaking. Yet the story isn't one sided. It shows the perpetrators being in such a horrid situation that allowed something like this to happen. The movie shows the difficulties and consequences of being a whistle blower - how relevant today.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox gives a very moving and sympathetic performance showing he is a fine dramatic actor. My initial misgivings of him as being mainly a comedic actor were quickly dispelled. Sean Penn gives a totally believable performance as the idiotic sergeant in charge. The Vietnamese actress Thuy Thu Le's performance is so good that it's almost too painful to watch.<br/><br/>This movie isn't as famous as it should be and deserves a place among the most powerful and well acted war movies of all time."

Casualties' grip on the viewer increases step by stop and scene by scene. Each scene ends with a dilemma that ""hooks"" the audience and demands continued viewing. Each scene begins with either a resolution of the previous scene's hook, or begins with an oblique answer that leads into a direction not anticipated by some viewers. Like DePalma's best films Casualties is primarily a thriller. One doesn't need any political viewpoint to enjoy this film. The film works well on more than one level of reality, which is always an artistic accomplishment."

"zetes","5","12","25","27 September 2009"," A powerful story, poorly told
","Incredibly uneven Vietnam drama from pulp master Brian De Palma. De Palma's the problem here - he's really the kind of director who needs to stay away from serious subject matters, because he's too ham-fisted to handle it with any tact. He does very well with more B-level stuff, and he can definitely be masterful in movies like Carrie and Sisters (though he screws that stuff up as often as not, too). Casualties of War is about a five-person squadron (Michael J. Fox, John Leguizamo, John C. Reilly, Don Harvey and led by Sean Penn) who kidnap a teenage Vietnamese girl, march her into the jungle, rape her and then murder her. Fox is the lone objector in the group, but there's nothing he can do to stop them. He's just a private under Penn's command. Plus, they all have guns and are presumably better at using them than he is. When the group returns from the mission, Fox tries to do the right thing and bring about justice, but his superiors (including Ving Rhames) are mostly unwilling to listen. Yeah, this is powerful stuff. The problem is, De Palma doesn't think we will know that if he just presents it. He has to throw it at us, underlining every little thing, and giving the actors big speeches (one particular shot with Fox seems so clearly to be meant as his Oscar clip that I had to giggle). The worst part of the film by far is the score. Who wrote it? None other than the great Ennio Morricone. I guess everyone has an off day, but I've never heard Morricone deliver a score that was even mediocre (okay, maybe his John Carpenter knock-off score for The Thing). This one is downright putrid. The whole film is terribly overscored. I think that was done to go along with Sean Penn's overacting. The guy's frequently been accused of overdoing it, but generally I think his methody style works. Not here. He's never been worse. By comparison, Michael J. Fox actually isn't half bad. It's pretty clear he wasn't meant for heavy drama, though. Brian De Palma made a startlingly similar movie about the Iraq War in 2007, the even worse Redacted. I know both of these stories are true and they certainly are both subjects worthy of a film treatment, but De Palma was not the one to do it. And, having done both of these movies, it almost seems like he has a beef with U.S. soldiers."

"buddyboy28","8","3","5","10 July 2013"," The Theatrical cut is good but the extended cut is a masterpiece
","I am not usually a fan of War films, but this is not a typical War film.It's not a grand-scale action movie with big battle scenes. It's a low-key Vietnam War drama about the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a Vietnamese girl at the hands of a group of US soldiers.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Michael J.Fox who plays Erikkson,a naïve soldier who has only been in Vietnam for three weeks. His Sergeant is played by Sean Penn,a tough,efficient soldier who is just about hanging onto his sanity amongst the chaos and destruction that's going on around him.<br/><br/>Whilst relaxing in a village,Meserve's closest friend,and radio operator,Brownie,is shot,and later dies. This is the point where Merserve starts to lose it. And when he and the rest of his men are refused entry into a brothel,he decides to kidnap a local village girl and use her as their sex slave.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma proves again what a masterful filmmaker he is,in scene after scene,shot after shot. The film is grim,and disturbing in many parts,but his style and cinematography is so good, it's difficult to look away from. This was a film that he'd been wanting to make for years,and you can tell when you watch the film that he was passionate about it,and wasn't just interested in showing sex,or violence for the sake of exploitation,or just to shock,which he has been accused of sometimes.For instance the rape sequence is brilliantly filmed. It goes without saying that rape scenes are always uncomfortable to watch, but the rape scene here is surprisingly the least graphic I've seen from a visual point of view. There's hardly any nudity,and there's no close-ups of the sex act. However, emotionally it is one of the most disturbing. Partly because there's such a long build up to it. As soon as the girl has been kidnapped, we know what her fate is going to be. Partly because it's a group of soldiers that are committing the act on her, and partly because De Palma films it in a way that puts the audience in Erikkson's place. While the rape goes on,he is helplessly on look out duty, and it's filmed from his point of view as he watches the soldiers from a distance in the hut, taking it in turns with the girl. We feel what Eriksson feels, horrified and angry. It's a disturbing yet stunning piece of filmmaking and Ennio Morricone's haunting music makes it even more effective. We don't see Erikkson again until the moment when Meserve approaches him,and then we finally get a close-up of his face. This is the moment where Erikkson has become demoralised.His face speaks volumes about what he's seen. The moment where the girl is killed is equally unsettling. Again, De Palma avoids sensational violence and shows the girl been stabbed in the distance behind Erikkson as he is taking out the Vietcong with his rifle and doesn't even notice what is going on behind him. The close-up of the girl been shot dead is shocking and filmed again from Erikkson's point of view, as he witnesses this tragedy whilst trying to prevent her death.<br/><br/>The third and final section of the film focuses on Erikkson's attempts to bring his comrades to justice. This was a part of the film that I felt lacked something in the theatrical version but now thanks to the extended cut, I think it's just as powerful as the events leading up to it. There's only 6 minutes of extra footage but it adds to it. There's a scene where Erikkson is interrogated by two Military agents that was missing before. It's a great scene because it now explains how the investigation began after Erikkson's Captain and Lieutenant tried to dismiss it. Again, De Palma films the interview well with one long tracking shot.And the courtroom scene is brilliant too. While each of the four guilty soldiers are been prosecuted,we are not shown anybody else in the room,we just see each of the soldiers and hear the voices of the lawyers. It's also one of the most shocking moments because it's the moment when these criminals are shown in all their glory. Obviously you never forget that they are soldiers during the events leading up to their trial, but all through the kidnapping they are rough and dirty unshaven.Here they are clean and shaved, dressed in their formal uniform and wearing their medals but it doesn't change the fact that they are rapists and murderers. The extra scene here shows Erikkson been cross-examined. It further drives home the point that even though Erikkson didn't take part in the incident, he failed to save her, and he feels as guilty as if he did take part in it and it will ultimately haunt him for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Michael J.fox doesn't belong in a serious War film but he's perfectly cast here. His youthful looks work for the part of the innocent, naive young soldier ,and his short stature works for the ""ordinary,everyday man"" caught up in an unthinkable situation. His acting his outstanding throughout. He does have a few bits of clunky dialogue,but it's not his fault,it's the writer David Rabe who actually served in Vietnam, trying to get some moral points across. Fox handles it well. But it's mainly his subtlety I was impressed with throughout. His expressions speak volumes. I've never been a fan of Sean Penn. I've always found him to be an overrated,scenery-chewing actor and I still feel he's the same here. But I think it kind of works this time because of the extremes of the situation his character is in.<br/><br/>This is a thought-provoking, powerful piece of cinema that shows the best and worst traits of human behaviour. It's a difficult film to watch at times but I've seen it many times because of the performances and film-making. It's a masterpiece."
"Toolman911","10","3","5","30 May 2005"," An Excellent Emotional Piece of Vietnam History
","I was born in 1967 and can very happily say that I am glad that I never had to serve in the military, much less, Vietnam. Since I was never there, I can only read what has been published, and either choose to believe those stories to be accurate portrayals or simply embellished accounts. This story is tragic and is supposed to be based on a story that was published in a magazine, based on true events. I believe, in my honest opinion, that while it may have not been rampant, there was indeed raping and killing of Vietnamese civilians during the Vietnam conflict. This story highlights one such occurrence and is gripping and tragic. The character portrayed by Michael J. Fox, must have had some very strong character, but was also very realistic in what he felt he could do. Personally, had it been me, and I was thrown into that situation where my squad decided to kidnap, rape, torture and kill a Vietnamese innocent, I would have simply wasted the squad. Screw the consequences, I would have done what was my moral obligation to prevent that from happening. If I had to go down for, so be it. But, I would feel justified in killing those filthy bastards. I hope that I am not the only person out there that feels this way and not the only person who strongly believes that we should have NEVER been there in the first place. It was their war, to win or lose. Instead, the US went in and became profiteers in this tragic piece of history, raping and gutting the country of Vietnam and playing both sides and seeking to make money off of the pain and suffering. To this day, we still seem to keep making those horrible mistakes in the name of God and country. Makes me ashamed to be an American."

","This stunning film is unquestionably Michael J. Fox's finest hour and proved there was more to him than Marty McFly. His scene with the chaplain when he tells him that he had helped kidnap the Vietnamese girl from the village and stood by while his comrades raped her is especially heartbreaking. Sean Penn, always a great actor, provides another good performance here as the sneering Meserve, instigator of the rape. The film's other ""star"" is former model Thuy Thu Le, who without the benefit of any dialogue manages to convey the horror and anguish of the situation she is in and in fact the film would be that much less effective without it. With Brian DePalma still at the height of his powers here (this probably being one of the very best films he has ever done, ranking alongside ""The Untouchables"", ""Blow Out"", ""Carlito's Way"" and ""Obsession"", and just before the debacle that was ""The Bonfire of the Vanities""), this is also arguably the best Vietnam film ever made (definitely better than the overrated ""Deer Hunter"" and ""Platoon"" and certainly the equal of ""Apocalypse Now""), certainly the most moving. Ennio Morricone's grand sweeping score (complete with pan pipes) is also a big contributor to the film's emotional heart. With early roles for Ving Rhames, John Leguizamo and John C.

Meserve (Sean Penn). After the five are rejected on a leave Meserve kidnaps a Vietnemese woman who they plan on raping. Eriksson is against their action and soon finds himself at the four's wrath but things get even more heated once he plans to help press charges against them.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma's CASUALTIES OF WAR was just one of many Vietnam movies from about an eleven year period where all sorts of them were coming out. COMING HOME and THE DEER HUNTER kicked things off and then you got stuff like APOLALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET. De Palma has stated that he believes his film is among the best made but I'd argue that it's the least entertaining.<br/><br/>There are all sorts of issues that I have with this film but the biggest is that De Palma just isn't working too well in the drama department. One of my issues with the film was the music score that is just over-bearing at times as it's often very loud as if they're trying to put certain emotions into the viewer. The track is just too intrusive and I'd argue that it does more damage than good as it pretty much beats the viewer over the head trying to get them to ""feel"" a certain way.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the picture was the performance by Fox. He gives a good performance but at the same time I just didn't believe him in the role and I didn't think he was strong enough to carry the picture. It's been said that him being cast is the only thing that got the movie made, which I believe but I just don't think he helped the movie. Penn is also quite good here, although I do think his character gets a bit too cartoonish at times. The supporting cast includes fine performances by Don Harvey, John Leguizamo, John C. Reilly, Ving Rhames and Dale Dye.<br/><br/>De Palma certainly knows how to film a movie so the cinematography is top-notch and I'd argue that the rape sequence as well as the trial sequences in the Extended Version are well-done and tense. With that said, a lot of the movie just comes across as flat and that includes the battle sequences, which just aren't all that memorable. CASUALTIES OF WAR was made to show what horrors were in Vietnam but on the whole it isn't nearly as good as it thinks it is."

"view_and_review","8","1","1","14 February 2020"," Immensely Disturbing
","War is bloody, it's dirty, it's ugly, it's a nightmare, but what happened in ""Casualties of War"" wasn't war even by the most hawkish definition.<br/><br/>
Five men, led by Sargent Meserve (Sean Penn), went on a short mission and along the way they kidnapped, r*ped, and killed a young Vietnamese woman. Of the five only four partook in the sexual assault while Pfc Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) abstained. It's hard to say what was more depressing and more disturbing: the fact that a platoon of soldiers kidnapped, r*ped, and killed a woman, the fact that the two leaders coerced Diaz (John Leguizamo) to partake and tried to coerce Eriksson, or the fact that Eriksson told his superiors and they were almost angry he mentioned it. All of these facts are immensely disturbing and I can only imagine that if this one instance did come to light, how many others stayed in darkness?<br/><br/>Whether you believe these men did these acts because of the war or because of something within them irrespective of the war, it was still depravity. And I got the impression that depravity was normal and tacitly approved so long as the men were good soldiers. War is no place for a conscience. It's no place for morals, manners, ethics, religion, or right and wrong. It's a place of following orders and being a good soldier. And if r*ping an innocent woman along the way will help a man be a better soldier, then so be it. It would seem that the Army would take ten Sargent Meserves over one thousand Erikssons.<br/><br/>This same story told by a different soldier would have you believe that Eriksson was a treacherous soldier not to be trusted. He doesn't follow orders and he's a rat. Meserve wanted all of his guys to participate in the violation of the nameless Vietnamese woman because then he could trust them all. If they were all dirty then he'd know that they were all equally guilty and they were all in the crap together. But if one of them should abstain, such as Eriksson did, then now you have someone who's not a part of the team. But how far would you be willing to go to be a part of the ""team?""<br/><br/>As a plot, as a production, and as far as performances; this was a quality movie. Sean Penn was masterfully despicable. He played his character so well I'm sure his own mother hated him. But as much of a quality movie this was, ""Casualties of War"" made me sick. I was sick with anger, disgust, disappointment, sadness. This was one hard movie to watch. Some movies are hard to watch because they are so bad, yet this one was hard to watch purely because of the content.<br/><br/>This happened. I can watch the movie or not watch the movie. It won't change a thing. This deplorable and immeasurably depraved act happened, so why not know the truth in all its ugliness as opposed to some sugar coated version to make us all feel good about the Vietnam War and our soldiers? I think we owe it to ourselves and to the nameless faceless Vietnamese that were killed for no reason."
"classicsoncall","8","1","1","7 June 2019"," ""You survive the Nam, you get to live forever.""
","So as not to overlook the significance of the movie's title, the statement being made here is that often times, the true casualties of war are not the soldiers killed on the battlefield, but the survivors who carry the memory of their actions in the arena. That's not meant to disparage the sacrifices of the deceased and wounded, but for them, the ordeal is over. For those like private Eriksson (Michael J. Fox), the horror and dread of his war time experience will remain forever etched into memory from which there is no escape. Similarly, the fates of his superior officers and fellow soldiers will have to live with the burden of their inhuman behavior for the rest of their lives, well beyond the span of time deemed by military justice to have served as their penalty. Of the many fine films made of the Viet Nam War (""Platoon"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Apocalypse Now""), this is one that may well affect the viewer most on an emotional level, as you place yourself in the position of Private Eriksson and try to imagine how you would react in the same situation. As much as one would believe they'd hold firm to his principles, it's not impossible to understand how someone in similar circumstances would fold under the pressure of fellow team members the way Diaz (John Leguizamo) did. Cast in a sobering role, Michael J. Fox portrays his conflicted character well, determining that the truth will eventually out. However the most excruciating performance is turned in by Thuy Thu Le, the Vietnamese girl kidnapped and raped by Sgt. Meserve's (Sean Penn) willful subordinates. No matter how noble their military service might have been up to that point, their obvious willingness to cast aside all human decency while on patrol would remain a black and bloody stain on their conscience forever."
"paulclaassen","7","1","1","14 February 2019"," Effective, emotional drama
","Firstly, don't watch this movie expecting an all-out war movie. The film is a character study of soldiers during a war, and the crimes they commit simply because they believe they have the means and power to do so. In the midst of all this, is one soldier (Michael J Fox) who still believes in morals during war.<br/><br/>Thuy Thu Le was incredible as the kidnapped villager. Sean Penn was excellent as the antagonist and Michael J Fox equally good as the protagonist. The film is an emotional journey of torture, rape and humiliation. I couldn't help but wonder how many times this possibly happened during wars over the years. The film is as effective in stirring emotion as it is in still believing in the good in people."
"Poseidon-3","Null","1","1","20 June 2008"," Unsung, disturbing bit of war hell, based on a true story.
","In the wake of ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (and thanks to its release in the summer during amid less oppressive fare), this Vietnam era drama failed to make a big splash at the box office, but has earned a following over time. Fox plays an idealistic newbie, dropped into the hellhole of the conflict and assigned to a five-man team, which is sent to spot the enemy in advance of a major operation. The team is led by hard-edged, slightly off balance Penn, who is mourning the recent death of one of his pals. The remaining soldiers include violent blowhard Harvey, thickheaded Reilly and meek Leguizamo. Penn, in an unauthorized and startling move, decides to kidnap a young Vietnamese girl (Thu Le) and use her as a sex slave for the men during their trek. Some of the men revel in this plan, but Fox and Leguizamo balk at it. This sets up an enmity between Fox and Penn that affects both of their lives forever. Fox, whom many considered preposterous casting for a film this serious, does a terrific job for the most part. His tireless earnestness only becomes a bit much near the end and there are a few scenes that are perhaps deeper than he can go. However, he handles the bulk of the dramatic aspects well and fits his character nicely. Penn is an arresting presence and offers up a captivating portrayal, though he does go a bit over the top along the way. Similar to the way Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie did not communicate off the set in director DePalma's ""Carrie"", the two men didn't socialize behind the scenes on this film. Harvey is appropriately slimy and menacing. Reilly and Leguizamo, in very early roles for them, are quite good at what they are called upon to do. (A special nod must go to the casting director who not only gave these two their tremendous breaks, but also gave future award-winner Rhames a featured role as Penn's superior officer.) DePalma crony Gregg Henry appears unbilled in the court-martial scene of the extended cut. Thu Le, an unknown actress who seemingly never did another Hollywood or other major project, is extraordinarily affecting as the captive. Based on a true story (and followed more closely than is sometimes the case with these things), it's a gut-wrenching, even haunting, experience. The landscape is breathtaking, the cinematography is lush, the music is excellent and the acting is often very strong. Depalma places the viewer into the situation and forces him to experience the events through Fox's eyes (with the sexuality being downplayed somewhat, though never the violence, of course.) If there's a significant problem with the film, it is probably the dÃ©nouement, considering the most interesting events take place during the middle section and what follows is either silly (the events in the lavatory) or repetitive (the reporting and investigation scenes.) The ending is even more protracted in the extended cut of the movie. Also, thanks to the heavily dramatic, slow motion, moan-filled climax, edited for maximum impact instead of for stark bleakness, there is very nearly the presence of unintentional humor. These issues aren't fatal, but they do detract moderately from the film's overall success. Still, it's a skillfully produced, emotionally stirring, thought-provoking piece of cinema that deserves to be seen."
"drystyx","7","1","1","5 March 2007"," More than any other movie, a boy grows up in a hurry
","If there's a moral to this story, aside from all the basic ones, its that a lot of casualties of war are because boys are sent in to fight for causes they only know a little about. In this case, Michael Fox plays a boy who, more than any other movie ever made, has to grow up in a hurry. He is part of a fighting unit which has gone loco, thanks mostly to two insane members. The five man unit kidnap a young girl in order to rape and kill her. Fox does all he can to stop it, as a boy who is a member of a respected group. During the movie, Fox realizes he must be more than that to stop the maniacs. He realizes the maniacs will never stop. In essence, he becomes a man, which alienates him from the numerous maniacs in charge, which is the real problem. Excellent writing and production. And one of the best realistic yet Hollywood endings of all time."

","All I can say is GREAT FILM. The one thing that people should know going into this film (and others have documented this in their summaries) is that is painfull to watch. If this film doesn't touch you then nothing will.<br/><br/>Great performances by Sean Penn and Michael J Fox."
"ArthurDental","7","1","1","14 December 2002"," Happy ending not worth it
","I think this film tries too hard not to leave audience down, so Fox is made too innocent simply by being so isolated, and the ending a bit forced. It'd be much more impactful if reality were portrayed. I don't want to give a history lesson, but only one incident, the infamous My Lai, brought a trial (basically a village was savaged and massacred). And when the American public learned about it, they were furious - at the sight of our boys on trial. So despite the military looking likely to mete out punishments, Nixon applied pressure and everyone was let go. If this film took on that reality, it'd be a more hard-hitting film."

","Director Brian De Palma once again walks the thin line. He creates a war drama that gets darker as it sinks into depravity. During the war in Vietnam; a squad of five men kidnap a young girl from her village, rape and kill her. One of the men, played by Michael J. Fox, does not take part, thus bucking his fearless squad leader, played by Sean Penn.<br/><br/>This will leave you frustrated, disappointed and ashamed that this sort of thing was considered by some as just another part of war. Fox seems like a fish out of water; but he conveys all that is right in this film.

","Michael J Fox proves his versatility in ""casualties of war"". Before this, I had only seen him in back to the future, so I was amazingly surprised at how manly he was in this. Even his height didn't let him down! He was such a man! I have to admit though Sean Penn was sexier but Michael J fox topped him because of his personality. Even though justice was served in the end, this is a depressing film. By the end of it I did feel sad. Even MJF's bubbly personality didn't cheer me up. It is quite thought provoking though, when you lose hope in thinking there are no decent men in the world anymore, this film proves you wrong. There are a lot of evil guys but there are also nice guys too."

","I confess: I didn't watch this one too closely.  In my defense, it was tough.<br/><br/>I couldn't get over Michael J. Fox's presence in this movie.  Where was Doc Brown and the flux capacitor?  Where were the rest of the Keaton clan?<br/><br/>Sean Penn could have saved me, but Penn has been in every Vietnam film ever made, or at least so it seems, and usually playing the same character, so the unique reality of this movie began to blur into all the other Vietnam pics in the genre.<br/><br/>So you've got the surrealism of Fox as the lead and the mimeographed quality of Penn's calloused soldier redux.<br/><br/>But I'm not too jaded to ignore the fact that the film packs some power. It doesn't hold a candle to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, but if this is your first in the war-is-literally-and-viscerally-hell genre, be prepared to be stunned.<br/><br/>That said, the flashback device may have never been so clunkily misused. Fox, after the war, sees a young Asian woman on a bus.  She resembles someone...fade to the jungles.  We never revisit that bus until moments before the credits roll-but in just enough time for a heavy-handed sage-wisdom summary just to make sure Fox can get on with his life.  Ah, if only the real veterans of that war could have been healed as easily.<br/><br/>One scene in particular both rankles and amuses.  Fox, appalled by war atrocities, approaches his decent buddy and launches into what feels like a five-minute monologue on existentialist ethics: we are but brief candles, so we must bear our unbearable freedom honorably...live every day as if it were your last.  This scene was unwittingly spoofed in another Fox film, The Hard Way, when Fox's actor character steals overwrought lines from James Woods and delivers them with all the finesse of a Mack truck.<br/><br/>DePalma, SchmePalma: Marty McFly should never have time-traveled to the Vietnam War."
"Ianmcane","6","4","10","13 February 2008"," Important moral dilemma
","Brian De Palma's Casualties of War is one-part Vietnam commentary, one-part moral dilemma. The film manages to illustrate the horrors of war with some visceral visual effects, and the same time also pose the crucial question; how would you react in the situation in which Eriksson finds himself? The setting largely plays second fiddle to the moral question posed - this is not a film about the politics of the Vietnam War - and it is around this that much of the film is centred. The isolated environment of a long-distance mission in a small squad raises, and accentuates, the issues of peer pressure and moral-abandonment perfectly. This is undoubtedly the film's strongest point and greatest message.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, i found some of the performances and dialogue a little disappointing. The character of Sgt. Tony Meserve, played by Sean Penn, was particularly bemusing. Clearly intending to portray a kind of brilliant but sociopathic soldier, he came across more handicapped half-wit and it truly stretched my limits of believability to convince me that this man was put in charge of an infantry unit. A very disjointed performance by Penn indeed. Michael J Fox's character Eriksson, suffered a little from the sometimes overly-sentimental script which at times seemed thoroughly incongruous with the sobering environment and moody score. It's harsh to typecast Fox, but his virtues-of-steel persona didn't come off too well for me and i couldn't help but see his usual, jovial self lurking just beneath the facade.<br/><br/>A heavy, but watchable war movie, handled with skill by De Palma but with a flawed screenplay and some lacklustre performances.<br/><br/>6/10."
"Bogey Man","10","3","7","11 July 2002"," Brian De Palma's masterpiece
","Casualties of War is very powerful and thought provoking film from very talented film maker, Brian De Palma, the man who has made Scarface (1983), The Untouchables and Carrie among many others. Casualties of War is based on a book that is based on real events in Vietnam war. The names of the characters were replaced for this film, but that doesn't change the fact this is a depiction of what happened in real life. Michael J. Fox plays private Eriksson, one member in five men's league to go to a mission during Vietnam war and find some enemies and destroy their hiding-places etc. Their patrol is led by sergeant Meserve (Sean Penn) who after losing his friend in battle, begins to feel very severe hate towards all the Vietnamese and decides to kidnap a girl during their patrol in order to rape and abuse her with the other men during their journey. Eriksson cannot accept this and what follows is no less challenging and powerful than what happens in Oliver Stone's masterpiece Platoon.<br/><br/>Casualties of War is a depiction of morality in general and individual's morality and values. The film is set in war, but all this could have happened anywhere else, and now that this happens in war, it tells about the war itself at the same time. Meserve and his friends (Eriksson excluded, of course) are the incarnations of evil, something so wicked and rotten that has rarely been depicted this powerfully in ""mainstream"" cinema. His character is equally evil but not as symbolic as Tom Berenger's character in Stone's Platoon. Casualties of War is very disturbing exactly due to its characters' wickedness and how they treat that innocent Vietnamese girl they kidnap. The film becomes almost unbearably intense at one point and I felt genuine feelings of sorrow, anxiety and oppression as it seemed that any attempt to commit something good and justice for that girl fail. The ending of this film is incredibly purifying and relieving, but never too traditional or cliche. An ending this powerful was also in Takeshi Kitano's latest, Brother, which I viewed recently. Casualties of War really makes to think what's right and wrong and things definitely are not just that simple. The scene when Eriksson hits Clark to head with a shovel, is one of the most challenging acts of violence I've ever seen in any film. How can it be accepted? The evil is so strong at that point, it seems that by answering to evil with evil, one may be able to fight it that way. Then we must remember what Nietzsche said that by chasing monster, we must beware not becoming monster ourselves.<br/><br/>The narration is totally stunning and the last 15 minutes would not be as intensely powerful without the talent of De Palma and his ability to tell his stories this personally. The viewer definitely doesn't have a clue how this film ends since all seem to be just evil and there absolutely aren't any signs of justice happening. By telling how this film ends and what happens to its main characters, the viewing would be spoilt badly and I hope anyone who's reading this hasn't read any spoiling ""reviews"" on this film. The conclusion of the film seems to be, that by staying ""good"" and believing in ones righteous principles and moral, justice happens finally, if not in our world, then there what's next when we leave this place. The ending can also be seen in the girl's point of view as she is now in peace and never has to face the kind of horror and evil she met in man's world. The ending is especially rewarding for those, who kept believing in good throughout the film and never gave power to evil thoughts and wrong tools of finding justice. <br/><br/>The strongest element in this film is the screenplay as the characters are so personal and real and, fortunately, not shallow. They are real to life and represent all the traits we all have, active or un-active. Eriksson's character is as powerful as Charlie Sheen's in Platoon and the incarnations of evil are also equally shocking and gripping. Equally brilliant element in this film is Ennio Morricone's extraordinarily beautiful and sensitive music that really gave the scenes an incredible punch and made the whole film as powerful as possible. The music is perhaps close to Once Upon a Time in America's sensitive and sad score, but Casualties' score lacks all the positive and major segments found in America's score. Morricone's music in Casualties is perhaps his saddest score and that is really saying a lot when considered the incredible talent of Ennio Morricone's.<br/><br/>This film is among the few that made me cry. I remember having very strong feelings when watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream and Spielberg's Schindler's List (for the first time), and also after and during Casualties of War, I almost and cried since the power of this unique film is so incredible. Michael J. Fox' acting ability is one reason for the effectiveness since he puts his soul into the role and really acts naturally and feels naturally. It would've been horrible, if this film was ruined by bad acting or, even worse, by shallow and bad screenplay. Sean Penn and his friend corporal Clark are also so bad and repellently wicked, it is even worse to notice that their superiors seem to have same kind of thoughts about life and, in this case, about the girl's case. All these things give the feeling that no one cares and all the attempts Erikkson does are in vain. But fortunately that is not the case when this film approaches its end.<br/><br/>Casualties of War is challenging, very disturbing, emotional, rewarding and purifying piece of art, and really De Palma's greatest film, in my opinion. This is important and remarkable film and his gangster films and horror masterpiece Carrie are left behind this stunning work, despite Carrie and gangster films of De Palma's are also great in their own way. Rarely have I seen a movie this powerful and thought provoking, and since there are not so many, they which are, become even more important and remarkable and Casualties of War is definitely among those films. 10/10"
"baumer","8","2","4","23 August 1999"," Brian DePalma's best
","May contain small spoilers:<br/><br/>Someone once wrote, ""War is hell.""  And that is true.  When a war is finished one side is declared winner and the other one has to pay war reparations.  But really, there is never a winner in war.  Life is lost, land is destroyed and crimes are committed.  And I think that is the real issue in this film.  If a crime is committed in the battle field, does one deserve to get punished for it?  I have never been to war and I thank God for that, but I still think my opinion is a valid one.  No one deserves to be brutalized ( I understand death on the battlefield is acceptable) or violated during war.  That means anyone from a POW to an innocent civilian. Watching this film made me look at us as human beings and ask the question that I have asked so many times.  What's wrong with us?  What is it that makes people behave the way we do towards each other or towards other living things?  It is a question that I think is impossible to get an answer for. Watching this film is hard because it takes a dark and evil subject and puts it right before our eyes.  Reading about it would be bad enough, but to see it right before our eyes on 35 mm film is raw.  And it is an experience that I will never forget.<br/><br/>What is bad about this film is the opening ten minutes and the final five. That is when we see Erickson in the present.  It is a completely different film and these scenes have no business in the film itself.  But if you discard fifteen minutes of film, what you are left with is one of the grittiest, most realistic and frustrating films to watch.  What we see is six soldiers that are in the battle field.  They kidnap a village girl because they are angry and frustrated with the war.  She has nothing to do with it and the only crime she has committed is that she is a Vietnemese girl.  Two of the soldiers are adament about the kidnapping and only one of them is dead set against it and actually shows remorse and resistance. The leader is Meserve, played with ferociousness by Sean Penn.  I believed his portrayal so much that I really have a hard time watching him as the fun loving Spicolli in Fasttimes now.  He plays Meserve with anger, bitterness and spite.  He is angry, at what?  Who knows.  The war, the situation, the surroundings.  Probably all of that.  But his anger goes much deeper than that.  I think he is just angry for being born and he is taking it out on the world, and this one unfortunate village girl happens to be his scratching post.<br/><br/>The rape scenes are especially hard to watch.  They are on par with any of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left, and her death is just as disturbing as the ones in LHOTL and 8mm.  Her death was meaningless and it could have been avoided.  And when she died, I felt terrible.  I felt ashamed that as a member of the human species one of my own kind could do this to another human.<br/><br/>To make this film work you have to have good performances.  Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox are great.  As I said Penn is so realistic that he bothers me now.  Fox has a tricky role because you not only have to empathize with his character but he has to go through a wide array of emotions.  Penn is just angry, Fox is all over the map.  And he does an incredible job.  Also good in her role is the girl who played the Vietnemese girl.  DePalma let her write all her own dialogue and it is appropriate that she is not subtitled. None of her attackers would know what she is saying, so why should we? Besides, someone getting raped is a hard enough scene to watch in any launguage.<br/><br/>It's really too bad that the first and last parts of the film weren't handled better because this could have been one of the best films ever made. I still do hold it high on my list as one of the best war films ever made though.  But I have to warn you, Saving Private Ryan is tough to watch because of its gritty realism on the battlefield.  This one is just as hard to watch because we can put a face to the person that is getting violated. This should be a film that everyone sees once.  Not so much because it is about war but because it is about how human beings are really a sick species, this film and incidents like it prove that.  And that is sad."
"dee.reid","10","2","4","8 May 2002"," How could this happen?
","The Vietnam War is something that I think we are all trying to forget. Young men, who weren't even over the age of twenty-one, were exposed to unspeakable horrors.  Thousands of young men died, hundreds of others were physically and emotionally scarred for the rest of their lives.  What makes this fact even more relevant today are all of the war movies that Hollywood has been producing recently.  These movies include ""Born on the Fourth of July (1989)"", ""Hamburger Hill (1987)"", and the much recent ""We Were Soldiers (2002)"".  All three of these movies are based on true Vietnam survivor stories.  ""Born on the Fourth of July"", the first of these films I'll talk about, starred Tom Cruise.  The story was about Ron Kovic, an all-American teenager who went to Nam, with high hopes of being able to serve his country proud.  Not even a year into his first tour of duty, Ron was wounded and was paralyzed from the chest down.  He returned home and endured a very unpleasant stay in a veteran's hospital.  He comes home only to discover that he may not be very welcome because of fighting overseas.  Despite all that, he would soon go on to become an anti-war activist.  Even though he lost the ability to ever be able to walk again, he had not lost his will to live a good life.  ""Hamburger Hill"" was about a platoon of soldiers who were trying to climb a hill that once conquered would be a crucial strategic point in the war.  These brave men endured enemy fire, as well as friendly fire, pouring rain, an ever-growing sense of dread, and unbelievable loss of manpower.  Still, aside from all of these elements of tragedy, they were eventually able overcome that hill.  ""We Were Soldiers"", the most recent of these films, which starred Mel Gibson, was about a group of soldiers, primarily young fathers, brothers and sons, who were able to fight bravely despite being surrounded by enemy forces.  Even with all of these excellent war films, we've forgotten something.  All of these films glorify soldiers overcoming powerful odds and tragedies and they've all been portrayed in a positive manner.  So what happens when our American soldiers become something that we could never imagine?  Keeping this question in mind, this brings me to Brian De Palma's forgotten war drama, ""Casualties of War"".<br/><br/>The main story of ""Casualties of War"" is that it is a morality tale.  A platoon of five soldiers goes into a Vietnamese village on a reconnaissance mission and kidnaps a young girl.  They then proceed to rape her.  One of the men refused to go along with the others.  After the rape, the young soldier tells the girl that he's going to try to get her out of there.  The other soldiers while trying to escape catch him.  Then the platoon, with the girl still in tow, proceeds on their way.  They then encounter enemy fire. In the fray, the young soldier sees his chance to try to get the girl out of there.  The platoon sergeant sees the girl trying to escape and then orders the other men to shoot her.  They do so and the girl falls to her death. After the incident, the platoon returns to base camp.  The young soldier who refused to go along with the others then reports to his lieutenant about the incident.  He's informed that something like this could severely damage the United States military and it's position in the war.  The other four soldiers are tried in a military court and are sentenced to lengthy prison terms for the crime.  The incident was never mentioned by anyone after that. It was not until a newspaper article, which a book then followed had been published about the incident that it would ever be brought to public attention.  <br/><br/>This is Brian De Palma's best movie behind ""The Untouchables"".  I'm surprised that this movie hasn't gained the attention that it so righteously deserves in the long period of time that it's been on video.  Brian De Palma doesn't shy the camera away when it comes down to the rape scene.  We see the young girl screaming and we also see all of the men's reactions to the horrors at large.  I actually had to turn my head during the rape scene. ""Hamburger Hill"" is another forgotten war movie that hasn't gotten much attention either.  The reason that movie is so good is that it shows men at their greatest when things are at their worst.  <br/><br/>Michael J. Fox, who plays the new recruit, Eriksson, is excellent.  It was nice to him a really good serious role for once.  I think that performances like the one Fox gives in this movie are rare.  Sean Penn, who plays Meserve, is a monster in this film.  We see a war-torn veteran, who is only trying to survive his last few weeks in Vietnam.  When a friend is killed in an ambush, this causes Meserve's already stemming hatred for the Vietnamese to go even further.  It is now that we see Penn go into overdrive.  He is so intimidating, that as one viewer already claimed, that it's easy to see how a weak person could easily come under his control.  The supporting performances I think are some of the best.  Don Harvey and John C. Reilly both give great performances as the two soldiers who basically follow Meserve's every command.  John Leguizamo, who plays Diaz, the newest soldier to the platoon, is great in an early performance.  You see, when Meserve first says that he and the rest of the men are going to rape the young Vietnamese girl, Diaz decides that he won't participate.  Diaz says that he will back up Eriksson when it comes down to it.  Eriksson agrees that he will back up Diaz as well.  When it's Eriksson's turn to rape the girl, he looks at Diaz to back him up.  Meserve, Clark, and Hatcher then begin calling Eriksson names like ""fag"" and ""queer"" when he refuses.  Diaz, seeing the kind of ridicule that Eriksson just went through chickens out and goes into the hut with the girl.       <br/><br/>It seems to me though, that Diaz is the only soldier out of the four that anyone can ever really have any sympathy towards.  I mean you have to feel sorry for him especially even though it wasn't really his fault for going along with the others in the rape.  If you think about it very carefully, you'll realize that he was FORCED into the rape.  This is a very debatable topic here because obviously Diaz is a person with morals, something the other three soldiers lacked.  Of course, one could easily blame him for not using common sense for going along with the soldiers, but what you have to understand is that it was peer pressure that made him do it.  All that happened was that he simply cracked under pressure.  Another thing that you have to remember is that this is set during a very stressful time and it's easy for anyone, even a person with good morals, to commit an unthinkable act.  Why do you think good people go badly all of a sudden?<br/><br/>
I agree with one previous viewer that the Vietnam War truly brought out the worst in our American soldiers.  I've heard horrible stories about some people who claimed that the only reason that they enlisted into the United States army during that time was so that they could kill Vietnamese people. I know of one person who says that if he were of legal age, he would sign up to go into Afghanistan, just to kill some ""f*****g Arabs"".  It is exactly this kind of attitude that leads to atrocities like the one depicted in the film.  How many things like this really happened during the Vietnam War more so, the war in Afghanistan?  If so, how long will it be before they're brought to public attention?  I mean it took, what how long for the incident in ""Casualties of War"" to be brought to public attention, two years?  Two years may not seem like much, but think about the family of that innocent girl who was wrongfully taken away from her home and was forced to service four out of five soldiers.  How those four men raped that young girl and then killed her and not have any regrets whatsoever is beyond anyone.<br/><br/>
I think myself and everybody else, who has studied the causes of the Vietnam War, knows that the whole thing was a big mistake.  As stated above, young men were exposed to horrible conditions and were fighting a war that they are not even sure should have been fought.  I've heard that some soldiers did not even know why they were fighting.  <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I really love this movie, but it's obvious that some people will hate it.  I think that before someone says, ""this movie sucks!"" that it would be best to keep some of these things in mind.  Things like morality and the differences between right and wrong are all topics that need to be kept in mind when viewing this film."

","When a friend told about this film, I was a bit leery. I mean, Marty McFly in Vietnam? But this was an outstanding performance By Michael J. Fox as well as Sean Penn. The film is based on a true story of soldiers that go out on patrol. While on their way, they kidnap, rape and murder a Vietnamese girl. This is a very intense movie that was filmed in Thailand by Brian DePalma. The girl,Thuy Thu Le, is a Vietnamese actress that was cast by DePalma for realism. She puts in a great performance as well. Other faces that you will recognize are John C. Reilly and John Leguizamo. As I said, this movie is very intense and very hard to watch at times. There is a gang rape scene that is especially difficult. But all-in-all, one heck of a good watch."
"valhala-38849","10","0","0","29 April 2020"," I will not watch this movie again
","I have watched it three times already, and each time I couldn't sleep for a week.<br/><br/>I'll bypass the usual stuff about the film, you can read it in other reviews,aside from mentioning that Casualties of War is based on a true historical event (which is even more disgusting than the film)<br/><br/>Now, the performance of Thuy Thu Le is one of the best i have ever seen. I cannot imagine from where did she get the inspiration to express such anguish, terror and torment so vividly. In my opinion, the role of Oanh, aside from real life facts, was tailored to provoke a powerful reaction, and several moments in the film intensify it further - such as the scarf (as in the one that her mother gave her, to keep her warm, before she was raped, stabbed, and shot), a broom (which she grasps when there's nothing else to hold on to), etc. This, supported by Morricone's masterful score makes supremely powerful scenes. Oanh's face will remain seared in my mind forever, without a shadow of a doubt.<br/><br/>As for the role of Michael J Fox ( Eriksson ) i believe that there is a subtle aspect of it - Through it, the viewers themselves feel powerlessness. Any normal human being (as a first-time viewer) would hope/expect for the girl to survive, and that sense of impotence is,i think, what De Palma was aiming at. That look of hope on Oanh's face would compel any man to do everything in his power to save her - yet you cannot do anything.<br/><br/>About Penn's role - I hated him, as a fictional character that he portrayed, of course. Again, De Palma subtly hides Meserve's motivation -He is justifying his actions with the hatred towards the enemy. If a person looks at it rationally, and what De Palma portrays, here's what you get - Meserve is furious that his friend/friends are killed by the defenders of a sovereign country, that are defending their territory and people from a foreign aggressor. And what does he do? He shifts that hatred toward an innocent civilian girl that (by implications) never even saw a rifle, let alone used it to defend her country. The fact that he repeatedly justifies himself is plainly disgusting. With this De Palma expresses that - there are no heroes in a war. One side's hero is another side's butcher, abomination.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Yes, it is a masterpiece.
Would I watch it again? No way
Would i recommend it? No, it will carve the sense of deepest sorrow that you will never forget."

","I have watched ""Casualties of War"" four, maybe five times since it was initially released back in 1989. First on VHS, then moved on to DVD later on.<br/><br/>While movies about the Vietnam War are a dime a dozen, then ""Casualties of War"" actually managed to stand out, because it was not just another movie following a platoon of young Americans finding themselves deep in the jungles of Vietnam fighting a war for which they had little love, conquering all aside from insurmountable odds. Director Brian De Palma managed to make ""Casualties of War"" stand out by adding a very realistic level of human behavior to the characters in the movie, and also by making it a story that sinks right in and will probably have you in tears along the way.<br/><br/>Aside from having a really well constructed storyline and plot, and one that hits home hard and sticks with you long after the movie has ended, then ""Casualties of War"" really have an amazing list of casted performers, almost rivaling ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>The movie is so amazingly carried by the performance of Michael J. Fox, and he really surprised with his dramatic performance in this movie and he really shined through with his amazing acting talent in ""Casualties of War"". I am by no means a fan of Sean Penn, but he was good in this movie, and it was really hard not to take an aversion to the character he portrayed. Aside from Fox and Penn, the movie also have some nice appearances by John Leguizamo, Ving Rhames and John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>The movie is driven by an amazingly well-told narrative and it is a story that really sinks in. And I can guarantee that you will be in tears from this movie, because it really it a story that sinks into the heart and sticks with you. But also the characters in the movie are well-detailed and fleshed out, helping to further the flow of the movie quite nicely.<br/><br/>""Casualties of War"" is actually the type of movie that you can watch more than just a single time. Sure, you have to let a long time pass in between each viewing, but the contents are there to sustain multiple viewings. ""Casualties of War"" is definitely one of my all-time favorite war movies."

","Casualties Of War is no doubt in some way influenced by Platoon, but does not come across as well or as powerful as the aforementioned Oliver Stone classic. With that being said, I still think Brian De Palma's Casualties Of War is very good and like Platoon, it shows opposing sides of morality when it concerned with the horrors of The Vietnam War. This is a chance for Michael J Fox to show he has some serious acting chops and in this role, he did very well. Michael J Fox plays a soldier(Eriksson) that is on a five man unit(led by Sgt. Meserve, who was played by Sean Penn). On their way to the jungle, they kidnap and gang rape a young girl from the village. Eriksson, objects to this immoral behavior and does not participate in the sick, cruel indulgences that the other 4 men seem to enjoy. He does not stop them and the girl ended up being killed. This haunts Eriksson and this leads to a trial where the 4 men are brought to justice. Casualties Of War is not so much a film about the war in Vietnam, but this horrific incident, which similar things happened and continue to happen in war. Sean Penn plays his role as good soldier gone bad from experiencing too much insane horrors from that war. He then embodies the sadism and vile cruelty he has witnessed on not only enemy soldiers, but civilians as well. It was a very powerful performance and Michael J Fox does a good job opposite him.Overall, Casualties Of War is a very good film that shows the horror of war."

"atrollie","Null","0","0","20 February 2003"," America at its worst
","Contains Spoiler! I would just like to say first off that this is one of the best movies based on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen.  When I first saw this movie, It deeply shocked me.  I think what interested me the most about this movie is that it was based on a true atrocity that took place during the Vietnam War instead of a fictionalized story which took place in Platoon.  In Casualties of War, the story follows Eriksson, played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox, a new and inexperienced recruit just arrived in Vietnam who is confronted with a horrifying situation when his sergeant and the other men in his unit kidnap a young girl from a village and rape her and then murder her. Fox's character is then confronted with the agonizing choice of either doing the right thing and telling the authorities and being called a traitor or doing nothing.  And when he does tell his superiors, he is told to forget about what happened and let it slide because this event will cause a major international incident and jeapordize the war effort.  Fox does a great job of playing Eriksson, the young soldier who is haunted by this one event. Sean Penn also a brilliant job of playing the sadistic and psychotic Sergeant Tony Meserve!  Penn's character starts out normal enough, but as the story unfolds, he transforms into a total and complete psycho!  And by the end of the film, you truly HATE his character and wish that he dies! What makes this crime even more horrifying is the way that Meserve justifies it.  Because he was stopped by the M.P.'s from visiting the prostitutes in town and that in his mind, she's just a gook. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job: Don Harvey, John C. Reily, John Leguizamo, Ving Rhames, etc.  Don Harvey does an especially great job as Corporal Thomas Clark.  He gives off a cold and remorseless stare that just chills you to the bone.  And the things he says and the way that he acts towards the Vietnames people in the movie shows that he has utterly no sympathy and remorse as to how he treats these people.  Total hardcore RACIST!!! I bet his parents probably dropped him on his head one too many times as a child!  His is another character that you absolutely loathe in the movie. You just want to to go up to him and rip his spine out!!!<br/><br/>DePalma does a great job of filming the scenery in the film.  It shows the natural and ancient beauty as well as the devastation and destruction that the war has brought.  The film's soundtrack is also very good.  It is very haunting and tragic and stays with you even after you're done.  The rape scenes are also very brutal and will leave you shocked and disgusted.  In the end, I think that this film is a story of morality.  It shows that we have to put bounds on our behavior or we run the risk of committing unspeakable acts.  The film also does a great job of showing how easy atrocities like this occurred because the Vietnamese were dehumanized, soldiers were taught to obey orders, and how ordinary and normal these acts became.  One dialogue that helps to show this is between Eriksson's capatain and Eriksson: You just could't rest, could ya?  You had to push it.  Go to hell.  SIR!!!  One of the best lines in the movie in my opinion.  I don't think that many Americans like this film because it shows Americans in a negative light, and I think that's why it didn't get as much publicity as it did.  I think that this movie does a great job of showing that that the U.S. has a tough time admitting when we are and apologizing.  The movie shows that we are indeed a VERY arrogant nation, and we like to think that we are always right.  The atrocity that occurs in this movie also draws some similarity with the massacre at My Lai.  As with the defendants in this film, the soldiers were hardly punished.  And it took a while for the story to come out.  I also think that the movie is about redemption.  In the beginning, we see Eriksson still haunted by this event, and when he sees a girl on the train who looks just like the dead girl and tries to return her scarf.  It is clear that he is trying and hoping for redemption and forgiveness for what is done.  And after his conversation with her, the film shows that some of his guilt over this event has passed.  All in all, I give it *****!"

","I recently saw this film at my college which had a discussion session about the film afterwords. Starring Micheal J.

Taking place during the Vietnam War, it's the story of a group of soldiers whom kidnap, and 4 out of 5 of them rape a Vietnamese woman. Fox plays the one soldier who refuses to rape the woman. In fact, he eventually turns his fellow soldiers in for the rape and murder of an innocent Vietnamese woman. Steller performances from the entire cast make this motion picture a fine one. Great direction from Brian De Palma also helps to elevate this film. I was very impressed with it's dialogue and good acting. Other stars of note in this film are John Leguizamo, John C.

","Brian De Palma's only venture into war movies is a powerful, if somewhat melodramatic story about a squad in Vietnam who kidnaps a Vietnamese villager and rapes her.  Michael J. Fox sometimes is a little too much as the clean cut guy fighting against the system, but it still works.  Penn delivers a stellar performance as the squad leader he's fighting against. Some beautiful cinematography, with De Palma's usually flashy camerawork. The ending feels a little weak compared to the rest of the story, but all in all this is one of the most haunting films about the Vietnam War - made all the more effective by the fact that it is a true story."

","It's a strong story, all right, but I wish somebody else had directed it. With Brian De Palma, director of such virtuoso films as ""The Fury"", ""Dressed To Kill"" and ""The Untouchables"", you're inevitably looking for any detectable traces of his style in any movie he makes, and here you can find very few (a sequence with a grenade used in a murder attempt is an obvious example). His discreet use of the camera during the rape scene, however, is commendable. As for the performances, something seems to be missing from Sean Penn's acting, but Fox is unexpectedly good and the Vietnamese girl is so good that at times you forget it's only a movie.

","When does immorality cross the lines in a war? Naturally, civility and normality fly out the window....after all, war is about killing people. But are there rules to it? Ideals we should follow as we engage upon the enemy? This film answers that question, and the answer is yes.<br/><br/>I have a large interest in the Vietnam War, primarily because it is considered by many to be America's darkest hour. Watching a film like this forces me to agree. The story is about a platoon of five men, and how their ""fearless"" leader (an excellent Sean Penn) kidnapps a Vietmanese girl and taunts his men to beat her and rape her. Only one man stands in the way, who knows that what they are doing is wrong (Michael J. Fox, in probably his greatest role). The kidnapping eventually leads to the murder of the girl, and Fox is determined to bring the men to justice, even though Penn argues that ""what happens on the field stays on the field.""<br/><br/>This is director Brian De Palma's finest hour. Rarely has the Vietnam War been presented as so haunting, showing the effects war has one people.... The U.S. were arguably the good guys in the war, but even the greatest of men have their breaking points. And few films show those breaking points as well as this one. Indeed, this is one of the finest films to come out to ever represent Vietnam for what it was: controversial, tragic....and disturbing.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

It's the way director Brian De Palma shoots some of the action. At least twice, he uses the background to show action while in the foreground a character looks forward. It's a very manufactured look and takes away from the realism that this movie desperately needs. MJF does the ethical naive jittery newbie but something about him strikes me unrealistic. He's not up to the drama. It's not gritty enough. I feel it would be more intense if he kept more quiet. The character needs to have some more internal conflict.

This piece of absolute trash really says a lot for the many brave American soldiers (men and women) who faithfully served our country throughout the Viet Nam war. The story centers on the rape and eventual murder of an innocent Vietnamese child by 4 American soldiers who were refused leave. Who in their right mind would want to make a movie like this? The performances are just awful and totally unrealistic. Sean Penn is his usual unconvincingly terrible and casting Michael J Foxx in a war film is about as convincing as casting Stan Laurel in the lead role of Rocky ! I just fail to see how portraying American GIs as low-life rapists and murderers serves as quality entertainment. Very unconvincing acting, an awful plot, and totally off-center directing make this film the very bottom of the heap for me. One I would never recommend nor want to see again. Very disturbing junk.

Thank God he curses and smokes during it.<br/><br/>His emotional ""NOOOO!!!"" is definitely more suited to comedies like Back To The Future than so-called serious movies such as this.<br/><br/>To their credit, some of the ""main"" scenes...

","Just yesterday morning, AMC (that's American Movie Classics) ran an infomercial offering ""more sex, less stress."" That was followed by two Three Stooges shorts, then a heavily redacted version of CASUALTIES OF WAR. I'd seen the movie way back when, but I'd dismissed it as just another of Brian DePalmer's overblown would-be epics (like the vastly overrated SCARFACE, which features Al Pacino's worst-ever over-the-top performance). Because I'm not a video gamer, I have no idea if the first-person shooter games, set in a variety of war zones, feature any of the more True-to-Life perks that actual War provides- perks like Rape and Indiscriminate Murder. Certainly any video game set during The Vietnam War would have to feature such bonuses. As Nick Turse points out in his exhaustive study of The American War, KILL ANYTHING THAT MOVES, ""atrocities were committed by members of EVERY infantry, cavalry and airborne division... That is, every major army unit in Vietnam."" ""Soldiers realized that small groups of civilians could be killed with impunity and logged as enemy war dead..."" One medical officer listed a civilian's cause of death as ""running from U.$. forces."" And it was none other than Douglas MacArthur who set the tone for the war by telling General William Westmoreland: ""You might have to employ a scorched earth policy in Vietnam."" The U.$. released 30 BILLION pounds of munitions in Vietnam (and by the early 70s, there were 20 million bomb craters) and 70 Million liters of herbal agents- most notably Agent orange (which Turse refers to rightly as ""ECOCIDE""). This was the equivalent of 640 Hiroshima bombs... ""Detained civilians and captured guerrillas were often used as human mine detectors and regularly died in the process."" The Biggest crime of all, called Operation Speedy Express, was, according to concerned soldier George Lewis, ""... a My Lai each month for over a year."" The International Commission of Enquiry Into U.$. Crimes in Indochina concluded: ""... The main burden of responsibility must lie with those who have been making this policy."" Said Kissinger: ""Once we've broken the war in Vietnam, no one will give a damn about war crimes."" As Huynh Thi Nay (whose son was murdered) said when she spoke about it: ""It became dark as night.""

","This time around, here's a Vietnam pic of a different sort. Shockingly based on a real incident, revenge hungry soldier (Penn) and his squad kidnap a young female villager, and subject her to a brutal rape, then a shocking execution, that pangs a memory when I think about it visually. In my opinion all voluntary participants, should of faced a firing squad. The only one truly against is Fox, miscast as a nicey nicey soldier, we can see why he was chosen. This rape part of the film is very hard to watch, and will easily offend some, more so if have being raped in real life. It's up to Fox, who unthankfully was rescued by Penn, much earlier, when caught in a pickle, to make things right, and he does, going up against his squad, reporting the crime. Even though Penn does overact some, he's character great here, as Seargeant Meserve, a man of frightening intensity and remorselessness, as if he's lost complete touch with humanity, much like a machine, while too, we have John C Reilly and John Leguizamo, before they were known, playing two reluctant GI'S, forced participants in the rape. Even though Fox, does get on your goat a bit, you do admire his mettle and defiance, when doing the right thing, and getting none too thanks for it, brazenly telling his uncompassionate corporal (Dale Dye, from platoon) to go to hell. The same goes for another corporal type (Ving Rhames) delivering a monologue, concerning an incident from the old days, this matter of plain cold murder, just something to brush under the carpet, was something I must say, I found truly angering. The violence is quite rough too, like one vet, a backward sort, hitting a booby trap. Fox's slightly drunken confession I found quite moving though. Of course, the catalyst, for Penn's vent of revenge, culminating in that innocent, unwarranted killing, was his close squad mate, buying it early in the flick. The music is soothingly beautiful, I must say. I really didn't think, Casualties Of War had a plot, as I just wrote it off, as a just another Vietnam, no plot flick, but this is a film that should be seen, life from the other side of Vietnam, a despicable and unforgivable act, where really with the exception of Fox, and those two others mentioned who got appropriate sentences, Penn, and his inhuman psycho, hate filled mate, who I found detestable (the Stephen Baldwin lookalike guy) should of just of fried. What was odd, which didn't make Fox convincing was at the start and the end (the same scene, a nice touch) while having bad recollections on the bus, of those days gone by, it's hard to believe he looked like something who'd been in Vietnam. But for most part as a Vietnam Vet, Fox is embarrassingly unconvincing. Otherwise this Vietmam pic, is a recommended view."

","Casualties of War is a film set in the Vietnam War. As such, I was afraid it would be redundant to watch after recently watching both ""Platoon"" and ""Hamburger Hill"". In some ways, I was correct - the same themes are here about Americans terrorizing the Vietnamese and teamwork failing under pressure. But there is a difference. Back to that in a moment.<br/><br/>This film has Michael J. Fox as a college-educated soldier in a team full of heartless, hardened soldiers. Many scenes are similar to ""Platoon"", where Charlie Sheen entered the war with no experience in combat. Another parallel is with ""Full Metal Jacket"", even using the whole rifle/gun dichotomy... in reverse.<br/><br/>But where this film is different is that it does not show bits and pieces of mistreatment: it focuses on the mistreatment of one Vietnamese woman and carries it for over an hour. You never have time to escape the brutal reality of rape and torture that this film shows you. If the point was to humanize foreign peoples (in times of war or otherwise) it succeeded. This is not your ""family film""...<br/><br/>Sean Penn is also decent as the commanding officer, a psychotic madman. He is quite believable as a controlling sadist. However, I found Penn's acting to be a bit over the top sometimes and his non-stop mumbling was very annoying for me (is that how Penn talks, or is he obsessed with playing characters who don't know how to articulate?). All in all, this film was better than I expected and not just another war movie. Also, Michael J. Fox is really short. He must be like 5'2""... Recommended."

","""Casualties of War"" forms part of what may be called the cinema's Second Vietnam Cycle. The first came in the late Seventies, immediately after the war itself, with films such as ""The Deerhunter"", ""Coming Home"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". Hollywood then seemed to lose interest in the subject for a few years, but returned to it in the late eighties when there were a number of major Vietnam War films such as ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Hamburger Hill"" and Oliver Stone's trilogy. <br/><br/>The plot centres around five American soldiers who are out on patrol. Their leader, Sergeant Meserve, suggests that they kidnap and rape a young Vietnamese woman, and two of his men eagerly go along with the idea. The others, Privates Diaz and Eriksson, are appalled, and make a pact to oppose the plan. Under pressure from his comrades, however, Diaz gives in and agrees to participate, leaving Eriksson to look on helplessly as the other four men seize the terrified woman from her home and brutally rape her. She is forced by to accompany the men on their patrol, and is later shot and killed by them when her coughing threatens to give them away during an attempted ambush of a band of Viet Cong troops. <br/><br/>Meserve tries to justify his treatment of the girl by claiming that she is a Viet Cong spy, but there is no evidence that she is anything of the sort, and even he himself does not really believe it. The trigger for the incident is Meserve's anger at the death of a comrade in an ambush and at the fact that the Military Police have prevented him from visiting a prostitute, but the underlying reason is that he and his colleagues rape and kill the girl simply because they can, as an expression of the power that they, as armed men, possess over the unarmed villagers. They believe that they will not be punished, and Eriksson's later attempts to have them initially meet with little success, as the officers to whom he speaks are unwilling to take action. The military authorities would prefer to turn a blind eye to war crimes committed by those under their command, believing that to carry out investigations would hamper the conduct of the war and lead to unwelcome publicity. Meserve is regarded as a good soldier, the sort of man that his superiors would be unwilling to lose. He is efficient, brave (we are reminded that on one occasion he saved Eriksson's life) and clearly regarded as having powers of leadership, having been promoted to sergeant at only twenty years of age. A good soldier, however, is not necessarily a good man. <br/><br/>I was interested by the comment from the reviewer who said that this film could have taken place against any background, be it war, college campus or neighbourhood gang. This is partially true. Crimes such as rape can, of course, take place in peacetime as well as wartime, and another movie from the late eighties, ""The Accused"", took as its theme a gang rape committed by a group of young men in a bar. ""Casualties of War"", however, is both a film about male violence against women and also something wider than that. It is also a film about how war can lead to a breakdown in civilised values, with soldiers coming to feel that they are immune from the demands of both law and of morality. There is perhaps little about the film that is specific to Vietnam- events similar to those portrayed here have occurred in all wars throughout history- but the unpopularity of that war meant that the film-makers could deal with a subject- war crimes committed by American troops- that in other contexts could have been too controversial to handle. A Second World War film, for example, that showed Allied soldiers raping and murdering a German woman might have been condemned as, at best, unpatriotic and, at worst, pro-Nazi.<br/><br/>I had previously thought of Michael J Fox as a lightweight actor, at his best in comedies and TV sitcoms, so I was surprised to see him taking the lead here as Eriksson. His performance, however, was very good. I was perhaps less impressed by Sean Penn as Meserve, who seemed at times more like a schoolyard bully than a psychopathic war criminal. Penn did, however, have one very good scene where he persuades the other members of his patrol to take part in the kidnap. His superiors were obviously right to think that Meserve had powers of leadership; unfortunately, those powers were applied to perverted ends. <br/><br/>The main fault with the film is its structure. The central part of the film, which documents the actual rape and killing, is very powerful, a harrowing indictment of the brutalities of war. The opening part, however, is slow-moving, and the battle scenes are less convincing than those in, say, ""Platoon"". I do not agree with the suggestion that I have seen made that the film should have ended with the death of the girl. Given that the film was based on a true story, it was important to show the aftermath of the killings, especially as an important part of the story is the traumatic effect that the incident had on Eriksson, the one 'innocent' member of the patrol. One thing that Fox coveys well is that Eriksson's pursuit of justice is motivated as much by his own feelings of guilt at failing to prevent the woman's death as by moral indignation. The investigation and subsequent court-martial, however, are treated very perfunctorily, and we never really understand why the authorities overcome their initial reluctance to pursue the matter. The opening and closing scenes, which show Eriksson meeting a Vietnamese girl after the war (a prominent newspaper headline referring to Nixon's resignation tells us that the year is 1974), are weak and unnecessary. The result is a film with a weak beginning, strong middle and weak ending. 6/10"

","A really ugly and exploitive film about five American soldiers in Vietnam who kidnap a young girl from a village. Four of them, led by Sean Penn, repeatedly rape and abuse her until she is barely able to defend herself or even stand up. After she is finally killed, the fifth soldier (Michael J. Fox) tries to get the U.S. military to do something about the chilling events but his journey is far from being an easy one. The tale is shown in difficult flashbacks by director Brian De Palma as Thuy Thu Le plays dual roles (the abused girl and a young woman that Fox sees in the present-day). Not a total waste, but still a really under-achieving film that makes a case for one of the biggest mistakes of the 1980s. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS: Well, I suppose this film was meant to provide Michael J. Fox his dramatic acting bona fides. I guess it achieved that, he did pretty well. Sean Penn really chewed the scenery here to good effect. The problem with this film seems to be in the script. The beginning and ending sequences on the train detracted from the movie. Also Fox's character got a little too philosophical and pontificating. Good performance by Thuy Thu Le. The rape scene was painful to watch, as always. Murder is so commonplace in movies that it has become simply a plot device, having no shock value. Brutal rape scenes do carry that shock. I certainly hope that they do not become so common that they lose the power to shock. The theme is found in the title, and every character could be classified as a casualty of war. Most obviously the innocent Vietnamese girl, raped and murdered. Also Eriksson (Fox) will never be the same. And then Meserve (Penn) and the other squad members serving lengthy terms in a military prison, can be thought of as casualties, that their lives may not have been utterly ruined had they stayed civilians, or not been in combat. Particularly Diaz, (John Leguizamo) who didn't really want to be a moral zero, but went along under, I guess, peer pressure. Severe peer pressure, to be sure, but obviously nothing can justify rape and murder. A tough thing, war."

","In the same way that time had to move on in order that considered films on the Vietnam War could be made, so time sometimes needs to move on to provide a perspective on those films themselves.In the early 21st century America finds itself in another hopeless adventure abroad, in Iraq, with young men killing and being killed with no-one quite sure why.With the passage of time this story assumes a depth and resonance that wasn't possible at the time.<br/><br/>De Palma's strength is in how he portrays people, and this is a veritable tour de force in this respect.Sean Penn is about the finest actor of his generation, and his Sgt Meserve is superb.Brutal and loyal, yet cruel and amoral. Just what the Army needs in a battle, but not the sort of person that the Capitol Hill aesthetes would welcome for dinner.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox carries the part of the effete whistle blower well, his hair is always as nicely washed and clean as his morals, yet in the crucial court martial scene, it is hard to work up any enthusiasm for his actions.Cleverly, De Palma runs two parallel belief sets here. On the one hand, kidnapping, raping and murdering farm girls is not right. Equally when you train young men to kill, and risk their lives day on day, when they see their friends killed and mutilated, when all vestiges of their home life are stripped away in an alien jungle, nobody should be too surprised that some will get up to no good.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is the triumph of the film. The casualties are literally everywhere.I felt as much for the convicted soldiers as I did for their victim.The chaos of the battle scenes where all you have is your buddies is well played. The loyalty, bravery, Stoicism and heroism of the doomed patrol are shown as vividly as the amorality of their actions.<br/><br/>A worthy synthesis of excellent battle set pieces and cerebral soul searching."
"schenkenberg","8","1","2","21 June 2005"," An untraditional war film
","Before ""Casualties of War"", I had seen only two films about the War of Vietnam, ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". Although being quite different, the emotions of American soldiers are same. They can't see a point in a war thousand miles from their home. They want to leave as soon as possible. They don't know much about political problems in Vietnam and they don't care. Some of them are losing their morale. ""Casualties of War"" is more similar to ""Apocalypse Now"". The soldiers do things they wouldn't do at home, some of them go mad. Four men kidnap a Vietnamese girl, rape her and finally murder her. The only man in the team who is against it, is Eriksson. While he has been at war less time than the others, he is not listened to. His companions quickly begin to tease him, calling him gay, coward and traitor. Greatly shocked, Eriksson tries to alarm the senior officers but no-one seams to care. Such things happen often during wars. But Brian De Palma shows us how terrible this can be. The suffers of the girl and Eriksson, both helpless and scared, are really depressing to watch. If Eriksson hadn't shown unusual determination and courage, the case would have been forgotten shortly like the most of the war crimes. During the film, four normal young men become maniacs. It's notable that only the less experienced man understands what is right and what is wrong. Michael J. Fox is best known as Marty McFly from ""Back to the Future"". ""Casualties of War"" clearly requires more acting skills and Fox shows he has them. The scene where Eriksson attacks Capral Clark who tried to kill him proves well that he is not just a complainer who wants to earn the respect of senior officers. He really wants the criminals to be punished. At that point it is difficult to believe that a couple of years ago, the same actor escaped by a skateboard from the bad guys from the past in ""Back to the Future II""... The supporting roles are also interesting. Sergeant Meserve, played by Sean Penn seams to fit to the leader at the beginning but later turns out to be as cruel as the others. Capral Clark (Don Harvey)has a great sense of humour but finally he's the one who tortures the girl the most. Private Hatcher (John C. Reilly) and Private Diaz (John Leguizamo) just do as the other two without thinking if it's right. (Reilly's Hatcher is remarkably stupid, as many of his later characters later on.) Capral Brown (Erik King) who gets killed in an early phase liked me most and as Eriksson says, he probably would have stopped the crime. Ving Rhame's Reilly, sitting opposite to Eriksson, reminds me Marcellus Wallace talking to Bruce Willis' Buck in ""Pulp Fiction"". ""Casualties of War"" is a fine film. Although not as brilliant as Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", it is a realistic story about the dark side of the war."
"canadude","8","1","2","11 March 2005"," De Palma's Vietnam
","De Palma's ""Casualties of War"" is a pleasant surprise for two main reasons: 1) it almost entirely refuses to compromise the story it tells to appeal to plebeian morality and 2) it features one hell of a performance by Michael J. Fox.<br/><br/>""Casualties of War"" does its best not to cheat and when it succeeds, it does extremely well. I'm not a huge fan of De Palma movies save ""Scarface"" simply because of its almost cartoonish, spoof style, but this particular film is serious through and through. There are very few De Palma'isms, camera trickery, logical jumps in psychological development, etc. The film is restrained, well-structured and the way it sets up its primary conflict is much like the gait of creeping blackness across the sky before rain. In a word, the story is very believable, as it should be, since it is true.<br/><br/>It details the story of a platoon which, under surprise attack, loses one of its members. ""Casualties of War"" treats this as a set-up to its much darker intentions - namely the revenge that is exacted and the psychological dynamics that lead to it being carried out.<br/><br/>And, as much as I like Sean Penn as an actor, it was Michael J. Fox who stole the show in my opinion. I mean, this is an actor I know from ""Doc Hollywood"" and the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy and here he does drama. That can be fatal - I am of those who found Charlie Sheen's performance in ""Platoon"" somewhat jarring with the otherwise excellent cast. Michael J. Fox doesn't jar with anything - he takes us from somewhat incompetent, fresh soldier's innocence to dubious outsider, to straight-out protester, traitor, obstructor and hero (in the noble sense of the words). He shows range and sensitivity to the subject matter presented - and I think he does an admirable job.<br/><br/>The subject matter is tough. This film, like other great Vietnam War films, tackles a whole spectrum of themes, ideas, psychologies and questions. ""Casualties of War"" asks us about the existence of moral boundaries in entirely amoral (NOT immoral) situations, the dynamics of group mentality versus individual mentality, the complexity of politics and the bureaucratic structure that supports it, the threat of complete dehumanization and madness. It summarizes many of the lessons that should have been drawn from our involvement in the Vietnam War in scenes so quick and effective that one could get goosebumps. And it usually doesn't offer easy answers. The revenge committed by the soldiers in and of itself is horrid, but we can at the same time understand how hard it is for Michael J. Fox's character to isolate himself from the context of the war to make that judgement. Especially after losing one of his fellow soldiers in a shoot-out, in a village where all the seemingly friendly villagers were aware of VC presence and impending attack. Suddenly, it becomes clear how the a lot of soldiers viewed the Vietnamese - as one entity because it was so difficult to distinguish between allies and foes.<br/><br/>The film insists that despite the circumstances it *is* important to do so, to make moral judgement calls despite the insanity of the context. That is what I really liked about it. I did, however, find a few problems with the film - minor really, but problems nonetheless. I do think that De Palma characterizes the platoon minus Michael J. Fox as a bunch of animals, instead of people who became animals because, as Joseph Conrad suggested, they were seduced by the heart of an immense darkness. Essentially it boils down to a problem with psychological transitions, but De Palma does his best and while it sometimes doesn't work, most of the time it does splendidly.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoiler* I also think that the end of the film is a minor cheat - the resolution simply does not work for me as well as I'd like it to. There are so many people who were crippled by the horrors of the Vietnam War and so many who struggled to keep on top of them - the final scene is almost too little to end or resolve what comes before it. It feels like it didn't happen - but if it did, then I'm wrong and I'm prepared to live with that. The movie, while I don't think it's of ""Apocalypse Now"" caliber, is a very good movie nonetheless."

"AnneSLReid","Null","1","2","16 September 2003"," One of De Palma's best
","This is a highly stimulating film which challenges all the traditional notions of morality - when does a victim become a perpetrator?  How far can we excuse people's behaviour because of circumstance?  Ultimately, De Palma tries to show that during war, the line between baddies and goodies is not as clear cut as we would believe.<br/><br/>The theme is totally centred around Penn and Fox, the former being the ostensible ""baddie"" - a common, sadistic, murderer of an innocent Vietnamese girl, but who is the best soldier of his platoon and whose bravery at the beginning of the film saves Fox's life.  He is admired only in the field, outside of which he is a common, unsavoury nobody.  After losing his friend to the VietCong, Penn savagely rapes a girl, whose only crime was to be associated with the villagers who harboured the VietCong.  He then manipulates his henchmen to kill her - being too cowardly to do it himself. The line between grief and recklessness, understandable in wartime, and pure sadism becomes blurred.   It is difficult to believe that the girl was murdered because he mistakenly believed she was VietCong.  Rather, she was easy pickings.<br/><br/>Fox - the ostensible ""goodie"" - is a quiet, gentle, family man, conscripted into the Army, where he doesn't want to be - the antithesis of Penn. However, his gentle, trusting nature endangers his own life and possibly the lives of his comrades (he naively accepts food from the villagers and helps them farm their land, whilst they are harbouring VietCong).  Fox is the only person to make a stand against the brutal rape, but he is too cowardly to save her from being killed.  Indeed, he does not report the murder until his own life is threatened, a life which was originally saved by the man he reports.  Although racked with guilt, his character is ultimately on nobody's side but his own.<br/><br/>The weight attached to these two characters is immense and both Penn and Fox made very good performances.  However, Penn's performance was vastly superior.  He was every bit as coarse and vulgar as his character should be, yet charged with vulnerable energy.   I found Fox rather average - a typical all-American ""goodie"", whose moral outbursts were slightly unconvincing at times.<br/><br/>Supporting cast were also very good, particularly Leguizamo, who played the backstabbing ""ally"" to Fox.  Le was also good, but her role was limited to a lot of hysteria.  It is interesting to see that her character's name was never mentioned until her body was found.  Reilly and Harvey were also limited, and Harvey's attempts at being ""hard"" were irritating beyond extreme.  However, they served well to support Penn.<br/><br/>A very good film, which produces a variety of responses every time you watch it."

Very good actors do very poor acting here, like Sean Penn, that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on «I am Sam», and Michael J. Fox, that wastes a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen on «Platoon», performing just «average». But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of fine talent by the director), that was a cheesy,scared and insecure kind of person, even more irritating that Jar Jar Binks (yes,you heard it). The battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet on a VC tunnel.Mr. de Palma has a weak work here, and if it wasn´t for films like «Scarface» and «The Untouchables» (these ones excellent films), i would consider him a «bluff» director: too much publicity, bad filming.<br/><br/>3/10"

Erikson is forced to take a stand in the face of rape and brutality that he can't believe  however what's a crime in war time?<br/><br/>De Palma is a great director when he's on form  untouchables is a class film and Snake Eyes shows that he can rise above material to deliver style. However here he has no action set pieces to work with and the real drama is a moral one.  This causes him to fall down by painting too simplistic a picture of good and evil.  The story follows Sgt Meserve's hate driven unit as they capture a girl to service them sexually while on patrol.  New member Erikson is portrayed far too wide eyed and innocent and the gap between the two men makes it too much to accept  it takes away the very element of debate and merely tells us what we already know.<br/><br/>The official denial of the event is helped by Ving Rhames explanation of justice, but other than this it's all too black and white.  The simplistic nature continues right up till the ending where Fox achieves some sort of closure by meeting a young girl on an university campus years later.  De Palma delivers horrible visions and disturbing scenes of rape and brutality  but outside of the shock value there's nothing to do but shake your head and say `how could this have happened'.<br/><br/>Despite their characters the cast are good  Penn is powerfully convincing as Meserve and Fox manages to carry the wide-eyed youth easily.  The support cast is made up of quality  John C Reilly, Leguizamo and Rhames head it up and all three are on top form.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a powerful film and you can't help but be moved by the cruelity and injustice inflicted upon the Vietnamese girl.  But with the moral debate of wartime atrocities reduced to a picture of black and white then it can get a bit dull at times."

","Bombastic, repugnant war drama--though one with an emotionally resonant finale, for those who can stick with it. In 1966 Vietnam, a mad-dog sergeant with an axe to grind leads his four-man squad to a Vietnamese village where they kidnap an innocent girl for the purposes of using her as a sex slave; only one soldier in the troop refuses to take part in a gang-rape, and later helplessly tries to rescue the girl after she is beaten and stabbed. Ugly beyond comprehension, the film is nevertheless well-made and fairly well performed, although Michael J. Fox's maddeningly sane Eriksson tests credulity. David Rabe adapted his screenplay from Daniel Lang's non-fiction New Yorker article, which was later published in book-form, yet the dialogue is probably the picture's weakest link (it's thick with writer's ink). Brian DePalma may want to leave this genre to filmmakers like Oliver Stone...his style is occasionally in evidence, but he doesn't have his heart in this scenario, which may be why the movie is so stultified. ** from ****"

","Casualties of War is a movie I got for $5 at the WalMart ""bargain bin"" because it looked like it might be an OK movie. When I got it home and watched it, I realized why it was in the bargain bin. This is a movie that is cheaply made, poorly edited, has bad acting, and is not a good testament to an extremely serious topic.<br/><br/>The movie basically follows a squad of American soldiers in Vietnam as they capture, rape, and kill a young Vietnamese girl. It is told from the perspective of Michael J Fox who is the one guy opposed to it. I'm no fan of war and I realize that few good things ever come out of it, but this movie didn't do it justice. It was first of all not very good acting, despite having Sean Penn and Michael J Fox, which was surprising. The scenes with the Vietnamese girl where actually kind of hard not to laugh at because she spent the entire team just whining in an extremely annoying tone. I don't know what language it was, but it wasn't Vietnamese. There is also a lot of completely random and unneeded dialog, such as when Michael J Fox meets with the black lieutenant who rambles on about his life story with no relevance whatsoever to the movie.<br/><br/>Finally the special effects are terrible. The opening scene is jungle combat where explosions are just a bunch of sparks (they look like cheap fireworks) and when a VC soldier gets shot and is supposed to fall back into his tunnel, it is extremely obvious that someone pulled him down. In several scenes you can clearly tell that two shots have been fused together. Perhaps the worst of it all was when they finally stab the Vietnamese girl. You can see the knife go in ... and the BOUNCE back out. Watch it carefully, I promise it will be the worst special effect you will ever see. And all of these things are just off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has a good concept but a terrible execution, and in the end is just disrespectful. You come away thinking that the mindset of the directors must have been, ""OK, we're going to do an anti-war film demonstrating all the horrors and brutality of war and human suffering it causes, but we're going to do it cheaply and cheesy."""

","DePalma is one of the most prolific American directors of our time, and has created some masterpieces such as ""Scarface"" as well as some horror classics, ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed To Kill."" ""Casualties of War possesses the same qualities that DePalma is recognized for; excellent, stylish camera-work and editing, a sense of intense drama, etc. his Vietnam war film even features a sweeping, epic score from Ennio Morricone. But for some reason he was not able to get one believable performance out of his usually talented cast. The usually brilliant Sean Penn delivers an embarrassingly bad performance as the bullying officer in command, complete with a cheesy, fake Brooklyn accent, while Michael J. Fox, (another talented actor) gives a typical, one dimensional characterization of the innocent by-stander, who must endure the horrors and corruption around him. his whole performance consists of making anguished faces and looking horrified or hurt. Strangely enough, the only memorable performance was given by the little-known actress who played the Vietnamese girl who is kidnapped, raped and murdered. The scenes of this girl suffering are genuinely harrowing, and her cries and look of utter horror at what is happening around her, will haunt many viewers long after they see it. This one had potential, given all the talent involved, but the hammy acting by the all-star cast, combined with an awful screenplay, sinks this one. The problem here is that ""Casualties"" looks and feels too much like a 'movie.' This style works fine for other subjects, but when dealing with something like war, this was just not realistic or gritty enough. Recent films like ""Black Hawk Down"" handle the subject much more effectively."
"mjneu59","6","1","4","9 November 2010"," almost too strong at times
","The latest in a now long line of post-Vietnam War flashbacks is suitably intense and horrific, but suffers from a major drawback: it's all been seen before. Director Brian De Palma nevertheless brings a professional sheen to the film, adding a note of urgency to the already shocking story of the kidnap and gang rape of a Vietnamese girl by battle-scarred American GIs, acting out their most primitive instincts beyond the jurisdiction of any moral restraint. David Rabe's screenplay was based on an actual incident, which shows in the weak resolution: the punishment (prison terms) doesn't fit the brutality of the crime. De Palma's direction is always at its best when he isn't, as usual, aping Alfred Hitchcock, but this film is almost too strong at times: it's easy to read the story as a microcosm of the war and of the fate of the Vietnamese people, but that doesn't make it any less difficult to sit through. Michael J. Fox handles himself well playing the only soldier with a conscience, and Sean Penn obviously enjoyed taking advantage of the opportunity to further refine his Robert De Niro imitation."

","You either hate Brian DePalma, or you love him. He's either a rip-off of Hitchcock or the next master of suspense. His films are either awful or bad.<br/><br/>It's selective. People either love or hate ""Scarface."" They either love or hate ""Raising Cain."" ""Mission: Impossible"" is either one of the smartest films you've ever seen, or one of the dumbest. ""Snake Eyes"" has style or nothing.<br/><br/>So he tried ""Casualties of War,"" two years after ""Platoon"" came out in 1987, in order to change his image and imitate Oliver Stone with the film's hard and gritty portrayal of war. And it works -- to a certain extent.<br/><br/>The pros: Good true story, fine acting, fairly strong script, good emotional heart-tuggers.<br/><br/>The cons: Sean Penn's accent, DePalma's rather boring direction, a somewhat contrived lead character, and a mildly fake feel to the film.<br/><br/>Fox is Eriksson, an infantryman with a wife and daughter who joins the fight in Vietnam and witnesses a brutal murder and rape. Supposedly based on a true story and a novel by Daniel Lang, it all starts when Eriksson is transferred to a veteran five-man platoon led by Meserve (Penn), a 20-year-old New Yorker with a thick accent and no moral standards. Eriksson watches in horror as they raid a Vietnamese village and kidnap a young woman (Thuy Thu Le). They make her march with them and then later rape her, with the exception of Eriksson, who watches in disgust and tries to free the girl -- but too late, since Meserve has already given the order for her death.<br/><br/>This is essentially a story of depravity and morals, fed with a backdrop of a true story that will haunt a lot of viewers who aren't able to stomach a lot of sex and violence -- especially considering the context both are used in.<br/><br/>The problems with the film bring it down a notch or two. DePalma, notorious for outlandish filming and style, tries to make a new mold for himself -- but he can't help but slip into his old form again. Check out the scene where Fox confronts Dale Dye, a retired Military Captain who provides a commentary on the new DVD for ""Platoon,"" which he also starred in and was an advisor on. Watch as DePalma bends the camera at an awkward angle -- for no purpose whatsoever.<br/><br/>I respect filmmaking techniques when they're done for a purpose. ""Scarface"" is a great movie. I've always had a soft spot for ""Raising Cain."" But both films used the awkward angles and outlandish styles to their advantage -- ""Scarface"" with what DePalma described as its ""coked-out music,"" and ""Cain"" because it dealt with split personality disorder -- something that might trigger different angles on screen.<br/><br/>Here it makes no sense to use them.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors, tries his best to convince us that someone like himself would survive in Vietnam as long as he does -- but fails. The film is preachy about morals and war -- but it tries too hard and turns Eriksson into a type of Lone Saint. He wouldn't have survived an hour with that attitude -- his own men would've killed him off long before the ""gooks.""<br/><br/>Penn's accent is too comical -- in Lang's book the kid was from Brooklyn. Penn shouldn't have tried to become the character in the book -- he should have stayed himself. Penn's a great villain, but here he's nothing more than a decent one.<br/><br/>This movie isn't bad by any degree of criticism. It has its flaws, but for the most part it's an enjoyable movie. The worst thing about it is that it's not very memorable, and it's not on the same level as ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now."" But regardless, it works.<br/><br/>And hey, you get to see Ving Rhames with hair.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"zfiany","8","0","1","2 November 2009"," Ladies & Gents, It's THE Brian De Palma!
","I've said it before and I will keep sayin' it. Brian De Palma is my favorite director, with all do respect to Trantino and Kubrick, I like the latter two guys but De Palma is by far the Master. Have you seen Scarface, Untouchables, The Black Dhalia, Dressed to kill, Carrie, and Sisters? Of course you did! De Palma is the director of variety. De Palma directed movies like untouchables and scarface but also romance and horror, and Nam movies like Casualties of war. Tarantino and Kubrick had a certain line they walked through but didn't diversify! N e how, Casualties of war is a Nam movie that storms your thoughts and stirs your fears of how cruel, unethical, and chaotic wars can get to be. The casualties of the war were many in the movie hence the (/s). The girl who was beastly raped was not the only casualty in the movie. Humanity is the first casualty and then comes the people in war who disagree of what's going on but can't really take a real stand. If you think about it, I am sure that in Iraq today the same scene is taking place and almost anywhere there is war! It scares me a lot the idea that many people are defendless, helpless and become victims for no viable reason in wars! I just want to take all my hats off to De Palma and being a girl it felt like my nails pinched holes in my palms because I was so aggravated by the rape scenes. <br/><br/>Sean Penn, you can tell, is a very good actor from this movie and too bad it took him long to climb up until recently he reached.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox, I loved him ever since he played Alex P. Keaton in Family Ties and he is just so good! <br/><br/>If you are a nam movies fan, Brian De Palma fan, and good movies fan, then this one is definitely for YOU."
"Hunky Stud","8","0","4","28 January 2009"," Only in the USA, the greatest country of all!
","Wow, I am really impressed by this movie. After all, unlike those typical war movies made from Hollywood, even though the government probably don't pay them any money, most of the war movies are trying to tell the whole world how great the US soldiers are. whatever the wars they are fighting for, it seems that they are always fighting for the right cause. And the US audiences generally like to pay money to watch that kind of movies.<br/><br/>This movie is entirely the opposite, from what I watched from the DVD extras, not many studios were interested in financing for this movie. And it didn't make a lot of money, either. Michael J. Fox talked during the interview, at that time, a lot of people paid money to watch ""honey, I shrunk the kids"", look at it now, who actually remember that movie.<br/><br/>In those socialist countries (aka communist countries, known to the westerners), those governments always like to teach their students that in capitalist countries, greedy capitalists only goal is to make money. Only in socialist countries, can the real people make movies for all the working classes. In reality, with this kind of theme, this movie can never be made in the socialist countries. Even if it was filmed, it can never pass the government's censorship, and the directors, actors might be banned for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Only in USA, can people have the freedom to make a movie like this. Even though money talks in the court room, at least, some of the soldiers got sent to prisons for a long time. Those are the reasons why there are so many people say that they are proud to be US citizens.<br/><br/>These kind of things probably happen all over the world. In other countries, some people might even protest against the director just for making such a movie because it is not ""patrotic"".<br/><br/>I watched the extended cut on DVD, so it felt a little long. The performance is solid. The girl was very real, it felt as if she was really the girl from that real story. What a tragic story, it made me cry. From what I have seen in the extra interviews, the director seems to be the first super nice director I have ever seen, who has some high moral standards. Because of that, he was the one who actually made this movie a reality.<br/><br/>By the way, it seems that my comment is the 100th for this movie, great!"
"jboothmillard","8","0","1","3 December 2008"," Casualties of War
","From director Brian De Palma (Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables), this is a very disturbing and provocative fact-based Vietnam war film drama, just as effective as one of Oliver Stone's. Basically new recruit PFC. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox), led by battle-scarred Sgt. Tony Meserve (young Sean Penn), along with fellow soldiers Cpl. Thomas E. Clark (Don Harvey), PFC. Herbert Hatcher (John C. Reilly) and PFC. Antonio Diaz (John Leguizamo) are obviously fighting in Vietnam. In their trek, they find out they are not allowed to the near village anymore, even with passes, so they decide kidnap a local woman, Tran Thi Oanh (Thuy Thu Le). Eriksson is objectionable to their intentions, they each plan to rape her, and they do so very brutally, and he obviously refuses to join in, and stands back doing nothing. There is a point when he tries to help her, feeding her, and trying to let her go, or help her get back to her people, but he is caught, and as a result, while she is hiding with the soldiers, trying to escape, they kill her! When Eriksson gets back to a camp, he is determined to see his fellow comrades get their justice for their terrible crimes of rape and murder, and thank goodness they do. Oh, and there is a point when going home, Eriksson sees a lookalike of the girl on the train (obviously the same actress), an interesting end sequence. Also starring Erik King as Cpl. Brown, Jack Gwaltney as PFC. Rowan, Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames as Lt. Reilly, Dan Martin as Hawthorne, Dale Dye as Capt. Hill, Steve Larson as Agent #1, John Linton as Agent #2, Vyto Ruginis as Prosecutor and Al Shannon as Wilkins. I think what makes this film just as effective as an Oliver Stone Vietnam film is because it makes you realise how horrific the realities of the Vietnam war was, and it so horrible to think that men actually did this to poor innocent girls in their homeland, very risky content, but done very compassionately in terms of the both J. Fox and the girl's positions. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Ennio Morricone. It was number 55 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!"
"dead47548","8","0","1","8 January 2008"," Very intense.
","A very powerful story of a unique bravery in the time of war. Usually we see the generic sentimental tales of a group of men banding together, becoming brothers and struggling to make it through a brutal war together. This is a much darker story of a moralistic man doing whatever it takes, no matter what the dangerous cost, in order to give four horrible men the proper punishment. De Palma does a very good job of showing the true side of war, where men go mad, without having to show us the descent of insanity when the men return home. We see the true horror and disgusting nature of soldiers at war, and 'brotherly comradery' shown in films like Saving Private Ryan takes a much darker, disgusting turn for the troop in this one. I must say that the ending was a wonderfully symbolic moment that I hadn't expected from such a hard-hitting straight forward drama. We see the inner pain of seeing something so horrible as kidnapping, rape and murder by men who are supposed to be fighting the good fight, taken in the form of a dream. A dream that takes place on a train, just like where the abducted Vietnamese girl was shot down right before Eriksson's eyes. He makes constant eye contact with a woman, and gets off the train to speak to her. Played by the same actress who portrayed the rape victim, she lets him know that his nightmare is over now. He brought the criminals to justice, put them in prison, and now he deserves to wake up. He did the right thing and, in a saved form of the victim, he becomes aware that his conscience his clear and he can move on with his life. A beautiful ending to a very gut-wrenching film.<br/><br/>The performances from the two leads make and break this feature. Sean Penn is on fire in one of the best works of his career. His portrayal of the supposed courageous hero who turns into the leader of a despicable crime is top-notch. The performance is extremely intense and makes the audience terribly afraid for Eriksson. Michael J. Fox was insanely miscast for this kind of a film. After Back to the Future, it only made sense for him to try and escape the nice-guy routine but the unfortunate part is that's the only kind of character that Fox fits in to. He just...doesn't work here, and that's all there is to it. Another aspect of the film that I wasn't too fond of was it's habit of being a tad overly sentimental at times. There are a few scenes where Fox is delivering a righteous monologue about doing the morally right thing, and Ennio Morricone's score (which is a little too sentimental, as always) is really pouring on the attempt to bring the tears flowing, that the film just becomes far too sappy and overly preachy for me to enjoy it. Fortunately this only happens a couple of times, and the rest of the film more than makes up for it."

","It was an upsetting movie - but then it was supposed to be. I assume it is a fictional story, but just last year in Iraq there was an event eerily similar. If they are guilty may justice be done in real life as in the movie. I was afraid it was going to end with them getting by with it....which was going to upset me big time. But it had a satisfying ending, except I don't understand why Sean Penn got just ten years....it was his idea and his 'leadership' that did it. And like probably everyone else who watched it - as least for the males - there was a continual gut wrenching question: What would I have done if I had been there?. What if I had been in M.J. Fox's shoes? Participate in the rape/murder? Answer is no for most of us. Some may say that no one can say what they would do until they were there themselves. True, but right is right and wrong is wrong. It doesn't matter what everyone else does, even if every person involved is guilty...that doesn't make it right. I didn't go to Vietnam - was in the service at that time, but state side duty. But I know Vietnam vets who, even though in heavy combat, brought honor to themselves and our country in what they did. And then there are others I've heard about. Which brings up another question that has been debated endlessly...was the conduct of our troops in Vietnam worse than in other wars? Thats a matter of debate and I'm not qualified to get into that one. But back to the movie. I've never been a Micheal J. Fox or Sean Penn fan, but their performances are awesome, especially M.J. Fox. I highly recommend it, but if you take medication for high blood pressure, make sure you take it before seeing this movie."

This film is early in his career, and is a eye widener as to what he would/is up to in his older years. The film itself if hard to believe. We all know that war is hell. But some things we just don't do everyday. No one is saying that what happened in the film didn't happen. But, if it did (and is a small part might have), in no way was it normal business, despite media showings. War is War. No One Despites This.

Everyone that follows him knows that he has consistently taken up anti-authority roles.<br/><br/>Film is a big political media. Anyone who says that it isn't is ignorant.

The story is absolutely heart-wrenching. If you're not moved by it, you may not be human. On screen, there's one moment in particular that hits so hard, it feels like a kick to the stomach. Visually the movie is also stunning: lush greens, blue skies, a few tricky camera shots, etc. If you wanted to look for flaws, I would have to say that some of the other leads besides Fox give uneven performances, including, surprisingly, Penn; but I digress.<br/><br/>The DVD extras are decent too consisting of a ""Making of"" short, an interview with Fox, and the theatrical trailers.<br/><br/>In short, buy this DVD!"

","There is a distinct difference between Vietnam movies made in Thailand and those in the Philippines.  The Thai ones try to be morality plays or generally don't understand the topic, the Filipino ones are disillusioned and disturbing...certainly more advanced than their counterparts.  Sadly, Casualties of War is a Thai-Nam movie and not a Phi-Nam one.<br/><br/>Sean Penn does his best General Ripper/Turgidson impression and makes an interesting insane caricature.  Michael J. Fox and the rest of the squad are cardboard cut-outs necessary to make DePalma's morality play work.  Too bad half the time they are unintelligible in their reactions.<br/><br/>The way DePalma fixes the camera as a separate from the narrative, such as in the opening with the platoon moving through the jungle, shows moderate intelligence.  When he separates the camera from the narrative--after the kidnapping for example--then thrusts it into the viewer's face by having the cast talk at it, that's brilliant.  Too bad the other elements of the film aren't anywhere near as sharp.<br/><br/>DePalma is neither an auditory director nor an editing one.  Funny, when ads ran for Femme Fatale, he was listed as ""master of the erotic thriller."" He'll be better known as the person who reshaped the crime genre with Scarface and the Untouchables.  DePalma can't separate moods and pacing from each individual cut, Sam Raimi is already several steps ahead of him.  No better example comes to mind than the climax of ""Casualties"" where DePalma throws every possible angle he can on the screen, but the editing is so cumbersome that the entire scene is ruined.  Sound work in his films is always an afterthought.<br/><br/>Basic storytelling skills are further decimated by the horrendously unneeded prologue and epilogue with Fox back in America.  Did we really need those scenes?  Perhaps Brian should've spent more time on the script and understanding the fundamentals of film storytelling before hopping onto this project.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll leave it at that.  Visual work alone doesn't make a good movie, but this is one of DePalma's more watchable films.  Isn't that sad? (60%)"

This movie, on the other hand, was really good WITH even a good ending.  It had some awesome acting in it, with Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn!  I was especially impressed with Penn!  Never have I seen anyone do a DeNiro like him!  I think this was the first movie I saw Fox be really emotional, so I give major props to him. The actress who played the girl that they killed put on a great performance that made you really pity and feel bad for her character.  Now let's talk about the ending:  Fox finally realizes that he can't change what happened to that girl, and that he must not forget about it but move on in life. You can't let something get you down!  ""Did you have a bad dream?""  ""Yea."" ""Well, I think it's over now.""  That, I think was the perfect ending. That and those men getting what they deserve (I personally hated Clark).  When Penn and Fox were talking about Brown (who was shot and killed), I really do think that if Brown were still alive and on that platoon, that things for the girl's fate would've been different.  In the beginning, Brown and Fox's charcter really hit it off as buddies, and that showed you that Brown had the same heart as Fox's character.  Anyways, this was a superb movie that you should watch!

","Very powerful movie with Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn turning in brilliant roles. After seeing Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, I believe Casualties of War has the edge over all of them. While the kidnapping, raping and eventual killing of the vietnamese girl is very disturbing and portrayed as sickeningly wrong, after studying the Vietnam war this particular situation happened more than once during the course of the war. What you may understand after reading what I have read, that the Vietnam war was so emotionally shatterring to American and allied soldiers, being attacked by Vietcong disguised as villagers of whom they were helping, losing friends to booby traps - and basically fighting an enemy they couldn't see, it becomes slightly clearer as to why such horrible events like these occurred. I am definitely not defending the acts of Sean Penn and the other soldiers in this movie and indeed during the course of the war. This movie actually made me feel sorry for Sean Penn's character. This is a man driven by love for his country and hatred of his enemy, that during the course of the war he has lost sense of reality and of what is right and what is wrong. Many people will say that this is ""Just a movie"", but you must remember events like this DID take place. On an overall perspective a very good movie - my pick as the best vietnam war movie."

","Casualties of War is a excellent movie based on certain events in the Viet Nam war. Michael J. Fox does a fantastic job as the fresh, idealistic, rookie who is caught up in the (arguably) most terrifying situation imaginable. Sean Penn also does a great job as the main villain. The movie is centered on a group of American soldiers kidnapping, raping, and murdering a young Vietnamese woman, and Michael J. Fox struggling with the decision on whether to report them and be called a traitor by his comrades or to do nothing and go on with life. Sadly, this movie is not fictional; it is based on several other events like it that took place during the war. During the movie, it becomes obvious that while Captain Meserve (Sean Penn) is a good soldier, he has become corrupted by the war and seeing so many of his friends die. Private Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) also comes off as a caring sort of person who does not belong in war. The director did a excellent job at capturing the feeling of emotional struggle and the feeling of helplessness.<br/><br/>(WARNING; SPOILERS AHEAD) During the movie, I noticed how quickly things heated up, especially after the platoon is at risk of the Vietnamese discovering them because the poor Vietnamese girl is sick and coughing; or after they are at risk of other U.S. forces seeing the girl from a helicopter. Michael J. Fox conveys a sense of helplessness as his Captain brutally mows down the girl with an M60 machine gun so that the helicopter doesn't see her, as Eriksson's his scream of rage is drowned out by her scream of pain.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is defiantly worth watching, even if it is hard to do so at times.<br/><br/>I give it a 4.5 out of 5"

","Director Brian DePalma attempts to continue the vogue started by fellow directors Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick when it comes to making a quality film about the conflicts of the Vietnam War. DePalma succeeds but only moderately as his example is nowhere near as strong as the examples turned in by the aforementioned men. Michael J. Fox has a good rare dramatic role as an army private who, along with his commanding officer (Sean Penn), tries to cover up a young Vietnamese woman's brutal murder. Conflicts erupt and the film turns out being more of a character study than a war film and that may be one of the problems. That would prove that the title may be slightly misleading."
"Bill Slocum","7","0","1","9 October 2002"," Flawed treatment gathers steam in second half
","Released at the end of a decade of big Vietnam films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Born On The Fourth Of July,"" ""Casualties of War"" occupies a smaller and more intimate space, almost resembling a TV movie apart from the cussing. Based on a short non-fiction account by New Yorker writer Daniel Lang, the minor-key treatment kind of works in the picture's favor, putting character before spectacle.<br/><br/>What doesn't work in the film's favor is surprising. Brian De Palma's a great director of suspense and action, but he stumbles early here, with a silly sequence where a trapped soldier is menaced by a Viet Cong soldier crawling slowly through a tunnel. It's a VC tunnel, so why is Charlie crawling? Just walk over and stab the guy, right? But here, and a little later with the fate of Brownie, De Palma telegraphs his punches in ham-fisted style, and the picture drags. And what's the use of hiring the greatest actor of his generation if he can't give a decent performance? Sean Penn's mannerisms are off-putting throughout. If you're going to do De Niro, okay, but at least choose whether it's going to be the guy from ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Midnight Run.""<br/><br/>On the other hand, Michael J. Fox is actually very good, overcoming his callow 80s cut-off-tie image with a performance of hidden depth and complexity. How do you deal with a group of fellow soldiers who set out to perform a despicable act, but whom you are bound by trust and duty? How far do you push to see justice is served, when you don't know if it can do any good?<br/><br/>The film gathers force and mission in the second half, with a powerful climax to the kidnapping segment and then a gripping, satisfying search for justice that features maybe the best use of a shovel in cinema history. The dialogue sometimes ODs on steroids(""What happened in the field stays in the field""; ""Oh, you think this is over?"") and there are some awkward visual metaphors, but it holds together for repeat viewings well. I like the confrontations with Capt. Hill (Dale Dye from ""Saving Private Ryan"") especially.<br/><br/>Some liberties were taken with the book: There's no Brownie in the Lang account, nor Hatch. Diaz isn't an unwilling cherry, and he has a cousin who is in on the rape, too. Eriksson didn't try to lead the kidnap victim to safety in an unguarded moment, and Sgt. Meserve didn't save his life (he saved someone else's immediately after his crime, for which he was nominated for the Bronze Star.)<br/><br/>The bookend sections are weak, particularly the ending, which is so lame it makes sense the screenwriter all but disowned the work after De Palma rejected a tougher conclusion. But ""Casualties"" is a strong movie all the same, about more than just a war. How do we hold onto a code of morality in a world of chaos and random violence?<br/><br/>As Eriksson says, both in the movie and the book: ""We all figured we might be dead in the next minute, so what difference did it make what we did? But the longer I was over there, the more I became convinced it was the other way around that counted - that because we might not be around much longer, we had to take extra care how we behaved."""

","I wasn't sure how to think, considering the timeline and all...but I thought Michael J. Fox did a pretty good job. And even though I don't like Sean Penn, he played a believable bad guy. I didn't like Leguizamo's character though. He seemed like such a wussy."

","I was thinking after watching Casualties Of War of how many good films feature the conflict in Viet Nam. Deer Hunter,Apocolypse Now etc in fact i cant really think of a bad film made on the Subject. This film is no acception. Michael J Fox and Sean Pen star in this gritty drama about a young soldier who tries to bring justice to the rest of his platoon for raping and Murdering a local girl. Fox is superb (why did he not take on more serious roles like this)as is Sean Pen. The film flows and is highly watchable if not a little disturbing. Brian De Palma comes up trumps. Well worth a view. 8 out of 10."

","This movie was pretty good drama/war movie. Michael J. Fox does a good acting job in it, although it's not the best movie of Fox. So it's worth of watching,at least once."
