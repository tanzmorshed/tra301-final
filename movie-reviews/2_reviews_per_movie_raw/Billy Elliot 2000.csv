","Billy Elliott is a moving, uplifting, and often exuberant, drama about motherless young Billy (Jamie Bell) fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer, in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother (Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven).<br/><br/>It is also a piece of magic realism, with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a close-knit mining community, and more specifically against the backdrop of the 1984/5 miners' strike - a defining moment of modern British economic and social history - writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues, without turning their work into a political tract, and without losing focus on the central human drama.<br/><br/>The film is realised near flawlessly. Bell achieves a convincing blend of adolescent bewilderment and defiance; if his dancing is not quite as good as we might expect, the storyline explains this away by saying that at this early stage his attitude and drive are more important than his technique. The dancing set pieces, clearly inspired more by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly than by Nijinksky, are performed with gusto, mainly to pop songs by T-Rex.<br/><br/>Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. They make us feel their despair as they realise that this cause is lost; but also their endurance as they come to terms both with Billie's aspirations and their own uncertain futures - within a few years most UK coalmines would be closed. (The colliery in Easington, the real-life location of the film, closed in 1994.). The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically, but with the occasional touch of humour.<br/><br/>Julie Walters provides an outstanding performance as Mrs Wilkinson, the dancing teacher who recognises and fosters Billie's talent; and helps him resist his own and his family's inhibitions. She is perfect as the chain-smoking, straight-talking mentor, who has her own personal disappointments and hurts, which she hopes Billie's success will help heal. To we outsiders watching the movie, Mrs Wilkinson appears as an integral part of the local community; but it is made clear that in the mid-80s, as far as Billie's family and friends are concerned, she is a middle class outsider, almost as alien as another species.<br/><br/>One issue which the film tackles head-on is traditional heterosexual male abhorrence of homosexuality. This attitude clearly underlies the shock of Billie's father and brother when they discover his interest in ballet. They would be even more horrified if they realised that his best friend was discovering gay tendencies in himself. It is typical of the sensitive direction that without labouring the point the film indicates by its close that attitudes towards gays changed radically during the 1980s and 90s along with the industrial landscape."

","I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month, finally, I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie, easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade.<br/><br/>Director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional, truly inspiring and moving, emotional and poignant movie. The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in North-Eastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us. Sometimes the movie is sad, sometimes it's funny but Stephen Daldry's work never leave you indifferent. The story occurs in a small coal-mining town in 1984 and there are signs of a severe depression all over the town. You can see all around a shadow of distress and even poverty. Some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring to us sad feeling of hopelessness and even despair. There is a big coalminers strike in the town but it's easy to see that it's also the hopeless strike. But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character, a twelve years old boy. He recently lost his mother and both his father and elder brother are striking coalminers. Billy is forced by his father to attend boxing classes and one day accidentally he see the girl ballet classes that occur in same room and he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing. So he attends those ballet classes instead the boxing and there is nothing surprising that after a few weeks his father suddenly finds out that Billy didn't attend boxing and worst of all he is attending the ballet classes. The main conflict occurs.<br/><br/>Billy must fight for his choice, fight against his own family. There are two stereotypes against him. First one is that ballet for girls, not for boys (lads do football... or boxing... or wrestling). And second sounds even worse: all male ballet dancers are gays. Billy is not but no one from his family except aged grandma want even heard about ballet. There are only two people in the whole town, who support him  middle-aged ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson and his friend Michael, who is the same age as Billy and who found that he is possibly a gay. This gay subplot easily became for conservative audience a very controversial question. But the fact is that such stereotypes are not invented by the director of the movie and if you would try to learn more about this terrific picture you will found that Jamie Bell, who took dance lessons from age six, suffered from similar sneers and taunts. Billy's problem is that he must fight not only against bad obstacles and misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes. Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors. His performance (and particularly dance sequences) is so genuine, bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy, not a director, choreographer or writer. BAFTA award for best actor of the year is well-deserved and it is pity that conservatism of the Academy too often becomes an insuperable obstacle for many great movies. Julie Walters (an Academy nomination for best supporting actress) as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary. The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot. Two other important supporting characters  Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction. The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic (including a nice reference to great Swan Lake) and modern music.<br/><br/>The original ""R"" rating shouldn't mislead you. Except for strong language it should be easily a PG-13. But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding. The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 looks well deserved. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English"

","With a seemingly run-of-the-mill storyline - that of an 11-year-old schoolboy wanting to be a ballet dancer - it is quite a feat to have made a movie as warm and entertaining as this.<br/><br/>Quite simply, this is the best British movie in years. All the characters are intriguing, and the acting is flawless, most notably from 14-year-old Jamie Bell whose acting is utterly convincing, filled with humour and insight beyond his years. He is also a fantastic dancer, and some of the dance sequences are reminiscent of the dance-filled musicals of the old black and white movies.<br/><br/>The backdrop of the historic miners' strike of the mid-1980s, it brings the story down to the earth and adds the necessary tension to make this film truly believable and a worthy story to tell.<br/><br/>I find it hard to see how anyone would not like this film. 9 and a half out of 10."
"robmillrs","10","114","131","10 December 2000"," Billy Elliot - The Class of 2000
","To say that Billy Elliot is the best movie of 2000 is to damn it with faint praise, since this year's crop is pretty uninspiring. Better to compare it to movies of the past few years, and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film, and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way, since it goes against the trend of quirky, violent, sex-obsessed moviemaking that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good, almost mythic story, complicated yet believable characters, a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint, and a series of dance scenes that are authentic, inspiring and completely integral to the plot.<br/><br/>No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres (one-quarter to one- sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters) and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart, head, funny bone, eyes and ears, and last but not least your feet, for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood: Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure; the people in his life rendered more black and white; characters would have either remained caricatures, or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot, where the characters develop in a totally believable way, where Billy invites admiration instead of pity, and where the silences, looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum ""Less is more"" is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.<br/><br/>The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a ""knock 'em dead"" Hollywood rollercoaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle, though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breath-taking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful, and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age, career, box office draw or Hollywood clout, Jamie and his movie would win hands down."

","I went into this movie expecting to hate it, and found myself instantly smiling at the playful opening credits with Billy jumping on a trampoline. From there on it just got better and better. The wasn't even a minor character that I could say needed work. The cast as a whole was brilliant - and surprising at times. The father and brother come off as these one-sided brutal characters in the beginning and then as you watch, they become two of the most well constructed and acted characters this year and for who knows how long. Jaime Bell is brilliant for a first-timer and his dance is wonderful. There are also so many layers to the film. From brilliant cinematography to wonderful symbolism both in the script and in the music (listen for the tune Billy is playing on piano in the main score during the big moments). The music on a whole was brilliantly picked and I don't think a single element was overlooked or addressed. If you haven't seen this movie - GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND INTO THE THEATER! It is truly an experience that everyone should have and I hope to see more from this writer, director and a brilliant new face in Jaime Bell."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","23","24","4 March 2008"," Masterful coming of age drama without sugar and soap.
","After revisiting this film again recently, I stick my chest out and state proudly that the film touches me on so many levels that my emotions go all over the shop. For a film that is in essence a feel good coming of age drama it is mightily impressive that the film never veers down that street known as sickly boulevard.<br/><br/>Set against the grim backdrop of the English Coal Miners strikes the film tackles an array of subjects, class struggles, fear of homosexuality, youthful adventure in discovering potential adulthood, and the universal joy that music and dance can bring to us all, even in the most trying of circumstances. So many great scenes here that are both happy and sad, Billy's father feels he has to break the strike to give Billy a chance in life, this leads to a truly heartbreaking scene between him and his eldest son, I weep unashamedly at the realism of it all, the dancing is just wonderful, with too many great scenes to only pick just one out, the film is a seamless classic that ticks every box that I personally require from a film like this.<br/><br/>The cast are magnificent, Jamie Bell perfectly layers the lead role of Billy by fusing confusion, joy, fear, hope, and sorrow into one almighty performance. Julie Walters is up to her usual standard of greatness, whilst Gary Lewis as the father is nothing short of tremendous, they all can take a bow for making such a wonderful movie. The soundtrack is music gold, you can never have enough T-Rex in your life, ever, and I ask if there has ever been a more appropriate use of music than the use of The Jam's-Town Called Malice? Paul Weller's up tempo beat belies it's sombre lyrics, the song is about a town besieged by unemployment, a great scene accompanies the song as Billy dances out his frustrations down the street; ""you either cut down on the beer or the kids new gear, it's a big decision in a town called Malice"".<br/><br/>Brilliant! Maybe I'm biased because I remember the miners strikes, a sad and desperate time for the industry that was about to go under, perhaps I love it for the sheer sympathy the characters garner, or could it just be that it's an incredibly human story that is laid out fantastically well with an ending that demands a positive response from the viewer? Either way it rates 10/10 for me and it always will."

","Billy Elliot is a truly inspirational movie. It reminds us of the human potential to transcend our economic surroundings and the expectations of society by doing something so simple, and yet sometimes so very difficult, as simply being ourselves.<br/><br/>Born in a socially and economically repressed mining town, Billy is told that boys box or wrestle; boys don't dance. But Billy loves to dance and does so every chance that he gets.<br/><br/>Does a love of ballet make you gay? Does it matter if your best friend is a crossdresser? How far will a father go when he realizes the truth about his son? This is a movie of change, growth and emotion, with characters and actors so real and fully developed that they pull your heart forth and place it firmly upon the screen. We literally feel the brittleness of judgement, the despair of lost hope, and the joy of acceptance.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why this small British film has won so many foreign awards and nominations, and I only hope it will be given the chance it deserves to inspire and transform US audiences as well."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","11","11","2 February 2010"," Beautiful, honest, touching, poignant- a truly remarkable film
","This movie is such a good film for a number of reasons. As a study of daring to be different in the fact of intractable tradition, Billy Elliot is beautiful, touching, poignant and very honest. It does start off slowly, but the film does have a lot of heart. Firstly, I liked the story, a young boy who wishes to ballet dance against the the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike, it was a nice one and is likely to evoke some emotion. Stage director Stephen Daldry makes his feature debut here, and succeeds pretty much brilliantly. Another strong asset was the writing, while funny in places, it is also quite touching. Then the music, I loved hearing the music Tchaikovsky's timeless ballet ""Swan Lake"", such a melancholy yet enchanting and haunting score. But really the best asset of the film is the acting. Jamie Bell gives a really believable performance in the lead role, while Gary Lewis is marvellous as his dad. The acting honours though go to the brilliant Julie Walters as Billy's chain smoking dance instructor, that role especially proves what a fine actress Walters is. In conclusion, I loved this film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"cooper-29","9","63","77","20 January 2001"," Wonderful!
","I had seen the commercials and they emphasize the dancing aspect of the story which is great but there is so much more to this movie. It deals with death and it touches on Mens feelings of loss and what a Man is and even deals a bit with homosexuality. Theres not many times where I sit though the end credits anymore but I was mesmorized. I laughed in this movie and I cried too. The dance scenes were terrific too. The boy who played Billy should get an award hands down for this movie. I watched the emotion on his face and it was amazing. This is the best breakout performance by a young boy since haley Joel Osmant in Sixth Sense. I have to say I just loved Julie Walters too. Where has she been since Educating Rita. Inspite of the swear words this is a movie that families should see. Its hard to believe this gets an R rating and movies like Scary Movie get...only R ratings.  I dont get it. Strange that two of my favorite recent movies are from the British...This and Croupier. Word to Hollywood, make more movies like this or at lease import more like this. Dont miss this one!"
"pumpkinland2000","9","77","96","18 November 2000"," A nearly flawless drama
","This is one of those really great dramas that only come around maybe once a year. This is my pick for the best drama of 2000. Filled with amazing characters, a great plot, and circumstances that seem too real, the wonderfully underplayed value of it takes precedence over anything set against it.<br/><br/>There are some great performances here, so let's get to em.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell plays the lead role, in an astonishing performance. Amazing dance routines done in perfect sync, I can just imagine the time he had memorizing all the steps. A knockout performance, with some of the most dramatic scenes played out with perfect honesty and realism.<br/><br/>Another notable performance comes from Julie Walters, who plays Mrs. Wilkinson, the dance instructor in the mining town where Billy lives. Once a great dancer but now forced to work in the bottom floor of a boxing hall, she plays her part wonderfully, showing the lack of compassion and jadedness without words but only through expressions, deep hurt lying beneath all that scorn, but love shining through as she sees Billy's true talent.<br/><br/>
Finally, performance wise, we have Gary Lewis, who plays Billy's father. With wonderful scenes that play themselves out with harsh reality, I never tire of seeing the hurt in his eyes when he sees that his little boy isn't going to be a boxer or a football player, but a dancer, then seeing him again with the love and appreciation for his dancing son. Some things must be experienced, and the deep hurt he carries about the death of his wife is one of those. Greatness all around.<br/><br/>The one problem I did have with this movie is that it is first of all rated R. Why?!  If it weren't for the few (and very effective) uses of the 'F' word, it would've gotten a PG-13 rating. It so strongly needs the 'F' word, yet it needs to be seen by a PG-13 audience! This is a move that truly should be shown to middle schoolers all over the country, showing that you should believe in yourself and no one else. Follow your dreams. Not only is this message not shoved down your throat (as some other movies shamelessly do), but it is done in such a way that you truly believe it. You want good things to happen, and you get that, but not spotless and clean. Nothing is done easily, and there will always be someone who will try and stop your dreams from coming true.<br/><br/>Another (and the only other problem) are the accents. The British definitely have a style of speaking all their own, and it sometimes took a moment for all the dialogue to register. Sometimes I'd miss half a scene, trying to decipher out exactly what was said. However, the tones and emotions of most scenes were enough to let you know what was said. Everything didn't have to be spelt out, but I can imagine that after I get this DVD I will sit down with the captions on, just to know I didn't miss anything. This is one of the only complaints I have for another favorite of mine, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.<br/><br/>Billy Elliot is a true rag-to-riches story that unfolds amazingly well without pulling your heartstrings shamelessly as other movies love to do. I recommend this to all, expect to be entertained with great plot twists as well as interesting characters, wonderful dialogue, and a story that can never grow old: Follow your dreams."
"Orson5","Null","52","64","7 December 2000"," A Triumph of Highly Charged Storytelling
","Billy Elliot is by far the most honestly told depiction of middle boyhood I've seen in years, if ever. I was in joyful tatters at the end of this story of a boy struggling to stay true to his calling in an anguished northern English mining town circa 1980. Every working class character in this film is written and uncompromisingly played with great love and understanding of both family and class hardship. Personally I view this film as the finest piece of British ""intimiste"" cinema I've seen since Mike Leigh's ""Secrets and Lies"". Yet it has epic elements as well.  Billy's personal story unfolds while his home town is occupied by uniformed British strike control forces.<br/><br/>This is a tale of inter-masculine struggle in a family and mining town almost devoid of (and yearning for) a balancing feminine presence. Billy's gift is slowly awakened in this stressed and violent male crucible. His relationships with his brother, his father, his genderally confused classmate, and his teacher all grow increasingly charged as the movie develops. For honesty and presence, Jamie Bell as Billy far surpasses Haley Joel Osment's debut in The Sixth Sense. And if that's not enough, Julie Walters, Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven as Billy's teacher, dad and brother are all heartbreakingly portrayed. All are perfectly cast and at the very top of their form.<br/><br/>After all these characters have passed through the warzone of the first and second acts, director Steven Daldry delivers perhaps the most perfectly executed third act I have seen in a family centered drama from England or elsewhere. There are countless insightful decisions  Daldry makes in the course of this film that other directors will study for years to come. But they're all brought to touching and masterful closure in the third act segments.<br/><br/>Kudos to scenarist Lee Hall for an excellent script. It should also be noted that many of DP Brian Tufano's beautifully composed shots match those of the great Chinese and Italian cinematographers. The film is brash in its musical style and forthright in its language. It is a film of specifics and the locale is not dressed up. And unlike many other local color films from England since 1985, this film has a strong, eminently compassionate narrative spine. Many audience members in the show I attended were immobilized and overcome in their seats during credits.<br/><br/>Despite frequent profanity, boys 11 and up should be allowed to see Billy Elliot, if only to keep them from abandoning hope. If it helps even one oppressed and confused boy keep an ear to the faint voice within that might just be his true calling, this film will have been worth every dollar spent in its making. A truly uplifting film."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","6","6","31 August 2009"," ""Billy Elliot"" grounds the magic and passion of dancing into reality
","Dancing, passion and familial struggle are all tied together in the high-spirited ""Billy Elliot,"" the little independent film that could in 2000, when such films were drastically under- appreciated. ""Billy Elliot"" caught some attention however because it combines the dream-like fancy-free spirit of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films along with the social-historical context of the '80s coal miner strike in England. Youthful optimism and social reality are at odds as seen through the young Billy (a very talented Jamie Bell) and the film doesn't let either one completely win out, an admirable and unexpected quality for a story about a child.<br/><br/>Pre-teen Billy lives in a small England town where his father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are picketing as part of the coal miner's strike, so money is scarce. His father then becomes especially angry to find out Billy's been taking the money he was supposed to be using to pay for boxing lessons for ballet instruction instead. Despite his father's disapproval at his son taking up a ""girl's"" activity, Billy meets regularly with Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) to prepare for the Royal Ballet School audition.<br/><br/>The feature film debut for both writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry, ""Billy Elliot"" is a real triumph of art imitating life. In a stroke of inspired creativity, Billy dances when he feels it, when he needs to express emotions of anger or excitement or when he was something to prove. Scenes are intercut often to show how Billy's drive to master ballet is indicative of a need for self-discovery, family approval and learning how to handle life's challenges.<br/><br/>With a soundtrack mixing '70s English rock band T-Rex with classical music and orchestration by 1999 Oscar-winning composer Stephen Warbeck, ""Billy Elliot"" takes on this true independent spirit. It's far from the cheesy uplifting string music of an inspirational drama and more true to its historical context. Its much easier to sympathize with Billy's yearning for movement and his description of ""electricity"" in terms of how dance makes him feel with modern music.<br/><br/>Billy's dancing outburst scenes give the film the feel of a dance musical movie ala the Fred Astaire era of Hollywood, while his angry and emotionally withdrawn father as well as Billy's own fits of irrational anger ground the movie in the struggles that surround the Elliot family on a daily basis. <br/><br/>The film is also not a social commentary on gender roles despite the conflict of Billy wanting to dance and his father wanting him to box. Billy takes an unexplained interest in dancing and doesn't exhibit any ""homosexual"" tendencies. This is about doing something you're passionate about, not a child's struggle with his gender identity. Billy's cross-dressing friend is there to remind us that one thing is not connected to the other, but the film doesn't waste time overdramatizing this small conflict in a greater story.<br/><br/>""Billy Elliot"" is a special film, one that perfectly fits the magic of finding one's passion within the troubles of real life and a cast that accurately reflects that vision from Daldry and Hall. It acknowledges that with good comes bad and with reward and hard work comes nervousness and discomfort. It's a unique outlook for a movie based about a young boy and his dreams. ~ Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

Breath taking photography, scenery. Excellent cast specially by young Jamie Bell (Billy) and Gary Lewis (Billy's father). Above all I enjoyed the story which becomes so alive due to a director's talent. It's a moving love story between a boy and his father, a story field with emotions like despair, anger, sorrow and love. All inspired by an excellent choice of music. This is the first movie that made me login and rate it with a perfect 10!<br/><br/>Tarig"

","What a treat to see on DVD a film which I loved from the second it began with its tacky 70's style music. the boy is so innocent and his family irritated me at first but then i began to really understand what was going on. I thought the only bad thing was the cliché stuff with the people who interviewed Billy. Otherwise, fabulous. If Biritish movie were more like this I would go more to see them when they first come out. I am new to this experience and am trying to see films which are a bit different to the normal Hollywood stuff. I liked the feeling that I was able to recognise the world of Billy - it seemed familiar although I was brought up very conventionally. The photography was special and i absolutely adored the scenes at the end in the theatre. I cried. Lovely film."

","Somehow I fell into the trap that this film tackles. Prejudices against ninny ballet dancers. What could be great about an 11 year-old boy from straight British coal miners background who dreams of becoming the new Fred Astaire? But finally the DVD made its way to the player and I must confess I was electricised. The intensity of the acting as well as that of the pictures, the discrepancy between the lost coal miners hopes and the subtle positivism ingrained in the stubborn boy, the subtle humor, all lack of arrogance .... it just all matched. Well told story, straight to the heart without any ""kitsch"" - a pure pleasure to watch and receiving my full recommendation, even though this 2000 flic may not be one the front pages any more."
"Manoel Grob","10","7","8","18 January 2001"," YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE IT!
","The story is beautifully director by Stephen Daldry. Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) is, in my eyes, the best new comer of the year 2000 and Julie Walters performance as ballet teacher is brilliant. Stephen Daldry did what other directors can't bring to the screen with millions of dollars, a master piece! This movie has so much charm and emotions. It makes you cry, laugh and it makes you believe that ""we can touch the sky and beyond if we only believe in it."" This movie and it's sound track will blow you"

","When I first saw Billy Elliot I thought it was great! I really loved the environment and the outstanding performance by Jamie Bell! The second time, I thought it was even better! All the details and the story itself..and the expressions of Jamie as Billy, is really breathtaking! He deserves an Oscar for his performance!(!!!) and I think the movie itself is worth an Oscar for 'Best film', 'best actor(s)', 'best photo' and 'best director'!

"antoniotierno","9","6","7","26 March 2005"," heartwarming and charming
","It's absolutely undeniable that Jamie Bell has greatly acted and delivered a very charismatic performance, evoking laughters and tears at the same time; Billy Elliot works his way up to success after giving through the hardest times and situations a child could live in. Compared to other pictures shot in the Eighties and showing English plights of those years, this melodrama is better conceived and more engrossing for the way it tells of family life and dreams coming true. With everything considered it's genuinely intense and soulful, narrating emotions, changes and above all a story of struggle: struggle with losses of life, with biases, with public authorities and with sexuality."

","After seeing the many previews on cable television, I finally got the chance to tune in one night.  Well, I found this story to be extremely touching. I'm a HUGE fan of British movies, as boring as some of them may be, they enlighten me on how people live in the UK.  I found the character of Billy Elliot extremely funny and cute, and was happy to see that after so many trials and tribulations with his family, especially his father, they stood by him in the end and allowed him to achieve his dream.  Definitely worth renting if you're into British films."
"WalterFrith","Null","6","7","4 February 2001"," The British keep coming!
","What a gifted lot the English are for film production.  Their culture transforms life into art in the most tasteful ways and we are still feeling the effects 20 years later when 'Chariots of Fire' (1981) took home the best picture Oscar thus influencing many British filmmakers to mold their craft accordingly since then.  Jamie Bell and Julie Walters shine brightly as a youthful ballet student and his teacher.  Set in 1984, this film tells two stories just as emotionally.  The one involving Billy Elliot's quest to be a great dancer and the other involves his father and brother's struggle with their labour jobs in the midst of a miner's strike.  I felt almost every emotion possible watching this movie and director Stephen Daldry along with writer Lee Hall have made the most artistic looking film about the arts since Scott Hicks' 'Shine' in 1996.  'Billy Elliot' is again Oscar worthy material from the UK.  Cheers!"

"tonypeacock-1","7","2","2","23 June 2019"," Film instantly evoked memories of Ken Loach
","As the title of this review suggests this film quickly evoked comparisons to your typical Ken Loach film.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Daldry it follows the highly unlikely topic of ballet in a 1984 County Durham mining village in Northern England amidst the backdrop of the miners strike of the time.<br/><br/>That is one typical Loach trait. The left leaning political climate of the film.
The second is the older brother character to the lead Billy Elliot. It reminded me a little of the Jud character in the classic film Kes.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a young boy who instead of following the usual route of the local boxing gym ends up being taught ballet by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).<br/><br/>I have never been disappointed with a Walters performance to be fair. She just has this comedic, down to earth manner.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent soundtrack from the 1970s vinyl of the Elliot family, a bit of The Clash and 'London Calling'.<br/><br/>The film was the springboard for the acting career of a young Jamie Bell in the title role of Billy Elliot.
A commercial success leading to spin offs such as the customary musical show."

"x-x-ren-x-x","10","2","2","1 June 2008"," A very successful film.
","Billy Elliot is a heart-warming tale that brings out sadness, anger and laughter captivating the viewer throughout the whole film. There is an obvious musical, comedy and drama theme, as seen in The Full Monty and East is East, this makes it fun to watch and appealing to all ages. The poster used to promote the film is successful in setting the story, targeting all audiences while making it seem interesting. Jamie Bell plays Billy, a fiery, emotional and possibly confused character who is still grieving over the tragic death of his mother. The director, Stephen Daldry, was definitely looking for a 'raw talent' to play this diverse and intriguing young boy; seeing as Jamie had little acting experience and no dancing knowledge, he must have seemed perfect to play the role. All of the actors live up to expectations, especially Julie Walters who comes from the other end of the spectrum, being very popular and with years of experience. She fits into her character's personality instantly because she plays many 'motherly' roles, such as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince and Aunt Betsy Trotwood in David Copperfield. Daldry seems to enjoy producing or directing films in the drama genre, he directed The Reader and another short film Eight, which features the same kind of journey Billy Elliot undertakes; having to cope with the loss of a parent and discovering a new interest that changes their life. As well as this, Billy is constantly in disagreement with his father who deals with his grief in an extremely aggressive way. He is also involved in the miner's strike that severely affected the family's income and interferes with Billy's aspirations. The saddening situations make the viewer sympathise with Billy, and to a certain extent; his family.<br/><br/>Brian Tufano and his crew are very talented in deciding what camera angles and type of shots to use in certain scenes. For example; being able to portray emotions through angles of the camera and make a scene look better on camera than it does when filming. This is also enhanced by editing techniques used by John Wilson and the editorial team. They provide a gentle transition from one scene to another without losing the storyline and in some parts, the mood of particular scenes change so rapidly, the viewer is taken aback. Without editing, this film would not have been achieved to such a high standard and would not have been as successful in emphasising emotions and events. The colour also compliments the film and the period, with nothing too bright and the interiors of the houses typical to the 1980's with patterned wallpaper and frosted glass. Stephen Warbeck uses T.Rex's catchy 'I Love to Boogie' to begin the film. Other artists such as Stephen Gately, Eagle-Eye Cherry, The Clash, The Jam and The Style Council also feature in the film. Most of the sounds are diegetic, which enables the film to be more realistic to the audience; however, the few non-diegetic parts do not detract from the scenes. Set in the mid 1980's in a small estate with all families on a similar income, it reminds the people aged between the ages of 30 and 40 who may have experienced the affects of the minor strike had on the community. While appealing to the older audience, the story still interests teenagers, especially the youths who enjoy dance. There is a comical aspect to this film, for example, when Billy is attempting a 'pirouette' in the bathroom (to make sure his father doesn't find out about the ballet lessons) but fails miserably falling in the bath and soaking himself. In addition, Billy's friend, Michael Caffrey played by Stuart Wells, is discovered by Billy to be dressed up in his sister's clothes and putting make-up on, obviously hinting at his homosexuality. Billy is encouraged to attend boxing sessions by his father who had been taught that he needed to be masculine to get somewhere in the world, but this is something that Billy doesn't want to pursue. Julie Walters plays Mrs Wilkinson, an average but troubled ballet teacher who persuades Billy to join a class, something that Billy knew his father would be fuming about. Walter's character seems to be disappointed in herself for not being good enough to make a successful career in ballet, so she tries to channel that frustration through to her female students that simply don't have that spark of talent. However, Billy Elliot does show an indescribable something that she knows could take him to a future that she hoped for, but only with the right training. Because of this, she provides the role of a mother as well as a coach for Billy; this automatically makes the viewer have a respected opinion of her. All the characters, especially Julie Walters, perfected the language and accent that is needed to professionalise the film. This would have proved difficult to some who have had no experience of speaking in a Northeastern accent because it is such a vital aspect. Jamie Bell was at an advantage because he came from a similar area and already had the blunt and sometimes comic accent. However, it may be difficult for people who do not recognise this style of speech and they may not be able to relate to the film as well as people who are familiar with it. Despite some minor errors, the film was loved by the public, and praised by the critics. It shows that being a dancer is more difficult than first expected, and is in some ways deemed to be similar to the physically exhausting mining job his father does. In my opinion, Billy Elliot is an extremely successful film and many feel that it is 'the best British movie for years'."

","Brisk and sprightly movie about a little boy growing up in a working-class English village who wants to train for ballet, much to the displeasure of his dad.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell gives a tremendous performance as Billy, an angry youngster who doesn't understand why he should be ashamed of something he loves, particularly since that something gives him a means of expression for his juvenile frustration and anger. The other standout is Julie Walters, spectacular as Billy's firecracker of a dance instructor. A scene in which she and Billy dance together, giving wild vent to their love of the art form, is the film's highlight.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"mikeupd","9","3","4","22 July 2006"," Brilliant social commentary...
","This film must rank along with the 'angry young men' films of the 1960s for it's gritty subject material and portrayal. Set again the background/backdrop of working mens struggle to do the only job they have and the gradual acceptance of the family towards the sons ballet classes. This should be compulsory viewing for all those studying English/UK 20th Century social history along with many other gritty Northern England socio-documentary style films such as 'Brassed Off.' The Transporter Bridge at Middlesborough, a piece of wonderful engineering, gets a look in also. The old Newcastle 'National Express' coach station also shown. Such an emotional finale...

Because my friends and me are all university students and work closely to the field of social science, we really admire the excellent involvement and relation between and within the family members of Billy. With some minor changes and careful explanation, this film should be used as an educational purpose for young students to encourage them to find out their own hidden talent regardless to the negative effect of the world outside.

","There are so many things that could have gone terribly wrong with this film. It could have turned out as dreary, faux-realist prole-pornography. It could have turned out as a swooning paean on Northern English sensibility, replete with postcard cinematography. It could have turned out as a grimly activist protest against bourgeois conformism and capitalist oppression.<br/><br/>It turns out to be an aptly scored, superbly acted and strikingly shot masterpiece. Vividly edited and briskly plotted, we follow young Billy as he fumbles his boxing lessons and discovers ballet during the great miner's strikes in the 80s.<br/><br/>The inevitable tension that develops between Billy and his father is played out among a cast of memorable characters: Billy Fane's appearance as the seedy, misanthropic piano player is brief but hilarious; Julie Walters' rendition of the chain-smoking ballet teacher is simply iconic.<br/><br/>The depth and detail in this movie evoke countless bittersweet images: the way Billy's gritty neighbourhood is framed so as to show the majestic and tranquil sea in the distance, glistening with Olympian indifference; the menacing, surreal omnipresence of authority in the form of the British police force; the dignified despair of a town library which has been relegated to a mobile home.<br/><br/>Unprepossessed, humorous and genuinely moving."

","""Billy Elliot"" is truly an excellent motion picture. It has virtually all of the elements of what I expect in a fine film: great characters played with care by wonderful actors cast appropriately, a great director (in his first major effort), a moving plot set off by a number of very strong subplots, a striking new leading actor (and superb dancer) in the person of young Jamie, a gritty realism nicely moderated by fine touches of humor, and so much more.  But rather than say anything more about it, I strongly urge all film lovers to see ""Billy Elliot,"" and on the big screen if possible.  Even if it doesn't have many killings, explosions, bad guys and so on, it does have about everything I look for in a great motion picture!"

"xxitalianxx","Null","4","6","9 May 2006"," Billy Elliott
","After seeing Billy Elliot it was very obvious people who not accept the fact of a boy wanting to dance. It is hard to hide things from your parents and family, especially when it's not something illegal or wrong.<br/><br/>It upset me to see someone really enjoy doing something but not be able to tell anyone about it. He worked hard with his teacher to be good. One scene I recall the most was when his father found out and then his brother did as well and Tony wanted to beat him up for dancing. I think he was afraid that if anyone found out his brother enjoyed dancing people would look at him differently and ruin his reputation as well. He would think that people would think he was ""gay"".<br/><br/>Julie Walters played a great character Mrs. Wilkison. She agreed with Billy wanting to dance and she was good about hiding it from his family. But everyone had a break point; Mrs. Wilkison couldn't let such good talent go to waste. She approached Billy's father about it and told him how he was a great dancer. He then told her to stay away from him and he could no longer dance. That didn't stop the two. They kept practicing, even harder then before.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie was Christmas night, Billy took his friend to he place that he dances at. In this scene Billy's father and the owner of that gym walked in on him dancing for his friend. At first we get the impression that he is going to be mad at Billy. Later we find he turns his way of thinking and supports Billy and him wanting to dance. At the end of the movie we see Billy in a dance recital and his brother and father watching him proudly.<br/><br/>It takes a lot for outsiders to think he wasn't gay. But it all comes down to the people that matters don't mind, and those who mind don't matter!"

The film isn't tugging at your heartstrings because it is far too clever for that.<br/><br/>**SPOILER** It's well worth watching the film just for the last five minutes, when the camera pans to the father at the same time as Billy is preparing to do his debut show (in Covent Garden) and the music blasts out VERY LOUDLY. You see his father swallow a lump in his throat, and his breath catch, and if you don't cry at this part, then there's something wrong with you :)<br/><br/>Amazing. Beautiful. Real. Touching.

","Do you ever wonder if other people saw the same movie as you? A friend of mine dismissed this film as trite, manipulative and shallow. He hated it and said it was offensive to gay people. I don't get that at all.<br/><br/>
I really enjoyed this movie. I don't care that the story line was trite or that the ending was obvious, it made me feel good. I loved the characters, and I felt they grew in the film. They were complex and flawed but interesting. Even though you may have seen the plot before, it may be hackneyed or even cliched, the people in the film are real.<br/><br/>
For me, this was, at least in part, a film about relationships. The dynamics of the family under pressure are beautifully portrayed. I empathised so much with the brother as he tries to say goodbye to Billy but can't be heard, and the father as he prepares to abandon his principles to give his son a chance. Those moments were simple realisations of the deep feelings that are too hard to express and were deeply moving (I nearly blubbed).<br/><br/>But the film isn't all girly. Its funny, bloody hilarious in places. Its the way I remember being 11. (Except I would never dance. Never. Real men don't. Ever.)<br/><br/>I would love to argue every negative point that other reviewers have made. Except one. The last scenes...<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone."
"jotix100","7","2","3","21 November 2008"," Coal miner's son
","Can a boy from a macho background overcome all obstacles and go to be a star in the Royal Ballet company? Well, that is the premise of this feel good film that we saw when it first came out, but didn't comment. Watching it for a second time, recently, didn't produce the same effect as when initially seen on the big screen. Something was lost, but it is still an inspirational story.<br/><br/>Billy, a young boy from a poor background in the coal country in the North of England, realizes he has a passion for dancing. Since he doesn't know how to channel his desire for becoming a classic dancer, he has to get all the help he can get. With the guidance of Mrs. Wilkinson, a local dance coach, Billy finds the inspiration he needs to go on into that world, so foreign to a young boy of his class.<br/><br/>In a way, we couldn't help comparing ""Billy Elliot"" to ""Educating Rita"", not that they are similar in any shape, or form. Maybe the presence of the irrepressible Julie Walters, who appears in this case as the teacher, was the link and the basis of comparison. Her work in the film doesn't dominate the action, but her contribution to the overall success of it is an undeniable factor. Young Jamie Bell endears himself to the audience with his take on the would be dancer that wants to expand his own talent.<br/><br/>Stephen Daltry directed with panache the screenplay by Lee Hall. Mr. Daltry's work with the two principals wins us over. This small film couldn't have worked as a Hollywood production, which probably would have blown the action out of proportion and would have turned the story into something else."
"Mr. Hand-6","8","2","3","16 December 2000"," Good
","A movie with characters and a story that you can imagine to be real. To begin with the bad, the story is a bit simple at some points. I find it difficult to express what I mean because English is not my native language. Cliché would be to harsh a word. Perhaps an example: When a certain ballet was to appear in the plot, did it have to be most famous off all times, Swan Lake?<br/><br/>But overall I liked the movie so much that I tend to think this is perhaps just the amount of simplification or even cliché you have to do in a movie. Maybe it is difficult to capture more of real life in a movie without getting to complicated or boring.<br/><br/>I liked very much the way the characters appeared like real people. They aren't rich, they have problems that remain unsolved, they even dare to look ugly on the screen. Watch the way young Billy's dancing looks clumsy most times, though the whole movie is about his talent to become a dancer. But this is just what you would expect in an eleven years old boy. It looks true. I felt the same about several other British movies of the recent years, for example Trainspotting or The Full Monty. I like that style. It is a pleasant contrast to the endless stream of Hollywood productions where every one looks as if he or she had just stepped out of a fashion advertisement.<br/><br/>Though I have complained above about weaknesses of the story, it has still well enough interesting parts. Watch the way Billy reacts to the homosexual feelings that his friend Michael has towards him. I think the acting of both boys is quiet good.<br/><br/>To me it was a touching movie, particularly the way Billy's father and brother respect Billy's wishes although at first they seem to treat him rough. I admit the ending brought some tears into my eyes. An 8 and a movie I would like to see again."

As a teacher, not of ballet, but of mathematics, I have actually dealt with parents who did not want their daughters to be TOO academically inclined.  The same thing happens in reverse with Billy.  He is torn between pleasing or hating his family because of his wish to dance and their distaste and repugnance for this desire in a boy.  Every actor in this film plays his/her role to perfection.

It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a ""Billy"". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles. He deserves it, his acting is golden. 10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance."

","In my opinion ""Billy Elliot"" is a touching movie that motivates the audience to cogitate. The message of the movie ""Billy Elliot"" is that although you haven't got money you can realize your dream. Furthermore this movie is informative as it points out you should never give up despite a huge number of people who don't believe in you.<br/><br/>The setting is a coal mining area in Great Britain with the history background of a strike against the closing of the coal mines that brings penury in the area. <br/><br/>I guess the most important message of this movie is that even if the worst circumstances control, a marvel is possible. For this reason I could watch the movie more times. It is so fascinating that this young boy didn't capitulate although his father, his brother and all the others first deem him gay. <br/><br/>A very important scene is the gathering in which Billy's father and his brother try to collect money for Billy due to the fact that Tony really stands up for his brother for the first time. In this moment Tony doesn't care what the others could think. Till then the strong brotherly feelings for Villy didn't become apparent. However now the audience see that Billy can count on his brother Tony.<br/><br/>The only aspect I was bothered by was the music in the beginning of the movie. It was too loud to understand Billy's voice. But all in all it is an excellent movie."

","I introduce this movie. The movie is very great everything of movie. Billy tries to overcome his father's disappointment about ballet dance. Billy's father joined a demonstration of employee of coal mining industry. Billy's father thinks ballet is a girl's dance and boxing is boy's sports. Billy's dancing overcame the dissension of his father. Finally, Billy was able to enter national ballet school. During Billy's audition into the school, the Interviewer's questioned Billy. ""What do you feel like when you are dancing?"" Billy said ""So good I forgot everything and then flying like a bird"" I was impressed by the scene. I don't know 1984 of England, but I seem to be know a little more about England. I felt wonderful that the boy move forward in his dream.

","How interesting could a movie about a boy who gives up boxing to become a ballet dancer be? Actually, the answer is - very! This took me by surprise. It's well acted and well written, and presents an interesting look not just at Billy's (Jamie Bell) struggle to succeed in ballet but also a good historical overview of the Coal Miner's strike during the Thatcher era from the perspective of an affected family (Billy's.) Billy's widowed father Gary Lewis and brother Jamie Draven are striking miners, and neither are interested in having a ballet dancing ""puff"" in the family. We get to watch their attitudes change, however, as both realize that ballet could be Billy's ticket out of the wretched life they've been forced to lead.<br/><br/>This truly was a pleasure to watch.

Newcomer Jamie Bell is definitely no acting `ding dong.' He just might dance away with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Also, Julie Walters, who plays the chain smoking ballet instructor, might just waltz away with a Best Supporting Actress nomination herself. `Billy Elliot' did have a few falls though.

It's a typical British film, and I mean that in the best way possible. Brilliant actors, a great story, great production design (feels like you're there), great direction, sadness and jokes and that special mood and tone of a British comedy/drama.

","This film is about Liberation in the most fundamental sense. The story of one proletarian boy's struggle to just begin to develop amazing natural gifts is brilliantly told. The viewer is shown the objective and subjective (verging on production numbers) realities of a conflicted and dominated child with seamless grace. Amazingly, the film deals with BIG issues very effectively by using the various vignettes in Billy's life. We are allowed to see things through the less cluttered child's eyes. Jamie Bell is himself a talented boy and simply IS the title role. Julie Walters, whom I will always see as the uneducated Rita, was a natural for her role. Gary Lewis, as the collier dad,  was able to keep his potentially dastardly character from being a bad guy. Jamie Draven, as Billy's much older brother, captured the conflicts in his relationships extremely well. For me, Jean Heywood's farewell to Billy was a crystal revelation of what this Elliot family was all about. I cried, as I always do when a film captures the emotional fullness of a subject. The film is about class. The film is about talent. The film is about the unscarred beauty of youth. The film is about the victory of honesty and love. So, go see it and bring a handkerchief."

","I finally saw this film last night and after reading some of the previous comments here, decided to add my own take on the film.  Folks, if you can't stand some straight-forward messages, then don't bother watching movies at all.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy a feel-good movie with realistic characters, then Billy Elliot is the one for you.  The final sequence of the film is spectacular.  Someone else mentioned that they couldn't understand how an 11-year-old boy could have angst.  Hey, try losing your mother (who sounds like one of the few people who understood Billy) at age 10 or 11 while your father and brother are distant and unsympathetic--and then see if you might not have a little angst, too!  I thought that the young boy who plays Billy did a marvelous job in his portrayal--we need to see more of him in the future!"

"Buddy-51","Null","1","1","14 July 2001"," wonderful feel-good film
","`Billy Elliot,' one of 2000's best films, is far more than just the typical coming-of-age story.  It is a paean to all of us who have, at one time or another, felt ourselves to be `different' from society as a whole (and who among us, in moments of quiet honesty, would deny feeling this way at some time or other in our lives?).  `Billy Elliot' takes us back to that time in our lives  early adolescence - when we are just beginning to experience the manifold wonders of the world, when we are just beginning to explore those things which makes us feel good, and when we are just starting that long process of self-discovery that will ultimately define who we are and what we love.  Such a journey can be an easy one if, for instance, that thing that we choose to love happens to be socially acceptable  i.e. football for boys or cooking for girls  but what if it isn't?  What if, say, the focus of attention for a young boy growing up in a poor English mining town happens to be ballet dancing?  Then growing up and staying true to oneself suddenly become all that more challenging.  If for no other reason, `Billy Elliot' deserves credit for tackling and illuminating the tricky and sometimes uncomfortable subject of adolescent gender-bending.<br/><br/>Billy is an 11-year old boy whose life provides little opportunity for warmth or joy.  His father and brother are striking miners, his beloved mother has recently passed away and his maternal grandmother struggles with the disorientation that comes with advancing senility.  The one ray of light in Billy's otherwise drab, humorless life is his fascination with the ballet class that meets in the same gym where he is supposed to be receiving his boxing lessons.   One of the great joys of `Billy Elliot' comes in these early scenes as we see Billy going to enormous lengths to hide the truth of his activities, secreting his dancing shoes under his mattress or inside his trousers or absconding with a book on dancing from a local book mobile etc. Who among us can fail to identify with this sense that, if others discovered what we REALLY loved, we would quickly become a pariah, a misfit, an outcast?  Haven't we all, at some time or other, secretly hidden objects that meant the world to us but that others just wouldn't understand if they saw we had them?  Well, `Billy Elliot' reminds us that it is okay to be different, that indeed pursuing our goal  whatever it is  is the single most important step to achieving personal happiness.<br/><br/>In terms of plotting, there is not really much that is new here.  The conflict-ridden lower class family, the recently dead mother, the feisty, sympathetic teacher who places all her faith in her young pupil, the initial reluctance on the part of the family and the community to accept Billy's dream and their ultimately yielding to his wishes  these are all elements we have seen in films before.  Yet, somehow, `Billy Elliot' never seems clichéd or derivative, partly because writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry get the details of character and setting so right and partly because Jamie Bell delivers such a luminous, naturalistic performance as Billy. Thanks to Bell's subtle underplaying, Billy never comes across as precious or precocious.  He is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary gift who is not afraid to ultimately stand up and defend his own originality.  As the ballet instructor, Julie Walters conveys just the right combination of firm determination and openhearted compassion to make her a believable inspiration to her young charge.  Gary Lewis, Jamie Draven and Jean Heywood are all excellent as Billy's father, brother and grandmother respectively. <br/><br/>
The term `feel good movie' is often the kiss of death when it comes to encouraging the less sentimentally inclined among us to check out a film. But `Billy Elliot' really is a movie that could serve a salutary purpose. If it inspires even one parent to allow a child to fulfill his or her dream  regardless of what it happens to be  it may be one of those rare films that actually does some good in the world.  Not bad for a little independent charmer like this one."

","The much lauded and nominated film ""Billy Elliott"" is a slice of life flick about an 11 year old English boy who, to the dismay of his motherless working class coal mining family, chooses ballet over boxing as a pastime. The film is technically excellent, artistically well done, and follows the traditions of Hollywood film-making. The story is a pleasant mix of humor and pathos, not too deep, and palatable enough to make it an audience favorite. In addition to being just plain fun to watch, ""BE"" makes a few points about accepting people for who they are; about the undeniability of innate passion by artists; and about the sublimation of aggression through dance. Not a classic and somewhat over rated, the simple numbers prove ""BE"" is a box office favorite and an enjoyable watch for most.

","""Billy Elliot"" isn't about a boy wanting to dance. It isn't about a miners' strike in the mid-1980s. These are only the elements which happen to be chose to tell this story. The story is about finding beauty in the world, finding it despite the chaos and conformity that surrounds youth.<br/><br/>Billy, through the course of the movie, struggles to find his own direction in life at a very young age. It's quite easy to understand this because of the choices of setting and character made for the sake of the story.<br/><br/>Billy is relatively young, making him subject to the pressures of his father and older brother. The time and place of the story, with police riot squads being a fixture on the streets, underscores the difficulty in being drawn to ballet, an activity not considered fitting among his family and peers. Still he pursues his passion.<br/><br/>The performances paint the picture perfectly. They are convincing and compelling renditions of the characters in this light, enjoyable drama."
"bob the moo","Null","3","6","9 January 2003"," Over-hyped but a low-key effective story about being true to ones self
","While his father and older brother are involved in the miner's strikes, Billy is still at school. When the ballet class has to share a room with Billy's boxing club he becomes interested in the class and joins it secretly.  When his family find out they go spare and stop him going, but Billy meets secretly with his teacher Mrs Wilkinson and continues. Eventually Mrs Wilkinson decides Billy may be good enough for auditioning for the Royal Ballet School in London  but how can he do it without his father's permission?<br/><br/>It seems that any British film that isn't rubbish gets hyped up and spread all over the place like the new Messiah.  Billy Elliot was one such film and it suffers a little from the weight of expectation this puts on it's shoulders.  Like many recent British hits, this is a low-key story that is a slow burn rather than a Hollywood `wow' film that needs to be hyped up because it's all about spectacle and not story.  Here the focus is all on the simple theme of `to one's self be true' (just like Babe!).  The plot develops slowly, sounds simple but encompasses the miner's strikes etc in compliment to the central tale.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is not in the telling but in the characters.  They are allowed time to develop and they change in ways that would be comical if they were just one-dimensional but, because they are fuller people we believe them and are taken in by them.  It's not flawless and some of the characters are a little weak  Billy's cross-dressing friend is a little too heavy in the film's `be yourself' message.<br/><br/>The acting is all very good.  Bell is excellent as Billy  bringing out the anger, freedom and bashfulness.  Lewis as his father and Draven as the brother are better in some ways as they must keep their emotions just visible under masculinity, only letting them out occasionally.  www is OK and does her usual working class routine that she does so well, but Bell is easily the best, holding our attention effortlessly.<br/><br/>Overall this film suffered from being overhyped to the point that most people expected to be totally blown away.  It isn't like that  it's more a slow, simple story that will involve you bit by bit so that you're fully involved for the low-key emotional finish."

The best lesson one can learn from this film is that one should strive to achieve what one has in mind instead of crumbling under pressure. Billy Elliot is a fine film which will surely appeal to all but it has also its share of some minor glitches.The fact that it is too British might be seen as an impediment for those viewers who crave for universal themes without any notion of national identity."

"themush01","Null","2","4","10 May 2006"," read my comment for my summary on this movie
","After seeing Billy Elliot it was very obvious that not everyone was willing to accept the fact that a boy would rather dance ballet then box with the other boys. Billy had a hard time dealing with his new love for ballet at first and tried to hide his new passion from his father and family. This became more of a problem once his family did find out but Billy kept practicing and wanting to learn more and more about ballet.<br/><br/>It is upsetting to see someone who really enjoys doing something but is not able to tell anyone about it. Billy worked hard with his ballet instructor to be good. One scene that stands out the most was when his father and brother found out about his new love for ballet. His brother Tony, wanted to beat him up for dancing. Tony was afraid that if anyone found out his brother enjoyed dancing people would look at him differently and ruin his reputation as well. Tony knew that people would think that Billy was gay. <br/><br/>Julie Walters played a great character Mrs. Wilkison. She agreed with Billy wanting to dance and she was good about hiding it from his family. But everyone had a break point; Mrs. Wilkison couldn't let such good talent go to waste. She approached Billy's father about it and told him how he was a great dancer. He then told her to stay away from him and he could no longer dance. That didn't stop the two. They kept practicing, even harder then before.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie was Christmas night, Billy took his friend to he place that he dances at. In this scene Billy's father and the owner of that gym walked in on him dancing for his friend. Billy was running around doing ballet moves that he had learned and throwing in some tap and other dance moves that he had thought up and came out naturally. At first the viewers get the impression that he is going to be mad at Billy. But later it turns out that he supports Billy and wants him to continue to dance. He wants him to go to that special school that his instructor had told him about. At the end of the movie we see Billy in a dance recital and his brother and father watching him proudly.<br/><br/>It is hard to overcome caring what other people think about you especially when you are young. For Billy he still stayed devoted to ballet despite what others thought about him. He followed his heart and went after his dream. Overall this was an amazing voice and I would highly recommend to anyone for either enjoyment or for learning about dance."

The setting is a depressing, dull (both in weather and in environment) area which feels suffocating just to watch and the characters are all working class who have no real future prospects and are forever stuck in a rut. It makes me wonder if all foreigners see the British like this.<br/><br/>That said, Jamie Bell delivered an excellent performance and it's easy to see he is destined for a career in acting if he plays his cards right.

Billy Elliot-played brilliantly by Jamie Bell-is supposed to learn to box but secretly chooses ballet with the girls. The film is unsentimental and inspiring especially when Billy finally dances in front of his father and the old man loosens up. Billy describes how dancing feels to him: ""I feel a change in my whole body. And I've got this fire in my body. I'm just there. Flying like a bird. Like electricity."" The music score is brilliantly chosen and ranges from T. Rex to Tchaikovsky. This is the original (released under the title Dancer) that inspired a musical version of the film in England in 2005 that led to the Broadway production, which cost $18 million to produce, over three times as much as the original film's budget.

","What can I say? This film is a beautiful, passionate project built with heart and honesty. It is not solely focused on the human aspect but there are also political undertones that help shape the troubling context Billy Elliot is set in. Billy is played brilliantly by Jamie Bell, who like any of us, merely starts observing something out of curiosity and slowly feels that electrifying spark that ignites our interests and turns them to passion for something. His passion for dancing, is somehow frawned upon by conventional society, and specially those close to Billy, like his father and brother.<br/><br/>Being a young boy, is hard to go against his father in pursuit of what he really loves doing, so to help him smooth things out is his dancing teacher, so convincingly played by Julie Walters. The film is stunningly shot, so straightforward and transparent, almost exuding sincerity.<br/><br/>Not only does it shine in terms of what it evokes but also how Billy's own struggle is shown. He's a troubled boy because he is not allowed to pursue his dreams, he wants to dance because that's what makes him feel alive and talented, as he becomes great at it.<br/><br/>A truly inspirational film, with a story destined to move you through its journey and resolution."

"sol-","Null","0","0","3 December 2017"," Dancer in the Light
","Passionate about dance, a teenage boy secretly attends ballet classes and has deal with his father discovering his secret in this British drama starring Jamie Bell. The film may only have the most obvious of messages to offer in terms of the virtues of individualism and the hurtfulness of gender stereotypes, but it still leaves quite an impact with Bell in strong form. Bell has his own prejudices that he learns to deal with, fighting his own preconceptions that all other boys who do ballet are ""bent"" and Bell gives us a multi-dimensional character with a love for dance that resonates but also much internal anger. Julie Walters is equally as impressive as his spunky ballet teacher and they really carry the film. The less said about Bell's father, the better though. His father changes so quickly from being against ballet to in favour of it that the progression never rings true. The film has some crafty moments though in which the father's difficulties with work and participation in demonstrations are edited against Bell dancing. More could have probably been made of Bell emerging from such working class origins, but the film has plenty to like as it is with its celebration of dance as something that boys and girls can both succeed at."

","This is one of the only feature films I've seen that is about kids but not geared for kids (the only other that comes to mind is Stand By Me). This sort of combination is found a lot in independent shorts, and it just goes to show how kids are forced into an unkind world well before most of their parents would wish them to. It's unfortunate, because this portrays a child's journey of following his dreams pretty realistically in my opinion, whereas a movie with a lower MPAA rating would give a more romantic take on it and be ""kid friendly"" but also potentially misleading.<br/><br/>What the movie does a very nice job of that I am only realizing now is how it shows the way that ballet affects Billy's life. Ballet changes *what* Billy is, not *who* he is-- his life views and his circumstances, yes, but not who he is as at his core. Ballet, his previously undiscovered passion, gives him something to confirm his identity with, but does not bring about any great changes within him on a emotional or moral level. Instead, it brings about change in those around him and gives them a new perspective and hope, namely his dad. <br/><br/>The relationship between Billy and his dad was a little shakier. There's a common belief among screenwriters that third act problems originate in the first act, and I think that holds true here. Billy and his dad's relationship seems like it begins right when the movie does, which may be true given the recent death of Billy's mother. The only things that were used to establish their dynamic were social norms, which is not intrinsically bad, but immediate family members don't relate to each other based solely on social norms no matter how non-existent their relationship is. I don't want to totally bash the father-son portrayal here, because it actually avoids most of the common and annoying tropes that come with such movies. But there was definitely a foundation missing.<br/><br/>It was surprisingly entertaining to see Billy discovering his love of dancing. Jamie Bell owns his performance in this respect, conveying an unashamed love of dance without coming off as a ""poof"". As a young man who has had many passion hobbies (one of which is analyzing movies), I could see a lot of parallels between my own experiences and those of Billy becoming a dancer. It begins with some uncertainty as to whether he likes it and whether he's any good at it, then a fear of whether he wants to identify with his new passion, then embracing ballet internally while hiding it from those close to him. Granted, my own hobbies have not been met with such resistance as Billy's but there's always a bit of a fear that they will.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone over 13 seeing this. Yes, there's a lot of language, but trust me, it's nothing a 13 year old hasn't heard. The same goes for the homosexual motifs. There are things about it that I think could have been better, but it was pretty good overall with some great emotional themes and an innocent undertone amidst hopeless circumstances. Overall Rating: 8/10."

","What a moving, cute, funny, political, sensitive movie! Since the very first scene sequence spectators notice that this will not be an ordinary film. Cinematography is great, it is perfectly edited, actors do an amazing job (Jamie Bell is awesome in the leading role, but how not to also highlight Gary Lewis's performance as his father, or Julie Walters's as his ballet teacher, or Jean Heywood's as grandma?). It is much more than a dance film, as people usually refer themselves to it. It deals with many complex elements together, such as English working class, British politics under Thatcherism (with miners on strike and violent police repression), complicated family relations, gender conventional roles, sexuality, prejudice, cosmopolitanism vs. provincialism, and boxing as the archetypal lower class sport."

","Set against the backdrop of the strikes at the UK's mines, young boy Billy Elliott discovers his love for dance. He finds opposition within his dysfunctional family but the love isn't set to die out.<br/><br/>The most remarkable of this entertaining movie is the young protagonist's (Jamie Bell) performance. It stands out to the others' more hesitant portrayals of struggling individuals.<br/><br/>The emotional evolutions the characters undergo sometimes lack credibility. However, it is compensated by the creative depiction of the raw reality of the UK's 1980s. <br/><br/>Another strong point is that the film takes the children's point of view. Often insecure, they try to cope with the big and small things in life. At the same time, the adults around them display emotional struggle as they haven't managed to cope.<br/><br/>This is no movie for children, despite the character's young age. Interesting themes as family, hopes, unprocessed emotions are mixed together in this enjoyable feel-good movie."

Billy's father think ballet is for girls, but actually, ballet needs boys and girls. Ballet duet dance is that boys and girls dance together. Some people don't know about ballet well. Third, family love. After Billy's family agree with Billy dancing ballet, father cooperates with Billy, and helps and cheers up Billy. All members of Billy's family wait for the result.

","The character development and Bell's acting were really superb. The film was well made and edited as it perfectly captured the struggles that Billy face and takes the audience along on the ride that is his life. Bell too, accurately showed his character's frustrations and inability to stop dancing as the passion burned in him.<br/><br/>The acting from the other actors and actresses were pretty good, though I would have to say not on par with Bell's. They got into their characters well enough, however it felt awkward at times, especially when Lewis as Elliot's father was trying to act really angry, it felt staged to me.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors felt really real. Elliot's friendship with Michael was so sweet that I almost died inside. Elliot's relationship with the rest of the characters too, was well displayed.<br/><br/>The dancing element to this was really cool; Bell can really dance. I liked that the dancing was incorporated into all kinds of scenes as it enhanced the different moods being displayed. The ending though did not have a lot of dancing, was a great way to end.<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that the film is based on how boys should not do 'girly' stuff like ballet, and instead should do 'manly' stuff like football and whatnot. Take those gender stereotypes and gender intensification, and stuff it somewhere else.<br/><br/>One down side to this story though, was that I did not really get what was happening in the community except that there was a strike. I was a bit unsure as to what the father and brother were doing, and why they didn't really get along with Billy. That was a bit shaky to me.<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com"

","Every human has goals they hope to achieve in their lifetime and in Stephen Daldry's ""Billy Elliot"" we come across a character named Billy Elliot who's goal as an eleven year-old boy is to dance in a ballet class and at a high ranking school. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) has a difficult life by dealing with his harsh father (Gary Lewis), his mean brother (Jamie Draven) the death of his mother who he was very close to and living in a working class town who is not accepting of Billy's dance. One day at school young Billy encounters a ballet class with all girls and joins the class. His teacher Mrs.Wilkinson (Julie Walters) pushes Billy to be great but also forms a sweet relationship with him and serves as a mother figure. Billy shoots for the stars in trying to get acceptance into a royal dance school but more importantly tries to win the love of his family. This is based on the Broadway play that was a huge hit and as a film it is wonderful. At times I felt certain scenes were unnecessary but in the end I was very satisfied with how Billy's relationships turned out and the choices he made. This film shows a more harsh look at the difficulties in achieving your dreams rather than just everything always working out like in some interpretations of this subject matter. The setting of a blue collar English town is very believable and shows how different people are everywhere and how sometimes accepting change in someone can brighten your life. The relationship between Billy and his family is something I found very moving. The turning points with his father and brother are not just randomly occurring but take time to adjust to. I particularly found Julie Walters' character as Mrs.Wilkinson very helpful to the story. She shows the side of a struggling human just like Billy. That helps them bond. Jamie Bell as a young kid does fine work here and most adults I feel can relate to him even as he is a kid. Stephen Daldry directs this film is a decent fashion, but I feel it could have had better shots and a sadder darker mood more often to really emphasize Billy's struggle. It just seems to happy. The ending he handles beautifully. ""Billy Elliot"" is a film in which it wants you to ask yourself what is holding you back in life and what you can do to change it."

","Billy Elliot is one of the truly outstanding creative work of art by BBC Films. The movie is a heartwarming crowd-pleaser.One has to truly appreciate the performance of Jamie Bell as Billy Elliot. The most memorable part of the movie are the characters especially Billy's Dad. Billy Elliot is exactly what you expect from BBC films and Arts Council of England. There is no need for an in-depth analysis of the subtle plot, because there is not one present. But the movie excels in portraying the struggle of miner's union against Margret Thatcher's Government. A Great Movie with a great characters and I absolutely loved the use of songs by T-Rex."

","The film that started it all...well for this particular franchise/story that is. One of many films that has become a great success and followed on with even greater success as a musical theatrical production. I think this film may have been one of the first to kick start that trend as it were, can't quite remember.<br/><br/>The tale of a humble miners son whose aspirations to become a male ballet dancer are frowned upon by his blue collar father and similar blue collar brother. Set in north eastern England around 1984-85 during the miners strikes against a powerful Thatcher led Conservative regime...errr I mean government. Billy is destined to become a miner like his older brother and father and is pretty much forced to take part in boxing at school by his father. His dad obviously wants more for his boy with the possibility of boxing but he knows the pit beckons.<br/><br/>On the other hand Billy discovers his love for dancing in ballet and wants to follow that path. Naturally this disgusts his strong proud father and gets him into trouble for disobeying. The whole plot could be the tale of many many northern born men within England at any point in time really. I have lived up north in the UK and it can indeed be a bit bleak with little job prospects for youngsters (no offence to the north). <br/><br/>The whole film is one big stereotype really, but a very real and truthful stereotype. Billy's tough working father is a typical northern bloke who likes beer boxing and a good plate of drippin' sandwiches. The area they live in is of course very working class with small terrace housing along steep hills and flatcaps everywhere and the general attitude of all the men is somewhat old fashioned. Boys partake in football rugby and boxing, girls do ballet and sewing, there is no middle ground...dare I say homophobia is lightly touched upon too.<br/><br/>I am exaggerating yes? well not really, as I said I've lived up north for many years and in some areas this is exactly what its like to this day. Thinking back to 1984-85 it would have been ten times worse!.<br/><br/>The main crux of the story is Billy's struggle against 'the norm' and his fathers rules. He wants to be a ballet dancer, his school dance teacher thinks he's good enough but the money isn't there to fund it any further and his father hates the fact his boy might be a sissy. I think many people will be able to relate to this story as I said, but not just with dancing, with many areas. The scenes where Billy fights against his dad are naturally emotionally strong and really hooked me. There are many scenes where Billy gets into trouble by playing with his homosexual friend whom he doesn't understand is homosexual, not going to boxing lessons, going to ballet lessons and the intense strike sequences which are all terrifically acted out and really sucked me into the moment.<br/><br/>The moments of spontaneous dance from Billy are really cool to watch, I really found myself wanting to dance too, yeah maybe I can do what Billy does!. Every character is wonderfully portrayed, Bell is a little bit too full of himself at times, a bit too eager to please by over acting perhaps but he's certainly fun to watch. The only character I thought was maybe a bit off was Billy's dad played by Gary Lewis. I really thought this character needed to be much harsher, stricter, he was tough but I didn't really fear him or his rule. I'm not saying there should have been nasty beatings but he just didn't sell the gruff northerner aspect to me despite the fact he's Scottish. I think the fact he is actually Scottish (and in the film it seems) means he doesn't have the REAL English northerner spirit inside him, unlike a real Geordie, Yorkshireman, Mackem etc...<br/><br/>The build up to the finale is quite moving and did pull on my heart strings I can't deny. Its all very cliché but it damn well works...damn it!. The whole notion of anyone trying to simply make their father/mother proud by their good actions or dedication to something is a warm path to tread and guaranteed hanky dampener at the movies. Again many will be able to relate to the lovely final curtain sequence as Billy finally shows his family what he has achieved, it does put a lump in your throat and made me wish I could do the same with my own father.<br/><br/>I think you will get more out of this film being British and knowing of the north south divide and stereotypical views within the UK. I think if you live up north then you will certainly know the vibe this film gives off and will be able to relate and hopefully enjoy. It can be a feel good film but at the same time it can also be a slightly depressing film on various aspects...the miners strikes, being on the breadline, the grim north and being a youngster trying to break out of a situation. In the end the film is a joy to watch and should leave you upbeat. I hope I have not upset any of my northern countrymen, my dad is a Yorkshireman born n bred so I have experience ^_^<br/><br/>9/10"

","As i was told of that my class would be watching the movie Billy Elliot is was not impressed, the thought of watching a movie for nearly two hours about a young boy living in a struggling town who strays away from what a normal boy of his time would do and take up ballet did not appeal to me. As the movie started i was very optimistic about whether i should turn my head away and gaze at the schools harbour views or sit there starring at the projector in front of me not knowing what i should expect. Surprisingly as the movie went on and i knew more deeply about what the characters situations were i became like what i was seeing. I was fascinated by what was happening to all of the miners in the town and the struggles they faced in getting food on the table for their families, but when Billy decided to continue to do ballet without his father knowing i knew i had to continue watching. The film engaged me in listening to the characters and knowing what they felt. I wanted to know what Mrs. Wilkinson was feeling as she realized what great talent billy had and i also wanted to know what was going to happen once Billy's father had found out and what Mrs. Wilkinson did to try and keep billy at the ballet lessons. When his father finally let go of his emotions towards Billy's going to ballet and excepted him for it on the cold Christmas night it was great to watch. When Billy's dad chose to boycott the strike and go back to work it showed how much love he had for his son and knew that if ballet was truly what Billy wanted to do he would not stop him. I believe the film Billy Elliot is great in showing that it is okay to go away from the typical gender stereotypes and to do what you love with out worrying about anyone else. JOEL CAMBOURNE"

In the end, last scene when both Billys best friend from when they where young and Billys dad is watching him dancing the swan lake on the ballet is perfect. And I hope that my children and your children will watch this when they are the same age as me. Because this history is brilliant.

","I remember when this came out and the adults around me were crazy about it. Unfortunately, I was only aware of the negative reputation the film had, I didn't realize this was a much grittier social commentary. The centrepiece of Billy Elliot are the performances, Jamie Bell is especially impressive for his age and perfectly expresses anguish and frustration. Julie Walters is charming and her scenes with Bell are a delight but the true underrated star is Gary Lewis, Billy's Dad, whose subtle performance is fascinating and incredible. It's a film with great production design too, as though Ken Loach went to Hollywood. Unfortunately, its problems lie with the screenplay, with rushed and brief development and a few too many montages. It struggles to establish things properly and develop things. When Billy was finally doing ballet, I didn't understand why, and it was a moment they saved for the climax that should have come to light immediately. It does have a few great movie magic moments as Billy defiantly dances in front of his father, but once his father came to believe in Billy, there felt little left to resolve to escalate on top of that. It does have a great soundtrack though, awesome use of ""London Calling."" Still better than I expected.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Nobody would understand better what it's like to sort of skirt the line between 'manly' and 'puff' better than Stephen Daldry, who goes by 'gay' despite being happily married to a woman and father to a daughter. He's as gay as he is straight, and in reality, it's like this: he likes what he likes. This film seems an extension of that: the lead (Jamie Bell, in a wonderfully nuanced young adult performance), is just a boy with a lot of energy who finds he's better at channeling it via dance than boxing (as his father would prefer). He's widower father and older brother are striking against the coal mines that won't pay them enough wages and you see a struggle as they grasp to their identity of what it is to be male. (if you can't feed your family, you don't feel like much of a man, do you?). Julie Walters delivers a fine performance as the dance teacher that sees Billy's potential and helps him realize it. Moments that could have been stomach-churning manage to go by like rocks skipping a lake. Transformations don't exactly ring true, but you find yourself more relieved and besides, with what ends up at stake, who has time for such 'trivial' matters?"

However it didn't take long for this film to win me round. <br/><br/>Jamie Bell is simply outstanding as the would be boy ballet dancer ( and has proved this performance was no fluke with later film efforts). Julie Walters as his teacher is also excellent as are the rest of the talented British cast. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight forward and you always know what is coming next but this film is always entertaining with some wonderfully blunt and funny scenes. As with any good film this film is just as entertaining the second, third and fourth time you watch it as the first.<br/><br/>It may take a bit of a stereotypical view of Northern British men and Northern life in general but it is a film and I didn't find this was detrimental to the film. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful feel good drama that can be watched by all ages even children way below the ridiculous 15 rating."

","The mark of a truly great film is its ability to transport you to another part of the world and make you truly care about the characters, their lives, and their daily struggles.<br/><br/>Billy Elliot is just such a film. I saw it years ago (even before it was turned into a hit Broadway musical), and instantly fell in love with it. I've watched it several times again when it's aired on cable TV. What a gem of a little movie, and what a richly woven screenplay by Lee Hall. What a legacy of love for his native England. This movie is, on a lot of levels, Mr. Hall's love letter to his country.<br/><br/>Be prepared to fall in love with England, the English, and especially, Billy Elliot. This movie paints a broad portrait about humanity with many universal experiences. At the same time, it is an intimate glimpse into what makes the English English, and endearingly so. I loved the sweeping scenes of striking coal miners, the multigenerational relationships, the dashed hopes and dreams, and the lilting hope of a young boy who wants nothing more than to dance, dance, dance.<br/><br/>To the lucky who have not yet seen this film: You are in for a huge treat. Enjoy."

","It's certainly a good story. It has heroes and villains and the heart of the artist put to the test. The reason I didn't react to it so well is that I've been there a hundred times before. That is not to say a movie about following your dream isn't valid. It's in the telling and I didn't feel anything new. That said, the performances are quite good. The clashes over artistry are more subtle than I thought they would be. The connection made, finally, with the father and his sacrifices are worthy. But for me, it seemed clichéd. Even that connection appeared a bit contrived and out of character with someone in such a volatile setting. I know that this is an immensely popular musical that is sweeping the country in 2012 after years in European venues. I will see it if I have a chance. I have a suspicion that the music raises it and the dancing puts a punctuation mark on it. Perhaps the story is made more by nature of the artistic extension."

","It was the 1984-85 miners' strike in Britain. The miners were on strike throughout the country, including 11-year-old Billy Eilliot's (Jamie Bell) father Jackie (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony (Jamie Draven). Billy also lives with his grandmother (Jean Heywood).<br/><br/>In the midst of the miners' strike, Jackie took his son Billy to boxing lessons. It was not what Billy wanted, and he one day chanced upon a ballet lesson going on nearby in the Sports Centre where he has his boxing lessons. Billy soon became interested in what he saw and initially took lessons secretly from whom will be his teacher in Sandra Wilkinson (Julie Walters) along with the other female ballet students in the class. It was something which Billy's grandmother would know about initially, as she talked about how she could have become a professional dancer herself in her younger days. Billy's father Jackie would come to know about the secret ballet lessons and he forbade his son from doing so. That did not stop Billy from taking lessons from Mrs. Wilkinson, which also intertwined with the miners' strike getting more violent and bloody.<br/><br/>It would be when Billy was supposed to attend an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London which Mrs. Wilkinson felt that Billy has the talent which put Billy's talent on a collision course with his father and especially his older brother. There was a skirmish between the police and the miners which Billy's older brother Tony got involved and saw Billy missed his audition in London. There would be a major confrontation at the Eilliot's residence when Mrs. Wilkinson visited the family where it would become over whether Billy should be allowed to become a professional ballet dancer.<br/><br/>It is quite a heart-warming and up-lifting film, of a young boy and his dream of wanting to be a ballet dancer and the obstacles he had to face along the way, considering of what was plaguing his family in the form of the miners' strike. The backdrop of the film which forms the basis also gives an insight of the struggle between the miners and the government of the day, for the non-British audience. Still, it is a film which gives hope to those who dare to chase their dream."

","I saw the musical for Billy Elliot the other night and ad to review it. I had also seen the movie recently so I thought it would be a good opportunity to review both. ********* The Movie: Average... Jamie Bell is brilliant and seems to be keeping that up with King Kong and Flags of our Fathers. Julie Walters is as usual, brilliant! The story is dull however as is the writing. The music score was awful. Stephen Daldry did a fairly decent job with the movie. My main problem with the movie is how it tries to mix drama with comedy and in some places it does work but in some places it does not. Overall; 5/10 ********* The Musical: Brilliant! There were four boys who were Billy and the one who was performing on my night was terrific and had a very nice voice as well. The dancing was just as good as the movie if not better and the woman who plays Mrs. Wilkinson reminds me of Julie Walters which is of course a good thing. Simply stunning! Overall; 9/10 ********* You should see both!"
"Isaac5855","8","0","0","3 July 2008"," Experience the Joy and the ""Electricity""
","BILLY ELLIOTT is an enchanting and exuberant film that celebrates the joy and the passion of dance and how it can infuse anyone. Not since FOOTLOOSE has a film so beautifully captured the passion and joy that can be experienced from the art of the dance. Billy is an ll-year old Irish boy who lives with his widowed father and older brother, who both work as coal miners. Billy is taking boxing lessons at a local gym but inexplicably finds himself drawn to a ballet class that is being taught on the other side of the gym and after taking a couple of classes, Billy has tapped into a real passion for the dance which he fights but cannot deny, despite having to initially attend class behind his family's back. Eventually, with the encouragement of his teacher, who sees his passion after he takes his first class, Billy actually finds himself auditioning for a prestigious ballet academy, but this is not what this film is about. This film is not about the work and dedication it takes to dance or the roadblocks that can stand in your way nor is about it about the threatening of traditional gender stereotypes or about dancing being an indicator of sexual orientation, all of which are touched upon here, but this is not what this film is about. This film is about the pure joy of dancing and the passion that it can ignite inside a person. Director Stephen Daldry has mounted an imaginative and infectious story on a truly original canvas. Lee Hall's screenplay loses the film points, primarily for its needless subplot involving a coal miner's strike which distracts from the enjoyment of the primary story being told. Young Jamie Bell is nothing short of breathtaking in the title role, a riveting performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. The casting of Bell is inspired because he is not a dancer, further sustaining the film's underlying theme of someone who is not necessarily supposed to be a dancer, but has a passion for it that forces him to work at it. I love when Billy is walking out of his audition and one of the auditors asks him what it feels like when he's dancing and he replies, It's like...electricity."" Julie Walters (EDUCATING RITA) received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her performance as Billy's teacher, who recognizes the lack of technique in Billy but sees his passion more than makes up for it. Strong support is also provided from Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven as Billy's dad and brother, respectively (though their thick Irish brogues make them hard to understand at times). A warm and energetic film that will make your heart full. Later turned into a stage musical."
"threegorges","10","0","0","29 July 2007"," There are many things this film is not about...so look to the soul.
","Set amid, not so much against, a backdrop of Margaret Thatcher's war with the striking miners of 1984, this film is not about the strike even though it is evident and nearly dominant in much of the movie. Billy's father, his brother, his deceased mother, his friends, his teacher, his town--all play major roles that form the body of this cinematic triumph--and yet the film is not really about any or all of them either. Nor is it really about Billy. Those elements and more make up the story, but even the story is not what this film is about.<br/><br/>It is not about The Dance, but the dance is what lifts Billy to that ethereal place, akin perhaps to an akashic journey, wherein he comes to understand his own soul and enables his hard, basic, mining community to taste and savor the kiss of supreme triumph, the achievement of knowing who you truly are and knowing that you truly are a thing of glory...in those magical moments of flight. And therein resides what Billy Elliot is about.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, please do. See it alone. See it with someone you love. See it again.<br/><br/>This movie should have been nominated for and should have won more awards than it did. How could Jamie Bell not have been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe and more? This masterpiece did receive a lot of recognition, I will readily admit, but one suspects that the politics of that generic ""Hollywood"" drove others to glory instead.<br/><br/>No matter. Billy Elliot will not mind; it will just live on, enriching souls."

","I totally loved the movie. Jamie Bell can dance better than me and I have been dancing for 8 years. He portrays such a good character and if he kept dancing, I'm sure he could be a success. His best friend in the movie is gay (which you can totally tell from the moment he said that billy would look good in a tutu, plus him in a dress). I think Billy might have been a little upset about having to leave for ballet school, but maybe a little happy. He'd have to leave everything behind him that he ever knew and loved, because, like he said, he's never been to London. I wish he was a real person, Billy Madison. He seems like someone I'd totally love to get to know."

In the End of the story there is a turn in the situation and Billy's father Jackie is a big fan from Billy, who dance in London and get at last an award to London and the father is very proud of Billy.<br/><br/>In my opinion the film Billy Elliot is a very good film for the ensemble family and the film is very interesting to see, because in the film there are many special effects with the camera and the camera movement is much diversified, that makes the film interesting I think. Another important point in the film is the music. In my view the music gives the situations the right expression and so you can film the as a viewer from the film more emotion. The music in the film is at the most time older until classic. In my opinion you can see the message in the film very articulate, because Billy wants to dance but his father think it is a girl sport and so they have a argument."

","I watched this film during the last week in school. At first I thought that drama film could be very boring, but while I watched it, it became more and more interesting. I like to see Billy Elliot performing; he is very great at acting. He can dance, box and do ballet, he is multi talented in performing other characters I think. He played every scene very self-assured and serious.<br/><br/>I also think that all the other actors gave 100 percent. Their clothes go very well with the time in which the film takes places. Besides I like the setting, it was very good arranged.<br/><br/>In my opinion it is very interesting to watch a film like this. There are a lot of problems in the family, since the mother died. A lot of people want change him to an other person he isn't, but Billy is pursuing all the time his greatness wish, to dance and go to a ballet school. He is a very powerful person. To see how the dad change his opinion to his sons and to ballet was very exiting.<br/><br/>The message of the film is that everyone is legitimate to follow and life their own wishes and dreams and no one have to be against that, because it isn't his or her live. So everybody should accept the opinion of the others.<br/><br/>But I also have to criticize some aspects too. I don't like the background music so much; piano music isn't that what young people want to hear. The second aspect I have to criticize is the title of the film. The name ""Billy Elliot"" isn't so exiting. The film should have a more interesting title I think.<br/><br/>But all in one I can recommend this film to everybody who hasn't watched Billy Elliot yet and want to do that. It's worth watching."

","Billy Elliot - film review The film is about a boy - Billy - whose greatest dream is to become a famous dancer but his problem is that the male part of his family, his father Jackie and his brother Tony, are against the boy's dream. Both of them want him to become a strong boxer instead of a ""girly-like"" dancer.<br/><br/>The film shows how important it is to follow your intuition and dreams in life instead of listening to other people's pretensions about you! As well as Billy does, people should pay more attention to what their heart says. To follow the passions and affectations in our lives, because if we don't we'll become that kind of emotional-crippled-being that Billy's father was before he discovered that it's more useful to stand behind Billy instead of blocking his way to success and felicity. We have to see that people who are reaching for their dreams are people which should be admired, not adjudged.<br/><br/>Completing I would recommend the film to people who're interested in some kind of unusual film makings, aside the commercial ""Hollywood-film-making. Also you have to be able to look behind the shallow actions of the film to see what the actors try to express with their deeds and words! Maybe it's not just about seeing what the actors try to say but the people surrounding you, sharing some parts of your life."

","When ""Billy Elliot"" was first released in theaters, I consciously chose not to see it - I had a negative bias for no particular reason, really, even thought it was a very big hit. I guess I was tired of ""british suburbs"" films that make you depressed: I used to find them interesting but, then, after a certain point I felt they started becoming repetitive and ""dead ended"" like the lives they describe. So, when I practically bumped on the film in the TV, minute by minute I found myself being pleasantly surprised by what I was watching. Now, I believe it is one of my favorite films. What ""Billy Elliot"" manages to do is give a tender and tough, bitter and sweet, at the same time, taste of reality in the life of the boy. It makes a story with out the American- type ""emotionalism"", with the correct dosage of laughter, compassion and questioning for the viewer. The thin line between social criticizing is very well kept in the film, since it does not try to take a stand nor in politics (like Ken Loach would) or in other issues presented (such as homosexuality): it rather prefers to show the impact on the boys life, through his own eyes. In general very well directed and very well acted, music bonds very well with the action. Do not miss it."

","On the last scene, we see Michael, aged 25. presuming this is 14 years later, from when we last saw Michael (when he was 11) the year should now be 1998. So how come we see Billy's dad looking much older, yet Billys brother, Tony, looks the same as he did 14 years before? This is obviously a minor error, but it still should have been taken into consideration. All films have some misdemeanours, and it is peoples jobs to point these out. After all, where would films be without the careful viewers? Billy Elliot is a powerful film full of emotions. Lets not ruin it with errors, shall we? Because i for one love this film.

","Billy Elliot tells the simple story of a boy from the working classes having a particular talent for ballet. Because his mining family has troubles from both the death of the mother and a mining strike the talent is not recognized nor supported by his family. He does get support from a middle class woman (Julie Walters) who somewhat projects her own problems on Billy by giving him private lessons and develops his talent. (The class difference being shown by the dog that barks every time Billy or his father enters that community).<br/><br/>Others tales are spun in: Billy, Debbie and Michael reach puberty and the confusing time a teenager goes through on that age is well portrayed, for example by Debbie seducing Billy in an interesting scene where the camera rolls on so long it makes the scene almost uncomfortable, the gay Michael seducing Billy in a way, and Billy staying focused throughout, but having fear of failure. And we have the miner's strike at the time of Thatcher in office as a background story. Children as usual seem so unaffected by their environment, as Billy and Debbie walk along a couple of police men with Debbie's stick against them they talk on and aren't even aware of what's going on.<br/><br/>Besides the good soundtrack it is sometimes the editing of it all that gives this movie something extra: The weaving of Billy practicing at home from a book and executing that in the gym, mining strike images cut with Billy dancing. Stephen Daldry constructed some of the scenes in The Hours in the same way.<br/><br/>Three scenes in particular stand out for me: When Billy's father comes to terms with the talent of his son. When Billy leaves his home for London for his education: He says his grandmother goodbye, one final look at the house and the neighborhood (with the ever-present little girl) is such a good film moment. And the tale of The Swan Lake told when they take the ferry (!), here combined with the music.<br/><br/>But still this seems all exercise for the making of a more important piece of art: Stephen Daldry's almost perfect movie The Hours."

Does anyone know the name of the beautiful piano music played when Billy is dancing in the boxing ring and Julie Walters is sitting facing him on a chair? I'd love to know. I agree with comments written about how difficult it can be to grasp the dialog. I grew up in Northern UK and my grandma was a Geordie (from Newcastle) but even so there are sections that are hard to decipher. For me the most moving is Billy's Dad and brother taking him to the bus station after he has been accepted by the National Ballet school. Also the way his grandma hugs him and then pushes him away as he is leaving."

","This movie is lovely because it cannot possibly be cornered into a genre. It is at once about a a family, a town, and a teacher, each isolated from the others but connected by this charming little boy and his gift. This movie has moments that glow dull with a sad stagnation, shine with hope, and radiate a sense of reality and unconditional love. It is so sensitively executed; the acting is naturalistic and while there's nothing gritty about this film, it's not sticky sweet either.

","An excellent film and most inspirational. The plot, though perhaps a little simple, is wonderfully brought to life by the acting of Bell and Walters. The simplicity of the plot, does by no mean that the film itself is at all simple, for it tackles a somewhat difficult subject of being allowed to do, not just what you are good at, but also what one WANTS to do. A question begs to be asked: Is real life really like this? The answer no, but it should be!<br/><br/>Though of course one can say that there have been many films on this subject in the past, ""Billy Elliot"", I think tackles new(ish) ground because of the stereotypical gender roles being reversed. There are many films about girls wanting to be ballet dancers and boys wanting to be football stars etc, but few films with the roles being changed, ""Bend it Like Beckham"" being an obvious exception to this of course!<br/><br/>I certainly look forward seeing to Jamie Bell's future career, especially when one of his other films, ""Deathwatch"", being also as well acted, if not better through acting experience.<br/><br/>In summation, a difficult role, but one carried off to near perfection for a first time role."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I heard something great about it, but i didn't expect that it can be so good. I really like the tender moments between the two boys. And at the end, when billy kissed the other boy on his cheek, that is a very sweet moment. <br/><br/>this movie basically has 3 stories. the main story is about Billy, the second is the strike at the mine. And the mini story is about Billy's friend who loves him. I was a little confused at the very beginning about the strike story. It did not explain well what was happening. However, I suppose that it maybe because I don't live in Britain, so I don't know their local events. I remembered seeing the movie ""full monty"" in which was also about stories laid off workers who worked at mines. <br/><br/>Unlike some of the movies in which you can always get the outcome, this film has quite a few unexpected twists in it. For example, when the teacher suggested Billy to go for an audition, one probably would expect that he would go to that audition and won admission instantly. then everyone will be happily ever after. it didn't happen that way. <br/><br/>There is one little minor detail that i didn't like. At the end of the movie, it showed the Billy's dad and brother visiting the grown up him dancing. However, I felt that the grown up billy is a little bit too old. they should have picked a teenager.

","What a fantastic movie.  Stephen Daldry's first film is charming, funny at times, dramatic, tragic, and in the end, brilliant.

What i loved best about the movie was the bittersweet quality to it, an element that really brought the film to life, as well as bringing the viewer closer to the characters.  This is a movie that has stayed with me since watching it, not necessarily for depth of storyline or complexity(the story was fairly simple, yet moving) or even because of the moral of the story(which never really affected me, to tell you the truth), but because it was different, it was uplifting, and the characters, just to be frank, grow on you. There are some very memorable<br/><br/>scenes, and one in particular aroused in me the most intense feelings of tension i've felt from a film in a long time: the audition, and that's just one of quite a few. Overall, a sensational film that will stay with you.  Go Billy!"

","Possible spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>Billy Elliot is one of those films which just makes you feel good inside. It is not a mind-bogglingly amazing film, it's just simple and natural. It's a story for anyone who was ever told 'you can't do that!'<br/><br/>It's the  story of a boy who wanted to dance because of the fire in his body - that he felt for dancing.<br/><br/>The ending is not trite or predictable as some say. It shows us Billy having realised his dream, the support of his family, and their pride at his now being the best in the business.<br/><br/>Like British films only can, it is natural and real, showing normal people who are like anyone you may know. It is not fast-paced, but takes its time, developing the story and characters.<br/><br/>Of course you know what will happen, it's just one of those kinds of films. And it's great because of it."

","I decided to rent this movie because the previews looked convincing.  I went to the local blockbuster and rented it and i must say it was one of the best movies I'd seen.          This is a British story of an 11 year old boy, Billy(brilliantly played by Jamie Bell)who's life is taking dramatic turns(his mom just died, his older brother constantly picks on him, his unemployed father is mean to him and pretty much ignores him and Billy has to take care of his old and very sick grandmother)If that doesn't sound bad enough, Billy dreams of becoming a ballet dancer but is afraid that everyone is going to think he's gay. He meets and befriends the local dance teacher who teaches ballet next door to Billy's boxing classes.  The dance teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson(another beautiful performance by Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent of dance and encourages him as much as she can and even goes out of her way to give Billy private dancing lessons.         Although there were some points in the private lessons where I thought Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson were going to have sexual incounters however, it just turned out that Mrs. Wilkinson was trying to be a mother figure for Billy. With a lot of help from Mrs. Wilkinson and Billy's own inner strength to persue his dream, this movie has a great ending. <br/><br/>       This movie teaches to never give up on your dream no matter who stands in the way.  Ten stars all the way!!!"

","Set against the background of the strikes and consequent upheavals between the miners and the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, `Billy Elliot' is an interesting if predictable film. Part of its interest lies in not having the standard UK accents from down south, but the good almost `Geordie' accents from the far north of England: though we do not get to see much of the beautiful countryside of Durham, Northumberland, just a few residential streets of miners' houses. Jamie Bell himself is from Manchester, but the northern accent is near enough similar as to go well with the more authentic `Geordie' use of English. His interpretation is sincere, and at times is pretty convincing. Hats off to the brilliant `old dame' Jean Heywood as Billy's grandmother. Gary Lewis as his father and Jamie Draven as his elder brother both put in admirable interpretations, and Julie Walters offers a very level-headed reading of her part, though her accent seems to be from a fair bit further south  just a touch of `brummy', perhaps.<br/><br/>In such an atmosphere, with masculine domination of just about everything, more so here as Jamie's mother is dead, the fact that the little boy does not wish to do such manly things as knocking anyone's  head off or simply belting a punch-bag but is attracted to ballet, works out to be just a little too steep for Billy's father and elder brother, both embittered hard-core strikers clashing head-on with that woman from Number Ten. However, the little boy's desires hold out and the rest is an almost triumphal fairy-tale exposition  if it were not for the shrewd directing keeping everything in line with the rife and social upheaval going on at the time.<br/><br/>The famous miners' strike of 1984 had the UK importing coal from Poland and the USA (`cheaper' says the smug lady from Parliament) and caused enormous social crises from the mining valleys of South Wales to the Midlands and Lancashire, and of course the far north of Durham and Northumberland. This should be remembered while watching this film: it has its painful moments.<br/><br/>Now, let me see: ah, Stephen Daldry's `The Hours' is still on at the local `multitheatre' so I think I'll just pop along there in a couple of hours as I am on holiday and not working late .........."
"JuguAbraham","8","0","0","2 April 2003"," Can it stand up to the best of British cinema of the 60s?
","Stephen Daldry is to be admired. For a first film by a theater director it is a commendable product that brings out fascinating performances that only theatre directors are adept at ensuring. Admirable performances by Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. Add to it clever and tongue-in-cheek editing by John Wilson and imaginative camerawork by Brian Tufano.<br/><br/>All this reminded me of three films from Britain made in the sixties: Karel Reiz' ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", Tony Richardson's ""Loneliness of the long distance runnner"", and Lindsay Anderson's ""This sporting life"". These movies captured exactly the same feelings as ""Billy Elliot""--the only difference was Billy is younger. ""Billy Elliot"" is in color, while the three brilliant films of the 60s were in black and white. Two of the movies were based on work by the superb writer Alan Sillitoe, who I was lucky to have met in real life, whose middle-class characters wanted to break away and become achievers in their own cosmic world--without the angry tap dances of ""Billy Elliot"" to aid them on the technicolor screen. The three movies of the 60s established the careers of the late Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, and the late Lindsay Anderson--another giant I was fortunate to have met and interviewed.<br/><br/>""Billy Elliot"" touches your heart because it is a great story and has so much of creative talent packed into it. Yet compare this film to the three British films made forty years ago, with older technology, but brimming with a passion that dwarfs ""Billy Elliot"" in all its color and technical glory. The politics, the social commentary and human values of the three 60s movies are more gripping than the saccharin sweet ""Billy Elliot"" made 40 years later. I do not infer that Stephen Daldry is less talented than Anderson, Richardson or Reisz--only that the movie needs to be compared and evaluated with its true elder cousins."

","Spoilers ahead!!!<br/><br/>Dance for some is the ultimate expression of love, passion, and life.  For eleven year old Billy Elliot, dancing is everything.  This is a film that shows you totally that no matter what your dream is, it's always within reach.<br/><br/>Set in England during the miner's strike of 1984, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is the story of a young, quiet boy who wants to be a ballet dancer so bad that in essence his desire is killing him. Dance to him is like the dreams of some young boys his age wanting to be sports heroes when they grow up. He lies to his family in order that he can continue taking lessons secretly from Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), the neighborhood dance instructor who teaches a ballet class at the community center that Billy stumbles upon after his boxing practice one day.  From there, the story progresses and we see the effect that Billy's dreams and goals have upon his father, older brother and grandmother who always keeps reminding us that ""I could have been a professional dancer once.""<br/><br/>The main impact of this film lies within its dynamic bravura performance given by Jamie Bell, who in my opinion was sorely overlooked for an Academy Award that year (2000).  Jamie's Billy touches all of us and makes us confront out innermost dreams and longings for our passions.  Not to be forgotten is Julie Walter's turn as the chain-smoking ballet teacher who has no other life besides teaching young Margot Fonteyns and Nijinskys.  Her performance is believable but yet still could have been turned out a bit more.  We, for one, never got to see what happened to her at the film's conclusion.  Simply, she continues on with teaching the young hopefuls, probably never again to have a student like Billy Elliot in her midst ever again.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film for anyone who's ever been told that their dreams are out of their reach.<br/><br/>Reach for the stars!<br/><br/>My rating: 4 stars"

","It is almost impossible to write in words (especially for a non-English speaker) the impact this film has had on me when I first saw it. I can say it in one word only: fabulous, fantastic, moving, touching, great, must-see, incredible. And of course Jamie Bell is the top star. His acting and dancing is phenomenal. The best dancing act is when you see him dancing and tapping on the roof of a shed next to his house and in the streets, after Mrs. Wilkinson pays a visit to his house to inform his family about the audition. You see Billy literally breaking free from his brick confinement. What more can I say. To me this film ranks among the top-5 best films ever made."

","I was just zapping through the channels and happened upon Billy Elliot- although I've seen it probably about three times I stopped for a moment and ended up watching the whole thing again. Although until now I have never actively included this movie in my list of favorite films, I just realised how excellent it really is- even the fourth time around, it made me cry several times, and the feeling at the end before the adult Billy jumps onto the stage is just as indescribable as it was the first time. After the movie ended I ran around the house with a huge grin on my face, filled with all sorts of poignant feelings.. this is a movie which makes me want to put on that music and dance (even if I would look very silly)and do all of those things I have ever dreamt of doing.

","So my friend walks up to me and says, ""Why don't you watch Billy Elliot?"" Well, the idea of watching a flick with some little kid who does ballet doesn't strike me as the best thing to waste my day on. I was just as wrong as ever. Jamie Bell, though only appearing in a few movies, is a magnificent actor, and quite an incredible choice for his role as Billy. Billy Elliot is witty, dramatic, and quite striking, just as it should be. It quite rightly shows an eleven-year-old boy's struggle to make his dream come true. Also, Julie Walters portrays the rather sarcastic ballet teacher with perfection. To give a rough outline of the movie:<br/><br/>Billy Elliot (Bell) comes from a rather low-class mining family, and is expected, as his father and brother before him, to accept his mining position with gratitude. However, one day after boxing lessons, he discovers his own passion: ballet. With the help of his new ballet teacher (Walters), Billy chases his dream of becoming a professional dancer.<br/><br/>Now that you've heard my rant on this excellent movie, do you think you'll watch it? My dare to you is to always try to achieve your dreams...be like Billy...never give up.<br/><br/>This movie sends out quite an important message, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Matrixchic007 rates Billy Elliot as a 10 out of 10."

I've never considered ballet so manly before .. okay, I still don't, but the ballet dancing is really a small part of the movie.

","Have you ever been criticized for something you enjoyed doing? Then you'll see how close to a real life Billy Elliot can be.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell plays the title character, son of Jackie (Gary Lewis), brother of Tony (Jamie Draven), grandson of Grandma (Jean Heywood). Jackie and Tony are coal-miners who are on strike, but continue to give Billy fifty pence a week for boxing lessons. When he accidentally goes into a ballet lesson instead, he enjoys it, much to his father's dismay. Billy has to undergo ridiculing from both his friends and family.<br/><br/>Touchingly beautiful, and yet selfishly self-conscious. Its wonderful story seems to be so real and so vivid, with sincere emotions. However, it knows that its touching and tries to cash in on them. It tried to be too many things (and wanted us to believe that all of them it were): drama, comedy, thriller, romance. It only completed on one of them: drama. Its drama was real and lifelike, but it seemed to try too hard for laughs (which they didn't succeed for me), and put in a ""fight scene"", so to speak, for thrills. A character that comes in for a couple scenes has a psuedo-romance with Billy. It would have been a lot better if they had thrown her in more, so then they could play on the romance quality of it, which isn't much.<br/><br/>Its story did have substance, don't get me wrong. Very multilayered. Billy's dancing, the strike, his cross-dressing friend. All of the subplots were developed just enough for you to enjoy them.<br/><br/>Bell gives a shockingly great breakthrough performance. Look for him to be in more starring roles. The rest of the cast were basically unknown to us Yanks, but they were all very good, as well. I especially thought Lewis was great.<br/><br/>The story of Billy Elliot seems far-fetched, but it is true to life. It could happen to any one of us. I think that's what makes it so good. If it was so unbelievable, it wouldn't be as captivating.<br/><br/>Billy Elliot is a touching and grand film, but with flaws.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language."

Have you ever dreamed about something - I don't know like a excellent job, or the lottery or that girl or guy you've wanted since high school.  That was the essence of this movie.  Billy Elliot wanted nothing more than to dance.  Granted some people said that some of the dance numbers Billy was doing went that good.  You have to look at the dance as a whole. Dancing in not only what you do with your feet and body.  It's what goes through your soul that is the important thing.  When you wake up in the morning and dancing is first thing that you think about - then you need to be a dancer.  Billy's every waking minute was filled with dance.  Yeah, maybe he used it to escape his horrible upbringing.  But this only fuels the fire further on.<br/><br/>I know this feeling, coming from a totally different background from Billy. I came from a very privilege background, but that didn't stop the fire in my body that I felt for the dance.  Father and mother wanted something else for their son, but I wanted something totally different.<br/><br/>And so it goes, Billy wanted to dance because of that fire in his body, he went away to this school and in the end danced the lead in Swan Lake, with his brother and father watching from the audience with awe and pride.<br/><br/>Excellent......"

My parents had a hard time understanding the speech at times, (which doesn't say much, but still,) and it's not just British accents... it's Durham accents. It's a kind of scottish/caulkney/british mix. Or something like that, lol.<br/><br/>The cast is totally lovable, and they all portray very human charachters, flaws and all. The cinematography was absolutely stunning, and it made the movie very easy on the eyes.

","BILLY ELLIOT is the latest in a succession of it's-grim-up-north-so-let's-do-something-heartwarming films.  How does it stand up against BRASSED OFF and THE FULL MONTY?<br/><br/>Pretty well, is the answer.  First-time director Stephen Daldry does a good job of presenting the simple story, although his lack of cinematic experience shows a bit, for example in the depiction of the flow of time. There are a couple of sequences where time passes, but this is not apparent to the viewer.<br/><br/>It's never difficult to find good actors for a low-budget British film of this kind and Daldry, who has a fine reputation for his theatre work, has assembled a good team here.  Of course, the film's raison d'etre is Billy himself and Jamie Bell needs no further praise from me.  A passionate and natural performer, he could hardly miss and he doesn't.<br/><br/>The film's biggest problem is its rating (15 UK, R USA).  There's something wrong when a film can't be seen by its natural target audience (who are Billy's age of 11-12) simply because of the language that is used in it.  Mr Daldry is used to the kind of freedom he has on stage, and no doubt did not want to compromise a good script by snipping out the strong language which is perfectly convincing in the context of the characters and the story.  But would it really have done fatal damage to the film if the producers had listened to the film censors and taken whatever action was needed to get a 12 (USA PG-13) rating?  I think not, and it's a pity that that wasn't done.<br/><br/>I still prefer BRASSED OFF, for its wider scope, but BILLY ELLIOT is well worth all the praise that has been lavished on it."

","At first glance Billy Elliot might seem like just the latest feel-good drama...but it is so much more this time. On the surface it is about a family trapped by poverty in a small mining town. It is from this ""hell"" that Billy is able to ultimately escape, unlike his father, brother or nana.<br/><br/>But looking deeper, this excellent film is about freedom of expression. Stephan Daldry marvelously juxtaposes Billy's ballet training against the fighting union members toward the scabs. It is about standing up for what you believe and expressing it in the only way you know how, which climaxes when Billy dances in front of his father in defiance...just as his father stands up against the scabs. I also thought they did a fine job of breaking down stereotypes. This is done through Billy's relationship with his friend Michael. The film makes it clear that a boy interested in dancing is not destined to be gay and that ""manly"" activities are nothing more than traditional and dead weight for people who fear change. In the end they all escape from the poor mining town: Billy literally; the rest of his family emotionally. <br/><br/>I'm sure we will see more of Jamie Bell (Billy), not because of his well-done dancing but because of the energy and pathos he brings to the role. This one isn't just another feel-good movie; rather it speaks to us about where we should be headed as a society."

I doubt that this movie would have been made but for the money given to the producer by the English National Lottery, BBC and The Humanities for The Arts.  This is an old fashioned movie with a heart.  I loved every minute of it.  Jamie Bell was outstanding as Billy.  The rest of the cast were equally good.  What I did notice, a school uniform makes everyone look equal, even someone as poor as Billy.  Does anyone know who the Ballet performer was who came on at the end of the movie - what a wonderful leap!"
"TuckMN","10","0","0","21 November 2000"," Billy's excellent adventure.
","From the opening sequence where the soundtrack proclaims `I was dancing when I was twelve' to the last moment of this incredible film you will probably fall in love with Billy Elliott the character and Jamie Bell  the talented young actor that portrays him.<br/><br/>This film is what all film should be and all too often is not:  story driven.<br/><br/>There are no big flashy special effects, no car chases, no guns, and no overt sexuality.  There is some violence  but it is not gratuitous and is necessary to the plot and to the development of the characters into real people.<br/><br/>Set in the coal mining district in the north of England, Billy's passion for dance is as unlikely as the existence of a snowball in hell: his family solves problems with their fists.<br/><br/>Julie Walters, whom I did not recognize even though I have seen `Educating Rita' at least a dozen times, is fantastic as Billy's chain-smoking dance teacher that sees something in Billy that he does not see in himself.  As in most of her performances, she very nearly steals the show.<br/><br/>But the show belongs to Jamie Bell.  Though he is actually 4 years older than the character he plays, he is the quintessential man/boy, forced to be an adult because times and situations are difficult.  Though this is his first film he carries the whole movie and appears in nearly every scene  and he carries it magnificently.<br/><br/>There is much to this film  It is a simple story of a boy that wants to be a ballet dancer  but there are so many subtexts and complexities that it becomes so much more than the simple story it, at first, appears to be.<br/><br/>Again, British cinema tackles a subject that is completely taboo to American film:  the subject of a young person's sexuality (see `Beautiful Thing'). It acknowledges that young people do have sexual feelings and they are often confusing and complex and not to be swept under the carpet or ignored.<br/><br/>This is only screenwriter Lee Halls' second film  if he continues in this vein expect greatness.<br/><br/>So too for Jamie Bell -- he has the makings of a true star, with a quality that leaps off the screen and into your heart.<br/><br/>This is one of the finest films ever made and upholds the magnificent tradition that is British cinema."

","""Billy Elliot"", in an earlier version, could have been ""Flashdance"" or ""Educating Rita"". But what this film lacks in originality, it more than makes up in athleticism and spunk.  This is a special film about a special time and place in the life of an eleven year old boy, Billy Elliot (a remarkable performance by Jaime Bell), growing up amidst the turmoil of losing his beloved mother, of identifying who he is, and of facing down his stern father (Gary Lewis) and troubled older brother (Jamie Draven). Besides the close family bonding, Billy befriends Michael, a neighborhood chum who is only beginning to accept his sexual identity.  And then there is 'Miss' (Julie Waters in a role reversal from ""Educating Rita""), the ballet teacher 'slumming' in the nearby gym, willing to put Billy through the paces because she sees his real talent.  It would be misleading to frame this film as just about a boy growing up in trying times because the only way Billy can achieve his dreams is if others around him grow up in lock step.  His father must break away from the provincial mold that says the only masculine activities are playing football and boxing.  'Miss' must confront her 'swan-lake' fable that seemingly has stunted her own life - a lovely swan left in waiting by her wandering prince.  This film is also heartfelt through and through from the tender advances little Debbie makes on Billy to the sobbing father wrestled by the older son from becoming a scab, to the rolling street, filmed dead-on with the placid bay on the horizon, that Billy triumphantly runs up and down after mastering a dance turn and later his dad repeats when Billy gets accepted to dance school.  The memory of Billy's mother pervades his life and yet her physical presence shows up only once, a minor oversight to a film that envelopes your heart for two hours and lingers yet on and on."

Jamie Bell gives a great performance, and after this movie he'll probably be more popular than Prince William in the UK.<br/><br/>This is a sweet little movie, and you have to give it the benefit of the doubt in its more melodramatic moments, but it's a wonderful portrait of a young artist emerging from family and social turmoil.  A great example of the worst thing in the world--a boy doing ballet!--turning out to be not just a good thing, but perhaps the salvation of a family's spirit.<br/><br/>With CROUPIER, GIRL ON A BRIDGE, and now BILLY ELLIOT, I'd have to say it's been a heck of a year for European movies."

","Words cannot express the heart and soul this movie carries. I have read many reviews complaining that this story has been done before.

I have never laughed, cried, and cheered at the same time while watching a movie. One would have to have an icy and cynical demeanor not to love this film. And at the center of it all is a talented little Jamie Bell. He carries the film on his narrow shoulders as he literally dances his way to stardom. I hope he moves on to bigger things. Hopefully, he'll get an Oscar nomination for his brilliant portrayal of a kid who's just gotta dance. The rest of the cast is splendid as well, especially Julie Walters, who practically stole every scene she was in. Billy Elliot is a truly wonderful film.

","The British Film Industry is in the doldrums at the moment and I for one am fed up with my local cinema filled with rip offs of ""Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels"". So it came as welcome relief that this film came along. Chiefly what makes this film work for me is that it is a British Film made for a British Audience - too often the British are portrayed as upper class twits or raving psychos and it's refreshing to see something different. It actually tries to be authentic and doesn't alter the dialogue or accents to suit the international market. The film isn't original, but lets face it with the exception of "" Being John Malkovich"" very few film are nowadays. What drives it are a clutch of fantastic performances that make you believe in the characters & want them to succeed. Complaints have been made against using the miners strike of the 1980's as a backdrop, but that's all it is, a backdrop - it's used and in my opinion very effectively, to further illustrate the struggle & sacrifices that Billy & his family must make in order that he can fulfil his dream and as for it being used as a setting too many times - when? the only other film I that I can think of is ""Brassed Off"" In short, a brilliant film that the British can be proud of, a rare commodity these days - let's just hope Mike Leigh is filming something...."
"Philby-3","Null","0","0","13 November 2000"," Dancing to escape
","It is nice to think that a miner's son can become a top ballet dancer, but the fact that it happens so seldom suggests it is not an easy transformation. `Billy Elliot' tells the story of a Durham miner's 11 year old son, who becomes enamoured of the dance while receiving boxing lessons. The local girls' core de ballet is training at the other end of the same gym and Billy decides the 50p for the boxing might be better spent on the ballet. The veteran teacher (Julie Walters) sees the boy is serious and puts much time into his lessons, even waiving the 50p fee when a horrified Dad finds out and cuts the money off. Dad is on strike  it is 1984, the time of the great confrontation between Mrs Thatcher and the miners. <br/><br/>
The story plays out against several themes skillfully interwoven into a compelling tale of pushing against the odds. A few things go Billy's way. Dad sees Billy tap dancing, realizes the kid really has talent, and switches from hostility to support. After all, aren't those Riverdance guys on the telly? So does Billy's older brother, already down the mine (and on strike). The teacher gets Billy an audition with the Royal Ballet School. The locals chip in to help finance the trip. But Billy is ferociously determined as well as talented and in the end of course he succeeds, shattering a few myths in the process. For one thing he discovers he is heterosexual, much to the dismay of a gay classmate (they remain friends). Coalminers can appreciate ballet too (Dad becomes a firm fan). And Mrs Thatcher did not necessarily beat the coal miners. It was just that they didn't win.<br/><br/>Films like this (`The Full Monty, `Brassed Off `, `Educating Rita') celebrating the perils and potentialities of being working class, can be rather didactic (the films of Ken Loach come to mind), but this one is funny and uplifting. The kid playing Billy is stunningly good and well supported by Julie Walters, more restrained than usual, as the teacher, and the two playing Billy's father and brother. In fact all of the acting is great, including Patrick Malahide in a cameo as a delightfully snooty ballet auditioner. A group of 12 year old boys in the audience thought the film was great, judging by their comments during the film, and there were plenty of other smiling faces at the end. <br/><br/>CAUTION:  POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD<br/><br/>Film makers are right to be concerned with the plight of the workers and to be a bit angry, but a good story like this one transcends the political issues and uplifts us all. At the end  when the mature, accomplished and confident dancer leaps into the air as the prince in Swan Lake, we see no sign of the struggle, but only the Art, the lesson being that Art belongs to us all."

","Other writers have noted that this film again visits the miners under pressure due to closing of coal mines -- settings used by Brassed Off and Full Monty, both films I enjoyed. The union strike in this film is more background than in those films.<br/><br/>BTW: I don't see the setting as a problem. The mine closings, redundencies and subsequent homelessness produced a lot of turmoil in the British working class. It's hardly surprising that films critizing the Thatcher government are more common after her party is out of power since much of the financing for films seems to come from the government. I think there are still a few more films that could explore what happened to working people during this period.<br/><br/>The film also reminded me of October Sky, where a young man's desire to excell in his field runs afoul of his father's expectation that he follow after him. The acting/dancing and photography/direction were excellent. This film is a tearjerker, but I didn't feel manipulated.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film -- although I wish they hadn't used such an unnecessary and negative stereotype in the final ""years later"" sequence."

Taking place in bleak Northern England during the coalminers' strike in the early 80s, watching Billy made me feel as if I squandered my early childhood on having fun and not developing myself - losing myself to a passion.  I know that sound VERY cheesy, but it's true. Jamie Bell's acting was excellent...his expressions of internal turmoil and triumph read easily through his face.  The performances Jamie Draven as his tough, pro-union brother and Stuart Wells, as his gay best friend are also very telling.<br/><br/>I know I haven't done this film justice...I told my roommate it was The Cider House Rules of 2000 (I actually liked it better - more interesting struggle that strikes close to home and is more believeable).<br/><br/>See this movie...I doubt you'll regret it...and, who knows?

","What this movie does well it does extremely well.  The scene of Billy's acceptance or non-acceptance into the ballet academy is exquisitely drawn out, just like the biggest events of our lives often are.  The few times the kid smiles are totally natural and come from the scene, so when he does it's bright and warm.  My main objection is that there's an overload of anger in this film:  Angry father, angry older brother, angry kid.  That could and should have been cut back about 25%.  Then, as far as the dancing, I didn't quite believe the mix of ballet, tap, swing and stomp, which was quite a hodgepodge.  But to get back to what works and is much appreciated, when the bus pulls away and the (still angry) older brother is unable to look directly at Billy, I ached for the connection that wasn't happening.  Those are the moments on screen, far more than ANY special effects or pyrotechnics, that honor the possibilities of film-making.  On my scale of 1-10, overall an 8.5."

Emotional cues come so thick and fast it verges on oppressive. Granny's losing her mind but Billy still loves her. Dad's a loud and grumpy man but Billy still loves him. Brother hits, teases and humiliates Billy but Billy still... you see? Every time we get to an emotional speech the strings start playing on the soundtrack, in case we miss it. We aren't always allowed to make what we want of the film, as much of it is rammed down our throats. Although shot to look low-budget and improvised, this is as meticulously crafted a film as you'll ever see, and not in an all-good way. 'Do we have a gay character?' 'No'. 'Quick, put one in. And while you're at it make sure admiring girl, Dad's fat friend, and dead mother are also thrown in there. Got to cover all the bases, don't you...'<br/><br/>As I said, though, it's ultimately a worthwhile experience. There are a few scenes that really do pack a punch, and Julie Walters is fantastic. It also manages to make a few wry observations about the miner's strikes that plagued Britain in the eighties on the way, although perhaps brushing them into the background a bit awkwardly.<br/><br/>Go and see this film. It's really quite good, it just doesn't want to let you dislike it. Perhaps a bit more confidence in the quality of the script, which didn't need as much emotional prompting from the director as it got, would not have gone amiss."

","Melodrama at its best.  I've seen a lot of movies already this year but this is the first one that has been truly outstanding IMHO.  About a year ago I saw American Beauty and Three Kings in the same week.  Until BE, nothing I've seen since then has come close.  Anyway, I thought it was really emotionally affective and a great performance by the kid that played Billy. Also, I loved the score/soundtrack.  How the music really came in hard to underline the drama.  Like when the kid was running around, or when the father was running up the hill to tell his friends the good news.

","This may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>For the first time for many years this hard boiled cynic had a tear in his eye at the cinema!<br/><br/>Other have given plot outlines so I won't do that. This boy is just fantastic in his portrayal of Billy, a boy on the edge of starting to discover all that there is in this game we call life. His dancing is pretty uncoordinated but he's got a fire which burns in him telling him to do it and his dance teacher, Julie Walters with fag constantly in hand, sees this too.<br/><br/>One of these life discoveries is to start throwing off what represses you, in this case a blinkered family and social structure that couldn't see firstly that life isn't all the pit, drinking and boxing or secondly that mines have to be closed if there is no coal in them, and however much you strike you can't change that. The saddest line was when Billy is asked if he's been to the magnificent gothic Durham Cathedral as his village is very near there and says he'd never been taken. Billy is surprised to that his father (who sports a Glaswegian accent) has never been to London.<br/><br/>Luckily the miners strike was only a back drop to the story, but for our foreign readers the strike was called by the largely Communist leadership of the miners union without a ballot as a result of which led to only about two thirds of miners striking. The strike had little public support outside the mining areas who responded as one would expect with great violence to those who did continue to exercise the right to work and who naturally asked for police protection. Only Mr Wilkinson on the film hints at the background to the strike.<br/><br/>This is an unashamedly feel good movie which should win some Oscars. Billy's cross dressing friend has the best line in the whole thing though. Billy: 'Why have you got a dress on?' Friend: 'Oh, my Dad does it all the time.' And where do they find those grim locations?<br/><br/>8/10 from me, which is very high, I've only ever given a few films 9 and none 10, though 'Elizabeth' got close."

","There are times when the world of film delivers a genuine gem.  There are times when a story is told that can touch and move you to places that you either haven't been or needed to go without the tricks or traps of Hollywood manipulation.  ""Billy Elliot"" is that gem.  It is a slice of life with the beauty of youth, the strife of real life, the bond of family, the blessing of talent and the prize in a soaring spirit.  The title character is an 11-year-old boy (the amazing Jamie Bell) in a British mining town during the 1984 strikes.  His father and brother are part of the strike and he is left to watch his aging grandmother after school as the men spend the days at the picket line.  His only respite is the gym in the center of the village in which he takes his grandfather's boxing gloves and goes, mostly unsuccessfully into pee wee bouts.  One afternoon Mrs. Wilkinson's (Walters) ballet class moves into the gym to utilize space and help pay the rent. Drawn like a moth to a flame, the young boy slowly begins to work his way into the class.  The boys father (a wonderfully effective Gary Lewis) soon discovers that his son is not boxing and the traditional gender roles and masculine mining town mentality and ego are played to aplomb.  When he forbids Billy to dance, Mrs. Wilkinson trains him on the sly with the plan to take him to London to audition for the Royal Ballet School.  Eventually this is discovered as Billy misses his audition because his brother Tony (Jamie Draven) has been arrested during the strikes.  As time and the strike go on it is the scenes in which young Billy rebels against the stereotypical dancer as a poof by being exactly who he is.  One of the finest moments comes as he dances purposefully in front of and all around his bewildered father after having been caught training a friend in the gym one night. This is the turnaround and the father is shaken into realizing that Billy has promise.  What follows is the awakenings of fate, life, family and dreams.  A beautiful story with affecting performances and a lead that is so graceful and enchanting a dancer, this is a film that cannot and should not be missed.  Rated R for language, it would otherwise be the type of film that would rule come Oscar time.  I will be personally upset if it doesn't win that sort of recognition as it is the most deserved of the honor in years.(A++)"
"Karmapolice","Null","0","0","11 October 2000"," Best British film of the year, easily
","I was very sceptical about this film, ever since I heard about it at Cannes. A feel-good film? About a ballet dancer? With a miner father on strike? Julie Walters as a ballet teacher? I sneered, and predicted the film would completely flop, fail, crash and burn. After all, I arrogantly predicted, nobody wanted to see another Kes, or any other 'My God, it's grim oop North' film of which Ken Loach is the undisputed master. That, of course, is not a good thing. What is a good thing is that in its first minute, Billy Elliot shows more visual imagination than any Ken Loach film ever made. We are introduced to the eponymous hero (?) jumping up and down, listening to T-Rex. It is a completely joyful image; it is unpretentious, funny and affecting all at the same time. The final scene ends with the same image (and, no, I'm not going to say how it ends, but you'll be satisfied).    It's all about a boy who wants to be a ballet dancer. Fair enough. While that might sound a fairly anodyne plot- Flashdance relocated to the UK- the ballet dancing was, for me at least, subsidiary to the main point; namely, that Billy is trapped in a repressive, patriachal society, and that only his talent can give him a real chance at life. It's reminiscent of Good Will Hunting, but without Robin Williams. Which can only be a good thing. Jamie Bell is so good in this film it almost hurts. He's not good in a sort of 'wow, watch the child actor act' way; he's good in that he makes you completely believe in his character, giving him the kind of emotional depth and feeling that most adult actors would simply fail to convey. If Warner Bros had had any sense at all, they'd have cast him as Harry Potter, with Terry Gilliam or David Fincher directing. Imagine just how brilliant that would have been. Gary Lewis is good too, as the father. The stereotype in this sort of film is of the abusive, violent, drunken father, but Lewis doesn't do that. Instead, he plays the part as a man who wants to do the best possible thing for his son, even, at one heartbreaking point (minor spoiler) breaking the miner's pickets and going to work so that Billy can go to his audition for the Royal Ballet school. Julie Walters isn't too bad as the dancing teacher- I say that as someone who has avoided films with her in in the past- and most of the cast is good. Stephen Daldry, who directed the film, must be feeling pretty confident that, like his mate Sam Mendes, he has transcended his theatrical background to make a real film, not just a filmed stage play. He is my tip to win best director at the BAFTAs next year (not the Oscars- that's Ridley Scott for Gladiator). He deserves it richly. Go and see this film. 10/10"

"dmnkeen","10","0","0","9 October 2000"," Powerful character study dressed up as a feel-good movie
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILER!!!<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this film is to be found in what is not said. The unspoken motivation of Julie Walters' dance teacher and the spiteful silence of her young daughter towards Billy; the lack of initial emotional connection between Billy and his father (and the father's own reasons for pushing Billy into boxing); and the confrontation between father and son where not a word is spoken but where the father recognises for the first time the gift his son has. These are all extraordinarily powerful scenes in a movie which has been unfairly criticised in some quarters for wearing its heart on its sleeve and for inconsistencies in characterisation.<br/><br/>I believe these criticisms are totally unfounded. Lee Hall's brilliant script and Stephen Daldry's inspired direction take basically Rocky-style material and overhaul it with terrific characters and truthful sentiment. Billy's dad does not act inconsistently when he is confronted by his son's talent - although times are hard, and he is on the face of it inattentive to his youngest child, he does finance his boxing lessons. Like the ballet teacher who sees her own missed opportunities in Billy, the father sees his own discarded potential in the ring in his son - the father's boxing prowess is referred to twice in the movie - and this clarifies even more his outrage when he discovers the hard-earned boxing money has been ""squandered"" on ""friggin' ballet"".<br/><br/>There are many moments like this which underscore the characters' motivations in the film and critics who insist on inconsistencies really should pay more attention. This is one movie where we have to look deeper into background detail (which is sometimes placed discreetly before us) to get our answers as to why the people in this movie behave in the way they do. And that is a refreshing change from the characterisation-by-numbers tat which often disgraces modern movies.<br/><br/>For these reasons above, I think ""Billy Elliot"" is not only one of the movies of the year, but one of the best for many years, especially from Britain where it seems crappy gangster movies are all filmmakers are interested in inflicting on us. Everything rings true in it and the acting is some of the best I have ever been privileged to see on screen.<br/><br/>Julie Walters is, unsurprisingly, terrific as Billy's teacher; Jamie Draven is a revelation as Tony, the eldest brother; and everything that has been said of Jamie Bell as Billy is totally justified: this is the best performance by a young actor since Christian Bale in ""Empire of the Sun"".<br/><br/>But, for me, the best performance (and the emotional core of the movie) is provided by Gary Lewis as the father. The pent-up rage which spills over into genuine grief and, finally, an act of unbridled desperation is all realised perfectly by this Scottish actor who, what with ""Carla's Song"", ""My Name Is Joe"", ""Orphans"", and now this, is fast becoming one of the most dynamic performers on the screen. If his name does not feature prominently come awards-time I will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Oh, and if all this sounds very serious, I should point out that the film is also incredibly funny, and ends with a smile fixed squarely on your face. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Billy Elliott is one of those movies that you watch to pick you up when you're feeling down. What a pleasure it was watching this movie even though it's not set during the best of times for these characters. We come in as they are struggling to confront a recent death and overwhelming poverty all the while trying to retain some sense of dignity. <br/><br/>Here we have young Billy living in a coal-mining town in Northern England with his father, brother and grandmother. His mother has recently died and his father and brother are on strike from the mines. Billy is in charge of looking after his grandmother, who is losing her mind while the others are at the picket lines. Billy is also is at that sexually awkward, adolescent stage. Times are tough to say the least. As Billy struggles to deal with all that is going on in his life he discovers he has a natural talent to dance. Urged on by the local ballet instructor (played wonderfully by Julie Walters), Billy faces the disapproval from his family for his love of dancing.<br/><br/>When I first read about the story line for this movie I literally rolled my eyes. I thought, `oh boy, one of those predictable feel good movies'. And while it is a feel good movie, it was not as predictable as I thought it would be.

","A boy from the wrongest possible side of the tracks gets his chance at stardom of an unexpected kind in this feelgood British film. Set against the backdrop of the miners' strikes during the darkest years of Thatcherism makes for some interesting contrasts as we see Billy and his fellow children seemingly oblivious to the menacing circumstances that they live in. Some fun moments arise from this - the scene where Billy walks along the street chatting with Debbie, oblivious to a rank of riot police on one side, is a delight.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell is the child star who does a good job of making Billy believeable. One bit didn't work for me - the scene in the dressing room after Billy's audition, I'll say no more, except that this for me was a device to artificially pile on tension in the film at the risk of credibility - this is the one time in the whole film where Billy behaves completely out of character. I also wonder what happened to Billy's oversized ears by film's end - it's a bit hard to reconcile Bell with the adult that plays the grown-up Billy. Oh, well.<br/><br/>For mine, the best actor in this film is Stuart Wells who gives a riveting performance as Billy's best friend Michael. The rest of the cast are generally very good also - flawed, real people, no Hollywood mannequins here. Perhaps a bit too real - the Northern accents are so impenetrable at times that this film could do with subtitles. A bit too much T-Rex in the soundtrack too, particularly since one T-Rex song is usually too many. But minor quibbles aside this is an enjoyable film."
"ken kanazawa","9","0","0","9 October 2000"," Very cinematic. Often fantastic.
","Here comes another charming film set in Northern England. Its dynamism almost sticking out of the screen, ""Billy Elliot"" reminded me that movies were once called ""motion picture"".<br/><br/>Julie Walters and Gary Lewis offer superb supporting performances as a somewhat brusque dance teacher and a curmudgeonly miner respectively, but the biggest accolade should be received by Jamie Bell, whose natural acting as well as elastic dancing really struck me.<br/><br/>Billy expresses pulses of his spirit - anger, sadness, pleasure and rupture - by dances rather than words. The more skillful he becomes in dancing, the more eloquently he does this, which at some time energetically collides with still lives such as concrete road and brick wall. The scene where Billy shows how much he loves ballet by dancing in front of his static father is just great.<br/><br/>Some have justifiably criticised the superficiality of the secondary subjects like Billy's sexual orientation and miner's strike. My impression is that, as for whether Billy is straight or gay, the director has sensitively dealt with his vacillating and indecisive mind of coming of age. With respect to the miner's strike, had the film been given too much emphasis on it and been depressingly politicised as was ""Brassed Off"", it would have gone into a wrong direction, marginalising the main theme, i.e. Billy's growth.  <br/><br/>Yet ""Billy Elliot"" has some defects. While it possesses a lot of fine moments when picture and music are so beautifully integrated into cinematic quality (I particularly like the take where the image of rather nettled Billy brandishing long and chunky stick overlaps with Fred Astaire's ""Top Hat""), there are also scenes so hackneyed that I almost sniggered, and the generally good music is sometimes obtrusive and over-sentimental. And if the redundant scenes had been cut and the script had allowed time for portlaying Billy boarding in London - where his character would necessarily crash with the value of the predominantly middle-class ballet institution - it might have possibly been more intriguing (but, alas, I realised it would take another film!).<br/><br/>Having said these flaws, I believe ""Billy Elliot"" is one of the most fantastic works done by the British film industry. Yes, as most people admit, the story line is conventional to say the least, but that's not the whole point. The quality images and the splendid performances certainly compensate for the lack of originality in the plot. Above all, ""Billy Elliot"" successfully depicts explosive and jubilant nature of adolescence, and should receive massive applause from the audiences of any generation.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended."

Critics especially have fallen for the film - the story of a boy's dream to pursue his hobby of ballet dancing during the 1984 miners strike.  The public of course have also been lured into Billy's adventure and few of them will leave the theatres, or in the future their televisions, without some expression or felling of awe and astonishment.<br/><br/>We always welcome the 'underdog' story and that the films that use it rarely fail to strike a chord with cinemagoers.  And, the underdogs haven't always been adults, Billy Elliot isn't the first child on the big screen up against all the odds.

It's like taking a sip of real life: the sadness is there, all the time, not underlined or exploited, the joys are subtle and success means loosing something.<br/><br/>Billy is great , acting or dancing; another character that really impressed me is his father, the prototype of the simple good-hearted man.<br/><br/>On the whole, the movie is beautiful, refreshing, different, it has something special, I would call it: the European touch."

","I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.  This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.  In a mining town, where men are men, Billy (Jamie Bell) slips away each night after boxing practice to learn ballet with the girls.  In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.<br/><br/>This is a story that is less about dance than it is about social interaction.  The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions. Also woven into the story are various themes about people who are different and how they handle being on the fringe.  The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.<br/><br/>My only reservation is that the film overemphasized certain of the human stories (particularly the minors' strike) at the expense of the dance.  We see glimpses of Billy's progress as a dancer, but he seems to explode from spastic and gawky to an accomplished tap artist with little transition. Also, there seems to be a disconnect between his exceptional tap skills and his tentative ballet skills, which is so discrepant that it is hard to believe it is the same dancer.  While the dance theme is clearly subordinate to the human issues, I felt it should have been more believable and better developed to complete the film.<br/><br/>Not much more could have been asked of Jamie Bell in this role.  In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.  Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.  Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.<br/><br/>The ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.  Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.  Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.  Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.<br/><br/>This is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  With a little better development of the dance theme it might have been flawless.  Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart."

","This movie is simply one of the greatest films ever made. I always had a thing for British movies (and the acting, especially!) but this one...what can I say? I saw it about 6 times in the theater, just couldn't get enough of it. There isn't a single bit of it that doesn't feel true and that touches your soul. Billy and his family had me from the first scene to the last. There is a lot to be said about this movie and I could spend a couple of hours praising it, but I think You all should just go and see it for yourselves! If you watch movies because of the acting and if you wanna get to know the characters and love them, then you will like it I hope. If you want action, sex and glamour, then you might not. I was disappointed it didn't get more Oscar nods. Julie Walters was great and atleast Jamie Bell was awarded elsewhere (the British academy award, and the national board of review), but my personal favorites (amongst favorites) were Gary Lewis as the father and Jean Heywood as the grandmother."

","The hero's dream of becoming a ballet dancer is born in the unlikely milieu of County Durham's working class mining community.  This impoverished population of broken dreams and domestic violence is the bleak alternative to, and thereby stimulant for, Billy Elliot's dream.  <br/><br/>The action takes place, significantly, during a time of rebellion: the pit miners are on strike because of pit closures.  This violent and brooding subplot is thematically linked to Billy Elliot's struggle against tyrannical sanctions: just as his brother and father resist police enforcement, so he stands up to them.  His rebellion is no less masculine: he defies his father's prohibition and braves physical abuse when caught dancing, proving that Ballet is not just for Â‘poufs' but is a dignified profession for those of physical dedication, discipline and courage.<br/><br/>The director symbolically conveys the opposition between Billy's values and his father's through an opposition between darkness and light (the white of the swan is to become a symbol of Billy's ambition).  The misery of parental failures is explored during a dark interior scene; yet the next scene, where Billy and his girlfriend cast away sorrows in an amorous play scene, is light and the feathers of the cushion as it splits fill the room with downy whiteness (a visual prelude to the swan's narrative introduction). <br/><br/>
Overlooking the river Wear, Billy's teacher (Julie Walters at her gut-wrenching best) tells him the story of Swan Lake as Tchaikovsky's theme is playing in the background: a beautiful woman is turned into a swan by a wicked magician, but has a few hours every night to be her true self.  This is an important moment for Billy, for he takes on the swan's story as a correlative for his own plight: like the swan he has a limitted time set aside in his day (the dance classes) in which to express his true self. <br/><br/>
Downy snow is falling like swan feathers in the Christmas scene and Billy is building a snow man with his friend; this is an image of hope and creativity(which is later urinated on by a drunken miner); rebuilding dreams as well as building the white snow man (Billy's friend is convincing him to try his luck at Ballet again).  It is as if the universality of the snow and all it stands for gives Billy the confidence to re-assert his ambition, for when his father catches him this time, he is not so passive.  He gives a muscular virile, even acrobatic, dance performance for his father in an awe-inspiring gesture of defiance.    <br/><br/>Jamie Bell is a Gene Kelly of the 21st century: his moves are a mixture of tap, ballet, gymnastics and, at times, football manoeuvres!  The scenes of tap dancing virtuosity across the lavatories, steps and railings of the brick back yards and along the streets and shed rooftops of Durham are as breathtaking as one of Gene Kelly's jubilant performances.  Yet, with Billy Elliot, the aggression and awkwardness of the moves are emotionally justified: he is angry and is dancing from frustrated energy reserves. There is nothing staged about his dancing, or indeed any part of this film, for it is enthused throughout by the thwarted passion and stifled, if ultimately triumphant, genius of the hero's dream."

","As with Mark Herman's 1996 drama, Brassed Off, this is another tale of hope set against the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike. <br/><br/>The eponymous hero is an 11-year-old whose dad and brother are on strike, his gran is losing his marbles and Billy misses his dear departed mum.<br/><br/>While doing a spot of boxing training, Billy becomes entranced by a band of wannabe ballet starlets and is taken under the wing of Julie Walters, on Bafta-winning form yet again.<br/><br/>Okay, she hasn't even been nominated for a gong yet but watch out for the brilliant Brummie next Spring as the winners are announced.<br/><br/>This is a touching tale which may not be the most original story in the world, but boasts great performances from all concerned. Aside from Walters and Patrick Malahide as a snobby London-based ballet VIP, the rest of the cast are unknowns who are bound to go onto bigger things after this.<br/><br/>A great movie which will leave grown men choking back the tears as the young hero makes his inevitable shot at the big time.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Why someone described this movie as funny (testimonial on movie poster) is beyond me, unless they typically find stories about poverty stricken miners, dead mothers, and labor turmoil to be humorous. Billy Elliot is a good movie, but it is not the funny, heartwarming movie experience I expected. Heartwarming maybe, funny at times, but this should not be a prime descriptor of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, the characters are believable and interesting, and the story is charming. I especially enjoyed the sub-plot of the labor unrest, and felt that it gave the film a depth it otherwise would not have had. And this is perhaps where the film fails somewhat in my opinion--in it's effort to tell a story about a boy's struggle to be able to dance the ""ballee"", the movie only glances at the bigger struggle, and the bigger story, of the miners' union's struggle against management. As much as I like a story about triumph over adversity, it's hard to get too emotionally concerned about a boy's desire to dance when hundreds of working class families are fighting for wages that will feed their children, never mind send them to dance school.<br/><br/>I rate the movie a 7 out of 10. It is unquestionably a well done movie, but I ultimately found the priorities of storytelling misplaced, and that hampered the entertainment factor."

","It looks like a typical 'follow your dreams' movie.  But once you sit down on the couch and watch the first five minutes of this movie, you won't be leaving.<br/><br/>I've always wanted to see Billy Elliot in the movies and never got the chance.  Finally, I was able to see it on video-tape and jeez, I should have watched it earlier.<br/><br/>Billy Elliot takes place in the 1980's in a small, lower class English town. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is into boxing when a ballet class moves into the gym where he's practicing.  He stumbles onto the class and joins.  Hiding the fact that he is dancing from his friends and family, he continues to box and dance.<br/><br/>Billy's brother and father are working in a mine when a strike erupts and times are tough.  While the brother is protesting, the father continues to work to support his family, enduring the hell ride to the mine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Billy's family finds out he is dancing privately with the ballet teacher.  Billy's father and brother are now p***ed, calling him a ""poof"" which I can only think to mean gay or a girl.  While Billy's brother is planning to kill his father because the father is too mean, beating both children, Billy stops it.<br/><br/>In the end, Billy tries out for an audition into a well-respected dancing school in London.  Beating up a kid in the locker room and getting in trouble for it, Billy goes home in tears with his father.  One day he gets a letter and finds out he's accepted.  The strike is now over, unfortunately.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Thousands of British lads auditioned for Billy Elliot, and only one made it. Jamie Bell, a cute boy who delivers a flawless performance.  No one could have done it better than him.  Jamie is not a child actor, he's a real actor and you see it in his emotions.<br/><br/>Again, this looks like the follow your dreams movies, but it isn't.  Even the sensitive subject of homosexuality is touched in Billy Elliot.  The movie is the best British movie I have seen, five stars, number one, all the way.<br/><br/>This movie is the third best movie I've seen and trust me, I've seen a lot. There is a bit too much using the 'f' word but it adds the harsh flavor to the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't see Billy Elliot and you're missing out on a lot."

","I always enjoy reading the comments other folks leave for movies like this one.  Usually, I'm left pondering whether the odd dismissive comments that demonstrate their author's ignorance are amusing or tragic.  ""This is a movie about a boy who wants to dance, and his father doesn't want him to."" Really?  And Casablanca is about a night club, The Maltese Falcon was about a bird, and Rosebud was a sled.  Have we really numbed our minds to such a sorry state?<br/><br/>Billy Elliott is about how even the most improbable dreams can flourish, and even in a world where not even survival can be taken for granted.  It affirms the power of the human spirit and explores the generational chasms that can exist within families, and forces us to confront stereotypes of working class values, frustrated aspirations, and even homophobia.  Through it all, Billy Elliott is an uplifting story of the triumph of a young boy's will over staggering obstacles.  It is an exquisite delicacy in a heap of fodder, and if you've spoiled your appetite by gorging on garbage then shame on you.<br/><br/>Julie Walters was my pick for Best Supporting Actress, but Americans don't like actors, they like stars.  Jamie Bell's performance was far better than that of Haley Joel Osment, nothing against Haley, who was magnificent, but since the good parts weren't all underlined for us, most Americans will miss the rich lodes of gold in a film like Billy, preferring to pan for nuggets in a torrent of trash. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was brilliant, and there are some dance scenes that are overflowing with complex and beautiful symbolism.  There's also fun, pathos, despair and hope.  And above all, there is the glorious ascent of the human spirit.  British cinema once again has a lesson for Hollywood."

","I was a bit late seeing Billy Elliot. It has been out for quite some time now, and I'd seen the trailers and read the synopsis and to be honest, despite all the rave reviews, it seemed like one of the dullest movies of the year. But when I finally watched it, I was left silent. I'm sure everyone knows the story by now. The performances from the cast were brilliant. No doubt about it, Jamie Bell as Billy the hopeful ballerina made an outstanding performance. Bell's facial and body expressions completely reflected how he felt. When he was angry, frustrated he let it all out in his sometimes manic dancing! Julie Walters gives a good portrayal of Billy's dancing teacher, and Gary Lewis creates a realistic relationship with Billy as his father. Jamie Draven as Tony, Billy's bad-tempered, 'hard man' brother gives an excellent performance that was totally underrated. Rarely was his name mentioned in reviews of Billy Elliot, even though he gave the film the realistic attitudes that a working class Northern English family would have. Now that I've watched Billy Elliot, I understand what all the fuss was about and promise never to judge a film until I have seen it for myself! Billy Elliot is now a firm favourite of mine. 10/10!"

I grew up in similar surroundings to the title character and would have been around the same age during this period and I have to say that the filmmakers have created the time and atmosphere of Northern England in the early 1980s to perfection.  I wish the very best of success to this production and hope that more viewers around the world can see and enjoy a truer slice of English life than the (not to take anything away from these films) ""Notting Hill's"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" portrait of the UK.

Jamie Bell gives a great performance as the lower middle class small town kid who wants to be a ballet dancer against his widowed fathers wishes.  The music for the film is also interesting, the director usesthe 1970's rock band ""T-Rex"" throughout the movie and even though it may not have been someone else's choice for a film set in the 1980's, the excellent ""Cosmic Dancer"" seems oddly appropriate. The films gender bending aspects are also very different from the standard Hollywood treatment hence ""The Full Monty"" comparison.

Jamie Bell is perfectly cast as Billy, and I dare to say his performance in this film was every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense.  There were times watching this movie that I forgot he was an actor; I felt like he *was* Billy.  The film captures a place (1984) and an era (Thatcher's England) so well it's like time travel.<br/><br/>The story is simple, and that's why it works.  The soundtrack is stunning, 100% bang-on, especially The Clash's ""London Calling"" and The Jam's ""Town Called Malice.""  Bell's dance numbers are brash and enthusiastic, and you can almost feel the character of Billy throwing everything he has into his self-expression.  The times that he seems most alive are when he is dancing, because it is then that he transcends the constraints placed upon him by his family and friends, and of course society, with its ""only poofs [homosexuals] dance"" mentality.  And hooray for Billy, the fact that his best friend is a cross-dressing ""poof"" doesn't really phase him.  The scene where Billy bids goodbye to Michael and Durham County is quite the heartstring tugger.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, do so.  You'll want to dance right along with Billy, and don't be surprised if you find yourself, like Mrs. Wilkinson, cheering ""Go, Billy!"""

","""Billy Elliot"" is nice, uplifting piece that doesn't take cheap shots.  The arc is quite obvious, but it's the way the film works towards that arc which I found impressive.  First of all, I'd like to say that I assumed I'd be watching a family film.  I ignored the R-rating, assuming it was on a technicality.  But this film really is filled with harsh language!  However, I didn't sweat it, because that was the film's way of capturing the realism of its characters.  The characters in the story are low-class, blue-collar citizens and naturally they're not going to have the cleanest vocabulary. <br/><br/>
The performances are great all-around.  Of course, the two highlights are Julie Walters and Gary Lewis.  Walters is electric as the possessive but good-natured ballet teacher.  I haven't seen ""Pollock"" yet, so I can't say if she would've deserved to win over Marcia Gay Harden, but I can say she definitely deserved to be nominated.  I also wish the Academy considered Lewis, who is powerful as Billy's overbearing father.  It strikes fear in me just by observing the look in his eyes.  His father-son interactions with Billy (Jamie Bell) are extremely powerful, and I love the chemistry between them.  They interact the way a REAL father and son would act, and not how a tailor-made, cinematic father and son would act.  <br/><br/>The film is set in 1984, so I was bopping my head to some cool 80s tunes. Aside from the dramatic scenes, ""Billy Elliot"" has a very upbeat feel and makes you want to smile.  It's funny, it's entertaining, yet moving at the same time.  Though it tries to be uplifting, it never forgets its dark subplots like the coal-miners strike and the loss of Billy's mother who he, in one scene, imagines in the kitchen with him.  <br/><br/>""Billy Elliot"" is a fine, fine film that inspires its audience to follow their dreams, and deliver it in a way that's unpretentious, down to earth, not sappy and something we can all relate to.  <br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","A fine story about perusing a dream. The ticket office clerk said 'It's a beautiful movie', and yes, he was perfectly right. You can learn the plot in other places, I would like to concentrate on what to my mind is making this movie good.<br/><br/>First of all, a solid acting of the lead of Billy Elliot and some good moves from father Eliot. The kid was able to behave mature, well trained, naturally in the whole line of acting to create a coherent character of a struggling boy, obsessed by the idea, weakened by not knowing what would be right, and still strong to allow us to feel it. Guess for that we have to thank the director, who really could mould the script in a living action, driving the audience to empathy. The story line is interesting and not banal. Actions do not flow by a one- track algorithm, there are hints, but it feels like a life. We know Billy will have to stand up to his father, but he does it in a difficult, comical and not transparent way.<br/><br/>I can perceive symbols, like the rusty metal fence, opposite to the alluring endless sea or the bridge and more. They just are, noticeable or hidden. Some redundant to my mind details are the homosexual line, or revolving of 11-years-olds around sex issues, which is probably a tribute to common thinking, because they are not really needed to open the characters. In overall, the director's feel of reality and proportion is what that make the film so well-paced. Almost no exaggerations, precise timing.<br/><br/>
There is no sweet American-style 'work-and-be-great' fanfarous finale, which feels fine, although audience might have wanted to see Billy playing the prince, not a swan in the episode with the 'Swan Lake',  but this is just a minor detail, maybe designed to underline the consistency of the likable good character.<br/><br/>D.

","Briefly, Billy Elliot is a charming movie which , despite having to deal with an every so slightly cliched plotline, manages to overcome this by some strong performances and a slightly off-centre approach. Its definitely worth seeing and is both a decent reminder of the necessity to find ones own direction in life and a reasonable snapshot of an important period in recent British social history. One final word, there seems to be much confusion as to the accents involved here. For those who are not familiar with the intricacies of U.K. accents, none of the actors concerned, other than Jackie (Jamie's father) are speaking in their own dialects. The film is set in Easington, Co.Durham which, for those who are interested, is set part-way between the larger towns of Sunderland and Hartlepool and although most Sunderland natives wont thank me for saying it , the accent to an untrained ear, is somewhere between Geordie and Cleveland. However, Julie Walters is from Birmingham, the actor playing Jamie's brother is from Manchester and his father is a Glaswegian so if any of our American cousins struggled to find uniformity in the accents then dont be too hard on yourself."

You don't have to be a ballet fan to be enthralled by this story of a poverty-stricken kid in a grungy Welsh mining town who completely by chance becomes enthralled by the world of dance, and to his instructor's amazement and his father's and brother's dismay, has the talent and ambition to want to go all the way with it. The movie is really about the triumph of the spirit and about family love and sacrifice. It's a beautiful, yes even uplifting and inspiring film. The kid who plays Billy does an absolutely phenomenal job, way beyond his years. Don't miss it (caveat: the accents are a bit thick, and it is essential to the plot to know that the word ""pouf"", used a lot here, is analogous in the UK to our degrading American terms ""fag"" or ""queer"").

","It's not surprising so many foreigners think Britain is a class-ridden society.  A few years ago the typical British film showed Hugh Grant and various other apparently unemployed filthy rich living the high life, now the fashion is for grimy Northern pictures showing decent working folk being ground down by the forces of conservatism. Well I am British, and I don't recognise either of these stereotypes as being particularly typical of the Britain I know.<br/><br/>Of course the story of the miners' strike is an important one, and Billy Elliot does make a good attempt at telling it. But Billy Elliot is primarily supposed to be about a young boy who wants to dance, so what has that got to do with the miners' strike?<br/><br/>What I think it's got to do with it is that the script needs a father who is basically decent, but is anti-ballet-dancing.  Now in fact I'll bet that if you walk into a pub anywhere from the West End to the Gorbals, and ask what the men there think of boys doing ballet, you will get some in favour, some against, and some don't knows.  But instead the film patronises the mineworkers by assuming that northern mineworker == conservative (with a small c) =thinks ballet is for ""poofs"".  This is a cliche in the worst sense, because it's a substitute for thinking; the film robs us of the chance to see what really makes Billy Elliot's father anti-ballet, which is never explained.<br/><br/>It's also manipulative.  If Billy Elliot was the son of a millionaire and went to Eton, his parents might be just as anti-ballet, and his public-school comrades even more scornful.  But the film puts him in a stereotyped Northern family, because the scriptwriters knew that by doing that they'd tug our heartstrings more.<br/><br/>The film is worth seeing because of the acting of Billy Elliot and his dancing teacher, who have a really special and interesting relationship.  But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDB top 250."

","Billy Elliot is a moving, involving and original motion picture. It's the first Brittish film I've seen since Shallow Grave, where I actually rate it as an excellent movie, not just the usual ""it was good, for a British movie"". The film is filled with poignant moments, and never once descends to sentimental slush. Except for the ending! I can't believe I haven't read one review criticizing what I thought was a cheesy, over-sentimental and ridiculous ending to what was otherwise the best film I've seen this year. It left nothing to the imagination of the viewer, and very nearly spoiled the affect the film had on me.<br/><br/>Although I think the film is badly marred by the ending, still, this is a movie everyone should see. It is filled with visual detail and strong performances that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."

"dare31","10","0","0","21 May 2001"," There is a little boy (child) inside all of us
","I watched this movie knowing little about it except that it was about a boy who challenged social stereotypes to take up dancing. I don't know what I expected, but I was not prepared for the marvel to which I was about to sit down. Without trying to give any of the movie away, there is little doubt that this movie has tons within it to appeal to the sentimental romantic. But it is not Forrest Gump. There is nothing improbable about this movie. It heralds brilliant performances by actors who have laid the hearts of their characters bare for all to view. There can be few dry eyes when the father is torn between his rigid ideals and the honest love he has to bring his son a future. To bears repeating again, however, there is no schlock to this moment.<br/><br/>As a social commentary, this film ranks highly with Brassed Off, another political critique on Thatcherism and the cost it exacted of coal mining communities. Both films poignantly examine these costs by bringing the lesser known's, the miners and their families, to centre stage. Quirky they might seem, but life is full of quirkiness, especially if one has the courage to throw off the mantles of social constraints and conformity.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that Stephen Daldry is a first time screen director in this effort. But then, maybe it is not that surprising. Good theatre often makes its audience work and requires it to pay attention. The direction and allusions are often subtle but are hard to miss. We don't need to be told' that Billy's mother is dead by a character. Instead, we see the family interacting, and a couple of photographs, and we can deduce the rest. We are not told about the mining strike in as many words at the beginning, but the emergence of police tells us that we're in for a time of confrontation. Then we see the posters. We see the Billy's friend Debbie run her stick along wall (as children will do) and then across a battery of police shields  a darkly comic moment, but so telling of so many things including: the innocence of the children in a reeling world and the omnipresence of a police state in these small towns. In other words, we enter into' the screen and become almost ghostlike participants in the narrative, like Scrooge being led by the ghost of Christmas present. Perhaps that is why the emotions we feel are so powerful and so draining by the end. We have lived these characters' lives with them.<br/><br/>The performances deserved much more recognition at the Oscars than it received. It is not surprising that Jamie Bell didn't receive a nomination for playing Billy, but he sure played a hell of a role. I guess the Academy can only reward so many first time performances but this is one that deserved mention. Jamie is Billy, or at least he comes across like he is  and that is great acting, regardless of the actor's age. Strong and memorable performances are also provided by Jamie Draven (brother Tony) and Julie Walters (dance teacher, Mrs Wilkinson). The performance Gary Lewis (Dad) is also well presented though I can't help feeling that the role was written powerfully regardless of the actor.<br/><br/>Thus far, of the movies of 2000, I'd rank this only behind Crouching Tiger and in the company of The Contender and Wonder Boys. I easily gave the movie a 9-10 rating. A must see for all."

And men do NOT go to ""bally"" lessons ! I would have given Billy Elliott a 8/10 if it wasn`t for the pathetic ending. #MAJOR SPOILERS# In my opinion, the film should have ended when Billy entered the bus, finally going to London to have dancing lessons. But somehow the director felt it was necessary to show Billys first stage performance (this is ten years later). Besides the fact that the older Billy is not resembling the younger Billy at all, the movie does not leave you with a fantasy about what could become of Billy or his family. Instead, you see his father and brother come to London (you wonder - where does all the money for this trip suddenly come from ? They wear good clothes etc.). The friend of his teen years who enjoyed wearing his mothers dresses and had a crush on Billy (wonderful performance !)  is now, 10 years later sitting next to Billys father, wearing a woman`s hat. Unfortunately, this scene does not keep in line with the subtle, intelligent storytelling we enjoyed throughout the film - but is a rather ""straight in your face - notice this guy is gay in 3 seconds before this movie is over"" scene. A few seconds less would have made Billy Elliott an almost perfect movie."

","The film ""Billy Elliot"" gets its name from the main character who was 12 years old. He is played marvelously by 14-yr-old Jamie Bell who was discovered for this film by auditioning 2000+ boys who 1)could dance, 2)could act, 3)was the right age, and 4)who had the correct NE English accent.  Bell is so good, with the great and sincere smile or the brooding, angry face, depending on the demands of the scene. He may become a ""one-hit"" wonder, but in this film he is nothing short of award quality. No question, even though the movie is filled with fine, experienced British actors, Jamie Bell carries this film, and that is remarkable for a first-timer!<br/><br/>CAUTION -- FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --<br/><br/>The story is set in 1984, in the coal-mining (the pits) area of northeast England. Workers are on strike and Margaret Thatcher is bound to ""break"" them, which she eventually does. Billy's mother has recently died, and he now shares a flat with his caring but overtly tough father, his older brother, and his half-demented grandmother. Times are tough, no one is working in this coal-mining community, angry picketers curse and throw things at the buses of ""scabs"" crossing the line.<br/><br/>Billy is in boxing training, but in the ring, wearing his grandfather's old gloves, begins to dance around, seems that dancing is just in his blood. Much later in the movie he explains, at the end of an audition, ""I just feel like electricity when I am dancing. I become someone else."" One punch decks him in this bout.<br/><br/>Billy quite accidently becomes aware of the ballet class at the other end of the floor (British pronounce ballet as if it were spelled 'bally'), gets interested, and is encouraged by the older lady instructor. She quickly recognizes Billy's talent and encourages him to continue.<br/><br/>Two problems -- there is no extra money around for 'bally' lessons and 2) his dad is horrified at the thought that his son might become a 'bally dancer', also afraid that he might become a homosexual. Their men box, play football, etc, but dance?? No way. So Billy has to practice his dance positions secretly, and sneak out to dance practice, his dad thinking he is still boxing. Until the boxing guy says he hasn't seen Billy in weeks!<br/><br/>So dad shows up at 'bally' practice and spots Billy among the girls, and you can see him fuming, his face turning red, and pulls Billy out. But Billy keeps on, on his own.  On another occasion dad catches him in the dance studio again. This time Billy stands 6 inches (15 cm) from his dad, almost nose-to-nose, defiant face, and begins to dance. All over the room, all kinds of moves, tap, modern, 'bally' -- and stops in front of dad, who then realizes both how much his son loves 'bally' and how much talent he has.<br/><br/>Eventually Billy gets an audition in London, where dad had never even been, gets accepted, strike ends, dad is determined to see that his son gets the schooling he deserves.  Before Billy leaves, he and dad are talking, warmly, and Billy asks, ""If I change my mind I can come home, can't I?"" Dad answers, ""But I've already 'let out' your room."" They both laugh.<br/><br/>The movie ends 13 years later, Billy is 25, and his dad goes to London to see him dance as the featured performer. All we get is a quick shot of him being told his dad is there, then leaping on stage. If I were a 'bally' fan I could tell from the costume which 'bally' it was, but I am not.<br/><br/>Fine story, important time historically, families in crisis and Billy Elliot determined to pursue his dream. There is a fair amount of 'salty' language, from all characters, but it always seems to be in context with the film and how NE Englanders really spoke in 1984. I was not offended by it, but I suspect some viewers might be.<br/><br/>I hope to see this one again some day. I rate it a strong 8 of 10 and think most everyone would enjoy it. The DVD has a few extras, the most interesting being the ""making of"" with interviews of the various actors and director. The sound is DD 5.1 and mostly good.  However, the quiet dialog and British accent forced me to ""rewind"" and re-listen to some to understand them. I also had to increase the volume 6dB which is quite a lot (4X sound level) compared to most other DVDs. So I give the sound only a C- overall.  Still, this can be overcome and not a fatal flaw in an otherwise superb presentation."

","Inspired by the actual events surrounding a strike by British coal-miners in the mid-eighties, ""Billy Elliot"" is the tale of Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), an eleven year-old boy who is slowly, but quickly attracted to ballet dancing and is taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), the chain-smoking dance instructor to become one himself despite that his grumpy Dad (Gary Lewis) and Billy's older brother, Tony (Jamie Draven) who once oppose Billy's dream before seeing the potential that Billy has.  It's well-acted by all (notably Bell, Lewis, and especially Walters, who garned a Best Supporting Actress nomination), masterfully written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Daldry, who both earned Oscar nominations.  Unfortunately, the film is another innocent casualty of the MPAA, who has given it an ""R"" rating (and not ""PG-13"") although the F-word is mentioned several times, but it's used in a respectful manner and not carelessly.

When the credits rolled at the end we both knew that we had just witnessed a great movie. Brilliant is how to sum it up in one word. This film is a real credit to the British film industry and makes me proud to be British. Funny in areas and also very tragic in the circumstances of the family of Billy Elliot. The performances are great throughout and the soundtrack is also excellent (always a bonus in a movie). One thing I don't understand is why so many people commented on the bad language in the movie, I personally thought that it was damn funny and reflected the way that people talk in Britain."

","Having just seen this film for the second time i feel compelled to comment on it. Now I've discussed this with several people and most disagree but I think that theres just way too much bad language appearing gratuitously in it. Now I know its set in the miners strike ( my brother was a miner ) and that its set in the grittier end of the North East but i still can't help feeling that there are parts of it that are over the top on the language front.<br/><br/>I mean how many Ballet teachers are you aware of that swear like a trooper especially in front of an alleged child prodigy .....<br/><br/>Anyway thats my bugbear with the movie which otherwise is a nice, if somewhat formulaic, movie dealing with the raw emotion of growing up in a mixed and uncertain childhood with your mother dead, your breadwinners on strike, and your Grandmother in the advanced stages of Alzheimers, and you suddenly discover a passion for an activity thats as alien to your loved ones as ""Enjoying"" a Rambo movie is to me. I particularly like the way ""Billy"" recites his Mothers letter verbatim in an almost uninterested voice without any emotion as your average misunderstood 13 year old would. Big thumbs up for the soundtrack too."

","This is an excellent movie, well, with just one flaw: too many dirty words! Maybe it's just the reality thingy, who knows?<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is about growing up differently from others. Little Billy finds himself more interested to ballet than boxing, but his family of course are against him.<br/><br/>He finally stands up for himself and believes that he should be himself no matter what people say. Maybe that's why they chose Stephen Gately from Boyzone to sing the theme song...<br/><br/>This movie is also about family values, which makes it quite a moving one. I don't know why it wasn't nominated in Best Picture category for Oscar. It's definitely a Best Picture material because it's better than ""Chocolat"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".<br/><br/>Jamie Bell is great as Billy Elliot and he also should've been nominated for Best Actor because I think he's better than Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great movie that deserves an award!"
"Bil-3","Null","0","0","28 March 2001"," **** 1/2 Don't miss this movie!
","Those who are expecting the hilarious comedy in the vein of Four Weddings and a Funeral that is promised on the posters for this film will be severely shocked to see that they have been misled. Shocked, but by no means disappointed. Instead of the bumbling comedy this film could have been, it is instead a beautiful and poignant tale of a young man whose dreams are just too big for the town around him. Billy (an astonishingly good Jamie Bell) lives in Durham (Northern England) and one days finds himself captivated during boxing practice when a girls' ballet class finds itself sharing the same gym his team is using. <br/><br/>When he's accidentally invited to dance with the young ladies, he finds himself unable to suppress his desire to release all the power inside him through his newfound ability to dance extremely well. Julie Walters is excellent as the teacher who guides him through his burgeoning self-discovery, a role that showcases her on this side of the ocean than any since her starmaking role in Lewis Gilbert's Educating Rita. Gary Lewis is equally brilliant as the ex-boxing champion father, now a miner on strike, who just can't understand the new direction his son has taken him. The film is gorgeously lush, rich with real emotions and endearing characters, fantastic choreography and always manages to be touching without ever resorting to sentimental treacle. Sort of a companion to this year's Dancer In The Dark (though by no means as upsetting): that film showed how music can be the very beat of a person's heart, while here it is the liberation of dance that does the same. Don't miss it!"

","As soon as I saw that this was an English film I winced because I have such a hard time understanding the English accent in film. Despite going into this movie with this negative attitude, it completely won me over, which believe me, is saying a lot. Watch out for Gary Lewis, who plays young Billy's father. Every scene he's in contradicted my knowledge that this was an actor playing a character. Try to ignore the sappy sentiments from Grandma (Jean Heywood), which seem to be present only for the useless ""aw, shucks"" factor. I see that this movie was passed up for an Oscar nomination for best picture. I can't wait to see if the movie that does win can even compare to Billy Elliot."

Billy Elliot is a magnificent slice of feel-good entertainment.<br/><br/>With it's backdrop of the miner's strike of 1984, and the theme of triumph over adversity, this is bound to draw comparisons with Brassed Off and The Full Monty. However, this is a better film than both, and leaps and bounds ahead of the latter.<br/><br/>Brilliantly judged performances all round, especially from Julie Walters and Gary Lewis (Billy's teacher and his father respectively) and new-boy Jamie Bell is a revelation.

","I saw this film on a transatlantic flight recently. I saw Flashdance on a plane journey back in 1984. I thought this would be the British version of that movie some 17 years later but set back in 1984 just to prompt my memory. Seemed like a piece of history repeating itself for me.<br/><br/>I grew up in the north-east of England so I can relate to most of the scenery, accents etc. very well. Then came the unexpected bits. Firstly, Billy's grandmother suffering from dementure and wandering off...just as my mother used to do. And secondly, the scene that I'm still trying to cope with. Billy visiting his mother's grave. This grave was set in the same graveyard my parents are now interred. These are very hard things to cope with at 37,000 feet surrounded by lots of people at close proximity all of whom are strangers.<br/><br/>And I suppose I was right in a way, it had some of Flashdance in it. But for different reasons to most I will always find this movie, most memorable."

","I liked this movie. It made me laugh and eventually made me cry a little. It deals with everything from how we deal with the death of a close one to how we let him go. It also deals with achieving our ambitions against the backdrop of an hostile environment. In short it deals with everything we go through in our lives and do it good. <br/><br/>Jamie Bell is excellent as the hero and so is everyone else, though I found Julie Walters a little bit irritating. The story itself shift well between Billy Elliot and the backdrop story of the miners strikes in England in 1984. The rhythm of the film is good and it is helped by the music of that period.<br/><br/>One last thing. Is the film a gay one or not? The makers of the film left it deliberately vague. There are some hints that Billy is gay and there are some hints which contradict this assumption. It definitely in the eye of the beholder and any interpretation can be correct. The reason that many see Billy as gay is because he is an outsider and has to deal with an hostile surroundings,a feeling many gay peoples can identify with. Whether he is gay or not, is not important to the fact that this is a movie that make you feel good.<br/><br/>Go see the movie,you will not regret."

","As I watched the lights come back up in the theatre after the last roll of end credits, I couldn't help but imagine that the person who had written ""Billy Elliot"" had been spying on my life.  But not my life, really.  More like my emotions, my feelings about the experiences of my life.<br/><br/>Of course it's clear that I'm not the only one who's had feelings like that coming away from this great film.  ""Billy Elliot"" is a film which inhabits truth, breathes it; and life exudes from it.  Black or white, man or woman, straight, gay, or in between, we all carry our own personal moments of pain, joy, peace, and terror; we all know the truth of living in this world.<br/><br/>
While there are terms for movies which connect with those memories, those truths, ""Billy Elliot"" transcends all attempts to define it or pigeonhole it, or denigrate it.  You can laugh at it, at those many women and men who made it, at those who love it, but you cannot lessen the truth of it by calling it a ""chick flick"" or ""heartwarming"" or ""fantasy"" or any other label people might wish to inflict on it.  The film does have elements of all those things, but it's value as fictional truth gives it weight beyond such simple labels.<br/><br/>If you go see ""Billy Elliot"" with even the slightest desire to be more than entertained, holding the possibility that you might see a small reflection of yourself, you will leave feeling empowered in the truth and worth of your own existence; that all too occasional feeling that you are special.<br/><br/>Because, of course, the truth is, as ordinary as we all are, there is only one of each of us.  Just as important though, ""Billy Elliot"" might for one short moment in your life remind you that the world isn't always 6 billion individuals but, for precious moments, is a place where we are all one and the same."

The whole plot takes you on a journey of Billy's emotions and desires, and Bell ensures that you understand how his character is feeling for the entire film.  His friendship with Michael is also very brave, two young lads who need to be allowed to express their own personality in different ways show that friendship is a bond which cannot be broken no matter what.  It is touching but not patronising, and Walters again shows that she can perform far far better than any Hollywood name.

A lot of it is down to some marvellous performances, notably the astonishing Jamie Bell (Oscar, where art thou?) but there is also excellent writing here: the relationship between Billy and his Dad requires double-strength Kleenex; setting the story at the time of the 1984 miners' strike is a master-stroke.

My only caveat is the ending, which lent an aura of saccharine -- the movie could have ended with Billy on the bus -- and should have.

After films like Brassed Off, Get Real, The Browning Version, The Full Monty, The Winslow Bow, The Winter Guest, Sense & Sensibility,... Billy Elliot is yet another film that gets me by the throat. As usually acting is like real life performances. If I'm allowed to compare Jamie Bell with Haley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense), who got a  deserved nomination for Academy Awards, I must admit that , according to my modest but true opinion, Jamie Bell should at least get the same admission. This boy gives Billy Elliot a real soul, a honest and realistic character. After several days , I'm still dazzled by this beautiful icon of cinema.

It is like a water color painting of 1984 England with characters that are beautiful in their own imperfections (a characteristic of British films). Of course Billy Elliot isn't perfect there are few films that are. Billy Elliot's grand finale speech was a bit over done and Billy Elliot at the age of 25 looked nothing like Billy at the age of 11. But all in all this movie is a fabulous piece. If you loved Dead Poets Society, or Ordinary People this movie is truly for you.

","There is something about a boy's story as depicted in film.  It evokes our own coming of age, a cathartic moment sometimes that brings us to tears -- to see on film the events that oftentimes have touched our own lives, though I am sure few of us have found ourselves in the same situation as Billy, he still touches us -- because many of us have lost a parent, lived in confining conditions and have had dreams.  Many of us have had touching friendships and demanding, but loving teachers.  That is the power of Billy Elliot -- the story of one boy can surface our own memories, bring a tear as well.  Maybe that is why when I went to see the film me, and my friends were all crying by the closing credits!  I fell in love with Billy and his story.<br/><br/>   The innocence of a child with a vision was best seen by this reviewer in Cinema Paradiso (I during that film too!).  In Billy Elliot, the power of a child with a passion, with electrical desire to dance despite his situation as a poor boy living in the mining town of Durham, England is wrenchingly powerful.  Together with totally mesmerizing acting jobs and magical and an upbeat soundtrack the movie takes you away from wherever you are and places you right in the life of Billy Elliot.

","I don't understand the verdict of some critics and commenters that this film is flawed because of something far-fetched, derivative, or on the other hand predictable, in its basic premise.  This assumption can only come from ignorance or prejudice.<br/><br/>The fact is that as long as ballet has existed, so, necessarily, have male ballet dancers, and in considerable numbers, although of course they are not ballerinas (a term reserved for the female).  This is an honorable and demanding fine art whose adepts must be, among other attainments, athletes of a high order.<br/><br/>Female boxers also exist, but we can be thankful that they are an aberration.  Real-life Lynn Snowden Picket was, for awhile, just as serious about boxing as Billy Elliot was about dancing.  She trained for months at that crucible of the gloved greats, Gleason's gym in Brooklyn, where she insisted on a real coach, not the staff member that such places maintain especially to mollycoddle the dilettanti who like to hang around.  After proving herself by winning a professional match, she concluded that boxing is bad stuff both physically and psychologically, gave it up, and wrote a book about her experiences, _Looking_for_a_fight_, to dissuade not only women but everyone in general from this pursuit.<br/><br/>Now, anyone IMHO who notes a symmetry between two films in which, respectively, a girl aspires (if one can call it that) to a detrimental practice that most have the good sense to leave to misguided males, and a boy aspires to a noble art only reputedly dominated by females, only to maintain that the latter must be little but plagiarism simply on account of the calendar, didn't look or think very carefully and has a lot of explaining yet to do.<br/><br/>The historic coequal presence of women and men on the ballet stage being obvious from the most cursory observation, one must go on to ask where the men came from.  Surely some arose from poor and lower-class backgrounds. Although one need only click on this Web page to appreciate that the impoverished and culturally deprived have no monopoly on misunderstanding ballet, at least they have some excuse for it.  All the likelier it is, then, that some, at least, of our  actual male ballet stars had as boys to deal just as heroically with an environment like Billy Elliot's.  (Hence, I was glad to see that Billy's sexuality remained ambiguous.  He can be hetero, homo, or bisexual as each viewer wishes. As he observed, one does not have to be gay to dance well. Neither must one be straight to be admired for it.)<br/><br/>I submit, therefore, that Billy's story is, in principle, both true-to-life and worth the telling, leaving it to others to dispute, if they can, the verisimilitude of details. It is worth noting, however, that few of those all-too-happy to consign it to the dustbin over some a-priori objection have actually dared to engage themselves with what is on the screen in front of them."

","Billy Elliot: Good or Bad?<br/><br/>Having recently watched Billy Elliot , I thought I'd write a quick note about it.<br/><br/>I must admit, initially I agreed with the general consensus, that a film about a ballerina (not to mention a male one) had the prospect of being about as exciting as watching paint dry, but putting this thought aside, I went into the cinema with an open mind.<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying I'm glad I had the chance to see this film because otherwise I might have missed out on what was a compelling story. The `star to be' Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) put in the best child performance I've seen since Hayley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense), yes it was that good of a performance. This, matched up with a sturdy support cast and a solid performance from Julie Walters, made up for an unexpected (for me anyway) good film.<br/><br/>The film also touches on the miners' strike as a `side track' story to Billys' ballerina exploits. This is done very well, leaving the viewer caring about both Billy and the mining community he lives in. Some of the scenes in the film are filled with such emotion that I defy even the sternest person not to be touched.<br/><br/>So the answer to the question posed at the top. Yes Billy Elliot is a good film, but I feel that the females out there will gain more enjoyment than the average male due to its content.<br/><br/>All in all though, Billy Elliot is an enjoyable film for all."
"marchrijo","8","0","0","29 December 2000"," Boxing and Ballet, Thatcher and Blair
","Of the recent-years-""coal and music""-films (Brassed Off, The Full Monty), this is probably the best, and that's because of the acting and the human warmth in characterization. Jamie Bell (look at his reactions reading the letter from the Royal Ballet School, for instance!) gives one of the best performances I've ever seen by a child of this age. More than the other movies it tells the story of strong, ""emotionless"" people, who ""find themselves"" by losing their identities as miners and workers, by searching for a last exit from their helplessness and sadness. The career of Billy Elliot is born from despair. This is the key to understand the political and historical implications of the movie. It produces an integrative patriotic myth of the nation, by bringing together opposite cultures: coal and castles, workers and middle-class (Julie Walters!) strike and strikebreaker, boxing and ballet, not at least old sexual standards and new sexual frankness (Michael!). In a way, ""Billy Elliot"" neutralizes the great divide in british society: the sportive elegance of the ballet reflects the pragmatic flexibility of the Tony Blair England, which reconciles the Tories with labour, and the miners with the Thatcher tradition. In the very end, everybody comes together in a big national theatre and smiles at each other. Are the people just spectators of a political play, or do they form a national discussion group? It depends on death or survival of the ""swan"" Tony Blair!"

","The film has moment of exhilaration when the acting, direction, editing, musical score and camera work all come together superbly.  I found myself weeping unexpectedly in many places throughout the film.  Some elements did not work for me, like the presence of the old granny and both young Debbie's and young Michael's attempts to seduce Billy.  Nor are all the attempts at humor 100% successful.  But these are minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.  On the whole this was a very enjoyable movie.  Special huzzahs for actors Julie Walters (all too rare on the screen since Educating Rita) as Billy's dance teacher, Gary Lewis as Billy's poor beleaguered father, and the amazingly natural child performer, Jamie Bell in the title role.  This is definitely one of 2000's best films.  The British dialects may be hard for most Americans to understand, but I'd still recommend it to intelligent adult filmgoers."

","I walked into the cinema not knowing what to expect and that really rewarded my viewing.  It was quite realistic - but also sweet and endearing.  It contrasted the harsh realities of the mining protests (with great cinematography) with this boys gentle love of ballet who is caught between his love of a ""poofy"" art with the harsh realities of redundancy in his own family.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell's performance is truly unique and upon thought, mildly disturbing.  His role as Billy Elliot is slightly dysfunctional but also unbelievably intriguing.  Even though everyone has praised this movie and this actor way too much, he really deserves a shout when it gets to OSCAR time.  I'm not sure it will do the lad any good, but for his performance in the film alone, he should at least be nominated.<br/><br/>I was taken back by the dance sequences which were pretty sensational. It was a light-hearted film but the dance scenes were intense and quite poignant at times. I was intrigued by his way of expressing his anger through dance - quite astonishing.<br/><br/>Bad points - I still do not like how the film ended. Its too trite for my liking.  At one point, sentimental music spoiled a good moment in the film near the end when Billy starts dancing in front of his dad.  It would have been more surreal if they just left the music out of that scene entirely - I like surreal!<br/><br/>All in all, this film is heart-warming yet foul-mouthed, delightful yet at times superficial - but most of all, its well worth a watch."

","`Billy Elliot'  (2000)<br/><br/>***Out of ****<br/><br/> 	One of those films they have to drag you to see and you end up having a pretty good time.  What's the first thing that comes to mind when they tell you the movie is about a young boy that wants to become a ballerina, boring right?  Well somehow Billy Elliot was different.  It was a touching film with a good steady plot.  Unfortunately it was inappropriate for the younger audience who would enjoy it the most.  There were just too many F-words for the younger viewers, although it was touching to everyone else who went.<br/><br/>   The most annoying thing that I found with it was, without a doubt the opening credits.  How many times does he have to jump?  Let alone the fact that the closing credits were the same.  The main plot was very steady but there were quite a few subplots, too many if you ask me.  The family was completely dysfunctional from the beginning, from the insane Grandma, to the older brother who hates the world, to the dad who is emotionally unstable, to Billy who wants to be a ballerina.  Then they bring in this little side plot about Billy and his dance teacher and her family.  After that they show us a minor relationship between Billy and his little girlfriend. Then out of the blue his friend is a transvestite and he appears to be gay. Then Billy appears to be gay also.  It's a movie about a messed up kid, in a messed up family, in a messed up neighborhood, in a messed up world, all in a messed up movie that somehow bring along laughs, and for some people tears.<br/><br/>
	 The movie was saved with the good acting, directing and the relationship between both. The film had a good morale and in the end Billy is happy, everyone else is still miserable but at least the main character is happy. Billy's friend is happy because his is in a relationship and is finally being excepted for what he is.  This is a good film if you don't mind Scottish accents and a lot of F-words, but it's definitely not for children."

","The young boy in the title role of this film shares a similar history to the eponymous hero - a working class boy from a pit village who harbours a dream of becoming a ballet dancer. This shared background may have contributed to his completely natural performance.Anyone who has witnessed the psychological growing pains of young teenage boys will recognise and respond to the scenes where Billy struggles to express his feelings or shrugs off the clumsy attempts of adults to connect with his world.Unlike 'Brassed off', where the setting of the miners strike threatens to submerge the more personal dramas,the context serves to explain the struggles of the family without condoning, or patronising,the choices they make.<br/><br/>The film plays on every emotion (I got through a lot of hankies) but never descends into mawkishness - though there were a couple of occasions when it teetered on the edge.Julie Walters is excellent as the ballet teacher but the finest performances come from Jamie Bell as Billy and Gary Lewis who is absolutely magnificent as the father whose whole raison d'etre is turned upside down.<br/><br/>This film is likely to rank amongst the very finest of those heart warming 'Gritty Northern' films such as Kes and, of course, the Full Monty."

","I saw this film last night at a small screening, 10 weeks before its UK release, and UIP have taken exactly the right tack in making sure that this film is the hit at the box office that it deserves to be.<br/><br/>It's a lovely, funny, moving film, set in an impoverished (aren't they all?) town in the North of England, in the early eighties. The film centres around a young lads struggle to become a ballet dancer, set against the wider conflict of the Miners strikes. In the same vein as recent hits like East is East, Little Voice and Full Monty (see? doesn't ANYONE have any money north of Watford?), it drags out of you the same gamut of human emotions. What shines through in this film, in addition to the moving script and high standard of acting, is the beauty of the film making. The choreographed scenes where the excellent young actor 'dances' his frustration out against walls and bins and outhouse doors are fantastic. A hit at Cannes, it deserves to replicate this success on it's release in September. Thoroughly recommended."

It's the depressing struggle of boring Northern suburban life and its been done before many times.. father loses job etc etc.  Quite frankly its crap and dull. The acting from the wannabe ballet dancer was average, though but next to the Sixth Sense kid its poop.

"tedg","Null","3","8","1 August 2010"," Battle Dancer
","This is a replacement comment.<br/><br/>Though the dance was passable here, the story is so vapid and unembellished, I sat there looking for another movie. And I found one, battling to get out. It was clever and true, overlooked because of the mediocrity placed in front of it. You can find the tragedy of an eleven year old girl in northern England. Her father was caught in an affair and also fired, so he sits around the house getting drunk. Meanwhile the topic of sex (urges, power and denial) pervades every moment of her home environment.<br/><br/>Debbie approaches menarche in this atmosphere which heightens her curiosity about sex. She is rejected by her sexually frustrated mother, so the attraction of sex combines with a need for companionship. Her mother starts a ballet class for Debbie and her little girl peers, in the hope that some of her lost accomplishment and youth will revive, if not in Debbie, perhaps one of her friends. Thus, Debbie is transformed into pupil from daughter. But neither Debbie nor any of the other girls shows any talent or focus.<br/><br/>So her mother seizes on a boy Debbie's same age who wanders in. She takes advantage of his own lack of identity -- exacerbated from the normal vortex of puberty by sexual confusion and the loss of his mother. Debbie's mother gives this boy some focus and is able to charm him into the enterprise of dance.<br/><br/>The core of the film is Debbie's attempts to come to terms with this usurper sibling, by similarly trying to charm him with anything at her disposal, including her childish sex. The battle between mother and daughter for Billy takes on the more abstract battle between the charms of sex and the drive for personal expression. Much of the real estate of the film is taken up in Billy's reaction, including some dances which play out this battle.<br/><br/>There's other guy stuff going on in the background as well, fights and strikes but they merely are there to provide a loud noise to illustrate the challenge of little-girlness. Ultimately, Debbie loses the battle because Billy is really gay (something the mother sees straightaway), and she is presumably doomed to a wasted life as non-entity in a dying coal town. (At the end, we see Billy's lover, the grownup, more clearly gay childhood friend.)<br/><br/>Nicola Blackwell utterly steals this film as Debbie, shining completely through all the noise and motion that swirls around her. There is an unforgettable scene where after a pillow fight, with Billy on top of her, she strokes his cheek-- one of the strongest images of the entire year. (The next time we see her, she plays Lolita, offering herself opencrotched and lollipop sucking. It is the last time we see her. Afterwards, her surrogate takes the place: the little blond girl who is consistently outside his back yard.) <br/><br/>That stroking scene establishes the emotional apogee. She also has the perigee (the comic center): when walking with Billy, she holds a stick against the wall, then walks by lined up cops, similarly holding the stick against their genitals protected by shields.<br/><br/>You might enjoy this -- be transported into how a sexually frustrated little girl imagines the world -- much more powerful than 'Dancer in the Dark.'."

"TheNorthernMonkee","6","2","5","17 January 2005"," clever British story with some superb performances
","SPOILERS For many years now, there's been some negative assumptions about the Ballet. For all the criticism though, ballet remains one of Britain's most popular art forms. Part of this might be down to the success of 2000's ""Billy Elliot"". With some superb performances and an excellent soundtrack, this film remains entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>In the North of England, people were suffering during the Miner Strikes. For reasons too complicated to go into, communities were divided as people's lives were destroyed. In this living hell, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is living with his own problems. Loosing his mother at a young age, Elliot fails to really communicate with his father (Gary Lewis) and elder brother (Jamie Draven). One day though, Elliot discovers a surprising passion, ballet.<br/><br/>From the offset, ""Billy Elliot"" attempts to tug at the heart strings. Introducing us to the mother's gravestone almost straight away, the film does try too hard at times. The irony is that whilst intentional moments don't click, there are moments when the film relaxes itself and these moments are the finest parts. Scenes where Billy's father reaches breaking point are in particularly brilliant.<br/><br/>As Billy's father, Gary Lewis is a revolution. Whilst Bell might have won all the awards, Lewis is absolutely breathtaking as the miner, angry with life. With a full range of emotion the character connects on so many levels with the audience and irrelevant of whatever mistakes he makes, we never stop feeling for him.<br/><br/>Aside from Bell & Lewis, others perform admirably in this film. Julie Walters as Billy's instructor is great, as is Draven as his elder brother. In fact, child and adult alike, there is not one bad performance in the entire film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about ""Billy Elliot"" is it's soundtrack. With classics from bands like T-Rex and The Clash, it sounds like a pub jukebox album.<br/><br/>Whilst not as amazing as is often claimed, ""Billy Elliot"" remains an acting masterclass. With some stunning performances and a powerful script, this film is well worth watching. Add an excellent soundtrack too, and there are aspects to please everyone."

Until one day his father felt the flame inside his son did he really put himself on the right track. Surprisingly so did the father. He had lost his wife. He did nothing but wasting his time on strike. That's evil because he wanted to gain more than he paid. He was lost. Everything went wrong in his life. But Billy sparked the hope for him. That salvaged the family. God did not forget him. His wife was once an angel for him and now his son took the role. Things went better and better. He knew how to make joke and smiled again. Sometimes giving gains more than taking. That's what we call family. His tear in the ending meant much more than his shouting in strike. To me the father also took the leading role in this movie.

"jchandbab","2","4","14","28 October 2000"," The Latest 'Great British Movie' on the block
","I have to admit that the main reason I went to see this movie was because of the many comparisons with 'the Full Monty' (which remains one of my favourite films).  Therefore, I went in with high hopes.  Unfortunately, what I got was not what I paid a fiver for.<br/><br/>It starts off well, displaying the basic background of Billy, his family and the small northern England in which he lives. This is useful as it also illustrates early on that there is a mining strike on, which is the sub-plot to Billy's ambitions to dance.  What comes next is 90 minutes of some of the most formulaic cinema you are likely to see.  Every up and down and up again that Billy experiences is set in the template that the 'Full Monty' created- from the reaction to the 'initial' success, to the fall in morale when something goes wrong, to the fact that the comedy (mainly miffed and ironic facial expressions) is essentially the same, just that the adult cast of the 1997 film carry it better.<br/><br/>Having criticised it so much, I would like to point out that 'Billy Elliot' is not a 'bad' film.  The acting (especially that of Julie Walters, the dance teacher) is pretty much flawless, while it is undeniable that the plight of the main character and its results are able to move the hardest of heart. The main problem is that these poignant moments don't occur often enough. The story of the strike involving Billy's father and brother turns out to be far more interesting in many ways, which is a shame, considering so much heart has obviously been put into this production, especially the choreography of the dance sequences, which are breathtaking. However, the final word must go to Steven Gately, who in his theme song 'I Believe', really sums up the whole experience: So, So predictable."
"ogami-itto","1","6","26","20 July 2003"," Sentimental and cliched
","British films seem to follow a set pattern of late. Or at least the ones that perform well outside of Britain. They either feature actors that couldn't even become stars on British t.v. pretending to be gangsters but coming across more as if they're starring in a bad episode of Minder (i.e. Guy Ritchie films) or they're heartwarming tales where the working classes find a talent to help them overcome their poverty (Full Monty) or they're kitchen sink dramas full of misery (any Mike Leigh film with the exception of Topsy Turvey). Billy Elliot ignores the Guy Ritchie route and instead seeks to combine aspects of Mike Leigh and The Full Monty. Here we're presented with a young working class lad who learns to dance in order to escape small town life. Trouble is Full Monty had jokes and Mike Leigh films have exceptional actors, here we get neither. Everything about Billy Elliot is cloying and manipulative, the scenes of the miners strikes add nothing to the movie and appear to be there just to add a weighty backdrop to the movie. In a film like Brassed Off the miners strike was used to deepen the emotional core of the movie, here it's just something that's there for a feeble tug at the heart strings. Everything about this film appears to have been lifted from a better movie. It's a shame that a talented actor such as Gary Lewis had to be involved with this nonsense. And it would have been nice if the lead actor had some talent whether it be for acting or dancing, Jamie Bell appears to have neither, he is the most annoying juvenile screen lead in a long time and hopping about like he has a crab in his underwear every ten minutes does not a dancer make. Sugary and insulting."

","Sure, Billy Elliot can be considered an endearing drama, and you do want to root for Billy to succeed. The story of a boy going against the male-ego dominated society in Northern England and fulfilling his dream of becoming a dancer is charming indeed. BUT...a subplot involving Billy's gay friend is ridiculous. While so many on here have gone sugary over Billy Elliot's charms, I'm concentrating here on a major problem:<br/><br/>The writers in movie-world have this idea that all gay male characters (in this case, Billy's friend) HAVE to be cross-dressers and have a desire to be like women. That whole subplot was unnecessary and just takes a huge step backward for intelligence. They must be listening to too much Howard Stern. Yes, we know Billy is heterosexual, and in order to have him pursue his ""non-masculine"" dream of dancing and come off looking respectable, the actual gay character is portrayed as a stereotype, dressing up in his mother's clothes (shades of that character of Billy Crystal's in ""Soap""). By the end of the film he shows up at Billy's big dance debut looking straight out of Queer Eye with an equally prissy black man, who has an expression on his face like he just dined on a very sour lemon. Face the facts, movie writers: the majority of cross-dressers are heterosexual, not gay. If you're going to establish that the young boy is going to be gay as an adult, show us other things instead of the usual tired stereotypes. If the character were a lesbian instead, you can bet she'd be ""hot,"" talk like any other woman, and not have any butch mannerisms. I don't know who the writers keep learning what they know about gay culture from, but all the gay men I know are quite blue collar and definitely not FABulous. I'm really sick of filmmakers and TV folks who only know how to show things ONE way, instead of showing the truth or at least showing a variety.<br/><br/>If the ridiculous gay subplot were not in the film, I'd have highly recommended Billy Elliot to friends. Sorry though, I just get annoyed with his friend's portrayal as a cliché stereotype, so many points are taken off for that one. Think of it this way, any youngster that might have thoughts he/she might be gay and see this portrayal in the film, it would really screw up his idea of what being gay is.....<br/><br/>OK, now you folks can read all the other reviews of praise on IMDb, just understand how little things in a film like what I mentioned can hold back any true progress for some people overall."

I'm totally immune to this charmless little twit.<br/><br/>And, except for one exuberant, and actually enjoyable, few minutes in a scene with Julie Walters, there's really no clear evidence that young Billy is remotely ready for the Royal Ballet.

Daldry displays a visual elegance, but does not always succeed in balancing the parallel stories of Billy and the coal miner's strike.

","Set against the disastrous miner's strike of the 1980's (unless you were a policeman on over-time pay), we find young Billy Elliot. He is too much of a kid to grasp the enormity of social and political issues. He is an observer. Things happen around him and implode upon his family life.<br/><br/>But he definitely has no desire to go down t'pit. His sights are set elsewhere - as a dancer.<br/><br/>In the steadfast working-class world of coal-mines, pubs and self-respect, nothing could be more out of place or less macho than dancing. Something for posh girls, perhaps, but certainly not working-class boys. Ballet? It's the stuff of pansies.<br/><br/>The conflict between the two extremes is almost a cliché in itself. But we can let that pass because it is sublimely acted, and the contrast between Billy's aspirations and the turmoil of the times is realised with heart-rending authenticity.<br/><br/>What is disappointing is that the movie appears to confirm the prevailing prejudice by actually casting Billy as a homosexual. It's as if all of those gruff, bluff voices at the working-men's clubs have collectively announced 'Thar - I tou'd thee so!' Perhaps many dancers are homosexual. But it doesn't follow that all homosexuals want to be dancers. It may also be that most ballet dancers in particular have what might be called 'an ambiguous sexual identity', but this movie tends to underscore the prejudice as a presumption. In doing so it over-simplifies Billy Elliot's dilemma by associating his desire to dance with emergent homosexuality. Life is not always that straightforward. And I personally think greater depth would have been lent to his character if he had been portrayed as a heterosexual youth coming to terms with an urge to dance whilst at the same time having to confront all of the contrarian elements of his inherent masculinity and expectations of manliness. Scripting him as 'gay' might have been politically-correct, but it glosses-over what could have been much more complex drama by suggesting it as an explanation in itself.<br/><br/>In 1970, we saw another young Billy in the movie 'Kes'. It was filmed and acted in a much more understated way which - although offering a less dramatic take on life, and therefore often dismissed as 'boring' by those not born of Yorkshire stock - nevertheless offers a more authentic view of life as it was 'oop north' in the days of the pit.<br/><br/>'Kes' is also more realistic because his family are neither enlightened nor supportive. Although he craves escape as much as his later namesake, we all know that there is no hope for him. The mine will surely swallow him up (though 13 years later he'll be out on strike).<br/><br/>Billy Elliot, then, is very much 'Kes' revisited. Where Billy was left in 1970, alone, neglected, hopeless and cradling a dead kestrel; this time our hero is spared his dismal fate and given opportunity and hope. It's a feel-good movie with a happy ending. But it seems bogus for all of that. How many miner's sons become ballet dancers? <br/><br/>I'll stick with 'Kes'. It's grim, but at least it's 'true'."

","BILLY ELLIOT is about an 11 year-old boy who hates boxing and instead of continuing with this class, switches to ballet. He loves to dance but is afraid to tell his working-class family because of the perceived ""unmanliness"" of dance, so he practices without their knowledge until he can no longer hide it--as he has a chance to go to a prestigious ballet academy in London. Will his father and weasel-like older brother back off and let him be who he wants to be or will Billy be cursed to be stuck in a dying town for the rest of his life?<br/><br/>I was very surprised that an inspirational movie like BILLY ELLIOT would be rated R. Generally, this sort of movie is perfect family fare and in so many ways this film is. However, the profuse use of vulgarities really make this a family-unfriendly film and it loses most of its audience. It wasn't just the language that was crude, but hand gestures and sexualized nature of the film that disturbed me. Now for non-British audiences, this might not seem as bad because some of the references have different meanings in other countries. The word ""fanny"" and the gesture looking like the ""peace sign"" are interpreted 100% differently in the US, for example--as here, neither would be considered obscene or family-inappropriate. Some may argue that the film used these crudities because that is how people are in these mining towns and perhaps this is true, but would it have seriously negatively impacted the film if these references would have been toned down? I sure doubt it AND the movie could have reached a much wider audience. This is all a real shame, as the structure of the film is similar to many family films. You know, one where someone or a group overcomes tons of obstacles in order to make their dream come true. Plus, as you KNOW that they will win in the end (so there isn't much real tension), this is a style film that might NOT appeal to the more discriminating adult viewer and SHOULD have more appeal more to kids.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it's very well made and entertaining. The acting is fine, the cinematography and direction are all fine. It is a good film--though also one that isn't a ""must-see"" due to it being rather formulaic and therefore predictable. Worth a look, but don't rush out to rent this one."

","Billy Elliot is a movie in which demonstrates the whole idea of what it is like to be a male in a society. In the beginning of the movie Billy started off by boxing at an after school program. At the same location, there was a ballerina course as well. Billy started to gain interest in how to be a ballerina. Due to this, he started practicing ballet without his father knowing. He had to hide this from his dad because being a male ballet dancer was not acceptable; it wasn't a male thing to do. When Billy started taking these classes he would hide his ballerina under his bed, but he than started practicing at home and his father started noticing his change. Mrs. Wilkinson was Billy's trainer and she helped him out by giving him private lessons. She saw a lot of talent in Billy and she knew that Billy could make it big. So she got him an interview at the Royal Ballet School. When Billy's father found out that he was practicing ballet he went furious. He was embarrassed by his son and it was a disgrace to him. His brother was against Billy as well. But later on, Billy's dad gave in and saw his son had real potential in being a ballet dancer. He accompanied Billy to his interview and he was anxious in knowing if Billy got into the school. They later find out that Billy was accepted and he went off to his new school. When Billy had his fist real show, Billy's dad and brother made sure that they went to see him. Billy's dad had tears in eyes to see that his son accomplished what he really wanted and besides all the trouble that he went through he managed to make it big. This movie very much depicts the identity of what it is like to be a male and what society categorizes males as. It shows that anything in this world can be accomplished if one really tries to achieve their dreams."

You see his whole family as how he does, until a pivotal scene at the end of the film. I think the relationship Billy makes with the instructor is beautiful. parts of it have me laughing so hard i can't breathe. i love it :) Also, i find that it deals with the stereotypes most male dancers have to deal with. The fact that Billy is such a lovable character completely adds to the attraction of the movie. You start to worry about what will happen to this boy, you care about him.

","I'm so happy to see so many people love this movie - to me, it is a textbook for overly-spoiled American kids. It is just wonderful to be able to relate to the problems in this family, and then seeing them getting resolved. Billy is a revelation - I love grandma !! All that background story about the mines and the comedy that's in it - then the sudden break-down of Dad - is so real-life. I wasn't the least bit surprised to see the little, sissy boy in there - and thought Billy was a champ the way he handled it. The ballet-teacher was a female drag-queen, and wonderful.....I wonder if she picked-up her daughter was hot for Billy? The whole story was so full of every-day happenings, but the grandest theme and point made was the total turn-around by Dad. I had the greatest empathy with him when they went to the ballet-school. He knew he was way out-of-place, but stuck to his plan to do the best he could by a son he didn't truly understand.<br/><br/>As others have written, the ending was so appropriate - the sissy all grown-up with her lover and in drag, and those two macho miners not the least bit bothered. To have Billy be the star in Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" was a shocker - but should have been expected. How many Americans do you think have seen that ballet ? This kind of movie tears me up, because they are so real - keep them coming ! Double-bravo to all -"

","It could have been boxing or singing, but what we saw in this movie was a deep insight related to dysfunctional families in the world and the emotional foresight of a man, Billy's father, who renounces personal beliefs only to support not a son, not a man, but a person who had a natural gift. I'd like to recommend those sequences in which the father fights against his impulses, against the common thoughts, because this gives Billy the strength to keep on even knowing the family disintegration was consumed. The soundtrack is a delicate piece that shows the struggle underneath Billy and the importance, the subliminal importance of music in life, expressed through motion."

","Rather Unknown 14 year old actor Jamie Bell portrays the title character, Billy Elliot. Bell carries the weight of the film on one foot. The film sets up the obvious with Billy's plight but never the less, it captures the heart and spirit of the viewer and is an inspiration to those young hopefuls who want to do more than dream.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Daldry sets up the obstacles splendidly. He creates an environment of strife and conflict brought about by the institutions of society. Billy Elliot is about following your spirit. It suggests that we get one chance in this life to let our spirits fly. The film is set in Ireland during a coal strike that has Billy's dad and brother full of pride as they stand off against the union. Billy's grandmother symbolizes the state of mind that happens when we let that one chance of flying be taken away by the institutions.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell dances on rooftops and in the streets without the Hollywood influence that plaqued Footloose. The film touches on individuality and the outside forces that seek to take it away. The film has tender moments of sexual identity. Billy Elliot grabs the heart from the start and does not let go even after the last shot. It is a powerful film that provokes the spirit of the viewer as well their tear ducts."

While searching for something to watch at the local library, the VHS version was sitting there waiting for someone to borrow it. I must be getting old, because I had forgotten most of the story over the last half decade. I was reminded of the wonderful soundtrack, performances, directing, cinematography etc. After viewing it a number of times this week I went back to IMDb to research the cast and crew. I was then shocked to learn that the part of Jimmy in King Kong was Jamie Bell. I'm really happy to see his career is doing so well, and that he will be in the upcoming Flags of our Fathers with the equally talented Adam Beach. IMO it would be a shame to describe the film to someone who hasn't seen it.

My gosh, the reviews were right -- this is not a schmaltzy just feel good movie. <br/><br/>It's even better then ""Brassed Off"" as a working-class-and-the-arts-movie. It reminded me of my favorite scene in King Vidor's ""Our Daily Bread"": ""Your contribution to the group will be giving violin lessons to our children."" (chokes me up every time I see that).<br/><br/>The emotion is ratcheted up here because the miners are in the middle of the doomed anti-Thatcher strikes and the dancing kid is simply incredible. The story is told visually through his face, body language amidst the different pressures he's caught between, and that irrepressible dancing (though not comparable to be in Oscar contention vs. non-dancing adults). <br/><br/>This isn't just about working class attitudes towards ballet and gays; their political and financial struggles are real, putting their bodies on the line for their solidarity and economic future.<br/><br/>In the midst of being ""unfulfilled,"" as even the middle class representatives are, is one kid's glimmer of something inconceivable--being different.

Granted, his family is rather shocked at this, but the newfound talent helps Billy through life.<br/><br/>Every part of this movie was perfectly done; I can't possibly stress it sufficiently. A particularly moving scene shows Billy's father scabbing on the other workers. Another of the many great movies to come from England."
"jboothmillard","8","1","2","8 July 2005"," Billy Elliot
","I am quite keen on the films involving a dreaming and performing kid, and this one is no exception, from director Stephen Daldry (The Hours). Basically Billy Elliot (BAFTA winning Jamie Bell) started out going for 50p to a boxing club, pretty normal for an eleven year old, and then he is fascinated by a ballet club, and he feels an urge to keep going. As he learns more and more moves, routine and poses from teacher Mrs. Wilkinson (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Julie Walters) she is very impressed by his talent and enthusiasm. Eventually his Dad, Jackie (Gary Lewis) finds out his little secret and is quite appalled, threatening and despising. But Billy keeps working to achieve his dream for auditioning to join a professional ballet school. His brother Tony (Jamie Draven) obviously takes longer to get any reaction or care, but his Dad eventually gives in and is behind him at his audition. There is one point here I recognised particular words that Elton John borrowed for the lyrics of his song ""Electricity"" for Billy Elliot: The Musical, and after this he is successful, and when he leaves that is when his brother is quite emotional, and the coal mine strikes end. The dance routines from Bell as Jamie are fantastic, he's like a mini Fred Astaire for the 20th Century, and Walters is really good as the teacher. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Stephen Warbeck, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for both director Stephen Daldry (The Hours) and writer Lee Hall, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Julie Walters was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Very good!"
"steven.gough","Null","1","2","16 October 2000"," Un-original, un-inspiring, typically dreary, dull and predictable British melodrama.
","The Emperor has no clothes.<br/><br/>I stand, terrified, at the lip of the yawning chasm of unreality that separates us from this film. I know it's a vain hope, given the weight of popular opinion, but someone should point out how mediocre this film really is, how little it has to say about life in general, and how much less about real life in England in the 1980s.<br/><br/>At home in the UK it has been hyped as the new ""Full Monty"", much like every new home-grown film that isn't the new ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".  Now, if memory serves, ""The Full Monty"" was a comedy, so did I just fall asleep and miss the joke?  This film is a dull, predictable, parochial melodrama about a self-obsessed, untalented child who lays waste to the lives of those around him, set against a background of grim, working class calamity worn to cliche by overuse.  Oh ha ha ha.  Stop, please, I can't breathe.<br/><br/>If you've been watching British movies over the last 5 years you'd be forgiven for thinking the only socially, historically significant event here since the end of World War 2 was the 1984 Miner's Strike.  On the bright side, obviously, it meant the plucky if sexually frustrated men of our nation could rise to the challenge of adversity with a host of quirky alternative lifestyles, from stripping, or playing in a brass band, to re-painting the electricity pylons that stride across our rolling countryside.  The British film industry has subjected hundreds of thousands of us to this grim procession of increasingly overwrought and improbable stories, the least and hopefully last of which is this strange fairy-tale of a graceless, limply homo-erotic ballet dancer and his cartoon grotesque family.<br/><br/>It's a ""timeless"" story, in the worst possible sense.  Even with the home advantage for cultural references, I couldn't tell when it was supposed to be set. The cobbled streets and narrow back-alleys of the ""Northern"" town setting have become all-purpose visual shorthand for the deprived English working class from any time since the Victorians.  Billy and his brother listen to mid-70s T. Rex the way kids do only to contemporary pop.  The house is decorated in drab 70s kitsch, and the kids' clothes are straight out of a 70s revival costume grab-bag.  The boys look very fey in their tight T-shirts, which I'm sure is the effect they were looking for, but they're jarringly out of time.<br/><br/>You can't blame the writer for the way the set was dressed, but who else takes responsibility for the one-dimensional characters?  It's become an easy refuge for ""serious"" British screenwriters to surround a young central character with surly, bitter adult men, physically brutal with no verbal or emotional vocabulary, and sexually frustrated, ironic women.  Every older man here is a grim, taciturn, proud, homophobic drunk.  There's no scope for subtle character playing, all emotion arises out of frustration and confrontation,  so most family arguments just play at the HIGHEST POSSIBLE VOLUME.  Even Julie Walters takes refuge here when called on to be anything more than ironically brusque.<br/><br/>The children are emotionally and sexually liberated, something their parents either don't believe or can't understand.  This is less an analysis of the hot-house maturity of modern children, particularly since this is a ""historical"" tale set in the 70s or 80s, than a springboard for some cheap thrills and laughs.  The dance teacher's equally pre-pubescent daughter suggests, ""I'll show you me fanny"" - hopefully dubbed to ""pussy"" in the U.S. so viewers didn't miss the point - and what were we supposed to make of their sexy pre-teen-on-pre-teen pillow fight and feathery fondling?  Billy's best friend, the 11 year old son of a transvestite, puts on his sister's dress, paints Billy with make-up and tries to kiss him.  I'm sure the writer found these moments edgy and confrontational, rather than either lame or salacious.<br/><br/>Finally, at the heart of the film, the dance sequences are laughable.  The young actor has neither style or grace, and the budget apparently didn't run to a choreographer.  What we're presented with might be charming from a dearly loved 8 year old, but you wouldn't expect a major dance institution to take it seriously.  The black kid in ""Fame"" who aces the auditions as O.J. Simpson getting into an elevator in ""Towering Inferno"" is more convincing.<br/><br/>This isn't a great and life-affirming film, it's a tired and dull re-tread of a very old story.  Billy is an unpleasant character, leaving a trail of broken spirits and humiliation in his wake.  He breaks his father's spirit completely, forced to compromise every principle, reduced to tears and humiliated in front of his work-mates, and patronised by the alien life forms at the Royal Ballet School.  Two of his peers fling their budding sexuality at his feet, he teases both and casts one aside without a thought. The ballet teacher is, ultimately, used and cast aside too.  Her rejection at the first audition is thoughtless, his half-hearted attempt to thank her later pitiful, and the bitter emptiness of her disappointment as they part is clear.  This is echoed and magnified in the final scene, when she is excluded from his success.<br/><br/>Oh ha ha ha.  Please, please stop.  I can't stand it."

In short, if our American pals had there way, we'd all be speaking like Dick Van Dyke did in Mary Poppins (which is of course still an utterly brilliant film). Anyway, the as yet unidentified Nothern accents aside (which I found very enjoyable) let's get down to tearing this film apart!<br/><br/>Actually, I'm not going to tear it apart. It charmed me, despite it's often manufactured manuscript. Stories should progress naturally, sometimes this film was manufactured. When a writer writes, he does so from the guts. Often when film writers write, they are thinking mostly about the viewers guts; which is fine if you can do it well, but most often it feels like someone is wanting you to feel a certain emotion, and that's not very nice, or clever. Still, there are times when the feelings are genuine, like Billies family waiting for him to open the letter from London, or his father running to the Miner's hall to tell the good news. These were genuine highs, and they made the film, for me at least, worthwhile."

It is a painful experience to watch a boring child who hails from an even more boring family and town try and be a ballet dancer.

","Lee Hall has written acclaimed stage plays, radio plays and TV movies.  So how has his talent transferred to the big screen?  If you are in the right frame of mind then his film is a feel-good breath of fresh air.  But you have to be willing to ignore some major flaws.<br/><br/>The central premise of a boy discovering dance with the coal dispute of 1984 in the background is a good one.  The strike gives an original twist to what is a simple bog-standard rites-of-passage story but it doesn't really complement the main story.  There are a couple of times where the strike affects what Billy wants; the first time to do with the audition and his brother is unconvincing and strange.  The second time to do with the audition and his father is brilliant but then goes nowhere as it has no consequences which is simply unbelievable.<br/><br/>For the rest of the film the strike seems more like extraneous conflict to bring in action when Billy learning dancing gets too boring. There were lots of conflicts relating to Billy and his relationships they could have used instead which would have kept the film more focussed but instead they decided to keep the characterisations shallow and go for the big irrelevant event.<br/><br/>In fact, we don't really get to know any of the characters that well especially Billy's father and brother.  They start out by hating Billy  - which is bizarre and never explained - so the subsequent inevitable coming together seems completely unconvincing.  We also see Billy resolving a particular conflict with his ballet teacher at the end but he had no conflict with her to resolve.  It was his father's conflict, Billy had nothing to do with it.  This relationship with the teacher is crucial but isn't dealt with properly just so the focus can move to the father.  To be fair a lot of these problems could have been in the directing or editing rather than in the writing.<br/><br/>Hall does veer away from schmaltz, which is to his credit, but he does it mainly by having the characters swear a lot.  But in the main the dialogue is very good and nothing made me cringe, which is good considering the story.<br/><br/>The first act is good and then the usual second act problems happen but this is meant to get better again when the third act kicks in but the film actually gets worse scene by scene ending with a stupid embarrassing flash forward.<br/><br/>Stephen Daldry makes his directorial debut and is already being held on a par with Sam Mendes, a fellow theatre director turned movie director.  I simply don't see it. Like Mendes, he coaxes excellent performances from the cast. Unlike Mendes, in all other aspects, his direction was disappointing - to say the least.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like - and expected to like - Billy Elliot and compared to many recent British films, it's good but it simply isn't good enough."

"torigemi3","Null","1","3","6 May 2007"," Gender Identity In Billy Elliot
","During a time of a Minor Strike in 1984 acknowledging self purpose was the last thing on Billy Elliot's mind. The film Billy Elliot takes the audience through the internal personal battle of a young boy named Billy and the struggle to hide his secret talent and love for Ballet from his family and friends because of the boundaries set by society dealing with gender and sexual identity. The assumption that male dancers must be homosexual and essentially being compared to the stereotype of what is considered ""female"" has always been an issue. Billy Elliot embraces these qualities and turns their falsity into fuel for self fulfillment. <br/><br/>The vibe from the film initially distinguishes male and female confinements from the first main scene. This is displayed by the building where character Billy, played by Jamie Bell, boxes and the ballet class is held. It's no surprise that there are no female boxers or male ballerina taking lessons. The boys were all promptly informed to not look at the girls in the ballet class because they were either looking at them in a sexual way or be considered a homosexual for enjoying the sight of ballet. One theme occurring in the movie was the relationship between Billy and friend Michael, played by Stuart Wells. Their friendship was not sexual in that Billy was not gay despite the fact that Michael was. Michael asks him ""are you a puffer"" a slang term referring to homosexuality, again displaying this idea that if his friend is a Ballet dancer he must be homosexual. In one scene where both kids are in the gym on Christmas Eve, Michael has on a tutu and Billy is dancing around. Billy's father walks in and sees the two together thinking that something must be going on between them. The most important battle Billy has to face in the film is between his family and his personal acceptance. At first Billy conceals his new found love for ballet because he knows how his father and brothers will react. It is not until Billy finally gains the self confidence and esteem for himself that he can defend himself to his family. Originally with the news of Billy, Jackie Elliot, his father played by Gary Lewis, is in tears. But gradually with the help of Billy and his dance teacher his family is not only accepting but encouraging of Billy's talent and goal of attending The Royal Ballet school.<br/><br/>By the end of the film Billy Elliot, the audience could easily be in tears with its happy ending. The film is about gender identity and breaking down the boundaries set by stereotypes in our society. Determining what is feminine and masculine plays a large role in our lives. The world of dance breaks those boundaries showing that not just woman are graceful and elegant dancers but so are men. And men should not be demeaned or judged because of their involvement with anything that is considered ""feminine""."

","Billy Elliot focuses on the struggle of a young boy (Billy Elliot) and his newfound love and passion for dancing and ballet.  The story is set against the backdrop of union upheaval in Northern England where Billy's father and brother face redundancy in a local coal mine.  Once they discover Billy's dancing secret - they are outraged - and want him to do something more manly! This movie is definitely a feel good one - it is similar in a way to The Full Monty - whereby people struggling with oppression and depression overcome it.  But where I thought the Full Monty was depressing (people are trying to commit suicide in it!!) - I think this is much more uplifting. The dance sequences are spectacular - and the acting hits the spot. This is definitely worth a watch or two!"
"Kittie_Girlie","Null","1","3","16 April 2004"," just a note on the rating
","I am in high school, and several weeks ago my dance teacher decided to show this movie in class. At first, I was concerned about the content due to the R rating. But, for anyone else with similar inhibitions, I don't believe that the rating accurately reflected the content of this film. Despite some inappropriate language and mild violence, I enjoyed Billy Elliot because of the reality and poignancy of the storyline. It was presented in a serious, dignified manner. It would be a shame for someone to pass up this movie just because they thought it was a nasty thing like many R-rated movies are. Billy Elliot is rather mild and suitable for people who don't appreciate sleazy, bloody, movie trash (like me)."

","I have seen this twice. The first time I saw it, I had a rather negative angle to it, since I knew it'd be about ballet dancing. Since I'm no fan of such activities myself, I simply made up my mind that it would be bad. The second time I saw it (I was forced to do so by a teacher of mine), I didn't expect much. Since I already knew the story, and the outcome, I didn't pay much attention to it, then I realized what a brilliant acting it was in this movie. As well as how touching the story indeed is. Great directing as well. What struck me as very odd, was that I really appreciated Jamie Bells dancing. It's so full of energy and initiative that it's amazing. This is odd because I really don't have any idea what so ever about dancing, but I can still tell that this boy is good. He will go far!"

","It seems to be a trend nowadays that British movies must take place in some Northern English location to give it a bit of social meaning (see Full Monty, Brassed Off). Unfortunately these films end up being full of cliches. There just isn't anything surprising in the story of Billy Elliot. Of course everybody is sursprised/angry by the choice of Billy to become a ballet dancer but then everybody rallies behind him for the feelgood ending. The best bits are the dialogues between Julie Walters (the ballet teacher) and Billy and the scenes at the teachers house."

I came out of the cinema with very little positive or negative to say about it, and would have forgotten almost completely that I had even been to see it after a couple of months had it not been for the British Press, and for that matter the British Public, who had an almost rabid obsession with it. New British films are still calling themselves 'The new Billy Elliot!'. I couldn't believe my ears when I came out of the cinema. People were proclaiming it as the greatest film ever made, which it patently is not.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that the plot is virtually non-existent. Artist struggles to get recognition. Thats been a cliche for a very long time now, so the film just played on sentimentality, and therefore ended up very sickly sweet and unsubtle, with all the messages rammed down your throat. Anyone can be a dancer, even if they are from a mining town! Not all dancers are gay! Prejudice is bad!<br/><br/>To be fair, some of the acting is excellent, especially Julie Walters, who was magnificent as the Ballet Teacher who wasnt up to the job. Jamie Bell wasnt bad, but he overdoes it, although I suppose thats not terribly surprising for an actor in his early teens. The backdrop of the Miners Strike was handled in a surprisingly candid way. <br/><br/>But I found it impossible to get even vaguely enthusiastic about this film. I thought it was overwhelmingly average. I find it absolutely bewildering that 'Billy Elliot' has got anywhere near the top 250. 5/10."

If that's all you are looking for, go to you local pre-school at lunch time.<br/><br/>the movie reminds very much if not too much of the even worse movie - ""the Orchestra"".

I found it uneven in the extreme.<br/><br/>The performances by Jamie Bell (Billy, the kid), Gary Lewis (Jackie, the Dad), and Julie Walters (dance instructor) in acting are very good, and Jamie's dance routine has all the verve and lack of polish one might hope to see in a novice dancer with raw talent.<br/><br/>Raw, maybe that's it. The language was hardly what I'd wish to expose my children to, although I understand how a Brit swears better than most Yankees. It was appalling and ubiquitous. <br/><br/>The soundtrack nearly drove me away. One must listen closely to the poorly miked dialogue, which is heavily inflected with the Lower Scots influence of the northern coalfields. Suddenly we're nearly blasted out of the room by pop tunes, as thumpy in their delivery as they are redundant in their lyrics.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering why the screenplay didn't convey more of the attraction to Billy of the power and beauty of dance. I can think of half a dozen ways that might be accomplished. If I can do that, why not those responsible for producing/writing/directing it?<br/><br/>Then there are the blithe bawdiness of ""Debbie,"" the repressed daughter of the dance teacher, and the confused and pitiful antics of ""Michael,"" ""Billy's"" buddy. These blur the focus of the narrative rather than sharpen it. <br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen this, be prepared for some shining parts to an otherwise lowbrow approach to the lure and reward of the arts."

The main character feels more than a little hollow to me, you don't really learn much about him other than he likes dancing. Jamie Bell has the physicality but otherwise I felt him a bit one-dimensional. What makes up for this is the excellent 1980s backdrop, which has an air of grit and authenticity to it; that steep Durham street becomes a character in its own right. Details involving the striking miners and the difficult family situation are done just right.

"classicsoncall","7","0","1","4 May 2018"," ""This is when you go out and find life, and all those other things.""
","Where I thought this film was going in the early stages was for Billy (Jamie Bell) to take up ballet dancing as a way to improve his stamina and footwork for the boxing ring. That would have made sense in what appeared to be a fairly male dominated society in an English county reliant on coal mining for it's livelihood. Even though Billy's Father (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony (Jamie Draven) initially derided his dancing initiative, there comes a point in the story when the coal strike takes it's toll, and it's understood that the mining industry is all but over, and ballet may be the only way out of poverty for the youngest son. <br/><br/>The film follows somewhat of a standard formula which includes a supportive and sympathetic dance instructor (Julie Walters), snickers from the sidelines over Billy's decision to dance, and a close friend who's friendship with Billy is tested regarding his sexuality. None of these factors ever seem to reach a critical point that would have broken the resolve of a less committed individual, and therefore Billy's struggle doesn't have the kind of epic feel similar stories tend to have. It's not bad mind you, it's just that Billy's struggle never really faced a crucial test, even with the audition for the Royal Ballet. Yes, there was some tension built in waiting for Billy's acceptance, but by that time it's pretty well recognized by the viewer that the film isn't going to let you down.<br/><br/>I recall that the movie received generally positive reviews when it first came out. This was my first viewing, and for a film nominally regarded as family fare, it probably could have done with a lot less use of the 'F' word and swearing in general, particularly by the principal character. Maybe my expectations on that are somewhat out of date, but I have a thirteen year old grandson who doesn't use the kind of colorful language Billy did. I don't think removing the obscenities would be any kind of handicap, in fact if it's not there, who's going to miss it?"

This left me reeling.<br/><br/>The movie leaves out all of Billy's formal education and early professional career.<br/><br/>By the end Dad is proud of his son, even if he dances, dances ballet, is gay and belongs to a travesty ballet company.

There was little intimacy between the two of them and I felt like at the end of the film it was still ambiguous as to what sexual orientation Billy held.

"Cinebuff38","5","0","3","5 January 2016"," A waste of a good idea
","In my personal experience, most films that have come with a lot of hype and where critics have waxed lyrically of them I have found somewhat disappointing. Unfortunately, for me, Billy Elliott falls into that category.<br/><br/>Not that it is a bad film. one of the problems I have is as with so many British and American films of today, it lacks depth in as much as instead of discussing it's subject, it presents it in an exploratory manner where we see its facade but not entirely what is behind it.<br/><br/>Stephen Daldry's film tells the story, with a script by Lee Hall, of a young boy (Jamie Bell) who during a boxing practicing session, witnesses a group of girls being instructed in ballet by dancing tutor Mrs Wilkinson (Julie Walters) which inspires him to take an interest in the discipline.<br/><br/>Wilkinson hands him a pair of ballet shoes ( which just happened to be the right size) and invites him to join in. Having developed such a keen interest, and not wanting to upset his apparently bigotry father ( Gary Lewis) Billy decides to cautiously take up the offer.<br/><br/>After successfully concealing for some time his newly found ambition from his family, his father finally discovers him in one of Wilkinson's lessons and interrupts the class to display his displeasure,much to the annoyance of Wilkinson.<br/><br/>His fathers use of bigotry is for me, A major let down in the film because While it is perfectly acceptable to have an opinion on a given situation or person, the belief of a bigot is usually unreasonable, unfair, biased and without research or foundation. It is because of that criteria we are left with a somewhat shallow film in which instead of going deep into the subject and discussing it thoroughly and therefore making it rich in dialogue, (and such film making today is possible, even in Hollywood. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are prime examples) we are left with a vehicle where the father's narrow-mindedness forms a big part of the families dysfunction.<br/><br/>Hall's decision to portray the dad as a (striking) miner was Unnecessary as was the grandmothers dementia. The character's pre occupation with the sub plots(and even they did not have much depth) distracted from the main subject in hand.<br/><br/>His father finally comes round to the idea of Billy becoming a ballet dancer. It is another part of the films weakness that it does this without any qualified link between the father being anti and pro.Apart from Billy's impromptu thirst for ballet, there was not that much inspiration in the story to warrant him auditioning for and being accepted in its school.<br/><br/>Several years later Billy is a young adult (Played by Adam Cooper)(It's amazing that Billy and mike aged while the father hadn't) fully fledged as a ballet dancer and performing in Swan Lake.<br/><br/>Bell, Lewis, and Walters played their respective parts convincingly, and did their best with what little they were given, as did all the other actors, but the film was sadly let down by lazy script writing and lack of depth in the characters. This is by no means the fault of the actors but that of the creative team who came up with a good idea and then watered it down with a total lack of character study."

That is a good message. Just did not hit me hard in this film.<br/><br/>What is even more interesting is how much discussion this film seems to generate about sexuality, and whether or not Billy is gay.

Perhaps thats one of the reasons more than anything that this movie got a wide recognition. The script is good and so is the cinematography yet, there is something that makes the movie fall, and it is the editing. Remove the dramatic pieces and cut it down by 15 minutes, this wold have been a great film. Yet, the way it is, it is just good.

","Billy Elliot is about a young boy who struggles with generally male sports such as boxing but finds a unexpected love in ballet. Billy must face obstacles such as his father and older brother not supporting him at all and having to have private lessons with his dance teacher behind his fathers back as he forbids him to take classes. This movie is very good how it challenges gender stereotypes such as only girls can do ballet and that all male ballet dancers are gay. When his father walks in on Billy showing his best friend one of his dances he realises how talented his son is in dance he goes back to work as a miner. This was hard for Billy's Dad as he was on strike and if he returned to work he would be known as scum. Billy's Father needed to go back so he would be able to fund for Billy to go to London to audition for the Royal School of Ballet. Billy Elliot is very inspirational as it promotes the fact that you shouldn't change what you enjoy doing just because of what everyone else says about it."

He and the actor of the father play their role seriously, too. And they show a realistic relationship between father and son and how they respect and love each other. The message of the film is at first that it is not impossible to realise your dream and that a family is very important in your life and that they have to support each other at any time in anything. So the music is also important, because it express emotions and feelings (""Ups and Downs"") in the movie as the same like the whole dancing scenes that shows how Billy feels in any situation at a moment. There are a lot of different camera movements in this movie; I think almost all of them.<br/><br/>At the end the film was in my opinion in some parts boring and you don't really understand the context about the ""strike"" and about the relationship to his school-friend, who was in my view ""gay"".

At the beginning the movie was good, but a story about person, whose dream is to become a ballet dancer, is not flavour. The movie was not so good, but the actors plays their parts good. The father shows the really relationship about son and father. Try to realize a dream and have a good relationship to his family. I think this is a message about the film. The music goes together with different scenes. It was good music. The movie has not any special effects. I miss the special effects, but the movie is a ""drama"" an d not a action film.<br/><br/>The film was boring. I can not identify me with the film. I can recommend the film to person, who love dramatic films I give the movie 2 stars to of 5."

Julie Waters (in a strong Oscar nominated role) plays his ballet teacher, who despite all odds and obstacles pushing the boy hard enough to begin believing in his dream again. His father wants to to plays tough sports like boxing or football but his heart wants him to dance. While tragedy and all sorts of dysfunction surround him on ever side, Billy manages to overcome all adversities to become one of the greatest and most talked about company dancers in history.

","After seeing Billy Elliot it was very obvious people who not accept the fact of a boy wanting to dance. It is hard to hide things from your parents and family, especially when it's not something illegal or wrong. It upset me to see someone really enjoy doing something but not be able to tell anyone about it. He worked hard with his teacher to be good. One scene I recall the most was when his father found out and then his brother did as well and Tony wanted to beat him up for dancing. I think he was afraid that if anyone found out his brother enjoyed dancing people would look at him differently and ruin his reputation as well. He would think that people would think he was ""gay"". Julie Walters played a great character Mrs. Wilkison. She agreed with Billy wanting to dance and she was good about hiding it from his family. But everyone had a break point; Mrs. Wilkison couldn't let such good talent go to waste. She approached Billy's father about it and told him how he was a great dancer. He then told her to stay away from him and he could no longer dance. That didn't stop the two. They kept practicing, even harder then before. The best scene in the movie was Christmas night, Billy took his friend to he place that he dances at. In this scene Billy's father and the owner of that gym walked in on him dancing for his friend. At first we get the impression that he is going to be mad at Billy. Later we find he turns his way of thinking and supports Billy and him wanting to dance. At the end of the movie we see Billy in a dance recital and his brother and father watching him proudly. It takes a lot for outsiders to think he wasn't gay. But it all comes down to the people that matters don't mind, and those who mind don't matter."

","In a small town in Durham there is a boy named Billy Elliot played by Jamie Bell, who has the ambition to become a professional ballet-dancer. Unfortunately his brother Tony (Jamie Draven) and his father (Gary Lewis) don't want him to take up ballet as they find it ""girly"". Billy Elliot lives in a crap house with his brother, his father (Jackie) and his grandmother (Jean Heywood). Jackie and Tony work as coal miners, but during the movie they are on a strike due to their low salaries. This makes their household stressful as they have no income. Jackie decides to send his son to boxing lessons (which he can barely afford), but Billy secretly quits boxing and takes up ballet. Billy started dancing because he always had the talent in him. He inherited this talent from his dead mother (Jamie Birkett) and his grandmother. <br/><br/>At ballet school we are introduced to Billy's ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters). Mrs. Wilkinson is a very strict Ballet teacher who molds Billy's natural ballet talents into perfection. After a couple of ballet lessons later Billy's dad finds out that Billy has taken up ballet. Jackie is very angry with Billy at this moment so he forbids Billy from going to Ballet. After this incident Billy has to take private lessons with Mrs. Wilkinson. Mrs. Wilkinson kindly offers him these lessons because she believes that Billy has the potential to go to the ""Royal Ballet School"" in Newcastle. Unfortunately Billy has to miss his audition since Tony got into a load of trouble with the police. Tony got into trouble with the police since he was the ring-leader the protesters. Later on we find out if Billy will become go to the royal ballet school, or if he will be forced to give up his dream because of his family."

","A must see  Billy Elliot is a real masterpiece and is one of my all time favorite movies. I found a lot of inspiration in the movie and somehow it reminded me of my own life. The movie encourages people to believe in themselves and follow their dreams. In addition it sends the message that people should be who they are  not what others expect them to be.<br/><br/>There is drama, there is humor - I could hardy think of anything else that can be included in a movie. Some scenes brought tears in my eyes, others made me laugh  I guess it is just because I associated with Billy while watching the movie  but somehow I felt the scenes almost like if I was there.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell plays exceptionally well the role of Billy, which is probably because he had similar fate (according to himself in an interview I have read somewhere). But it is not only him  all the actors have done an outstanding job.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. It easily gets 10 out of ten from me."
"Andreas_N","9","0","1","13 December 2005"," Pursue your dreams
","Stephen Daldry has directed an inspiring movie that needs to be ranged in among the highest ever achievements of British cinema. The following lines will outline my approach to a movie that features one of the strongest and most compelling messages and some of the finest character portrayals ever to be seen on screen. Thus this movie follows the premises of classic British gems like ""Kes"" or ""Ratcatcher"", thereby paving the way for modern British drama as implemented in ""Dear Frankie"", which is similar in taste and tune and as appreciated as ""Billy Elliot"".<br/><br/>Firstly, the story. What I have realized in the course of analyzing and rating British movies of whatever period is a marked tendency of directors to refrain from American defaults such as unrealistic and boastful stories and lavish applications of visual and special effects. The strengths of British movies rather lie in subtle and authentic elaborations on individual struggles and honest depictions of real challenges and hardships. Billy Elliot is an apt example for this premise. The way Daldry elaborates on this basic concept makes his adaptation of the script a unique transformation of the aforementioned features. Billy Elliot's story is elementary and lacks tangly implications, but that is its strength. It does not need terrific special effects to create the story of a young boy finding out who he is and what his talents are, thus delivering a sincere message everyone will be able to identify with. Billy's story serves as the archetypical struggle of finding your place in the world and accepting yourself as the first lesson of getting along with the challenges of life. The movie then acquires its supreme quality by elaborating on Billy's developments, the hardships they imply and the frictions they cause within his family.<br/><br/>Secondly, the characters. Starting from this firm basis, the emphases of movies belonging to this genre are put upon individual characters. Here it takes genuine and decent personalities to match the challenges of portraying both the cursory characteristics and the emotional implications of the key characters. The main challenge at the very outset was to find a kid from the Newcastle area with suitable attributes, the right age and the dancing skills necessary to fulfill the movie's requirements. Jamie Bell was cast among two thousand other kids his age. It became very clear that he was the perfect guy to play Billy. It requires a lot of character and endurance to go through the training necessary for this movie, and even more to dance in front of so many people. Jamie is able to make us feel his character's passion and his fervor never to give up on his dreams. His performance is outstanding, he acts confidently like an experienced actor and makes you forget that he is a newcomer.<br/><br/>What puts this movie above the ordinary is the quality of the other characters. Billy's family is a family almost torn apart by the death of his mother, which left his father emotionally crippled and his brother unable to take any form of responsibility. At the very beginning you have Billy's father (played by veteran Gary Lewis) as a flat and inapproachable man who seems to be able to beat the living daylights out of Billy once he realizes his son's preference for ballet, which is perfectly unmanly according to him. Billy's brother, Tony, is introduced as a somewhat foolish guy whose entire interest circles around the mining strike. The atmosphere within the family is bleak and emotionally drained.<br/><br/>Billy is isolated and yearning for love and appreciation. He visits his mother's grave and takes care of his grandma. He seems, right at the beginning, to be the only one who really takes responsibility despite the hardships of life. The striking thing about him is his determination and sturdiness when it comes to pursuing his dancing courses, which is a remarkable feature for an eleven year old boy, especially when you consider a) his dad's obvious contempt and b) feeling like a sissy himself at the outset. The movie builds on this general strength of Billy, which can be seen in his eyes and is reflected in his eagerness to proceed.<br/><br/>As the movie continues the emotional challenges for all the actors slowly but surely grow. Some sequences are stirring in their simplicity and heart-breaking in their subtle sincerity. The bond Billy establishes with his dancing teacher; the scene when she reads the letter of Billy's mom; his father's stand against his own union when it comes to go to the mines again; Tony's change from a frigid dummy to a caring brother. The scene when Tony runs after his father to the mines, and then both men tumble while embracing each other, sobbing in despair, is one of the strongest scenes I have ever seen. An adult man, father of two sons, breaking down and crying ""We're done, son! We're done"" is just smashing, showing the despair and the bottled-up emotions. The changes that the characters undergo manifest themselves in this scene. Thus the characters become even more vivid and make Billy's family as authentic as the movie requires.<br/><br/>The dancing is wonderful. The movie is funny as well and made me laugh several times. The language is rather vulgar and the characters very often engage in streams of curses, but this again strengthens the authenticity of the performances. The setting is Northern England in 1984, during the great mining strikes, which plays a significant part in the story itself.<br/><br/>Let yourself be inspired by the pervasive message of finding your talents and staying true to yourself. Enjoy the emotionally stirring scenes which will make your heart run over with emotions. Watch out for the unique soundtrack and Billy's outstanding dancing performances.<br/><br/>You will love ""Billy Elliot"" for what it has accomplished. It is indeed one of the finest pieces of British cinema, a masterpiece of lasting quality."

","Billy is a normal young kid from a normal 1980's mining town in the North East of England. However he finds that he prefers dancing to being hit on the nose at the local boxing club! <br/><br/>It says a lot about how poor modern cinema is that this bit of kitchen sink fluff took off and became a hit. The budget is obviously so low that even the real life props look fake! I don't know who ordered the ""period"" 1984 cars - but they shouldn't be in a job.<br/><br/>The plot is borrowed from every girls-only magazine published since the 1960's where the plucky little miss ""wants to be a ballerina, but her mother won't let her."" Only they have swapped the sexes around. Talk about old wine in new bottles.<br/><br/>There is nothing worse than not being charmed when all around you there are people that are. It is like being at a party and watching people get drunk, dance and kissing girls while you look on - long faced - from the corner. The general audience should be grateful that they don't know the North East, because if they did they would realise it is only a plastic version of it. It seems more like Yorkshire to me - but then I know these places better than most.<br/><br/>The use of endless four letters words - while not unrealistic - doesn't make it any more real and cuts across the point of the exercise. Who is the thing aimed at if not kids. Why shut people of Billy's age out? The thing measures out equal doses of dance, music, black comedy and social realism with a light gay undertone that I don't really understand. There isn't the depth and script to understand it. It looks like a bolt-on to try and sell it to gay audiences.<br/><br/>The sideline acting is vary passable apart from Julie Walters who clunks around in a boiler suit looking like a baby elephant. Is this supposed to be funny? Who knows. Someone, somewhere told the world that this woman has some kind of special talent - and the world seem to have gone along with it.<br/><br/>(Don't get me wrong - she can act a bit, but seems to pop up like bad penny in every Brit pic ever made.) <br/><br/>Naturally people evolve and change their opinion to become better and more rounded people - because that is what people do in movies. Billy is only made a loser so that he can be transformed in to a winner before our eyes.<br/><br/>Lead Jamie Bell seems a nice enough kid though - it will be interesting to see if he is anything more than a flash in the pan though. Despite being star of the show here it takes more to make it in showbiz than a bit of cod Irish dancing - the fact is that I thought his footwork was strictly chorus material."

"justitia","Null","0","1","6 April 2003"," Flashdance Flash Back
","I don't understand why no one I have read here (but I haven't read them all) has noted that from a dance perspective this movie is just a replay of Flashdance, only the dancing is pretty terrible in Billy Elliot and Billy's interest in dancing unconvincing.  When they finally get a decent dancer to perform (Billy as an adult) it lasts 15 seconds.  Extremely frustrating. Ballet was my first career effort, starting when I was 5.  I danced every opportunity I had, in my room as a child, on the streets, in restaurants, in class .. whenever and whatever..I would make up any dance form or steps if I did not know ones to do.  Even after I gave it up as a career path, I still loved dancing in social settings and didn't quit going to dance night clubs until it was too embarrassing because of the age gap between me and the others around me. That love for dancing is what is attempted to be conveyed in Billy Elliot but it is pretty unconvincing when the actor is physically graceless and there is (what I presume is) a double who is a rather mediocre dancer himself and the choreography is pretty terrible.  The scenes of the teacher ""refining"" Billy's movements before his tryout were laughable as Billy could barely raise his leg for positions in which his leg was supposed to be parallel to the floor...no evidence of dance ""genius"" here.  (Even the little girls in the dance class were better dancers than Billy..though how that was possible, with such a ""poor teacher"", is another weakness of the film.) It was impossible for me to suspend disbelief throughout. Though Jennifer Beals had an uncredited double doing her dancing for her at least the dancer was good, the choreography fun (and at times exciting) to watch and the editing well done.  I feel Billy Elliot does a great disservice to the effort to communicate what the love for dance means.  And the rest of the film...well others have already commented on its shortcomings.  But what I found really did the film in for me was the dozen or so sappy ""endings."" There were so many of them, one right after another, one more of a tearjerker than the last.... it amazes me that this film got as strong reviews as it did.  The only part I found worthwhile was the portrayal of the mining town and the strikers at that period of time.  But it had no meaningful context for the dance theme.<br/><br/>A number of people here have said that they did not like the film the first time but did upon other viewings.  I suspect I won't and probably won't give it a try.  But the movie has motivated me to see Flashdance again which I have not seen since the first couple of years when it came out. I wonder how it stands the test of time.  Not a great film but charming and I was very stimulated by the dance in it."

Set around the miners strike a young boy discovers he prefers ballet dancing to boxing. So he takes up lessons, well against his fathers and brother Tony's feelngs. It showed the crisis of the stike well, but i felt it had something missing. Compared to other British films (such as in recent years, The Full Monty, Brassed Off and When Saturday Comes), Billy Elliot seems to be missing an important element that gives the characters a sympathetic feeling that we saw in the the others. All of them are set around the mining community in the north, and they all show the terrible consequences of working in the mines. In the Full Monty, they are all out of work. In Brassed Off, the mine is about to be closed down, and in When Saturday Comes, the pit collapses. In this film, they are on strike. I'm afraid Billy Elliot did not make me feel as much for the characters as the others did."

Billy's dancing is good, but the footage of his lessons is definitely not in sync with how he dances. When he is already dancing the stars from the skies, the viewer still gets to see minutes and minutes of simple pirouette exercises...

I suspect the actors would have given better-focused performances in a more controlled studio setting.<br/><br/>You sure can't tell if the character of Billy Elliot is a good dancer from any footage here.

","""Billy Eliott"", as everyone knows, is a straightforward, feel-good movie. It can be thought of as a cross between ""Breaking Away"" (young working class kids overcoming adversity for their love of sport) and ""The Full Monty"" (the working class is English). Personally, I like this type of film. If it works, you are inspired and leave the theater with a tear in the eye. If they fail, they're a hoot.  ""Billy Eliott"" is one that works. You root for young Billy: to overcome the disapproval of his family and neighbors, to rise above the poverty, and to succeed and dance his way into the hearts of a grateful England. Okay, maybe not like that. ""Billy Eliott"" also has some depth; central characters are more thoroughly drawn. The father who is torn between his deep love for his son, and his visceral dislike of his young son's desire to be a dancer.  He's also involved in a lengthy and bitter labor strike that leaves the family strapped for cash. And there is the older brother following in the father's footsteps, and the elderly grandmother with dementia. <br/><br/>It's not a great film, but a very effective film.

I bet they watched it very carefully. Plus, the story is too dramatic, this is clearly made to make people cry. But...it doesn't work. An example of a film that DOES work(and produces tears): DANCER IN THE DARK. Finally, it's way too predictable: boy is a loser in boxing, but appears to be a talent in ballet...you can guess the rest. Did I already mention his father is against his choice? <br/><br/>BILLY ELLIOT is a decent film, as long as you don't expect too much of it, as I did. Then it will be a big disappointment.

","Weird isn't it?  Miners from the North of England are all the rage in British films, not that all the mines have closed down. Billy Elliot takes us to the same milieu made popular in Brassed Off and The Full Monty; and the problematics of masculinity in a world where men are not working is again addressed.  This time we have an 11-year-old who discovers he prefers dancing to boxing, much to the dismay of his father and brother.<br/><br/>
The film is cute and boasts a good performance by its star who has the young-old look of a kid who has known poverty.  It also has some beautiful industrial landscape shots.  Alas, however, like so many recent British films, it suffers from a sloppy, sappy script and a musical score which tugs relentlessly on the heart strings.

"Movie Watcher","Null","0","1","1 November 2000"," This movie had some problems!
","I don't consider it a ""spoiler"" to mention a certain theme running throughout this movie that I found disturbing:  Being that this film's premise is about a young boy taking ballet lessons, I expected to see plenty of scenes of his father and brother saying to him, ""What are you, a homo or something?""  To the contrary, the main person who said a lot of homophobic remarks was Billy Elliot himself.<br/><br/>Early on, he reluctantly takes ballet, telling his friend he thinks ballet is for ""poofs.""  That word, a slang for homosexual, gets used over and over by Billy.  Later, the screenwriter repeatedly points out to the audience that Billy is straight (through important plot elements that can't be revealed because they're ""spoilers"").  I questioned this because it was done in a defensive way...as if being gay is a bad thing.  Also, there is a scene near the end where an effeminate boy Billy's age is talking to him and Billy punches(!) him in the face and calls him ""bent"" (another derogatory slang for homosexual).  I find this insulting to the gay community because, like it or not, if it wasn't for the contribution of hard work and talented dancing that many gay men have put into ballet since its beginnings, ballet wouldn't exist.<br/><br/>It doesn't make sense that Billy is involved in the world of ballet, but the audience never sees one openly gay ballet teacher or dancer.  If we had, it wouldn't have contributed to the plot, but at least it could have shown the audience ""See?  Gay people can be good dancers and do beautiful things.

","Billy Elliot would have been a great movie, if only its enthusiasm, which was so integral to the dance and storyline, hadn't been its downfall in dealing with inter-character relationships. The movie presented the dance scenes well and with fervor, and the English countryside backdrop was spectacular. As well, the language and British slang used, although hard to understand at times, was perfect for the characters and the movie.<br/><br/>However, the movie was too enthusiastic in trying to do ""good"" in the end, and was slightly too formulaic. From the moment Billy made his speech about dance being a ""fire in his heart"" and like ""electricity"", the audience could easily tell the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In the director and screenwriter's enthusiasm to make a majority of the scenes (especially the dance ones) excellent, they ran by major points too quickly, and the movie seemed somewhat superficial. By trying to do too much, the movie accomplished little in terms of depth: Billy's relationship with his homosexual friend; Billy's thought process as to whether he himself was homosexual; his relationship with the dance teacher's daughter; Billy's deceased mother and her effect on the family; and the coal miner's strike, all things that contributed to the family's plight, could have been delved into in additional detail. These could all have been examined more in order to show us something about the personalities and actions of Billy and the other characters. By merely glossing over them, the movie tried to stay away from the serious and give audiences only happy endings, in the style of a more family-oriented movie (despite this movie's R rating). The movie also tended to drag at points.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, due to its enthusiasm. Some of the scenes were light, and very humourous. However, the movie was able to use dark moods and anger effectively when the need arose.<br/><br/>
Some relationships, such as the one between Billy and his father and Billy and his teacher, were explored in more depth with excellent results. The grandmother was a great character, used to show the family's plight as well as the caring aspects of Billy's personality. Billy's father was an excellent actor, and a perfect foil to Billy. The enthusiasm the actors showed for their roles is rarely matched. It was almost as if Jamie Bell ""became"" Billy, which is especially difficult for child actors to do.<br/><br/>Even though I personally am not all that enamored with dance, this movie's dance scenes were well placed, well performed, and definately furthered the story.<br/><br/>A solid, if not spectacular, movie, and definitely worth the money to go see it. If nothing else, you'll learn a few pieces of British slang.<br/><br/>7/10"

","""Billy Elliot"" is shaping up to be this year's ""The Full Monty"" although, fortunately, it does not share that film's belief that a naked man is intrinsically hilariously funny. The director manages to walk a thin line between the feel good factor of young Billy's striving to become a dancer and the almost Loachian portrayal of a Northern town during the '84 miners strikes. It is in this balance that the film is most successful; at times the scenes of the family under pressure are extremely moving-as are the more obviously ""tear-jerker"" scenes of Billy struggling to be understood by his gruffly macho older brother and dad. Any flaws probably come in the somewhat broad characterisations-(we have all seen Julie Walters' heavy smoking, cynical Northern women too many times now) but overall this is an enjoyable feel-good movie with enough grit to stop the terminal cutesies setting in."

","Like almost every film about young people these days, Billy Elliot has a dead mum.  What's going on, were childbirth methods medieval 20 years ago? Anyway, 'Billy' is getting the kind of acclaim here 'American Beauty' was getting over there last year; you know, more-than-a-film-take-it-to-your-heart kind of thing.  Which made me wary.  In its mixture of feel-good fantasy and gritty urban realism, it is very similar to 'Brassed off' as people have been saying, except where once the combination was bewilderingly complex, a mixture of anger, tears and exhiliration, the trick seems a little more formulaic this time, a little more pat.  So when Billy gets into the ballet school, you expect the joy to be doused with the bitter petrol of socio-economic reality; when it is, the effect is not as moving as it should be.  <br/><br/>Near the end there is a brilliant image of Dad and Tony being caged in an elevator shaft on returning to work after the unions are mauled by Thatcher's falange.  This mirrors an earlier scene when Billy, frustrated by circumstances which contrive to deprive him of fulfilling his potential, dances an extraordinary Gene Kelly-like explosion of emotion, full of a thrilling violence, and finds himself continually hemmed in by walls.  But Billy gets to go to London, gets to escape his family, history, economics, gender assumptions, his destiny, while his family remains firmly stuck in theirs.  Likewise, the filmmakers are trapped in the prison of genre.<br/><br/>Once the narrative has been set up, there is barely a scene you cannot predict, such as Dad's initial hostility culminating in a spasm of generational violence, before eventually succumbing to the cause.  The Royal Ballet is, of course, dreadfully upper claws, full of complacently nice toffs whose 'never mind, there's always next year' reassurances sear on a working class boy who is bloody lucky to get even one chance.  Yes, he seems to fluff his audition, but in the film's phoniest moment, manages to articulate the feeling he gets when dancing, even though the whole point of the dancing was that it articulated what he could not say, wasn't allowed to say.  When he gets the crucial letter from the Royal Ballet, there is the predictable 'suspenseful' dragging out of the result.  His dead mother is replaced by a surrogate mother, but she makes the obligatory hallucinatory appearance.  An excellent shot linking the cemetary to the fading industrial town is repeated to unsubtle effect.<br/><br/>Like Billy himself, the film's magic arises when its constraints force it to burst out - the credits sequence, to T-Rex's 'Cosmic Dancer', the banal wallpaper transformed, a suitably transcendent opening; the bending of time and space as Billy learns to twirl, his first step to promise, appropriately wreaking havoc on his own time and place; the feather foreplay with his teacher's daughter; the use of mirrors, not only to represent the continual splitting of Billy's personality (between genders; duty and desire; history and future; family and self), but as a magic gate into a fantasy, transformative world - one scene, where Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson are dancing in a boxing ring reflected in a mid-shot mirror, is brilliantly surreal; the sight of his friend in his sister's clothes; the harrowing scenes of the strike, proving once and for all the fascist basis of 80s Britain. <br/><br/>
The final scene is misjudged (when Jamie Bell as Billy is replaced by another actor), although Dad's bewilderment in the metro is wonderful; and there is nothing quite as rapturous as the scene in the meadow or on the bus in 'Ratcatcher', but, in the absence of anything else, 'Billy' is fine."

","England in the 1980s was the time of Margaret Thatcher, labor unrest, and the political shouting matches-not dancing.  This does little to stop Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), the son and brother of two striking coal miners in a working class town in northern England.  Not cut out for the boxing his father has signed him up for, Elliot realizes he has a special talent for dance and joins a ballet group at the local gym.  Being the only boy in the class and the only male ballet student in town does not bother Billy, but it does bother his macho father (Gary Lewis), who is dealing with the loss of his wife and the downtrodden existence of mining.  While most around him equate dancing with homosexuality, Billy persists in his desire to dance, spurned along by the local dance teacher (Julie Waters) and a desire to make it out of his poor mining town into the Royal Ballet School.  `Billy Elliot' overcomes a slow, formulaic start to provide an inspirational tale about determination and doing what you love.  While some of the characters are given short shrift, Elliot is a wonderfully developed young boy with a talent no one gives him credit for.  It brings some laughs but is more correctly described as an important fable on the pursuit of dreams."

","If my summary conjured up positive emotions for you, then you will love this film. DO NOT READ FURTHER.<br/><br/>If, however, you just threw up in your mouth, then you may agree with me: Billy Elliot is a vacuous white elephant dripping with sap. I must say I disagree with all the negative reviews here on the IMDb. They all seem to zero in on the typical redneck ""What the f*** would I want to watch ballet for?"" I love the ballet. I also thought the acting in Billy Elliot was pretty good, especially the boy. What amazes me, especially from the Brits, is that more people didn't find this film horribly forced, and obvious. It felt to me like one of those Hallmark greeting cards with the vaselined lens and little girls dressing up in Mama's clothes. Everything was too perfect. Too on the head. And good Lord enthroned in eternal majesty in heaven above, if I have to be told one more time that it's okay to be a homosexual I will EAT my own head off. All right, I get it, he's not a poofter, not that there's anything wrong with that. I GET IT! MOVE ALONG!<br/><br/>The main thing I did not like about Billy Elliot was the on the head hammering of it's themes. I wanted to like it, but that one flaw was enough to ruin it for me. If you loved Private Ryan, then I guess you will never understand why I didn't like this film. However, if you understand why 'The Perfect Storm' left me no choice but go on a shooting spree at the local MacDonalds, then perhaps you can relate to my sentiments. Does that make me a bad person? <br/><br/>I love feel good films such as The Dish,Gigot, The Secret of Roan Inish, etc... Heck, my favorite film of all time is It's A Wonderful Life. But Billy Elliot had that all too familiar aroma of a media spin doctor telling me what I should and shouldn't believe. I also felt much of his dancing, excellent though he was, to be impossibly contrived. It's one thing to want to dance, it's another thing to 'gotta dance' but it's altogether and impossibly an inexplicable thing when, like in a deleted scene from 'Flashdance' a person must simply explode with dancing, start climbing walls, tap dancing down the street and skipping to my Lou all over the damn village. What's with the thrashing and wailing of the boy? I mean, how much angst can an eleven year old have? Which reminds me, didn't it seem in the least bit odd that this young boy was spouting off clairvoyant soliloquies like a 70 year old grandfather giving sage advice? I expect that sort of lapse in reality from American sitcoms, but, call me naive, I expect more from British cinema. <br/><br/>And finally a huge mistake to put in foul language to make this an 'R' rated film (in the States). It seemed deliberate on the part of the director to ""toughen up"" the feel. Like it's such a bad thing for the movie to be what it really is, a nice story about a kid that is different. Seeing as how the biggest target audience for this film would be families and youngsters, and considering the cursing does nothing to help the story, it could all be removed without compromising the film in the least, I'll wager it could have made an extra 100 million at the box office without the cussing. That's just plain stupid."

"davejones","Null","0","1","12 August 2001"," Boy overcomes coal-mining Dad's objections to become a dancer
","Okay, let's just take it as a given that the premise of this movie is more than a little familiar: A young boy must overcome his coal mining father's misgivings about ballet to get into the British Royal Academy of Ballet or whatever it's called.  (Have you ever seen the Monty Python sketch about the son who comes home and announces to his actor father that he wants to be a coal miner?  This plot was a cliche thirty years ago!) I guess I can forgive a movie for starting with a weak premise.<br/><br/>But hasn't anyone noticed how paper thin and poorly developed the story is once we proceed from that shopworn premise?  I mean, where's the actual struggle to learn how to dance? Isn't THAT the most difficult part of becoming a professional ballet dancer?  We get about one, one-minute scene in which Billy Elliot tries to do a pirouette, falls down and says `I can't do it!'  to which his tough-but-lovable instructor says, ""Yes you can! Again!"" And that's really the extent of his struggle to LEARN how to dance.<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking: `Ah, but the real struggle is against the tyranny of the stereotype that all male dancers are gay!'  But that doesn't seem to be much of a problem for Billy either.  I mean, his father and brother have to be weaned from this stereotype, but everyone else in town is giving him the thumbs up and cheering him on from the moment Billy decides he wants to be a dancer.<br/><br/>This movie is beautifully shot, scored, and acted, but none of this can make up for such a weak script.  I guess that for people who've never seen one of these artist-struggles-mightily-against-his circumstances-to-become-a-star movies it seems like some kind of revelation, but to me it just seemed like a very poorly developed, connect-the-dots story.<br/><br/>It had a few effective moments, (I liked particularly the scene in which the older brother sees his father on the scab express and goes running after him)  But, from what I can recall, all of the other effective scenes in this movie concern the miner's strike subplot, and not the main Billy Elliot line.  The main plot of this movie is barely present."

","After hearing fantastic reviews from critics and the public, I finally saw this movie and was bored and irritated 10 minutes into the film. I guess the story of a boy ballerina appeals to most but it was not appealing to me at all. Billy Elliot's voice was extremely annoying as were all the british accents (the dance instructor, Billy's father/brother) and when voices are unbearable, it's hard to enjoy the movie. Where are all the good british actors who have nice voices like Richard Burton, Lawrence Olivier and Rex Harrison? Probably all dead like they are. Now, the british actors have pathetic voices that are laughable and aggravating. <br/><br/>The director focuses too much on the little boy's sweaty body parts as if he were shooting this movie for child molestors. Billy Elliot dances ballet.....wow. A big deal hundreds of years ago...but not in 1984 (when the story takes place). <br/><br/>If you get the dvd, find a silly sounding voice (anything Billy Elliot or anyone in the movie says), repeat it over and over and you'll begin to notice how horrible their acting is. 12 minutes into the dvd, Billy Elliot shous ""NO I'M NOT!"" at the dance instructor through a car window. This line needs to be repeated over and over. That's all."
"barberoux","6","0","1","8 May 2001"," Formulaic.
","Billy Elliot wasn't a bad movie.  It just followed a formula too closely for my liking.  The formula is: A child from a poor ignorant family gets involved in an activity not usually associated with his socioeconomic class. The family doesn't understand or approve so the activity is done on the sly.  A wise teacher recognizes the child's talent and encourages the activity.  The child has a chance to display his talent to someone of influence but a family crisis threatens to wreck the talented child's chances.  The ignorant parent becomes enlightened at the last moment and they hurriedly show up before the influential person who sees the child's talent and saves the day.  This movie has been made many times before. There were no surprises in this retelling.  I felt some of the scenes were very contrived and didn't make sense given the scenes that preceded them. There was a lack of emotional and character continuity.  Billy liked ballet but he wasn't gay.  That point was blatantly made.  Why?  Why couldn't he be gay?  That would have given the movie a twist.  Maybe the demographics of the prospective paying audience would not like the main character to be gay so he likes ballet but isn't gay.  A gay character was included to show how tolerant and understanding Billy could be but in another scene he is shown to be crude and brutal.  Also the demographics would dictate a rock music background so at a climatic moment the Swan Lake music is introduced but quickly replaced with some mediocre rock song.  It made no sense.  The cursing was also too much.   The movie was rated R because of it.  I would think the target audience would be families and younger people that the R rating would exclude.  If mature audiences were the target group why have such a bland sweet story.  A loss of a big audience just so you can say the eff word.  It makes no sense."

","An 11-year old boy from a working-class British family is torn between his desire to learn ballet and his father's wish for him to learn boxing. Billy's father is headstrong and medieval in his worldly outlook, as he only wants manly things for his son. But Billy sees something more in the poetry of ballet, and he wants more than anything else to be as fluid and graceful as those sinewy dancers.   Having established the conflict of the story from the outset, the movie takes us through Billy's struggles to complete his ballet training privately (under the tutelage of Mrs. Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters). It's a great idea for a movie, really, because of the stark contrast between the outside world of Billy's neighborhood (which exists under the spectre of an ominous protracted workers' strike, of which Billy's father participates) and the inner workings of Billy's decidedly unmanly mind.<br/><br/> However, the film is hit or miss. If the viewer allows himself or herself to become fully wrapped up in Billy's predicament, much as one would approach a soap opera, then one will fall for this unabashed schmaltz-fest with no problems. But for the more cynical among us, the movie fails in that it plays out virtually every Hollywood cliche imaginable; the only true original notion in the movie is the basic ""boy wants to be a ballet dancer"" ideal. Here are some tried-and-true portions of the movie: Boy wants to do something against dad's wishes. Boy's dad is a tough-as-nails cretin, stolidly stupid but somewhere, deep inside, he loves his boy. Then there's the unforgiving teacher (Mr. Miyagi, anyone?). And the Impossible Dream. The list goes on and one. When I first popped this in the ol' DVD player, I accidentally set it to play in French (at least I think that's what that was...) Then I stopped it and switched the settings. Guess what? The overwrought Cockney accents are, at times, absolutely indecipherable. It's like watching a foreign film, only not as full of deep meaning.   In short, this can be a real snorefest if you're not ready to become one with the plight of poor Master Elliot. If you are, more power to you; time for you to dust off that old copy of Love Story. But if you're like the rest of us, skip it unless you're suffering from sleep deprivation."

It is typical for the film that he does not even dare to clearly express whether Billy is homosexual or not. And I was very surprised that Billy, after all those ballet lessons, started step dancing suddenly. It's a pity that you could not even see Billy dancing after his education in London: the film ends with his first jump.<br/><br/>

It's actually almost the same story, only the straightforward, poor, miners' boy is a shy, reasonable successful, Japanese businessman and it's not about ballet, but about ballroom dancing. I don't give a damn about ballroom, nor about shy Japanese businessmen, and I do like modern ballet, and England, however, the story of Shall we dansu? wins in originality, subtlety, humor and plain enjoyment. Although this gem of a film is older, it seemed to me the writers had seen ""Billy Elliot"" and declared: We can do this thing as well - but good.

And yes, it does get rather squishy in the last half-hour, and it tests credibility in spots. It's hard to believe, for instance, that Billy, stealing a few furtive hours of dance practice under his father's steely watch, would master not only ballet but also tap, jazz, and traditional Irish dance. <br/><br/>But you expect such liberties from this genre. The surprise is how bleak most of the movie is: It's set in a horrible corner of Thatcher's England, where workers are one step above starving and the weather is always awful and the architecture is ugly and moldering. No wonder everybody in the movie is cross with everybody else. There's much more ill will and bickering than there are Kodak moments. The result is a dish of an unexpected variety of flavors, and a satisfyingly cranky indictment of Thatcherism.<br/><br/>

And so the dual dramas of parent/child and system/individual in Billy Elliot quickly found vulnerable flesh in me.  Only after a settling gulp did I start to see the wider picture.  This is OK stuff - but just a little shmultsy.  The artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks?  Surely Monty Python in the seventies, or Beyond the Fringe in the sixties, parodied this into ridicule?  Nevertheless the Bell boy was a great (dancing) star and his disgruntled frowns were adequate acting.

When Billy's father had to burn his dead wife's piano to have heat for Christmas, only to sit there sobbing while it burned, my heart yearned. This was a story of escapism, something like that of Educating Rita or Shirley Valantine. I liked it a lot. It had a subtle comment on gender bending and sexual identity from a child's point of view, without being uncomfortable, which is unusual. Jamie Bell was excellent and so was Julie Walters.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film was a scene where Walters and Bell were in a gym talking and a boom microphone dropped into the shot about ten inches.
