","""The Godfather: Part II"" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 ""The Godfather"" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel."
"Nazi_Fighter_David","10","220","252","10 March 2001"," Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...
","Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...<br/><br/>The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...<br/><br/>De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...<br/><br/>The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...<br/><br/>Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters..."

","This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .<br/><br/>Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time."
"DanB-4","10","424","526","7 May 1999"," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br/><br/>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.<br/><br/>
Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""Keep your friends close ....."", ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.<br/><br/>All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.<br/><br/>The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.<br/><br/>See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent."

","The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see."
"tfrizzell","Null","98","127","13 October 2001"," The Greatest Sequel During the Cinema's History
","""The Godfather, Part II"" is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5."

"alexkolokotronis","10","107","144","30 June 2008"," An Insult To Call It A Sequel
","To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.<br/><br/>The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.<br/><br/>The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.<br/><br/>Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one."
"MovieAddict2016","10","93","125","23 August 2003"," Terrific continuation of the ""Godfather"" series; to call it a ""sequel"" almost seems insulting...
","This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as ""sequel"" is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a sequel - ""The Godfather Part II"" is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.<br/><br/>The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. <br/><br/>Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.<br/><br/>Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in ""The Godfather Part II,"" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.<br/><br/>It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. ""The Godfather"" was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. ""The Godfather Part II"" may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a ""sequel"" almost seems insulting."
"Bill-247","Null","122","167","6 December 1998"," A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!
","Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, ""The Godfather"".  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb."

"jzappa","9","20","25","22 February 2009"," ""Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.""
","Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.<br/><br/>In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.<br/><br/>The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.<br/><br/>The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, ""You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago."" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.<br/><br/>I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.<br/><br/>So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, ""It had nothing to do with business."" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.<br/><br/>It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once."
"christoph-73","10","15","18","11 September 2007"," even better than part 1
","The Godfather Part 2 is easily better than part 1 for several reasons.<br/><br/>1. The telling of Con Coleones rise in power with Robert De Niro is very exciting and De Niro is amazing.<br/><br/>2. The scene where Micheals brother Fredo is killed is the best scene in the film.<br/><br/>3.

"BrandtSponseller","9","185","283","10 May 2005"," Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under ""sprawl""
","Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.<br/><br/>The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) ""in the role"" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.<br/><br/>After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.<br/><br/>During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call ""J.K. Rowling Syndrome"". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.<br/><br/>The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dÃ©nouement, which seems to just end.<br/><br/>I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.<br/><br/>The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.<br/><br/>Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry.

I have never watched anything like this in my entire life. This movie has explained the life of underworld people in a great way. It also shows how vengeance eradicates happiness from your life. People don't even care about their family in greed of power. It's a masterpiece that can never be written off even after centuries.

","Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewer's consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.<br/><br/>Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michael's character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.<br/><br/>I haven't even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I don't have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.<br/><br/>The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesn't really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so don't worry if you don't get it - you don't have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing."
"newfiesailor","9","22","31","27 April 2006"," As good as the original...
","Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brando's presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.<br/><br/>Michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It's a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.<br/><br/>Pacino's performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.<br/><br/>The secondary story is the rise of Michael's father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro's look? <br/><br/>What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiro's expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. That's unsurpassed acting.<br/><br/>The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900's New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That's sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.<br/><br/>Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.<br/><br/>The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.<br/><br/>One of the greatest films of all time."

","The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

Godfather 2 is better than the first part. It is a great sequel, it expands the themes and the world of the first part. Robert De Niro is stunning as usual. Missed Marlon Brando. Best part of this movie is it shows the rise of Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone contrasting their times and personalities.

","After realizing I have just reviewed the first movie, I realized I should do the 2nd!<br/><br/>Out of Coppola's work that I have seen thus far, this is my favorite. This is quite ironic because upon my 1st viewing, I thought it was the weakest of the trilogy.<br/><br/>It may seem insane to rate this above the first, but Richard Roeper calls this his favorite movie.(See IMDB's trivia page for him.)<br/><br/>Now WHY do I like this above the other? Hmmm..I have a hard time explaining that. I think one thing is the quotes. ""My offer to you is this...nothing."" ""My Dad said you would always catch a fish if you said a Hail Mary.""(that's a paraphrase.)
If I had to criticize something, it would be its length. Roger Ebert said ""no good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short."" I disagree with the first half.<br/><br/>TGP2 is very good but it's also very long. At 202 minutes, the movie actually seem longer and I had to repeatedly stop the DVD to get through it. Luckily there is an intermission you can skip.<br/><br/>Either way, I do think this is the best Coppola film and therefore-if you see the 1st movie before this, you will definitely thoroughly enjoy it!"

","I personally think that this film surpassed the glory of The Godfather I. you will have to watch it time and again in order to understand the nuances of it's brilliant film-making. the characterizations are exceptional: 1. Micheal Corleone (as the new don torn between family & business) 2. Hyman Roth (as the scheming old villain) 3. Kay Adams Corleone (as the worried wife) 4. Robert Duvall (as the loyal lawyer) 5. John Cazale (as the betraying brother) 6. Robert DeNiro (as young Vito) etc. etc.... It's just Brilliant!!! Speaking about the film-making the parallel narration of two different but interlinked stories is a fresh new lease of screenplay. the cinematography is outstanding. the indoors are lit up beautifully with overhead lighting which puts a shadow over the characters' eyes making it impossible to say what they're thinking. But unlike the first part where they had broken all the rules (the characters are established first before the place and time) in this film they've come back to the rules (the locations are established before the characters) Francis Ford Coppola should definitely be given another chance to make a sequel to the trio-logy so that the present generation can also experience the 'Magic of the Movie' and for anyone who's not seen this film, I bet they're surely missing something in life..."
"RichardKleiner","7","63","111","17 November 2007"," Sorry, but it just didn't deliver
","OK. Let's get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. I'm not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didn't like it. Here's the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michael's house, and the build up for young Vito's story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren't as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn't that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn't make sense. In the book, it's clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn't kill anyone from his own family (not ""the Family"", the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but let's remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Don's daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. <br/><br/>It's interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola's anatomy for each ""Godfather"". You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasn't's that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>Another flaw I found was that the story doesn't really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didn't even appear in Mario Puzo's novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesn't even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassino's condition from the first.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a die hard fan of ""The Godfather"". I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesn't do it for me."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","75","135","20 July 2004"," About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro
","It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10"
"DaveDiggler","10","17","26","16 August 2008"," Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been
","The sequel to ""The Godfather,"" at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with it's flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. ""The Godfather II,"" wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When we're in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we're watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it's near three hour run time. When we're in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but there's too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We don't really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didn't already know. We don't really see how he gains his power. He kills ""The Black Hand,"" and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and he's all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We don't know how he got there or anything, he's just there. De Niro gives it his best, but he's just not working with anything to give any kind of performance that's remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. <br/><br/>When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didn't have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). <br/><br/>When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesn't say much; he's sick of him; Fredo's too stupid to have around, and he can't even look at him. Coppola' direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you can't see the reactions of both of the men, they're both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.<br/><br/>Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. He's so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando' speech in, ""On the Waterfront."" All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. He's pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that he's well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesn't care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and that's it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history."
"BiiivAL","8","78","144","3 June 2018"," The summit of Everest
","The second part of the family crime saga about the mafia of the Corleone clan was an event that was widely celebrated in the cinema. In particular, six Oscar awards and a recommendation of prestigious cinematographic universities where our VGIK enters, but the main thing is not this, but that after forty years this film is watched and is still being revised, and in terms of staging a frame and accents, many contemporaries have much to learn from the maestro The Corypoles. As far as I heard, the director was not going to be engaged in the second film and the studio had to make concessions, in particular in the history of Vittorio it was partly to address the source, and the story of Michael's becoming as Godfather had to be fully compiled. I finally looked at the second film and I want to share my impressions and thoughts on this matter.<br/><br/>The second film was no less a legend than the original, not only having earned a well-deserved viewer's success and recognition of the members of the American Film Academy, but also entering the history of cinema as the best ""sequel"" of all time, in a number of polls - even bypassing the brilliant first picture. It was with the ""Godfather, Part II"" began the general fashion of assigning continuations in the headings of serial numbers written in Latin or Arabic numerals.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo deliberately sacrificed the dynamic development of the plot, placing a stake on ""epic breathing"", amazingly conveys the scale of personalities - a special kind of titans, from each decision whose lives depend. Even the Griffith principle of the ""cross"" installation comparison of the vicissitudes of the fate of the founder of a powerful family who fled from his native Sicily and with great difficulty conquering authority in America, and his heir does not contribute to an increase, so to speak, the speed of rotation of the flywheel of History. The denouement is constructed in such a way that, inevitably recalling the final frames of the original, holds, rather, the opposite thought. The next cycle does not end, when you almost physically feel the change of the ""spiral coil"", which knocks everyone: from the exiled Coroleone rivals to the last close person, eliminated for the committed treachery. On the contrary, everything returns to its own place, as if an unperformed prophecy is being fulfilled, or the Fate enters into rights, allowing for the time being to be illusions about free will. The final turns into a start, the ghosts of the past briefly come to life at a festive family table, and Michael's strong words sound even more dramatic and naive, outraged by his father's agreement with Tom Hagen: ""I have my own plans for my future."" Further - silence ...<br/><br/>At the same time, the first and second (as well as the third, released after a decade and a half) parts are not so much refuted as complement one another. The authors, as if expanding the initial socio-philosophical premises, are no longer limited to analyzing the actual functioning of the mechanism of the mafia ""family"", even significantly increasing the scale: forcing Michael to defend honor at hearings in the Senate and acquainting himself with the international interests of Corleone, as if it is a full-fledged transnational corporation. The opening of the sources of the power of Vito Andolini, on the one hand, based on the centuries-old patriarchal traditions of Sicily, proved to be stronger and more effective than modern state institutions, and on the other hand acting under pressure of circumstances, adapting to the brutal realities of the poor New York quarter. However, it can not be considered a coincidence that a memorable musical leitmotif permeates inexpressibly disturbing notes, accurately warning of the omnipotence of Rock.
From the interesting is also the concept of unfolding two plot layers, where in parallel with Michael is shown also the history of the formation of Witto, in order to better show us the father's features in the son, and the son could show the paternal character. The evolution of the mafia is visible in a huge conglomerate that has engulfed the whole of America and many infrastructures are in their hands, these people have a huge influence on politicians and other power-holders. From the philosophical point of view, this film is about how difficult it is to become an independent leader, how to show that you do not attach yourself to the glory of the Father, but you yourself are able to make weighted and complicated decisions. In this respect, the drama of Michael Corleone, whose marital status at first was shaky, and the other clans conceived the evil, worked well ...<br/><br/>Actor's works leave no doubt that before you the screen life, when the human pain is reflected on the faces of the actors. Al Pacino is great in the role of Michael, the warm heart gives way to the pragmatism inherent in the Head of the Mafia clan. Young Vittorio performed by Robert de Niro was able to show charm and become the future of Don with him, too, there were many events that change character. All the actors here are in unity and show how it is necessary to plunge into the role, in all to see a lot of work for what each of the actors thank you very much.<br/><br/>Verifying: A great movie that is recommended to watch everyone as an example of clear, competent and well-coordinated work of the creators' team, the whole mechanism works like a clock and as a result of hard work we get no less legendary film, somewhere even ahead of the original. Timing mastodon (202 minutes) does not interfere with perceiving history and imbued with the content of the saga. Such films are not at once to understand their greatness and strength to be reviewed and analyzed, but this film (like the whole trilogy) should not pass you by. All good and pleasant viewing!"

","The saga of the Corleone family continues from ""The Godfather"" in this classic film directed by Francis Ford Coppola entitled ""The Godfather Part II"" that was released two years after the original film was released.<br/><br/>This movie that stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro,who portrays Michael Corleone and the young Vito Corleone respectively,together with Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale,G.D Spradlin, and Method acting teacher Lee Strasberg,tells the parallel story of the expansion of Corleone crime family headed by Don Michael during the 1950's and the rise to power of the young Don Vito during the 1920's.<br/><br/>No question that the themes of corruption,ruthlessness,amorality and ambition continues in this film as both Michael and the young Vito continues to pursue their respective American dreams in this parallel story being told when both father-and-son were at the same age.We get to see Michael expands the family's gambling operations in Cuba and his pursuit to making the Corleone family legitimate while dealing with rival mobsters who intend to eliminate him like Frank Pentangeli and Jew mobster Hyman Roth.It also tells the story of how he dealt with the federal indictment by the U.S.Senate.As for the young Vito,we get to witness from how his family got killed by the local mafia chieftain Don Ciccio in Corleone,Italy and how he migrated to New York a young age.Then,it narrates how he started as an ordinary worker and then rose into stature and power after dealing with the area's extortionist,Don Fannucci and killing Don Ciccio to strengthen his family's power in both the United States and in Italy.<br/><br/>This was definitely one great film just like the original.It definitely would compare to the first film as we get to witness two great parallel stories of ambition and rise to power.In addition to that,we also get to see how much the characters of Vito and Michael deteriorated into becoming ruthless,corrupt and amoral as their power and stature increased.<br/><br/>Aside from great stories,we also get to see great performances from its lead stars - Al Pacino and Robert De Niro - wherein the latter won an Oscar for his portrayal the young Vito.Added to that,we also get to see great performances from the other members of the cast such as Lee Strasberg,who got nominated for an Oscar as the Jew mobster, and Diane Keaton as Kay,the embittered wife of Michael.<br/><br/>After more than 43 years since it was initially released in the theaters while this review is currently written,it would still be a fun to watch and it will hold up.Just like what I have stated in my review of the first film ""The Godfather"",I also would say that this film that tells the story of amorality,ruthlessness and ambition ""The Godfather Part II"" is truly a masterpiece."

","This isn't quite as powerful as the first Godfather, done two years earlier, but it isn't far behind. It's another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you've put it in your tape or DVD player.<br/><br/>What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.<br/><br/>One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.<br/><br/>The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.<br/><br/>There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg."

","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather: Part II"" (1974) is the second installment in the Godfather Saga, masterfully executed as a sequel.<br/><br/>In my view, it is the greatest sequel to have ever been conceived. How much pressure Coppola must have felt when embarking on this after the huge success and instant classic that ""The Godfather"" (1972) had become. In spite, he must have kept calm in perfecting the work of Part II.<br/><br/>The film centres partly on Michael's descent into the downward spiral of the crime world, as well as the history of his late father, Vito Andolini, beautifully portrayed in the original by the screen legend above them all, Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>In part II, Vito's life is presented from when he was a young boy in Sicily, and how the tragic events of his childhood shapes him as a person. We also follow him as a growing adult, portrayed by Robert De Niro, who gives a stunning performance, for which he deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. In this period piece part of the film, we see some intriguing character development which contributes to sophisticated storytelling, while simultaneously paying homage to Part I.<br/><br/>The character studies of Part II really is what drives the saga's perfection further. Along with a budget twice as large as in Part I, this highly ambitious effort was possible for Coppola to execute to perfection with beautiful shifting set designs and huge staging of the milieus. Naturally, it draws on the same perfect storytelling, direction, cinematography, score and all else that Part I is revered for. But it adds further, with even more intrigue and suspense than what we where exposed to in Part I.<br/><br/>A perfect film, and a deeply convincing character study of a man, who has it all but love, and who falls apart from his desires to power and money. Almost on par with Part I, and although some even think this surpasses its perfection, the original remains my favourite film."
"CubsandCulture","10","3","3","31 December 2018"," Inter-cutting makes the film
","The juxtaposition of Vito building the family up, personally and in terms of business, and Michael tearing the same structures down is what makes this movie. Less morally suspect than the 1st Godfather due Michael's fate this is Coppola at his best as director. It is simply remarkable that such an experimental story structure was allowed for a sequel to a blockbuster. No studio today would allow such a thing to occur.<br/><br/>I don't have much that can be added to the consensus but this is a mighty fine film."
"TheMovieDiorama","10","3","3","25 February 2018"," The Godfather Part 2 is often regarded as the greatest film of all time.
","With many claiming it to be better than its predecessor. Racking up a runtime of 200 minutes, this behemoth is the longest theatrical film I've seen. For those of you who read my review on Part 1 would know that my only gripe was with pacing issues, particularly in its third act which dipped completely to a point where I became uninterested. With no Marlon Brando and a far superior runtime, does Part 2 better its predecessor? Drum roll please...The Godfather Part 2...is...the better chapter in this saga. Yes, everything that made the first so well acclaimed still exists here but with a much more detailed end result. The pacing was perfect. There was always something happening whether it be the Corleone family members just interacting with each other over family and business, or when the Don himself Michael conceptualises a thorough and genius plan to get him out of trouble. Then, in addition, Coppola brings in Robert De Niro to portray a young Vito Corleone depicting his rise to power in the mafia culture. This is interwoven brilliantly with the current story involving Michael, the two plots bounce off each other and further the rich developed characters that Coppola originally put on screen. The plenty of backstabbing as traitors lust for power and control makes for some tense and gripping moments in a bloated film. Many more exotic locations to spice up the cinematography, from sunny Havana to vintage Corleone. I appreciated the inclusion of the Italian language, Coppola could've forced the scenes to be spoken in English and yet he didn't in order to keep the authenticity of these characters. Everything I mentioned in Part 1 still remains. Coppola's direction is flawless, acting is masterful (particularly Pacino and De Niro), complex family narrative that left me compelled in every scene...I mean I could go on but there is no need to. The vast majority of reviews state everything that I'm describing here, which is why this is regarded as one of cinema's greatest films of all time."

","Mike is the head of his family, but he is broken, angry man and no one can escape his wrath, not even his poor older brother. This film is a film that laments for loss and is full of bitter emotions.but this is also arguably one of the greatest sequels of all time to one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of favorite all-time films, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it better than the first movie. This movie excels at everything, especially when it comes to storytelling. and the devolution of Michael Corleone's humanity and morality. The film invokes emotion from us for many reasons from the sad but powerful score by Nino Rota, to the powerhouse acting from everyone in the cast especially from Al Pacino, a story that introduces the past effectively, a very shocking ending, tight editing, powerhouse directing by Francis Ford Coppola, and the list goes on and on. Sequels were not a commodity back in the day, and this sequel to the huge 1972 film The Godfather is one of the first of its kind. The success of this film is why today's movie business relies upon sequels to make money. Regardless, this is one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>This film continues the saga of the Corleone family as we continue from the events of the first film. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying to expand the family's business into places like Hollywood and Cuba. His character takes a dive as he clashes with his brother Fredo (John Cazale), his lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), and his sister Connie (Talia Shire). He is suspicious of his business associates activities such as folks like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and Frankie Pentangeli (Michael Gazzo). But this film incorporates another story into this story: the past. We meet Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) when he was growing up in Sicily and emigrates to New York City where be becomes connected with the mob life.<br/><br/>I loved how the story is told thanks to the masterful storytelling by screenwriter Mario Puzo and director Coppola. They successfully tell two stories over the course of the movie without any trouble. Each story complements each other very well. The continuing saga of the present day family remains a high point. Of course the central character is Michael Corleone. The first film he was a man reluctant to take over the family business, but now he is turning into a control monster who trusts no one, not even his inner circle. It's a sad thing to watch as his morality crumbles and the final scene-one of cinema's most famous scenes, makes the case to show why Michael Corleone turns into a monster.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the flashback sequences featuring young Vito. De Niro absolutely nails his role as Vito and he inherits the older Vito's mannerisms very well. It was fun to see how Vito turned into the man we knew him from the first film. The scenes in Sicily, where he is connected with a local mob boss is very powerful because Vito's mother was shot down. But that event helped turn Vito into the kind of man he was and to my happiness, Vito exacted the perfect kind of revenge. These scenes in Sicily and New York are beautifully shot and they really understood what New York was supposed to be in 1910.<br/><br/>This is a film full of performances, all of them wonderful. Pacino excels as Michael Corleone once again. I really wish he won an Oscar for this role because he deserved it. His performance was effectively scary. Robert De Niro was absolutely amazing as the younger Vito and his role showed the kind of versatility this man has. Diane Keaton was effective as Kay. This film has Kay standing up to his man as she eventually leaves his side. Duvall is always great as Tom Hagen. John Cazale has a bigger part in the second film, as he tries to do what's best but simply does not have the brains and ultimately pays the price. His performance was a powerful one. Then we have the likes of the little known actors who gave an impression like Lee Strasberg who played the business partner Hyman Roth who wants Michael killed and Michael Gazzo who plays Frankie, a relative and associate of Michael's.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is one of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather is an amazing film, but this one may just be a tad better. That is a rarity because 1.) Just look at the quality of the first film and 2.) sequels are rarely better than the original film. Speaking of sequels, this is the only sequel to this day that has won Best Picture at the Academy Award. Indeed, it's a very amazing feat. Although to be taken with a grain of salt, but on the website IMDb, this movie is ranked #2 of all-time. That goes to show the commercial value of the movie. I loved this movie for many reasons. From Al Pacino's wonderful performance to the chill-inducing score by Nino Rota. There was also a flashback sequence that hearkens back to the first movie as it brings back James Caan although Marlon Brando declined because he felt under-appreciated. Anyhow, Coppola does an amazing job with the first two movies in the series. That end shotjust wow.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","Growing up in my family, this movie was a staple and I have been watching the entire Godfather series since before I could understand what I was watching. Around the age of thirteen, I started to become a cinephile, a trait that was embedded in me by my father. I saw this film for the series for the first time around that age and understood it. The second edition of the series was perfect in that the theme of family ultimately stood and we got a chance to see great cinema at play as Coppola and Puzo told two stories simultaneously that ended up perfectly balancing."

"scorsese-1","10","5","6","10 April 2005"," A cinematic epic by Coppola
","The Godfather II is not really a movie about the mafia. The themes that run throughout the film are of power,corruption of power and family. Coppola expertly tells the parallel stories of a father and his son with the use of flashbacks and flashforwards. He simultaneously shows how the father builds an empire and how his son subsequently unwittingly destroys it. The scenes involving the son Michael Corleone are very serious in nature,whereas the scenes involving the father,a young Vito Corleone, are presented in a more jovial manner.Before a flashback or flashforward, Coppola uses an effective technique of having children or the mention of children in the scene in order to emphasize the generational link through children. The flasback scenes are also photographed using different methods of lighting to contrast the different moods.Metaphorically, the story of the Corleones parallels the rise and subsequent corruption of America. The ultimate symbol of America in the form of the Statue of Liberty appears throughout the film. The assassination of Hyman Roth the Jewish Mafia chieftain, is eerily similar to the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald the alleged assassin of President John Kennedy. Coppola effectively uses symbols such as the orange to represent evil. Several scenes show characters that do evil holding an orange (the fruit being a biblical symbol of evil).In an early scene Johnny Ola an emissary for Hyman Roth brings an orange to Michael Corleone from Miami. In a flashback scene, Don Fannucci (the black hand), is seen handling an orange before his demise. Michael Corleone is eating an orange as he plots the murder of his enemies. Coppola also uses catholic religious rituals as backdrops in major murder sequences. As Vito Corleone murders Don Fannucci there is a religious procession on the street. As Michael's brother Fredo is being murdered he is reciting the Hail Mary prayer. In the end Michael loses his soul and family to maintain his power. A great film by a talented director."
"BA_Harrison","6","23","41","7 March 2016"," It's-a not so good.
","The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that is regarded by many to be as good as, if not better than, the original. I'm guessing that much of its popularity lies in the fact that it is not just a sequel, following Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he continues to expand his family's 'business', but also a prequel, charting Vito Corleone's life from a child in Sicily at the turn of the 20th century to powerful New York mafia don. Two films for the price of one!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.<br/><br/>8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest. That's a disappointing average of 6/10."
"aml60","10","6","8","15 September 2005"," Not just a sequel, but another masterpiece of a continuing story.
","The Godfather Part II, is just as good as the first film. Al Pacino was absolutely awesome in this film. His performance in this film is one of my personal favorites, and probably one of his best performances of all time. This film was so good because it continues the story of Don Michael Corleone's rise to the top, and then slowly to the bottom at the end. Plus another cool thing about the movie, is that it has several flash backs on the life of younge Vito Corleone, played by Robert DeNiro (who also gave a great performance). Again the directing, and story telling, and the acting were great in this movie. It is truly the greatest sequel of all time."

"bkoganbing","10","8","12","17 March 2008"," The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones
","Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, I'd hate to argue the difference.<br/><br/>In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.<br/><br/>Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.<br/><br/>The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.<br/><br/>The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.<br/><br/>Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.<br/><br/>Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.<br/><br/>If the first Godfather film doesn't do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense."
"wrcong","10","8","12","10 February 2005"," Sequel + Prequel = monumental film-making
","Francis Ford Coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first.<br/><br/>In the truest sense of the word, Godfather II is NOT a sequel, nor was it intended to be. What Part II does is fill in details about Don Vito Corleone's arrival in America and rise to underworld power. That story was told by Mario Puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. Coppola and Puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of Don Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the Corleone family subsequent to Michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. ""Appended"" should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. There is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the Corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant Don Michael Corleone. He wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to ""be strong for everyone"" by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother Fredo (John Cazale, again brilliant).<br/><br/>Unlike the first film, Coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the Corleone family in the second film. Clearly the life of the crime boss is costing Michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. The first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the Corleones can be viewed with some empathy. In Part II, Michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. He seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator.<br/><br/>This is really two great films in one. Vito Corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by DeNiro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. Those scenes really capture remarkably the story of Don Vito's early years woven by Puzo in the novel. Wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (Congressional racketeering hearings and the Castro revolution in Cuba). This is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the Godfather story.<br/><br/>Don't end the story with the first Godfather movie. See them both. As for Godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down."
"Soysoy","5","33","65","2 November 2006"," I feel totally disconnected...
","So this is something that ranks as #2 on IMDb... this time I think I have to face the fact that I'm totally disconnected from the vast majority of movie addicts. So take this review with a grain of salt: I'm an outsider, definitely.<br/><br/>I kinda liked the first Godfather, while not considering it as great cinema I found it engaging, well put together, with strong moments, all in all a good movie. Not so here. To me this was excruciatingly boring.<br/><br/>I actually liked the overture scenes very much. Then we leave Italy for the USA, and after 40 minutes I was still waiting for something to vaguely interest me. These endless contrived stories about the Italian Mafia (mob) have become such a cliché in movies that it's impossible for me to attend all this convoluted, ultra-codified stuff without getting successively amused, then annoyed, then plain bored. So when the cinematic and staging aspects are great, like in SCARFACE or ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, I just take that stuff for what it is, a genre film bound by rules, and enjoy it from the great acting, direction and purely cinematic elements (in De Palma's case -Scarface- the fabulous camera eye, in Leone's case -Once upon a time- the mindblowing psychological staging and the terrific cinematography).<br/><br/>Here the staging is mostly sloppy, long parts of the movie feels like it's been produced too fast, with poor cinematography and loose acting, some others are just as good as in the first movie but they're too scarce.<br/><br/>Pretty average, exploitative, complacent stuff for me. Sorry, I've seen so many movies that I need much more than that to be impressed. As far as classics goes, I'd rather watch ""12 angry men"" or ""Le Procès"" for the 30rd time than another of these cliché-ridden mob movies."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","23","43","6 October 2010"," A decent follow-up but not great as far as I'm concerned
","""The Godfather: Part II"" hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.<br/><br/>The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.<br/><br/>The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldn't really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didn't find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I don't feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though it's nowhere near as consistent as the first film.<br/><br/>Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino & Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo & Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I don't feel that ""The Godfather: Part II"" lives up to its pedigree. I've watched it a few times, so I'd say that I've given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that I'm in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as I'm concerned, ""Chinatown"" deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film."

Part II on the other hand grabbed me right from the start and I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The film tells two stories simultaniosly. One is a direct continuation of the first film, in which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to balance his family life and leading the Corleone family's criminal empire. The other tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert deNiro) who is the godfather from the first film. The two different stories make the three hour run-time fly by. The slices we get of each story are perfectly paced in a way that makes every scene interesting.<br/><br/>This film is also a visual masterpiece. The directing and editing are flawless and the production design is also amazing. The costumes and props bring the 50s and 1900s alive in a beautiful way.

"jansen-aui","10","4","5","26 June 2006"," More ambitious and grand in scope, Part II packs a powerful emotional punch
","Given complete control over the directorial proceedings by Paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think Francis Ford Coppola had it good when, two years after the release of The Godfather, the studio convinced him to direct The Godfather: Part II. Despite this free reign, Coppola still faced challenges  most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. There are many critics who regard the second part of the Corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while I don't think Part II is as ""classic"" as it's original, I can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy.<br/><br/>The Godfather: Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), established in the end of part one as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to Nevada. Michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in Havana and Miami, where Hyman Roth (one of his father's aging ex-partners) resides. When betrayal comes from where he least expects, Michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. Throughout Michael's ordeal, Coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young Vito Corleone (then Vito Andolini) must flee Sicily when he becomes hunted by the local Mafioso at the age of only nine. As an immigrant, we are shown the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of New York.<br/><br/>Coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. They come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young Vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the Michael story. With the interconnectedness of the narrative, Coppola encourages a contrast of the way Michael and Vito take control of their respective families  what decisions they make, what they value  and this helps to further punctuate and underline the film's harrowing final scenes.<br/><br/>In keeping with the tone of the first picture, Part II sees the return of Gordon Willis' dark, under lit photography, and Nino Rota's memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent ""The Immigrant""). The acting across the board is quality  just as it was in the original. John Cazale has a larger role here as Fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family Don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. Newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, Michael Gazzo as caporegime Frank Pentangeli and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, preserving Brando's famous gesture and manner, but it's Al Pacino's picture through and through  his Michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. By the end of the picture, Pacino's beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. It's a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts."
"richarevans1","10","4","5","12 August 2003"," Truly a masterpiece
","Often seen as possibly a greater film than even ""The Godfather"" this film is truly remarkable. Part of the film is a pre-quel, with Robert De Nero playing a young Marlon Brando (is that a dream casting or not?) partly it's the story of Michael Corleone as he grows into the role of Godfather. Again brilliantly filmed, great acting, a great story of love revenge etc. but in some ways it's harder to sympathise with Michael as he slips further into a hell of revenge and murder. Like watching a car-crash."
"Steffi_P","7","15","27","31 July 2010"," ""It had nothing to do with business""
","In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.<br/><br/>Being a drama, The Godfather Part II's biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brando's middle-aged Don in The Godfather. It's still only a small demonstration of De Niro's talents however.<br/><br/>Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roth's wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she's not a character we need to remember, he doesn't allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.<br/><br/>But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. It's intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.<br/><br/>And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying ""They're carving up Cuba – geddit?"" But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And what's more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather – the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end – all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel."
"bob the moo","Null","11","19","13 April 2004"," A rich epic based on great performances - a little too lush but still a great tale of the corrupting nature of power
","Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.<br/><br/>I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.<br/><br/>This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.<br/><br/>The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","5","19","37","12 June 2010"," Over ambitious over long and over rated.
","At the time of its release, many claimed this to be a finer film than the original. However, the passage of time has been less kind to this than that iconic movie. <br/><br/>Much of the problem stems from the decision to make this both the sequel and prequel to the first film at the same time. So we have the back story of Vito Corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son Michael inter-cut throughout. This adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if Michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours. <br/><br/>Details in both stories fail to convince, the Vito back story most of all. It is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. As played by De Niro, he is a Robin Hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. He could have easily been taken out. The real Vito Corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. His character is whitewashed for Hollywood consumption. And there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene. <br/><br/>There is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in Michael's story arc. This differs from Vito's since while Vito's is very simple, Michael's is very very complex. Too complex perhap. Various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. The Mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary Cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the Kennedy assassination. The narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. The writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again. <br/><br/>The female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts. Talia Shire's impassioned plea to her brother sticks in the mind, but elsewhere she barely speaks a word. Diane Keen has a better role and sinks her teeth into it with gusto.<br/><br/>The film belongs to Al Pacino who dominates this in the way that Hamlet does in Shakespeare's play. Its an accomplished performance as would be expected. There is certainly enough here to make it worth watching, but it could have been much better."

"powermandan","10","5","7","4 December 2014"," Better Than The Original? Maybe. Unbelievable Ride? HELL YEAH!!
","The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I don't care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.<br/><br/>With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else he's ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacino's rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.<br/><br/>The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone who's family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleone's most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New York's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman.<br/><br/>If there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know Michael can destroy him and all he has. One reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. That masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. So maybe the first one is better.<br/><br/>Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppola's direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.<br/><br/>4/4"
"Boba_Fett1138","10","5","7","5 November 2009"," The movie that does everything right.
","As far as sequels are concerned; they just don't get any better than this. As a matter of fact ""The Godfather: Part II"" even ranks above the sublime ""The Godfather"", which got made 2 years earlier, starring mostly the same cast.<br/><br/>The movie connects nicely with the first movie and decides to start off were the first movie had finished. Michael is the new Don now and he continues his father work by leading a crime syndicate based in New York. Besides the usual struggles with other the other families and other characters who are looking for opportunities to gain more power and control, Michael also needs to handle his personal life with his wife and his other family members, who aren't all on the same line.<br/><br/>But ""The Godfather: Part II"" is not just a movie that continues what the first movie had started. It also adds a story-line of the young Vito Corleone, played in the first movie by Marlon Brando. In this movie he is being portrayed by Robert De Niro, who wasn't really a big star yet at the time. It's amazing how these two different story-lines, set at completely different time periods and also in essence have really nothing to do with each other, blend in so perfectly. The historical settings of the New York of the early 20th century are also truly impressive.<br/><br/>It's a movie that got practically made by the same cast and crew as the first successful movie. Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V. Gazzo but it was Robert De Niro who would eventually take the statue back home. <br/><br/>What also makes this movie an even better one than its predecessor is the fact that this movie is filled with some classic moments of cinema. It contains some of the best known sequences and phrases. It also contains some great constructed and build-up sequences, for which the credit really needs to go to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the characters are more developed and expanded in this movie. A true accomplishment for a movie with so many characters in it but then again the movie has also more than 3 hours to tell its story.<br/><br/>A sequel that even surpasses its brilliant predecessor.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"OllieZ","10","5","7","15 January 2007"," A great sequel and enduring vision of corruption and family.
","Without a doubt, Coppola made four of the best films of the 70's. The Godfaher Part 1, Part 2, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.<br/><br/>It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.<br/><br/>Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesn't over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.<br/><br/>De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.<br/><br/>This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the ""college boy"" and ""war hero"" of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.<br/><br/>Just as Michael's family is dissolving, Vito's is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michael's character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesn't understand how to sustain it.<br/><br/>A classic."
"ashish-verma-82","10","5","7","6 September 2006"," Best sequel
","Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power. The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn. He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film. Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies.<br/><br/>The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...<br/><br/>De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity.<br/><br/>Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor. It is not really a sequel, it's just more. It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters."
"MaxBorg89","10","5","7","15 March 2006"," This is a sequel that demands respect!
","After the huge success of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo go on with narrating the history of the Corleone family. It picks up right where we left it: Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in America. Soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. Apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (Robert Duvall) he can't trust anyone (""Keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer""), including his own brother Fredo (John Cazale). Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore.<br/><br/>As we witness Michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, it's the same Vito Corleone who made ""offers you can't refuse"" in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. It's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the ""best"" way to achieve something under specific circumstances.<br/><br/>Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. The screenplay is flawless, Coppola and Puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family that's ever shown up on a screen.The family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the director's father, Carmine Coppola, helps Nino Rota with the superb, tragic score.<br/><br/>But let's not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the Corleones memorable: Pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside Scarface's Tony Montana, while Duvall, Cazale and Talia Shire (not to mention James Caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. Yet there's one guy who tops all of them, the only one I haven't mentioned so far: Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for playing the young Vito Corleone. It's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): De Niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. It's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.<br/><br/>Before The Godfather: Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies. I can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and you'll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time."

The camera work in the flashback sequences chronicling the early life of Vito is stunning and would make you think you are looking at a picture from the twenties.

With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didn't, you won't. It's really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.<br/><br/>This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.<br/><br/>Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.<br/><br/>If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other."
"arthurclay","10","6","9","2 July 2005"," Considered by some
","Critics to be better than the original artistically at least. I am still not sure myself but they may be right. It continues the legacy of the Corleone Family and digs into the roots of their criminal empire. There are a series of flashbacks and that could be confusing to some and to be honest I'm not sure that was positive for the flow of the picture but who am I to criticize that. There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","7","11","30 November 2009"," Requiem for a Dream
","You can write the volumes about the Godfather Part II phenomena. There is nothing that has not been said about it greatness, magnificence, perfection that radiate in every aspect, every moment, every inch of every frame, every performance, quote, glance, in the sound of the music, in both parts of the story, past and present that take the viewer to the journey in search of American Dream that turn to the epic vision of gaining ultimate power coming with ultimate loneliness. The story of one family of Italian Immigrants begins in Sicily in 1901, goes to New York City's ""Little Italy"" and spans over the most part of the 20th century. The viewers and the critics often argue which film is better, the original Godfather (1972) or Part 2. (1974). Both films are perfect in every way, and the vision and movie-making talent of a young director named Francis Ford Coppola are simply awesome. His idea of making an American epic, the story of one family raise to power, the price it takes and the eventual fall instead of a low budget fast moving gangster movie as the MGM studio had planned proved to be the stroke of genius. It is not easy to choose the best of two but I prefer Part II because I found the way Coppola tells two parts of the story by intertwining them and cutting effortlessly, seamlessly between the different time periods and geographic locations - incomparable. Yes, it's been done before and after him but never was I touched so deeply and amazed by the artistry and brilliancy of moving between past and future. I am surprised that the film was not rewarded for the editing because the team of editors contributed enormously in what is the magic of The Godfather, Part II. The film is unique by being at the same time a prequel and a sequel to the original Godfather because it tells the stories of young Vito Corleone first steps to the top of the criminal world and of Michael, his youngest son who became Godfather after his father passing. Part 2 has the most important scene in the whole trilogy, the scene when Vito kills Don Fanucci - the choice that would eventually lead to his raise as the crime family patriarch. I can go on forever. It is known how many great performances Al Pacino gave back in the 70s, his prime time (four Oscar nominations in the row, 1973-1976) but Michael Corleone in Part 2 is something that has to be studied and admired for as long as the young aspiring actors dream of not being stars but the ACTORS. I am not a fan of Pacino's latest films and roles. He screams a lot, he overplays but all screams can't say more than one glance from the scene during the New Year Celebration in Habana. He said so much by his eyes only that had literally darkened with disbelief, grief, anger, and despair when he realized that he had been betrayed by his own brother Fredo - who broke his heart and left the viewers heartbroken. John Casale had only given five performances during his tragically short career but every one of them was remarkable and every movie he worked in belongs to the best America has produced. ...Robert de Niro speaking only Italian as young Vito gives one of his finest performances speaking. He plays a beautiful, dignified, decent man, hard working, loving father and husband who would stop at nothing to make his family happy the best way he knows how... And above all - the melancholic, melodious, mournful score by Nino Rota, the Requiem for a dream, the best Rota's tunes outside Federico Fellini films, As great as it is, Godfather Part II would never be the same without musical themes written by Nino Rota specifically for the film, especially the main theme or the Kay theme - the sound of love lost and longing... And in the end - perhaps the best flash back scene ever filmed, Christmas and Vito Corleone's birthday celebration - the family is close together, the grown up children sit around the table, talk about future, some choices have been made, but there is no alienation, betrayal, losses, regrets, death....yet."
"Coxer99","10","7","11","21 March 1999"," The Godfather Part II
","I have to agree with Robert Towne when he said this film is one of the greatest achievements in the history of screenwriting. When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that ""method"" to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original."
"jmlawton","Null","16","31","6 March 2012"," Astonishingly unapproachable, bored me to tears
","I have been forced to watch the Godfather trilogy by a friend of mine who thinks, as do most people, that they are the best thing since sliced bread. I found ""The Godfather"" just about watchable, but no more - I would have given up if my friend hadn't been there, but this was completely intolerable. I couldn't follow who the people were (and didn't care) I couldn't relate it to the previous film. I couldn't relate the 1930s stuff to the 1950s stuff. There is no excitement no tension, no nothing. A complete waste of an evening. And it's so interminably long too. I'm having trouble filling out my ten lines for the review, because the film left almost no impression on me - except that feeling that I used to get at school when I was forced to sit through the most boring lesson in the world. And God help me, I'm going to have to watch the third one. Like taking cod-liver oil. Ugh."
"kuangzao","10","2","2","1 April 2020"," well constructed film
","Controversial opinion: way too long, could have made a tighter movie out of just the content set in the movie's present. That said, a very well constructed film."
"keirjosephwilson","10","2","2","13 February 2020"," I was rather skeptical about this film
","If you read my review of The Godfather you'd know I was very impressed. And so, when I heard people saying this film was even better than the original, I was rather skeptical. After all, this film doesn't have any Marlon Brando in it, and he was arguably the best part of the original, and more than that, any film topping The Godfather is an impressive task which few films are capable of pulling off, what with how good that film is, nevermind the film's own sequel. However, upon watching this film, I have to say, this film might actually be better than the original Godfather. It's hard to say definitely because they are such different films, and myself, I can't really say which film is better due to said difference, but there are certainly elements here that work better than they did in the original Godfather, and at the very least the two films are comparable in terms of quality (and trust me even that is high praise)."
"d-24473","10","2","2","22 January 2020"," The Godfather II, the Don of Drama
","Exhilarating, intense, passionate. These are words often used to describe Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film, ""The Godfather II"". The film certainly delivers on all of those descriptions, and then some. It maintains the same themes of family, betrayal, and revenge as its preceding film, The Godfather, while still keeping the experience fresh and invigorating to experience.<br/><br/>The story is a continuation of The Godfather, following Michael Corleone played brilliantly by Al Pacino. After his father's death he becomes the new Don of the Corleone family. Due to the events that occurred in the previous installment, Michael has pulled out of New York to consolidate his operation in Nevada. While in his home, Michael is the victim of an assasination attempt. He suspects betrayal within his own family, and leads his own investigation into the matter. Meanwhile Michael has ambitions to expand business into Florida and Cuba with his father's old business partner Hyman Roth (played by Lee Strasberg). Throughout the movie it transitions using a flashback to Michael's father, Vito Corleone played by Robert De Nero. It takes us through his life growing up in Sicily, Italy, and eventually immigrating to New York. We see how Vito grew the Corleone name into a respected and powerful symbol, and building his business from the ground up.<br/><br/>Coppola displays his creative skill in screenwriting by telling two compelling narratives in the same film. The way he uses lighting to change the mood and tone of the setting adds depth to each scene. It creates an eerie and intense feeling at just the right moments, striking emotion into the scenes. The only problem I found with the writing was if you don't have any historical context, you will find yourself somewhat confused about what is happening. Though the use of history in the story is done perfectly, and adds another creative layer to the Cuba arc of the story. If you aren't paying attention or miss details because of the laid back and casual way lines are delivered at some key moments, then the following scene might fly over your head. My first viewing of the film I found myself asking myself ""Why are they doing that?"", or ""Why did that happen?"". Despite this, the story is still told in a mature and creative way that held my attention throughout the entire three and a half hour run time. All major themes found in the previous film family, betrayal, and revenge are built upon in this one. Each theme plays an important role in each of the decisions that are made. Coppola mixes themes that are like oil and water to make a shocking and compelling narrative. All themes in the film are ones that the majority of people watching can relate to, which allows the viewer to connect better with the characters and what they're feeling. The acting in the film mustn't go overlooked either. Al Pacino delivers his most notable performance in this film. I was able to feel the anger and passion through the screen during a major twist while he was arguing with his wife about their unborn child. All of the context built throughout the film and knowing how important family is for Michael, tears at the viewer which wouldn't be possible without Al Pacino's incredible performance. Robert De Nero and Robert Duvall each play their roles very notably, they where each casted perfectly and couldn't imagine any other actor playing their roles. There are some moments where the acting could be improved, like how a dead body is clearly breathing if you look close enough which can break the immersion. It's a very insignificant gripe, but worth mentioning. The soundtrack in the film is beautifully produced, and at times Coppola uses music being played in the scene to make the setting feel more natural.<br/><br/>The Godfather II is truly a timeless masterpiece of a film. It is the perfect example of a sequel done right, building on the key themes and elements that defined the previous film. The use of history and the blending of themes that on the surface wouldn't mix creates a compelling, exhilarating, and intense story that will hook you deep the entire time. Coppola is definitely a titan in the drama genre, which resulted in one of the most influential films of our time."

"JMichaelAtchue","10","2","2","24 October 2019"," The Greatest Crime Drama of All Time
","The first ""Godfather"" is one of my favorite movies. So is ""The Godfather Part II,"" which is not only superior to the original but has a serious claim to being my favorite movie of all time. While Marlon Brando's presence is sorely missed, ""Part II"" does everything the original did and does it better. Its story is deeper, richer, and ultimately more thought provoking. While ""Part I"" was a tale of good and evil, ""Part II"" explores the Mafia as the ultimate perversion of the American Dream - something that took the innocence of the immigrant ideal and warped it into a criminal monstrosity.<br/><br/>""Part I"" showed how a good man can become evil. ""Part II"" continues that story and demonstrates how an amoral but complicated man can lose his own soul in doing what he thinks is right. Like ""Part I,"" ""Part II"" is endlessly entertaining but it's also more emotionally involving and satisfying. I love how the filmmakers show the parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone, who're both played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The fact that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar for ""Part II"" is unbelievable; it's easily the best performance of his career. In fact everyone in ""Part II"" is great, from Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton to John Cazale. Like ""Part I"" the writing, directing, and music of ""Part II"" are flawless and make for some of the greatest scenes in movie history. ""The Godfather Part II"" is an unqualified masterpiece and essential viewing for anyone who loves movies. 10/10."
"kierenamand","10","2","2","15 September 2019"," Great addition to the Godfather series
","This film is not a sequel to the first, its so much more than that. Its difficult to compare the two films against one another but they both sit in the top 5 films ever made - and that says enough.<br/><br/>Watching how Micheal is dealing with taking over the family is exciting yet you can't help but feel a little bit sorry for him as he never wanted this life. Seeing how he has to hold the family together with fear is even more disturbing as we flash back to seeing his father create the family with love.<br/><br/>De Niro is amazing as a young Don Vito and rightfully won an Oscar for his performance.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10.

"dpg-87522","9","2","2","8 August 2019"," So great,but not better than the first one.
","For me the Godfather trilogy is the best trylogy of all, this second part is so great, but is not better than the first one i have heard that a lot of people said that this part is better than the first one and is not, why?Well the answer of that is very simple, is because the first one had a story more interesting and had all the characters,charecters that they are not in this movie because they are dead, interesting characters,and yeah this second part give you new characters but they are not as interesting as the first one. But seeing the good side thhe conflict of the movie is very interesting and dramatic, as in the first one the performeance of Al pacino and the other actors is great, and the evolucion and the evolution of Michael Corleone is incredible, and i like very much that the movie tells you the orgins of Don Corleone.This movie, more than anything, tells us about Michael's path in the life of crime, everything he is doing and the bad decisions he has made. Finally the ending of the movie is great,because reminds you of what Michael used to have with a scene of him eating with his family and then he changes the scene to a lonely Michael who really has nothing left."

"imseeg","10","2","2","7 April 2019"," The original Godfather is like Spring. Watching The Godfather part 2 is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful and as mesmirising, yet so saddening
","2 word advice: Watch it. Just watch it. Watch the restored 4K version if you can, the picture quality is breathtakingly gorgeous. This isnt a review by the way, it's just a long tribute to the brilliance of this work.<br/><br/>For once a sequel is as powerful as the original. The Godfather part 2 is the proof. It is more elobarate, with a more detailed, complicated story, compared to the original. It has more character devellopment than part 1. Yet it definitely has a more saddening, melancholic mood as well. The original Godfather is like watching Spring, watching The Godfather part 2 however is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful, as mesmirising and as brilliant as the original, but so saddening to watch. Sad, but beautiful.<br/><br/>Director Francis Ford Coppola pulled of something no other director has ever achieved. He created 2 masterpieces of American cinema back to back, within 2 years. Coppola was a mad man in the seventies. Bordering on lunacy and also bordering on bankruptcy. Although one would think the enormous succes of the original Godfather made him a millionaire, he risked all his money for the sequel. That risk of investing all of his own money gave him a lot of creative control though, with consequentially terrific results.<br/><br/>Just to mention one example in which director Coppola took risks no other director would dare take, I want to tell you about the Robert de Niro scenes shot in New York. The studio wanted to shoot these streetscenes on a cheaper indoor filmset, but director Coppola insisted he wanted to shoot on the streets of New York.<br/><br/>This was not just a regular shoot, no way. Coppola cordoned off two entire city blocks for weeks on end. He redesigned the entire 2 blocks to make them look exactly like pre-war conditions. New Yorkers being New Yorkers were complaining about the inability to enter their own houses for weeks on end. The costs that cordoning off entire city blocks costed were skyrocketing. And for what purpose? Coppola wanted an authentic looking scene of merely a couple a minutes in which Robert de Niro would walk the streets of his neighbourhood.<br/><br/>These scenes do look stunning, and because I know how many millions these few scenes have costed, I cant help but admire Coppola even more then I already did, for wanting to go to the limit in order to achieve ultimate credibility. And THAT is what the Godfather oozes in massive amounts: CREDIBILITY. Never before or after have life and love and the bonds of family been portrayed with such cinematic craftmanship and soul.<br/><br/>Originally released in 1974. It was brilliant, mesmirising and taking my breath away back then. It still does, to this very day..."

Al Pacino reprising his role as the powerful now Boss of the Corleone family. In this film you see the a cold-blooded Michael that would do anything in his power to secure the happiness and well-being of himself and his family. From the house shooting to the killing of his own brother. But, with a beautiful fairytale about the up-bringing of his father in the States and his struggles. Robert De Niro giving one of what is considered to be his best performance to date. The beginning of a life in stealing and killing, his friendship with Clemenza and the killing of an Italian Boss in Sicily to revenge his mother's death. This movie is as good if not better than it's original."

","I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.<br/><br/>It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br/><br/>Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

I couldn't help but watch The Godfather again. But i chose to watch The Godfather part 2 instead and boy I loved it.
Perfect acting by everyone specially by the trio Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and John Cazale. These people gave the performance of their life. This is De Niro best performance after Raging bull and taxi driver and Al pacino's best after Scarface.
The way this movie plays with your emotion is indescribable. The best part is when Michael hugs Fredo during their mother's funeral and they seem to have forgotten what had happened but the look Michael gives to Al Neri we know that Michael is going to kill Fredo. This part shows us the true haunting nature of Michael. And the part when Anthony is called by Connie and Fredo says to him that he will catch a fish for Anthony and Al Neri smiles at the back making it feel normal but we knowing what is behind the smile is haunting.
Everything about this movie is perfect! For me this, The Godfather and Raging Bull are the best movies ever made"

"Vartiainen","Null","2","2","11 July 2017"," Deep dive into Michael Corleone's psyche
","The original Godfather was more about Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) than it was about Michael (Al Pacino), his son. Michael was the other main character certainly, but it was Vito's movie all around. In this sequel the roles are switched and while it's still about Vito, specifically about his youth, it's much more about Michael and his struggle with power, responsibility, pride and greed.<br/><br/>The movie dances between two timelines, following both young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and Michael as the new head of the Corleone family. The roles are also switched in that in the original film we followed the fall of an aging crime boss and the rise of a cunning mind in Vito and Michael, respectively. This time it's Vito that's rising to become the most feared and respected man in New York, whereas Michael is the one to suffer and watch as his life is torn down all around him.<br/><br/>Superb storytelling from Francis Ford Coppola, and the main reason why this is such a beloved movie. In lesser hands all these separate strings, characters and plot points would have become a convoluted mess, but in Coppola's hands they weave a tapestry of corruption, personal glory and ruthless ambition. And while it is a requirement to have seen the original film, it in no way takes away from the saga. In truth these films should be regarded as one long experience.<br/><br/>The secondary reason why these films work so well are of course the actors. Al Pacino once again gives us the performance of a century. He has moved from young man plagued by naivety, responsibility and obligation to a man burdened by expectations beyond any reason, inner struggles of family and endless ambition to prove himself worthy of his father's legacy. Robert De Niro as young Vito proves himself Pacino's equal. In him we get a character that's eerily similar to young Michael in intelligence, charisma and willingness to do what's necessary, but unlike his eventual son, this man isn't burdened by the expectations of larger society. He isn't an unreasonable man, but neither does he expect anything to be given to him if he isn't willing to take it by himself. Fantastic roles, both of them.<br/><br/>The only flaw I can name in this film in comparison to the original is the multitude of plot point and story lines. I mentioned that in Coppola's hands they are not the disaster they would otherwise be, but that doesn't mean that the original movie isn't a purer, more streamlined experience. Though only in comparison. This film is still a masterpiece by any standards."
"Rampaging Hulk","10","2","2","9 March 2000"," Quite simply the best gangster movie ever made
","The first Godfather movie was a milestone in cinematic history. Puzo's book was awesome, but when he and Coppola teamed up to make the movie they produced an almost flawless film. It seemed impossible that they could repeat that, let alone top it. They did. Largely thanks to an absolutely perfect performance from the ever amazing Robert De Niro, this is a superior sequel. Portraying the young Vito Corleone (De Niro) as he becomes 'The Godfather', and his son Michael's (Al Pacino) descent from innocent and moral kid to emotionless and malevolent crime king, this film is an epic masterpiece. With a fantastic plot and frankly flawless performances across the board it is quite simply the best gangster movie ever made."

"Danimal-7","10","2","2","2 September 1999"," ""They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.""
","I am one of the minority who like THE GODFATHER: PART II better than the original.  In the first GODFATHER, we saw Michael give up his dream of an honest life to save his family and lead it back to greatness.  Here, we see he sacrifices everything for his family, and in the end loses even that.<br/><br/>At the same time, we see how Michael's father Vito became the great Don. Starting out by doing his family and his fellow immigrants a great favor by eliminating the brutish, terroristic Don Fannucci, Vito ends up merely replacing one tyrant with another in ANIMAL-FARM-like style.<br/><br/>As we see Michael and Vito maneuver for power against their enemies (including Hyman Roth, excellently played by Lee Strasberg), we begin to wonder how much worse the mafiosi are than the government officials who surround them.  Their dishonesty and their violence would hardly be out of place in many ""legitimate"" governments throughout history, and in some cases even today.  As Michael tells a corrupt Senator played by G.D. Spradlin, ""we're both part of the same hypocrisy.""<br/><br/>(Spoilers below).<br/><br/>The ending of THE GODFATHER: PART II is one of the most poignant in history, as Michael's memory flashes back to a party before he joined the military. The scene contains four men besides himself: Santino, Fredo, Tessio, and Carlo.  All are dead now - three of them by Michael's own order.  As Tessio mentions that thousands of young men are enlisting to fight the Japanese after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Santino comments, ""They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.""  Now Michael, having risked his life for his family for years, finds they are strangers to him who fear and loathe him.  The third part notwithstanding, the tragedy is complete.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of ****."
"shoot_the_martini","10","2","2","9 September 2001"," The greatest film of all time
","The Godfather II is regarded as the only sequel to be as good as its predecessor. My opinion is that it is far better.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Michael Corleone, the new Godfather, and flashes back to tell the tale of his father Vito as a young man. These two characters are portrayed brilliantly by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>The performances are great on all accounts, as is the direction.<br/><br/>With this film I found I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The story seems overly complicated at face value, but I found I understood more than I thought I did. And it was great.<br/><br/>I thought I'd not enjoy the film a second time round, but no I still loved it.<br/><br/>This chapter in the Corleone saga is better than its predecessor and Part III because of so many reasons. Part I I feel was not as interesting, and that Marlon Brando's Vito (many will disagree) was not as intriguing a character as Michael, or even De Niro's Vito. Part III was a decline in the trilogy while still a worthy end (in other words it fell short of Return of the Jedi as 'best final episode of a trilogy'. So much had happened between II and III that wasn't explained in detail and seems that it may have been pivotal - even Robert Duvall's excellent Tom Hagen character was just implied as dead, and no more so. Where's the 'closure' you US folk are on about (no offence)?<br/><br/>Anyway I think the three films are all amazing, but II stands proud among them all as the best of the lot, and the best film of all time."

","""The only sequel better than its predecessor.""  Come now, the ONLY sequel? How can you tell?  I can think of several such examples - and this isn't one of them.  The Godfather films (I presume we may ignore the third) are now a quarter of a century old, and if you haven't seen them, chances are that two snippets of information will leap into your mind when you think of them: they are about the Mafia, and the sequel is as good as the original.  This latter line has been repeated so many times, always with the same air of surprise, that it has entered popular mythology.  It is my sad duty to report that it's not true.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" was a story about the corruption of a soul.  It was a good such story, since the person who suffered such corruption did so from the noblest of motives, or at any rate from motives it would have been hard to question.  But, of course, once the process of corruption is complete, the story's over.  ""The Godfather Part II"" is afflicted with the same blight that afflicts most of the other sequels we dislike.  It's just more of the same doodling at the end of the script, prompted by a desire to know what happens next after the point has been reached where we don't need to know - and, worse, it childishly gives in to the impulse to tell the same story AGAIN rather than think of a new one.  When the original story concerned itself with the corruption of a good man this is just impossible to pull off.<br/><br/>Stylishly made, plenty of good bits, but heavily over-valued."
"pocomarc","4","29","67","4 July 2007"," Godfather II Stunk
","Godfather Two is Coppola's movie---and he had no instincts for the mafia. The Godfather author, Mario Puzo, objected to having Michael kill his own brother, but finally gave in to keep his share of the Hollywood millions.<br/><br/>Godfather Two has lightweights as heavies: the drunken New York mob guy and Hyman Roth can't compare to Barzini, Sollozo, and the other heavyweight bad guys of the original Godfather written by Puzo.<br/><br/>Godfather Two loses the atmosphere of the mob while it meanders lengthily into Cuba.<br/><br/>The main point that makes Godfather Two inferior is that it does not contain a single sympathetic character.The endless scenes in the Lake Tahoe home of Michael's are tiresome, dreary after a while, and lack interest as compared to the original Puzo story.<br/><br/>This movie shows a deterioration from the original, just as the mob has deteriorated in recent years.<br/><br/>Coppola had no right to think he could write his own Godfather, and his inferiority to Puzo when it comes to dealing with the mob shows up here in technicolor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, poor Mario Puzo watched his story being degraded by the instinctless Coppola, objected at first, and then gave in. Pathetic.<br/><br/>The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).<br/><br/>The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table. As soon as Sonny appears, everything comes to life."
"krumski","4","26","60","5 February 2000"," An absolutely great sequel - NOT!
","As a huge fan of the original Godfather, I have never understood all the hoopla about this film. A great continuation of the story? The only sequel to be better than the original? No way, on both counts - not by a long shot.<br/><br/>First of all, The Godfather is a movie that truly needs no sequel. When that door closes on Kay at the end, that's it - an entire cycle has played out: power has been passed on, the new guard has superseded the old, evil has corrupted goodness and the sins of the father have come back to feast upon the sons. It is a perfect story, complete in itself and suggestive of all that is to come. Anything you could add would only be elaboration, nothing genuinely new.  As such, there's nothing - not one single thing - which happens in The Godfather Part II that is not either already implied in the first movie or at least could be predicted by knowing the first movie. Therefore, the story just doesn't feel fresh; it feels more like a ""standard"" sequel - that is, one done just for the money, to capitalize on the series while it was hot. (The true greatest sequel of all time, of course, is The Empire Strikes Back - superceding the original in so many ways and on so many levels it's unbelievable.)<br/><br/>Now, I'll concede there's an awful lot of artistry on display in this movie - the acting is all great, the cinematography and production design, etc. It certainly doesn't have the *look* of a quickie re-hash. And you can tell that considerable time and effort has gone into the story and in the structuring of the movie. Which makes its failure all the more troubling to watch. First of all, the cross-cutting between the two time periods (Vito Corleone in the early part of the century and Michael in the late '50s) just DOES NOT WORK.  I'll challenge anybody on this point; if you think it's a good idea, you're just WRONG! I can half see what Coppola had in mind here, but it's just annoying. First off, the two sequences are not equally weighted - we see far more of the ""modern day"" Michael segment - and so the Vito scenes come to feel more like an intrusion, a break up of the momentum of the real movie, rather than as a legitimate sequence in its own right. And frankly, it's not a legitimate sequence anyway - it's far too bathed in quaintness and romanticism, it never truly takes Vito to task for the life he has chosen; in fact, it doesn't even give us a good sense of why he has chosen that life. Except for the brief murder scenes, it mostly portrays Vito as a hero - a Robin Hood of the people - and does not give a clear picture of the ruthlessness and cold-bloodedness he would have needed to build up his empire. (For a good portrait of this side of the young Vito, read the chapter in the original Godfather book by Mario Puzo which focuses upon his rise to power. Compare this sequence to the movie's in order to see just how much Coppola has omitted and how much he has romanticized what he's kept.) <br/><br/> Coppola wants to save all his rage and condemnation for Michael, you see - almost as if the Corleone crime family was kind of a Mom and Pop store started by the old man in the good old days, and was great and wonderful until the young whippersnapper came in with all of his newfangled ways and started screwing everything up. If Michael's soul is shown as corroded by the end of the movie, why is Vito not assessed in the same harsh way? After all, if not for him, his son would never have been put in this position in the first place. Curiously, Michael's attempts to ""go legitimate"" are portrayed as the real horror here, which is certainly an interesting idea, but I think this is a theme much better developed in The Godfather Part III, where the agent of legitimacy becomes the Church (the Vatican), making for a much richer and headier mix. Here, Michael's mainly trying to buy into resorts and casinos in Cuba. How interesting is that?<br/><br/>Finally, this picture moves sooooo slowly and takes so much time to tell its story (er, stories) that it becomes sleep-inducing. Not enough of import happens here for the story to take as long as it does. In short, The Godfather Part II is a film with an inflated sense of its own importance; the wonder is that it has suckered so many millions of people into buying into it. The Godfather is a movie which truly needs no sequel, but if you feel compelled to see one, rent Part III and skip over this tired and pretentious mess."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","6","10","24 November 2010"," One of the best sequels ever made
","I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.<br/><br/>For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.<br/><br/>The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

In this movie we see the rise of Vito Corleone to become The Godfather and how Michael Corleone expands his family business but we also see his moral degradation.In the Godfather we see Vito Corleone has no regrets for his deeds because he had maintained his virtues but in this movie Michael regrets his deeds very much because he has morally degraded(which we see at the end).This is a fair depiction of ""changing times"".

"joelsaxton","10","5","8","14 February 2005"," Better than the first? I still can't decide.
","To those who say The Godfather glorifies the mob, I say watch both Part I and II in tandem. Observe where Michael Corleone begins and where he ends: he begins as the idealistic war hero, refusing to get involved in the family business, but he is quickly engulfed by circumstance and slowly transforms into a cold and ruthless underworld boss. The recurring theme of solitude is persistent throughout the film. Michael trusts nobody, and his instinct is ultimately proved correct when he learns Fredo has betrayed him. In the end, he is completely alone. He has destroyed his marriage, he has alienated his consiglierie, and he has murdered his brother. From this perspective, the story of the Godfather is a classic tragedy. The final shot solidifies this notion, showing Michael sitting alone, reflecting on his life. By trying to protect his family, Michael has destroyed it."

The embroidery of the life of father and son, the metamorphose of Michael Corleone, the pressure of past, the air of nostalgia , the details as large mosaics and the cold feeling of a story about everything.

","After ""The Godfather"" became the most commercially and critically successful film when it was released back in 1972, a sequel or better yet a companion film to it was released known as ""The Godfather Part II"".Robert De Niro and Al Pacino star as the young Vito Corleone and Michael respectively in this second Godfather film together with Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale,G.D Spradlin, and Lee Strasberg.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of Don Vito Corleone and his son Michael when both were of the same age with the former's story about his arrival in the United States coming from Sicily after his parents and older brother were killed as well as the rise of the Corleone crime family in the 1920's and latter's story with regards to the Corleone empire's expansion in its gambling operations during the 1950's as well as the deterioration of his character as he deals with the other rival mob bosses particularly Frank Pentangeli and Hyman Roth.<br/><br/>While the film maybe considered a sequel to the first film,I consider it more of a companion film of part I.In it,we get to know how Don Vito came into power as a mob boss when he killed Don Fanucci and a background story of how violence came early into his life when a local Sicilian mob boss killed his parents and older brother Paolo.We also get a better understanding how he transformed from being a worker of the Abandando Bakery into a criminal life in the mob.We also see how Michael was able to increase the success of the Corleone family and how more ruthless he has become when he ordered the death of his enemies that included his older brother Fredo.Added to that,we also see how Michael was able to outwit the U.S. Senate on their investigation.The story was told in parallel and I believe that the film provided the viewer a great story just like the first film.No question that director Francis Ford Coppola and novel's author Mario Puzo wrote a great screenplay together. Aside from the story,we also get to witness great performances from the cast.Al Pacino definitely did justice to the role of Michael which made him get an Oscar nomination while Robert DeNiro did a masterful job as the young Vito which earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Added to that,we also see credible performances from the other members of the cast such as DuVall,Keaton,Cazale, and Strasberg.

","One of the best sequels of all time and the only Best Picture winner to be the sequel to a previous one, this film improves on its absolutely brilliant predecessor in every respect. Al Pacino is mesmerising as Michael Corleone and Robert De Niro gives a fantastic performance as his father Vito Corleone in the prequel storyline, which won him his first Oscar. The character was very recognisable as a younger version of the Godfather from the first film but De Niro still managed to put his own stamp on the role. Incidentally, Pacino is one of only two actors to be nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for playing the same character, the other being Barry Fitzgerald who was nominated for both awards for playing Father Fitzgibbon in ""Going My Way"". The writing and direction are once again of an extremely high quality.<br/><br/>I've watched nine films which ran 3+ hours long so far this year and this is one of the best structured of those. There is a not a minute that drags. The two story lines are excellent and I loved the depiction of Michael's moral decay. My favourite scene in the film is the extremely powerful one where Kay tells Michael that she is leaving him and she aborted their child when she discovered that it was a boy as she did not want to perpetuate the next generation of Corleones. I think that Diane Keaton deserved a Best Actress nomination for the film. I was surprised that Talia Shire got a Best Supporting Actress one as, while she is excellent as Connie, she has such little screen time. Besides De Niro, the two strongest newcomers were Lee Strasberg - the legendary acting teacher who taught Pacino, De Niro, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, among many others - and Michael V. Gazzo. Both of them were nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost to De Niro.

"JimBallard","10","3","4","16 January 2015"," Coppola Puts Himself In The Pantheon With Epic Part II Of The Saga
","It's hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. Having just watched this for the first time in years I was delighted to see it was as magnificent as I remembered it. Francis Ford Coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when he'd just made a film as acclaimed as The Godfather. How do you follow that? Amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in Hollywood history. And whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is Michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife Kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. Judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in Part III. This is the final Michael as we should always remember him.<br/><br/>The scope of Part II is extraordinary (as if the first film wasn't bold enough!) with the story of father Vito in 1920s New York cross- cut with son Michael's rivalry with ageing mobster Hymen Roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. These later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary Cuba to a Senate committee in Washington. This is a no holds barred portrait of American society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. How often has Hollywood been so daring<br/><br/>The film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man Vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a 'Godfather' in the Italian American community. Meanwhile in his middle age Michael has become a Don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. The inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family. <br/><br/>Few films can have gathered such a fine cast. Al Pacino's Michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. More than anything this is what elevates The Godfather over so many other gangster films. He's not just some Goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of Michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. Diane Keaton as Kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of 'respectable' America shows the futility of Michael's actions. If he can't keep his family together, what's it all for? John Cazale's Fredo is a tragedy of his own. Secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. Replacing the character of Clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, Michael V. Gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary Lee Strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend Uncle to Michael Hymen Roth, delivering one of the movies' great speeches.<br/><br/>So often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. One can only assume that the young Coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of The Godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. One only wonders why he's largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since."

"andreeamirimia","10","3","4","20 September 2014"," A great classic
","I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It gracefully blends two times: the father's, who rises to power through his own forces, and the sons' who takes care of his father legacy and increases his influence.Vito and Michael are to wonderful written characters, with both qualities and flaws. Also, the action is very captivating and i loved seeing Vito put the New York's scum in their place ;) and revenge his father! Michael is very intense and, just like his father, does everything for the good of the family. Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing and completes the first film perfectly. As Coppola wanted, they should have stopped here because the 3rd film isn't even close to the masterpieces the 1st and 2nd ones are."
"joshuawood2012","10","3","4","13 September 2014"," The Masterpiece Above All Others
","What is there to be said about the sequel to what many consider to be the greatest film of all time? ""The Godfather: Part II"" is a film unlike any other. From the seedy casinos of Nevada, to the revolution in Cuba, ""The Godfather: Part II"" chronicles the reign of Michael Corleone, acted to perfection by Al Pacino, over a massive criminal empire. Corleone's dealings with the manipulative and ruthless, but ailing, Hyman Roth, depicted by the masterful Lee Strasberg, are some of the best scenes captured on cinema. Roth is a weary, weathered old man, but he more than holds his own against the young, ambitious Michael Corleone. And how does one describe the character of Michael Corleone? Is he an evil killer that cares only about power, and will do anything to achieve it? Or is he a reluctant son, trying desperately to get out from under the enormous shadow of his father, but assailed on all fronts by enemies old and new? Perhaps both. The story of Michael Corleone in this film is a tragic one, without doubt. But his is not the only tale told in this masterpiece of cinema. The story of Vito Corleone, portrayed entirely in Sicilian by Robert De Niro, is interwoven with that of his son, and it is arguably as potent. A young Sicilian lad, orphaned by a violent Mafioso, Vito is smuggled off the island and to America. There, Vito is met with oppositions and struggles, and he overcomes them all to become the original Godfather. It is truly a journey, and shows the adversity that crafted a giant of a man.<br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part II"" beats the odds, and somehow, in my opinion, manages to be a greater film than its predecessor. It is a massive, complex, dark, tragic, ambitious film, and it succeeds in everything it does. 10/10"
"long-ford","Null","3","4","27 February 2009"," Tremendous follow up to 'The godfather' though Brando is missed
","Part II in 'The Godfather' saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"
"DKosty123","10","3","4","21 February 2009"," A Second Offer Is Harder To Refuse
","Usually, a sequel is not as strong a film as the original. This one is every bit as good. I am thankful to have just viewed the Coppola 2007 restoration of this film.<br/><br/>At well over 3 hours, it is longer than the original. What is does is deftly fill in 2 stories that we saw small parts of in the first film. We find out how the Don, Vito Cordleone got his name, what his real name is, and the history that made him who he was in the first film.<br/><br/>The second story fills in more about his kids, particularly Michael, and how he took over in the late 1950's and his battles with one of his dads enemies. The back drop moves from Nevada to Sicily, and then to Havana. Michael faces down a series of folks including a Congressional Hearing about his life.<br/><br/>While this has no Brando, it has an excellent cast from the first film with some additional folks added. James Caan makes a brief cameo at the end of the movie. Talia Shire & Diane Keaton head up to female cast though these films seems to have a cast of 100's because there are so many parties & events.<br/><br/>The film keeps with the same strength as the first film, strong storytelling which brings you in and peeks your interest enough to keep you going. When you watch this, your always wondering what is going to happen next and who will get theirs."

","This, perhaps the greatest sequel ever, tells the parallel stories of Michael's struggles as the new Godfather and the rise of the legendary Vito Corleone. The presentation of Vito's story is particularly impressive, with DeNiro in a fine performance. Michael's story tends to bog down at times but never fails to be compelling. Pacino is terrific, as are Duvall, Cazale, and Strasberg. The cinematography is beautiful and Rota builds on his memorable score from the first film. Coppola pushes all the right buttons, letting the stories unfold majestically. Having made the two Godfather films by age 35, the talented director had nowhere to go but down."

","Maybe the greatest difficulty may have been to follow up a movie like The Godfather, possibly the greatest movie ever, and Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job, most pretty good originals have a poor sequel, but how do you make a sequel to an almost perfect original. Without Marlon Brando, Al Pacino fills the big shoes as the Don in this movie, along with Robert Duvall, and flashbacks to a young Vito played none other than by Robert De Niro. This movie shows the rise of Vito and how he became so powerful, and gives you background on his upbringing and family. It also shows you how much different times are and how Michael handles current situations. I read somewhere that they asked Marlon Brando to come back for the second even though he passed in the first he probably would have done some flashbacks and It upsets me that he didn't do that, but then again who knows how it would have turned out, If that happened maybe they wouldn't have cast De Niro and would never have had the career hes had. So i guess everything happens for a reason. The Godfather Pt II is a great film and falls so close to the original."
"Hitchcoc","10","3","4","16 February 2007"," No More a Sequel that the Odyssey is to the Iliad
","It's only a sequel because of the Part II thing. This simply fills in the spaces with one of the greatest characters of all time. Remember, the two were put together in an incredible sage, putting things in chronological order. Talk about your psychological studies. Inside the head of Michael Corleone is a sense of power at all costs. Yet, he sees himself as a moral man. I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from ""non-family"" members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers. <br/><br/>I haven't a lot to add because I am not a film expert. As uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), I continue to watch. And in my heart of hearts I wonder if I were cast into this setting, could I stand up to the expectations of my culture?"
"Huffman1","Null","3","4","11 June 2006"," One of the best films of all time
","The Godfather II, in my opinion, is just as good as the first. So rare is it for a sequel to be as gripping and as well-made as this movie is. First off, I have to mention the excellent musical score. It gives the film a sort of dark, moody atmosphere, and I think it was a very good idea to use the same score as in part I. Secondly, the idea of inter wining the story of Michael Corleone and of his early father Vito was brilliant and makes this sequel stand out from the first part. This idea of showing two stories in one film could have been quite risky and confusing but Coppola did a fantastic job at it. Both stories are very clear to follow and show the contrast between Vito and his son's way of handling the family business.<br/><br/>Of course, I cannot comment on this movie without mentioning Al Pacino's awesome performance. He definitely should have won the best actor's Oscar for that role. He has unbelievable screen presence and plays incredibly well the ruthless, suspicious Michael Corleone. The most poignant scene of the film, in my opinion, is definitely the one where Michael finds out at the party that his brother Fredo betrayed him."
"chunga95","10","3","4","28 April 2005"," For anyone who thinks the Godfather is overrated
","This post is probably gonna tick you off. But I don't want to flame on your tastes. I'm not gonna trash what anyone thinks is the best movie. This is just a very long-winded argument about why The Godfathers stand as milestones in cinema. Spoilers throughout.<br/><br/>I've read a number of posts who think the characters are hollow. There are long scenes when the characters seems to be doing nothing, or just *thinking*. That's one of the great parts of the film. There are deep threads of loyalty and family and duty throughout the trilogy, and the original Godfather (and ptII) is one of the few films that does these moments justice. The cast assembled does what few ever have: you can ""see"" them thinking. Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Strasberg (of course), Duvall - all masters of what is probably the most difficult talent to achieve on film. Pacino is especially great at this in GpartII when you watch him agonize over what to do with (if you've seen it) *you-know-who*. There is a subdued intensity to each character, living a life where death is always around the corner of one bad mistake. They're thoughtful, intelligent, and conflicted. The gift of these movies is they don't telegraph these undercurrents or make it painfully obvious. If you let yourself, the characters draw you in to these processes.<br/><br/>Much of our current standards for cinema are based on flair and fast-action-packed-editing. Not to sound cheesy, but the Godfathers unfold like a rare flower, slow and with purpose. Keep in mind, there are no accidents in movies. That is to say, what you see in the frame is completely planned (as much as can be in cinema). Watch the scene where Brando is advising Pacino on the particulars of the business. There is real heartbreak between them, two men doing the family's business. Vito Corleone never wanted it to be Michael, and neither did Michael want it for himself, but both esteem the family more than themselves, and so they discuss this ugly business. If this movie were made today, the scene would only be a few snappy lines, some quick wit dialogue, and cut to the big explosion. This is a gem of a scene because you watch the actors put these emotions away to do what's brutal and necessary, and in a sense, say goodbye.<br/><br/>Watch Brando in the car after the meeting with the Five Families. He comes to a chilling realization about who is behind the war, but how? Watch this scene and then re-watch the meeting with the Five Families for the moment this realization hits him. It happens and is gone in a second, but in that second you see him decide what to do. He tucks away his anger and waits. He waits until Michael takes over, and passes this knowledge on to him without ever telling him what to do. This is where the art of direction makes this possible. Without a word ever being spoken about what's coming, Michael takes over the family business and sets the table to take control over all the families. Of course, when the hits are actually being done, and splicing them into the scene where Michael's niece is being christened, is the best form of ironic cinematic poetry. What makes the GpartI and GpartII connection is you see the same process in DeNiro/Young Vito. After he's shaken down for the last time by Don Fanucci, he decides what and how to do it in a second - and DeNiro shows that, without a word ever being spoken. <br/><br/>Of course, there are the iconic moments of the movie. The horsehead in the bed, (in the restaurant with Solozzo and McCluskey) Pacino coming to a boil as the train gets louder in the background, the opening scene with the undertaker (a great homily to Italian-Americans), Brando moving around the room and brushing his cheek, Fredo on the lake reciting the Hail Mary, Pacino kissing Fredo in Cuba, Sonny on the causeway, etc... <br/><br/>These are just a few of examples of what make these movies great. I've read where people can't identify to the characters. How many of us really can identify with the people we see on film? The Godfathers paint a portrait of a life unknown to just about everybody. The real gangsters liked it so much, they emulated the fictional parts (like the hand-kissing). The films are poetry, but there's nothing poetic about the events in it. The characters are sublime, but there's nothing sublime about their character. The movies don't give anything away (who saw the Fredo thing coming?), but are transparent at the same time. I know this is high minded and stuffy, but hopefully, even if you're not a fan, you can understand why the films are so highly regarded.<br/><br/>But, for the haters, I'll give you GpartIII - what in the h*ll was he thinking letting Sofia Coppola act? Part III is by far a weak addition to the trilogy...unless you're a die hard fan...not worth seeing. Now rub your eyes if you read the whole thing...."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","3","4","2 March 2005"," amazing continuation, but personal preference remains with Part I
","SPOILERS If you were to stop people on the street nowadays and ask them to name their favourite series of films, they'll say either one thing. Either the person will believe the current hype and say ""The Lord Of The Rings"", they'll recount to their youth and say ""Star Wars"" or they'll answer ""The Godfather"" trilogy. Containing some truly breathtaking acting and a jaw dropping good plot, the original ""Godfather"" film was a masterpiece. Even more surprising though is just how many people seem to prefer the sequel from two years later. Once more starring Al Pacino, ""Godfather Part II"" is an awesome film which could technically also be classified as a masterpiece. Still, despite the technical genius of the film, this second episode in the story of the Corleone family is slightly inferior to it's predecessor.<br/><br/>In continuation from the first film, Michael Corleone (Pacino) is head of the family and living in Las Vegas. Apparently enjoying life, Michael is a much darker character than he was during the previous film. With plans to expand into foreign territories, Michael once more finds himself faced with difficult decisions and former friends turned enemies.<br/><br/>The true genius of ""The Godfather Part II"" is the combination of sequel and prequel. Rotating between the early life of Vito Corleone (played in the original by Marlon Brando, but now played by Robert De Niro) and the current affairs of his son Michael, the film manages to tell two superb stories side by side.<br/><br/>Pacino, as with the previous film, is once again stunning as the now cold and malicious Michael. Transformed from the outsider at the beginning of Part I, Michael has become a completely different person, and Pacino shows this with skill.<br/><br/>In ""The Godfather: Part II"" however, the true star of the picture is Robert De Niro. Taking hold of the role of a younger Marlon Brando, De Niro spends his time on screen replicating Brando's mannerisms with apparent ease. He takes a firm hold on the life of the young Godfather, and he impresses throughout.<br/><br/>Despite it's technical genius though, this second part in the story does feel slightly inferior to the original. To a degree this is possibly due to the Michael scenes being original rather than Mario Puzo's book, but the parts of the film dealing with Michael, never really seem to take off compared with the original. In the first film, we are shown a loving family who fight for each other and who come out on tops despite heavy casualties and strong opposition. In this second film, the view on the family feels much more dark and disturbing. Gone seem to be the family values, and instead Michael's direction seems much more obscure and unfocused.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that this reviewer simply didn't understand this film. There's no denying that upon first viewing the original, the impression wasn't good and it took a second viewing before becoming a fan. In comparison to the Brando and Pacino led first chapter however, this second chapter doesn't really hold water. This doesn't stop it being a masterpiece, and it is. It is easily one of the finest films ever made, BUT compared with it's predecessor, it doesn't quite work."
"johnny-m","Null","3","4","22 February 2004"," The Economics of Destiny
","Sequels rarely rise to the level of the original, and almost never surpass them. This phrase has been used so often in reference to ""The Godfather: Part II""  the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.<br/><br/>This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make ""The Godfather: Part II"" stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.<br/><br/>The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.<br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part II"" remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.<br/><br/>Even if ""The Godfather"" is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, ""The Godfather: Part II"" remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising."

","I really enjoyed The Godfather, so i decided to see The Godfather Part 2 if it's better or worse, and to my utter surprise, it's better than the original and has one of the best performances in a Movie ever. This film is a true masterpiece. Here's why.<br/><br/>The story is as good as the original, this time the film has two separate story lines: Vito Corleone as a Young man and Michael Corleone's storyline. Vito Corleone's story follows his life as he evacuates from New York and to Italy by his parents in 1910 and goes through his normal day life, and Michael Corleone's story follows him being accused for being a criminal by the Law after being framed by his Brother during a celebration when another criminal did the illegal Activity that happen in the celebration and Michael goes through Family life and has a divorce With his wife and all that stuff and must prove that he isn't guilty of the actions caused by a another person.<br/><br/>The film's direction is one of the biggest strengths of this film, it's switch between Vito and Michael is done in a good pace and well choreographed camera transitions makes this film direction nearly a masterpiece. The performances especially once again Al Pacino is so good, it deserved an Oscar for best performance, for a reason, Pacino's character is so emotional, you really care for him in the scenes With his wife. Oustanding i must say.<br/><br/>The film, despite being a serious drama, has some funny moments, like where one of the characters gives Vito Money and continuously regrets it, now that was funny, but the film really is quite serious apart from that one scene, that's why the change of pace makes this quite comforting of a Movie.<br/><br/>The characters are better and the film is longer, The Godfather Part 2 is one of the best films i've ever seen, Performances, humor, drama, direction, Music and characters are great, there is nothing terrible With this Movie.

"awesomesteinberg","10","4","6","13 August 2014"," The Best Sequel, Prequel, and Movie Ever Made
","Normally, movie sequels aren't very good. They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, ""The Godfather Part II,"" is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadn't seen this one yet.)<br/><br/>""The Godfather Part II"" is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I can't say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, ""Scarface"" fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" you'll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.<br/><br/>Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I haven't yet seen ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull."") But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I can't decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasn't cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldn't have this terrific performance.<br/><br/>Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movie's cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michael's stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michael's brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things don't go according to plan. (I won't go into specifics.)<br/><br/>Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.<br/><br/>The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as it's longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.<br/><br/>This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didn't get Best Actor, but, according to ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Nobody's perfect."") Clearly topping the original, ""The Godfather Part II"" is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10/10 rating."
"C22Man","10","4","6","29 October 2013"," The greatest sequel ever made and equally as good as the original
","It seems impossible to think that the first Godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.<br/><br/>The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. <br/><br/>The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself. <br/><br/>The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, ""Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer"" and ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies"" to name but two. It's great how the film focuses more on Michael and it's reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michael's family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen."

Gazzo and Lee Strasberg.<br/><br/>The movie is a depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him - - a familial legacy then upended by Michael's business expansion in the 1950s. <br/><br/>Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay and turned his brother, Fredo, against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.<br/><br/>The film still has a strong performance from the cast despite not having Marlon Brando in it.Aside from De Niro,Al Pacino, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Lee Strasberg provide honest performances. Still present in the film is the haunting score of Nino Rota;the superb screenplay of both Puzo and Coppola; and the excellent direction of Copolla.But it has darker themes as compared to the first film as the characters are violent and amoral in their values.Also,the story presents the deterioration of the characters as the viewers feel for them in their pain and vulnerability. It may not be the ultimate family picture but nevertheless,it remains as the greatest sequel ever made and definitely one of the best films ever made."
"estebangonzalez10","10","4","6","22 September 2010"," Coppola directs a perfect sequel of a masterpiece
","¨Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.¨ Coppola's (or should I say Puzo's) The Godfather Part II is considered by many as the best sequel of all time, and some even consider it to be better than the original. In my opinion it is not as good as the first part, but there is no denying this is a great film nonetheless. Coppola did a great job with the direction once again, and has created a timeless film that movie fans go back to time after time. There are several things he did well with this film. First of all he took a completely different approach towards romanticizing the Corleone's. In the first film we were attracted to Vito for his strong family beliefs and loyalty to his friends, in this film we see how Michael completely begins to lose control of his family and friends. Michael, who I admired in the first film, has become so blind in his lust for power that he losses the strong values his father had taught him. He has grown cold, distant, and even goes as far as to hitting his wife (something Vito would never have dreamed of doing). The parallel story of young Vito and how he became a Don also works really well as it is told in flashbacks during Michael's present reign as Don. This story serves as a reminder of how distant Michael has become from what his father wanted of him. Part II is more of a nostalgic movie as we see the decline in the once strong and united Corleone family, and Nino Rota's score is a perfect example of that. The final scenes of the film only confirm this sentiment. The performance from the cast is as equally as brilliant as it was from the first, and Gordon Willis's cinematography is also equally impressive with its dark scenes that help set the mood of the film.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II continues where the first one left off with Michael (Al Pacino) as head of the Corleone family and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as his personal adviser and lawyer. They are living in Nevada now and running the gambling business in that state during the late 50's. While we follow the present storyline, Coppola introduces a series of flashbacks beginning all the way back in 1901 following the early life of Vito (Oreste Baldini) in Sicily. Vito's father, brother, and mother (in that specific order) have been killed by Don Ciccio (Giuseppe Sillato), but Vito is able to escape to New York. The film later jumps forward to 1917 where Vito (Robert De Niro) is making a living working as a clerk for a small store in New York. The movie jumps back and forth between both stories. On the one hand you have Michael trying to expand his empire traveling to Miami and Cuba, meeting with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), a successful Jewish businessman, who Michael isn't sure he can trust. On the meantime he has problems back home with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), problems with Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin), and problems in New York with Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), Clemenza's replacement and friend of the family. After an attack on his life Michael isn't sure who is after him (or maybe he is and we don't know it). On the other hand, the other story continues to follow young Vito as he meets Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) and Tessio (John Aprea) and begins his imminent rise to becoming the Don.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando was a huge part of the success of the first film, but Coppola, along with Puzo, did a great job introducing new characters to the story that contributed to the success of the sequel. Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie and Lee Strasberg as Roth were great in this film and gave it a fresh new look. Another contributing factor was the addition of the flashbacks because Robert de Niro was the right man to play young Vito. His Oscar winning performance was outstanding and he just stood out in every scene he was in. Al Pacino continued with his transformation in the first film, and now he portrayed a much darker and colder Michael. He didn't have to say anything and we already knew what he was feeling. There are several memorable scenes in which he speaks louder with his facial expressions than he does with his words. The opening scene in Nevada where the family is reunited celebrating Michael's son's First Communion is reminiscent of Connie's wedding scene in the first Godfather, and the same thing can be said of several other scenes as the final one. The sequel serves as a nostalgic memory of what the Corleone's once were (or at least what Coppola wanted us to think of them in the first romantic movie), it is much darker, but it still works and compliments the first part really well. The Godfather Part II is not better than the original, but it is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"classicsoncall","10","4","6","10 April 2010"," ""I came here because there's going to be more bloodshed"".
","It's difficult to imagine that ""Godfather II"" could trade punches with the original and still remain standing, but this is one brilliant film. Masterfully tracing the history of the Corleone Family from Vito's arrival at Ellis Island in 1901 to the Lake Tahoe empire of 1958, the story is a decades spanning saga that makes you wonder how almost three and a half hours can blow by so quickly. The picture's numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of Don Corleone's rise to power, and Robert de Niro's portrayal of the young Vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why Marlon Brando didn't show up even once. Pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like I was while watching today. It's easy to recall the highlights like Frank Pentangeli's courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way Fredo met his timely demise. What I had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the Sicilian back story, and the way the New York neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. It's funny how I recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of Don Fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be.<br/><br/>You know, it's hard to believe that the first two Godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release. They've become American classics that have well withstood the test of time, and will continue maintain their appeal. It's fair to say that seeing both of these iconic films are a must for the true cinema fan."
"DarthVoorhees","10","4","6","10 April 2005"," One of the finest sequels ever made,Beats the Original...
","The Godfather is one of the best films of all time,it is a dark story and is brilliantly acted and told.It excelled in character development,directing,and acting.You'd kind of find it hard to believe that a sequel could be better,but Godfather II is the superior movie.Godfather II has the stories of the Rise of young Don Vito Corleone in the 1910's/1920's and the moral fall of his son Michael Corleone in the late 1950's.By the end of the original Godfather you thought Michael sank to the lowest he could be.Here he was a good hearted guy,he just returned from World War II,and he had plans to marry his girlfriend Kay,but through the film he declines into a monster worse than his father.Don Vito was an interesting character,he was no doubt evil,but you could tell he had a big heart.Coppola introduced a really great way to tell a story on film,you see Michael and Don Vito at the same ages in their lives,you see how the two Corleone generations differed,how one failed,and the other prevailed.Don Vito is played excellently by Robert DeNiro.This is definitely one of DeNiro's best performances.Don Vito speaks in Italian most of the film with subtitles,so DeNiro had to do a lot of work with his face,look,and posture.Its one thing to excel at giving lines,but DeNiro excels at both verbal acting and non-verbal acting.DeNiro's Vito isn't like the Brando one at all,he's quieter,and sadder,but really you don't want them to be clones all good prequels set-up their character to become the character they are in the sequel movie.The best acting of the film though has to be that of Al Pacino as Don Michael Corleone,he has changed for the worst between movies,in the first movie he ordered killings to get more business,in Part II he orders them to get even.His wife Kay who stood by him through out all of his evil deeds in the original is loosing faith that Michael is sane.Even Michael's good friend Tom Hagen(Played brilliantly again by Robert Duval) tells Michael he's won,and its over.Michael even gets to the point where he kills his own brother Fredo.<br/><br/>Coppola makes Godfather II a lot darker than the original.The film feels more evil.Pacino gives arguably the finest performance of his career,his Michael is downright evil.Pacino has been able to create a character you know is dark,evil,and sinister.He's established a look for Michael.When Pacino's Michael has eyes of fire you know he's angry.For those who thought the original Godfather glamorized the mafia,you have to take a look at Godfather II,you cringe at what happens.Better than the original and arguably one of the best films ever made. (Personal Note)I don't really think a 3rd Godfather film was necessary,you didn't need to see Michael physically die,he was dead mentally by the end of II.<br/><br/>A Very Very High 10/10"
"Sylviastel","10","4","6","14 October 2002"," Poor Fredo! We still miss John Cazale!
","The Godfather Part II has excellent writing, plotting, editing is even brilliant, acting, and overall quality to watch over again and again. You can never get sick of watching this film. I miss John Cazale. He was truly a gifted actor and I miss him. He played my favorite Corleone brother. Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John. I miss you."
"Quinoa1984","10","4","6","21 February 2000"," One of the best sequels ever made
","The Godfather part 2 gets very close to the title for best sequel ever made, but not quite. Even so, I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former. The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleone's without any disconnected feelings for the audience. Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. It's spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic. <br/><br/>One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the ""in my home"" bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, it's just a very well done picture."

"ozjeppe","6","14","32","3 December 2006"," Good, but no match for part one... and certainly no masterpiece!
","NO, one shouldn't compare movies. But here, it's validated, since both part one and two are based on one book, so I WILL. And on its own, this one is just no match for part one. It's good; we have flawless production values and cinematography. Jumping between past and present works and mix of locations (wintry family residence and tropical Cuba) helps. But the major drawbacks are: 1. Its length. 2. Its stretched-out storytelling and protraction of many scenes, which made my attention and interest drop considerably. It is simply too draggy and meandering. I just FEEL so much more watching part one, because it cuts more to the chase - tighter, darker and deeper. This one seems made to sprawl - but stalls a bit too often.<br/><br/>However, some of the characters develop nicely (more depth from both Keaton, Cazale and Shire) , and the family heritage is cemented every time we move to Vito Corleone's younger days. Make no mistake, it's fine, solid and an indispensable part of the whole saga, but sorry folks - it's no masterpiece to me. <br/><br/>6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."

There must be other people out there who dislike this film as I do...? When comparing this film to others of a similar time (or before) I can still not understand its appeal.

"eddiez61","10","6","11","18 March 2010"," If A Greek Philosopher Directed A Gangster Movie . . .
","I secretly read Mario Puzo's The Godfather in 1974 when I was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what ""literature"" is all about. This is what ""reading"", I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.<br/><br/>Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacino's diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.<br/><br/>The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. <br/><br/>But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. <br/><br/>The period from which we are ""flashing"" is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the ""old"" up against the ""new"" we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. It's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.<br/><br/>While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of ""Easy Rider."" Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. <br/><br/>So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo."

Yet in the movie he frequently goes all over the place in just a regular suit and car. How is this so? Maybe his magic fear aura just repels anyone who would ever think of killing him!<br/><br/>The fans of these movies miss the obvious because they are so into Al Pacino brooding around posing for the camera and fantasizing of being the Godfather.<br/><br/>What a waste of time."

","It's rare for a sequel to match its predecessor, but the follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's monumental mob family drama does more than simply continue the same story, expanding on themes only suggested in Part One to present an ambitious overview of organized crime in 20th century America. The Corleone family tree is divided here into parallel histories, with young Vito (Robert De Niro) arriving in the New World to begin a family, and a family empire, which a generation later his bitter and lonely son Michael (Al Pacino) would consolidate, destroying in the process everything he holds dear. The sudden displays of gangland violence are no longer placed in ironic juxtaposition to the unlikely richness of Corleone family values, being used instead to measure the corruption of il padrone's immigrant idealism: murder to young Vito is strictly a matter of honor, but to Michael it's only an extension of his absolute power. The crosscutting between two stories sacrifices a consistent narrative flow in favor of complexity and depth, but it's a fair trade, and seen together with Part One (Part Two should not be seen without the introduction provided by the earlier film) is a rich experience not soon forgotten."

","The Godfather II is not nearly as good as Godfather I, even tho some intelligence and good acting went in.  After the Godfather I, and Michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much? The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that ""abortion"" blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.<br/><br/>The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.  This is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, I would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of Vito and the flashbacks of the family.  Robert DeNiro does a good job as Vito, and the screenplay is thoughtful, but ultimately the main story dominates.  Yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features.  Certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters.  To each his own--I can see why some people like this movie more than I do, but I really do not think it belongs on a pedestal either."

If the movie is the longest and I never felt it dull, it's the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.<br/><br/>The 60's trip into the Cuban revolution was too far away from the italo-American roots of the family. Maybe the drive of Michael Corleone to build his empire makes him too cold? But it was a pleasure to see Al playing with his mentor (Lee Strasberg) and watch their complicity.<br/><br/>The great moment of this movie was the story of the Don played by De Niro. He speaks little but when he said something, you'd better listen. The life of immigrants in little Italia around 1900 was very well depicted. Except those flashbacks, it's really about the criminal life thus putting aside the family content which is the heart of those movies. Happily, there's a part III."

"bobsgrock","9","4","7","19 November 2009"," Travesty abounds.
","The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michael's reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.<br/><br/>All this aside, I haven't even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.<br/><br/>Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.<br/><br/>The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity."
"Brawl_666","9","4","7","18 October 2009"," pretty amazing
","You're not allowed to dislike this film either. This is a massive achievement in every possible sense. Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.<br/><br/>Coppola doesn't shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleone's story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael & Kay, where she tells him of her departure, ""because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing."" Vito Corleone's backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vito's arc too obvious, as though he's following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.<br/><br/>I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another."
"michael_the_nermal","9","4","7","16 July 2007"," Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla
","Warning! Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>""The Godfather, Part II"" is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie's strengths lie in Copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.<br/><br/>Pacino's Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous ""scream"" to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the ""Godfather"" saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.<br/><br/>The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. One minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian ""tarantella""; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael's control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played ""The Turk"" Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg's Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. Roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn't fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous ""This is the Business We've Chosen"" speech he gives to Michael.<br/><br/>Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don't see much of Fredo in Part I, but he's essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naiveté, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth's scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that ""there was something in it for me!"", but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a ""Hail Mary,"" right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the ""family business."" <br/><br/>Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael ""loses his family,"" in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and Fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael's mother tells him ""you will never lose your family."" <br/><br/>This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla's further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copolla's career: ""what do you mean 'Charlie don't surf?!'"") He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie."
"krumski","4","14","37","5 July 2002"," OK, maybe I get it now (a qualified thumbs-up)
","I have an earlier review of this movie posted somewhere on this site in which I pretty much deconstruct it and its status as a ""classic sequel"" and even ""a great movie."" A handful of great scenes populate it, to be sure, and a spate of fine performances (particularly a toweringly great one from Pacino), but nothing that coheres into greatness - particularly as it's at the service of a turgid and convoluted plot.<br/><br/>All of which I more or less stand by - at least as it befits my own taste and predilections. But I recently had some insight into why this sequel may be so well-respected: in its very dourness and lack of fire, it paints the unremittingly grim portrait of Mafia life that many apparently felt was missing from the first Godfather. I recently showed that movie to a group of my friends who had never seen it before (amazing in this day and age, no?) and they all enjoyed it - but, to a man, they felt that it definitely glorified and mythologized the violence it showed and the lifestyle it portrayed. Personally, I have a hard time seeing this - and, pay attention, because I believe here lies the discrepancy between the people who love the sequel and those who don't. On the most simplistic level, if you feel the first film glorifies the Mob - and feel at least slightly cheated because of it - you will most likely have an appreciation for the second film. If you feel, like I do, that the first movie sucks you into associating and sympathizing (hell, even *loving*!) these characters, but that the violence brings everything all back home and reminds you the evil and corruption which undergirds their way of life - then the second movie, though having perhaps some interesting elaborations upon this theme, offers nothing genuinely new. And is, therefore - despite all the evident care and superb craft involved - kind of a waste of time.<br/><br/>But, since the violence and worldview depicted in The Godfather is such a polarizing issue, I suppose it was a good idea that Francis Coppola decided to have another go at it, ramming down his point for all those who didn't get it the first time: ""The Mob is BAD, it CORRUPTS YOUR SOUL, and NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT!"" These are good points to be made, and perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss them. I had just thought, previously, that . . . well, they're obvious (or should be, anyway - and anyone to whom they're not obvious is probably beyond all hope) and that the director had already made them once. Clearly, not everyone feels The Godfather makes those points cogently enough (as my friend says about the end of the first movie: ""Sure, Michael is cold, ruthless and lies to his wife - but DAMN, he's just the *man*!""). For those people, The Godfather Part II exists, and that's fine. I'll never speak ill of the movie again.<br/><br/>Except for those flashback scenes - those are still terrible! Either they should form a completely different movie unto themselves, or they should be cut out entirely (watching the second film as part of ""The Godfather Saga"", where these flashbacks have been excised, is infinitely more rewarding to me). I still don't know what function they serve - if anything, they seem a throwback to the preciousness and romanticism of the first film, except far worse, in my opinion. But no one seems to agree with me, so I'll stop beating the tune on that one . . .<br/><br/>But as long as I'm here and have got this movie in my sights for a second time (and am inclined to dwell on its strengths rather than its faults), let me just expand upon what I said earlier about the acting: the film is a veritable master's class in great acting, coming in all shapes and varieties. The coiled intensity of Pacino is complemented by an equally quiet yet forceful turn by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen (whose work in both Godfathers is some of the greatest, yet most unsung, in cinema history). Lee Strasberg does wonderful things with the Hyman Roth character, adding new layers and shadings in every scene, and his soliloquy to Michael about Moe Greene is as dead-on perfect as anything can be in this world. Similarly, Michael Gazzo takes a seemingly annoying and one-note character (Pentangeli) and works in so much depth and humanity, that at the end he's one of your favorite people in the entire Godfather story (doubly amazing, since he didn't have any automatic goodwill from the audience by being a carryover from the first film). The quiet scene between he and Duvall near the end is, in some ways, the most shocking, cold-hearted and violent of the whole series - and not one weapon is drawn, the two speaking in pleasantries the entire time, barely above a murmur. This, folks, is great acting - as well as sophisticated writing, all topped off by a director who has total confidence in the audience to get it, without his having to exaggerate or accentuate a thing. This is, simply, peerless moviemaking.<br/><br/>Such peerlessness exists, for me, in doses rather than all the way through in The Godfather Part II. But to extrapolate from this that the film is somehow worthless is a mistake - one I must apologize for. Though I still stand by my assessment that, for me anyway, the second Godfather is largely ""unnecessary"", I am more aware and sympathetic to the larger purpose it serves for a good deal of the audience. And, necessary or not, it still has on show some absolutely top-notch cinema acting, writing and directing. Maybe it, unlike the first one, is an offer I *can* refuse, but having once accepted it, I'm there for the duration."
"PWNYCNY","10","6","13","27 November 2005"," This movie is a study in greed and depravity.
","This movie is about a struggle for power between two men: the pretentious upstart Michael Corleone, who is trying to establish his legitimacy as Godfather, and Hyman Roth, the most powerful crime figure on the planet, whom Michael both hates and wants to emulate. The movie also shows Michael's depravity and hypocrisy. While committing the most vicious acts in the name of the Family, he is actually systematically targeting for destruction every one closet to him. Michael is nothing but a phony. He reveres his father, Vito, who is his role model, but he can never be another Vito. Vito was respected and loved, while Michael is feared and loathed. Vito attracted people, inspired confidence, was acknowledged a leader, while Michael repels people away. Everyone close to Michael is driven away or killed: Tom, Freddie, Kay, Pentangeli. They are on to Michael and Michael knows it, so he must have them eliminated. The character of Michael Corleone is one of the most chilling characters in cinema history. Michael is cruel and depraved, yet tries to pass himself off as decent and moral. But that is a front which masks his greediness and deceit. Everything he touches he destroys. Michael is so nasty and mean that he even fights Hyman Roth, the one man who has real affection for Michael. But even that is not enough for Michael. For Michael, being a predator, Roth's good will is a sign of weakness to be exploited. The depth of Michael's depravity is bottomless. And in the end, the man for whom family meant everything, has no one. He has either murdered or driven away everyone. He is alone.<br/><br/>When this movie was first released oh those so many years ago, I liked it. Recently I watched the movie again. This time, the movie wasn't that good. My main objections to the movie are: the repeated use of flashbacks and the character of Michael. Regarding the flashbacks, they ruined the continuity of the movie. Is this movie about Michael or is it about the first Godfather? Second, the character Michael is so overblown and two-dimensional that not even Al Pacino's excellent performance could totally save it. It seemed that what Michael needed was a therapist to help him work through his misplaced aggression. Michael feels the need to defend his family but defend them against WHAT? Moreover, Michael is married, is the father of two children, is educated and thoroughly middle-class. This profile does not suggest someone who is likely to be directing an organized crime syndicate. Sorry, it just doesn't wash. And when Michael has his older brother murdered, even though his brother is mentally challenged, that defies all logic, even for Michael for whom the family comes first. If this movie is supposed to be a dramatic study of a deeply confused man who harbors paranoid delusions of persecution mixed with a big dose of grandiosity, then this movie is interesting. However, if this movie is trying to suggest that an intelligent, college-educated, married family man, who has the option to go ""legit"", would be interested in pursuing a career in organized crime, then this is stretching literary license a bit far. Why not have Michael run for political office instead? Now that could make for an interesting and credible movie."

","My title/summary says the essence of what I want to express, the best movie I've ever watched. <br/><br/>The only thing I would add is that this movie acts as both a sequel and a prequel to the first Godfather movie, which I believe makes it grander, more epic in scope. I also think it's a ""funner"" more entertaining movie. <br/><br/>And just to add a bit of context to my above statement; <br/><br/>I consider Lawrence of Arabia second. I think those are pretty solid, definitive for me. <br/><br/>Just behind I think I'd put Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, LOTR FOTR(still have to watch ROTK) and The Godfather, but I'm not as certain, particularly about the order. <br/><br/>I also liked, The Maltese Falcon, Slumdog Millionaire, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight(haven't seen Rises yet), Braveheart, Casablanca and City Lights(Charlie Chaplin). <br/><br/>Finally, I have not seen Gone with the Wind, and did not like The Third Man at all.<br/><br/>Just my opinion, thanks."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","5","3 May 2012"," Rather Amazing How Perfect This Turned Out
","The Godfather Part II (1974) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece shows the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) who tries to rise in power and seek revenge after his parents are murdered. In the current times, Michael (Al Pacino) survives an assassination attempt and goes to find out who was behind it as well as destroy anyone who might be trying to do the family any harm. There's always going to be a debate on whether this film or the first is the best but for my money I have to hand it to this sequel. While both movies are great, I think this one works so well for numerous reasons but the biggest being that not only is a great sequel by continuing the events of the first film but it's also a great prequel by showing the life of Vito.<br/><br/>I've always had a few minor problems with the original movie but I think it would be fair to say that this one here is flawless in every way. Coppola does such a masterful job at making sure everything was on par with the original but you can tell he knew people were going to be questioning him attempting to do a sequel so he wanted to make sure that he delivered even more. As with the first film, this one here has that very slow pace that wouldn't be allowed in any movie today but thankfully the 70s were a much different time. Coppola perfectly uses this slower pacing to really get inside the heads of these people and he really delivers so much character development that you're amazed that so much is able to be done in its epic 200-minute running time. Even more amazing is how quickly the film flies by, which is saying a lot of consider the length and pace.<br/><br/>Of course, no one could ever say a negative thing about the performances and they're all masterful. I had really forgotten how wonderful Pacino was here but he's so chilling, cold and deadly quiet that you really do begin to fear him. I'm certainly not going to spoil anything but if you've seen the movie then you know what happens at the end and how Pacino plays this was just a masterful touch. DeNiro, picking up his first Oscar, does a wonderful job too. Doing the Italian language and mastering is obviously impressive but so are the small touches that he brings that connects the character to the later one played by Marlon Brando in the previous film. John Cazale is often overlooked but he has some terrific moments here as does Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and especially Diane Keaton.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER PART II contains all the greatness of the first film and it's a real miracle that Coppola was able to match it and deliver even more. The film works on so many levels but being able to pretty much see two movies rolled into one is something of a lost art. Even rarer is how perfectly both parts are as the drama, tension, violence and pain are all on full display and there's no question that this film deserves its reputation as one of the greatest ever made."
"jamesbutterford","10","3","5","28 October 2010"," As Good as Movies Get
","This is an excellent film. That's all there is to it. Personally, I think it's more than a little better than the first movie (excellent film also). In the DVD commentary, Coppola himself says that this is at least as good as the first film and that this is where he wanted to end things. The acting here is phenomenal from every character and I think the best performance is perhaps from the actor of Don Fanucci. You just don't see movies like this made anymore. I think the reason I prefer this over the first has a lot to do with the pacing. This movie is a little more fun and the flashback/forward structure always keeps things moving, as well as providing a beautiful contrast between the two generations of dons. By the way, don't let anybody tell you the stories have nothing to do with each other. Its structure is what really makes this a memorable movie, and it actually works without being tacky, unlike Once Upon a Time in America."

","i haven't seen the third part, but so far i prefer the 2nd to the first. not by a great deal, but i prefer it slightly to the first. <br/><br/>This is purely based on the fact that by Watching part two, i was made more aware of how much craftsmanship was implicated into the film's script. <br/><br/>The film begun to highlight on Michael's reluctance to continue in illicit practices in comparison to the first Godfather. the murders committed in the second part could be easily be seen as though Michael was getting carried away with the fact that he could get someone killed when he wanted and also that he acted on personal agendas rather than business. However, The fact was that he was eager to be rid of his enemies so quickly revolved around the idea that he wanted out; no more illegal dealings i.e. dealing with tergiversating, murders, money laundering etc.... The godfather became a story of thriving family men ( Vito and Michael) rather than a typical Mafia picture. i really appreciated the enactment of Vito's life as a young boy transcending into a respectable man of both virtue and vice, executed well by a young Robert De Niro. <br/><br/>what had really caught my senses- that really made me believe that the film was original, realistic and was created with diligence was the scene where Freddo supposedly met Johnny Ola for the first time and later had innocently neglected his concealment (of previously meeting Johnny Ola and Hyman Roth which he denied previously to Michael) and the presence of Michael only to implicitly slip out the fact that he had met both Roth and Ola previously, stated in a way that implicated that they all share a mutual friendship. instantly, i felt the inspirational factor of the film. that piece of simple originality in a film just made my day from then on, never in my early 17 years of life have i ever seen something so natural to human nature portrayed in a film, really beautiful. <br/><br/>so i have to say, the Godfather is one of the best made films not only for it's uniqueness and reality. but the timelessness of it's creation just makes it even more worth while and will continue to do so for many generations."
"blackmamba99971","10","3","5","30 April 2010"," Francis's Best work
","Seeing this film has never dulled the senses of how the world of the Mafia is in itself, a world of its own. Vito Corleone, an immigrant who lands on the shores of New York to escape the mafia in Cicily. Only to become the most powerful man later in life as the favour granting Don Corleone. Marlon Brando was brilliant as the Don as well as Robert Deniro who plays his younger self. The scope and gritty scale of the dirt ridden Ghetto was absolutely eye catching. You can actually smell the surroundings as you watch the film unfold. What was enjoyable also was seeing Al Pacino play the Don's young son, who later in life takes the reigns of his father's business and becomes even more powerful through the connections of the Las Vegas Game Circuit. Violence and revenge is what this movie is all about, to settle scores between families and factions which sometimes become chaotic. Through this is Micheal, a calm mild mannered child of Don Corleone who can take revenge to other levels. Another enjoyable character was Micheal's family lawyer played by Robert Duvall, without his connections, none of what the Corleone family gained would have been possible. This was a grand scale movie in all forms, the music, the gunfights, the revenge, and Coup De Gras type solutions which is only recognizable to those who appreciate this kind of genre. Beautiful story."

This is all understandable, for after all, making movies is a business.<br/><br/>HENCE, we generally treated to a parade of inferior stories, watered down story lines and lame ideas that get to the screen only because of perceived relationship to a real, true hit. The roster of examples are loaded with the likes of: SON OF KONG, FRENCH CONNECTION II, McHALE'S NAVY JOINS THE AIR FORCE, RTEURN TO PEYTON PLACE, BACK TO THE FUTURE II, III, IV etc., CITY SLICKERS II, ANALYZE THAT, BELLES ON THEIR TOES, HOUSE OF Dracula and all of those Friday THE 13th & HALLOWEEN spin-offs.<br/><br/>ON AN occasional a rarity occurs. A sequel picture comes along which is not only on par with the original, but in some cases actually tops the original. Titles such as BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, FOR THE LOVE OF BENJI and SUPERMAN II come to mind as prime examples. There are others out there; but for the sake of brevity, we'll hold down the roll call.<br/><br/>ARGUABLY the greatest example of a sequel that surpasses its progenitor is Francis Ford Coppola's production of MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER: PART II; which just happens to be today's subject for dissection and analysis.<br/><br/>PERHAPS the success of the original GODFATHER paved the way for such an unexpected surprise and hit. Critically and at the Box Office, GODFATHER II is considered to be an even greater achievement of film making. The reason probably lies in a maturity and coming of age by Director Coppola .<br/><br/>IN LATER interviews, as well in his commentary that is included on the latest DVD set, Mr. Coppola speaks of the interference and attempted control of his artistic view of the picture was an almost daily bone of contention; especially during the early days of production. There was a great deal of meddling from the 'Suits' from the board room of Paramount Pictures; even extending to rumors that the big company wanted to replace the Director.<br/><br/>LUCKILY for F.F.C. and the rest of us, he managed to survive long enough to get the picture over the hump and into the final editing room. The resulting product came out of the film editors' shop as quite a sensational film; being one that would go down as, arguably, the best gangster film of all time. Surely it could not be eclipsed! THIS UNPRECEDENTED and unexpected success earned Francis Ford Coppola his spurs as a full fledged Hollywood Director. His name would from that point on be mentioned in the same breath as Capra, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles, Huston, Spielberg and Scorsase.<br/><br/>FOLLOWING such prestigious accolades, the Director now enjoyed full artistic control over his projects. Mr. Coppola was able to pull out all stops and do the picture he wanted in his own way. From this point on, the office gang at Paramount Corporate Headquarters could go and pound sand. The corporate monkey of the 'bottom line' was off his back, for good.<br/><br/>SUCH freedom allowed for the drafting of a fine, complex story not only to serve as a sequel, but at the same time it was functioning as a prequel; which is a term that wouldn't come into usage for some years yet. The mounting of having both the story of Michael Corleone's ascension to the heights of the Underworld, as well as the wonderful and lengthy flashbacks into the early life of Don Vito Corleone, was truly a work of genius.

Refusing to give in to such demands, Coppola and Puzo wrote the Clemenca character out of the story; due to an unusual case of natural death; replacing him with this Pentangelli guy, who had been previously unmentioned.* WITHIN a short time of its release, GODFATHER II was hailed as a critical acclaim magnet; as well as being touted for its keeping high standards established in the first GODFATHER effort.<br/><br/>AND just for good measure, Coppola and the boys at Paramount had them a real good pitcher and hot item at the all important Box Office.

Robert DeNiro is very convincing as young Vito Corleone in what was, if memory serves correctly, is his big screen debut. I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire. The ending is heartbreaking because he realizes that he lost his family trying to save it. And the soundtrack in this movie is even better than the original GODFATHER soundtrack.

"mentalcritic","9","3","5","8 May 2005"," I prefer the first film, but this compares well
","The Godfather, Part II is one of the most revered sequels of all time, if not the most. While I prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. However, it also has one or two flaws that, if I am going to be fair, I have to mention. Since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, I'll get them out of the way first. The first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. As the story goes from one part of America to Cuba to Sicily to another part of America, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. The other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow Mario Puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. The big conspiracy with a Jewish smuggler and unnamed Italian rivals in the New York or Nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. Both stories, the historical story of Vito Corleone and the present-day story of Michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. It is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the Godfather Legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film.<br/><br/>The acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from Al Pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. Robert Duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. I think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with Duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. The real surprise here is John Cazale, who fleshes out Fredo Corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. It is unsurprising that all of the films Cazale has been in have been nominated for Best Picture. He portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. But these are just the highlights. The entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds.<br/><br/>The best thing about a Godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. The bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. Francis Ford Coppola has previously stated that he saw The Godfather as a (relatively) modern King Lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. Michael is in essence the new King of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. This is the film in which we learn why this is not what Vito Corleone wanted for his youngest son. Sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in Diane Keaton's dialogue. Some of her speech to Al Pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films.<br/><br/>Like the other Godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the Corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. The montage shown in Part II is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. Lee Strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from Israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. Unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates I cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means I cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. Being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among Godfather fans, I am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. In spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of Michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. But that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. With the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside.<br/><br/>I gave The Godfather, Part II a nine out of ten. In contrast to the original, I noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. Still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first Godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. If every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as Francis Ford Coppola had here, then the world would be a better place."

","For those of you looking for cheap thrills, or a no-brainer gangster movie, well this is not for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a timeless classic, then this is at the cream of it. If you haven't watched the movie, then the following may be a spoiler - but seriously, you must be living under a rock!!?! <br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to mention how great Pt II was. I cannot compare Pt I and II but really the rewards cashed in Pt II is because of Pt I. But on the face of it Pt II is the best one because its slightly more dynamic and clever. For me, its clinched by a flashback scene towards the end of the movie. In this flashback, Don Vito, Tom, Sonny and Michael are sitting around a table talking about the war but otherwise are merry, and Michael out the blue says he wants to join the army. At this point, the full realisation that Michael was the ""black-sheep"" of the family right from the beginning hits you. Michael has not transformed, he had always been like that. He was always the villain in the story. His promise (in Pt I etc) not to enter into the family business can now be seen in new light. His actions in Pt I and Pt II can now be seen in new light. Only those who contributed to the building/maintenance of the family are the true heroes.<br/><br/>Corollary to this, the movie also shows how its easy to sit there and criticise, or to lose everything, and how much tact, skill and resilience (and people/business skills!!) is required to build and maintain something. We could be talking about running a mafia business or your local football team, or your life.<br/><br/>If there are any imperfections, then I respectfully submit that it lies with the viewer."

One of the greatest sequels in the rarest form (whereby it being even better than its predecessor in many ways) of sequels: continuing the epic storytelling of the Corleone crime family with Michael (brilliant Pacino, Oscar nominee Best Actor) beginning his dynasty with the family business taking over Las Vegas with only his middle brother and family screw up Fredo (Cazale) ineptly trying to prevent him his destiny. What makes this sequel a stand out is the parallel storyline showing young Vito Corleone (uncannily portrayed by Best Supporting Actor De Niro) and his immigrant migration to New York City's Lower East Side ghetto, establishing himself as a man of his word. Some truly great ensemble acting particularly the character actor Gazzo as a stoolie with a conscience and of course master of the Method Strasberg (both a nominee for Best Supporting Actor) as nemesis Hyman Roth.

","I do not like The Godfather Part II as well as the original, if only because the shift in focus from the subtle machinery of the Corleone family business to the historically inspired (Kefauver hearings, collapse of the Batista regime in Cuba) episodes shortchanges the elegant simplicity of the first film.  We have already witnessed Michael's incredible transformation from ""civilian"" war hero into hard-as-steel overboss in the original, and this makes his character less interesting to me.  I do not wish to suggest that Part II is not a good film.  On the contrary, the intercutting of the Vito Corleone story with Michael's trials, troubles, and challenges gorgeously punctuates the importance of family tradition so crucial to the film's thematic fabric."

How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.

"MyPetMongoose","Null","7","17","8 July 1999"," Dull and Predictable
","I hate being the lone voice of searing ridicule in a throng of glowing adulation, but I must say that I found the Godfather: Part II to be dull, predictable and pointless.  The Godfather is a wonderful film with a compelling story arch of a good American war hero being pulled into the depths of organized crime due to his loyalty to family. While Part II makes an attempt to elaborate and deepen this theme it does very little to bring anything new to it.  Michael's loss of his family and the fate of his brother Fredo is obvious by the end of the first reel. Such a predictable plot undermines what would otherwise be an interesting sequel to a great film. Only the flashback scenes with Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone has any of the emotion and energy of the original Godfather.  If only the rest of the film was written and directed with such flair. I was so disappointed by The Godfather:  Part II that I haven't even bothered to see Part III and I have little interest in Coppola's other work to this day."
"secondtake","9","4","8","6 May 2011"," A stand alone masterpiece that is, deliberately, slow and epic
","The Godfather Part II (1974)<br/><br/>Is this well made? Dramatic? Epic? Beautiful? Impressive?<br/><br/>Of course.<br/><br/>Is this better than the original Godfather? In some ways, yes. It lacks the originality of the whole world novelist Mario Puzo (and co-screenwriter Coppola) created, but it fills in background in Italy and adds wonderful new elements about immigration and the revolution in Cuba. It lacks Marlon Brando, who is a force of his own, but the presence of Robert DeNiro in the many long flashbacks is moving (and he has more presence than Pacino, frankly, who is intentionally stoic, but to the point of expressionless). <br/><br/>Is it a great movie? Why not? What is a great movie supposed to do that this one doesn't? Well, for one thing, I don't think it surprises at all. It doesn't reveal anything too deeply, despite all its deeply felt and emotionally turbulent scenes, and despite the apparent inner probing of the main character (who is last seen thinking very hard, staring into space). It doesn't suggest how to feel about any of this violence, this cold duplicity. <br/><br/>And maybe it shouldn't do any of these things. It is an oddly ""confirming"" experience. It shows what we have come to think we already know, more or less, about the mafia world with its combination of loyalty and bloody revenge, its attachment to business and its selfishness, its emphasis on family even as it kills those in its own family.<br/><br/>What Coppola does do, as director, is suck you in. You get wrapped up in the world of these men (mostly men, of course, though with a great small role by Talia Shire and a famously troubled larger role by Diane Keaton, who makes a better Annie Hall by far). You are easily and gladly transported from New York to Las Vegas to Miami to Italy back and forth, across time and space, in warm colors and sweeping scenes, inside and out. The pieces of this rather complex story are put together with ""artful"" deliberation--it's a work of art, surely, despite its relatively straight forward intentions.<br/><br/>It is also filmed, that is lit and photographed, with sensitivity, without becoming virtuosic for its own sake, by Gordon Willis. Part of the immersion happens because of how everything is depicted, and it's easier said than done to make it all cohere and remain beautiful.<br/><br/>So yes, it's surely a terrific movie. It might not be one of your favorite movies, and it really isn't one of mine. I've resisted watching it a second time for two decades, and finally have, and found my mind wandering sometimes. This might partly be a testament to the imprint the Godfather movies have made on American culture and on the movies, because part of my distraction was that it's all so familiar. But it's familiar partly because it's so influential and convincing.<br/><br/>But it's also partly true that there isn't a huge range of events here. I mean, a lot happens, but it falls mostly into a small diversity of power plays, deceptions, waiting games, and ruthless murders. It's all fascinating and terrifying on some level, but it all wraps around itself over and over again. You will find yourself understanding and even identifying with some of the characters, but you might not find yourself sympathizing with any of them, not the major ones, who are all (all) out for themselves in the end, or a pathetic followers yes men. In short, if you like this world and are fascinated by the male power aura, every second is filled with drama. But if like me this isn't really sufficient for over three hours of absorption, your mind might wander a bit, too. <br/><br/>Cosi sia."

"tomgillespie2002","10","2","3","5 February 2017"," One of the saddest movies ever made
","Of all the wonderful things that can be said about Francis Ford Coppola's American masterpiece The Godfather (1972), above all else the film is a masterclass in storytelling. It's essentially a classic, romantic story of family, loyalty and the passage of time, undercut with a dark, violent portrayal of what it takes to achieve the American dream. It told a detailed, complex, and often confusing story featuring a large ensemble of characters, but this only matched the complexity of what Coppola was trying to achieve. The director, adapting Mario Puzo's novel, famously had a torrid time at the hands of the producers, namely Robert Evans. Yet when the resulting three-hour epic became a box-office and award-season smash, Coppola would be given free reign if he was to helm a follow- up.<br/><br/>The resulting three hour twenty minute sequel was the director grabbing his chance to have complete control and pouring all of his artistry into it. This wasn't to be another classical Hollywood tale, but one of corruption, greed and pure evil. I first saw The Godfather Part II around 20 years ago at the age of 12 when I was first allowed to start watching movies for grown-ups. Watching it now, having seen it a handful of times in between, it's a completely different movie to the one I remember. I remembered it as an ambitious gangster movie with quite shocking violence, chocked full of great performances by actors who are now giants in their field. What I see now is a sequel truly like no other. A movie that is somehow optimistic and pessimistic in equal measures; one that sees its lead lose his soul while his father gains his; and quite possibly one of the saddest movies ever made.<br/><br/>At first, Part II mirrors the narrative of its predecessor, beginning with a grand wedding as the Don (now Al Pacino's Michael Corleone) makes his underlings sweat as they wait to greet the head of the 'family'. While the previous wedding was a joyous, boisterous occasion, this one is noticeably different. Of the family that remains - John Cazale's weak-willed Fredo; Talia Shire's gold- digging Connie - only the mother seems to be the same. The band doesn't even know any Italian songs. While Michael may have attempted to continue his father's legacy when he took over, the changing, capitalist world has driven him inward, isolating himself from everybody around him and drifting away from the Sicilian values of his father. He was once a proud war veteran with a bright future, but now he is solemn and aggressive, and becomes even more so when a hit on his home almost kills him and his wife Kay (Diane Keaton).<br/><br/>His close brush with death only fuels his paranoia, and he must navigate perilous waters as he moves into business in Cuba with one his father's business associates Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who also happens to be backing a couple of brothers moving into Corleone capo Frankie Pentangeli's (Michael V. Gazzo) territory. Michael suspects a betrayer within his own ranks, suspecting everyone including his own family. It almost seems like a deliberately confusing plot to take in alongside Michael's descent into pure evil, and it may all be too overwhelming had Coppola not chosen to juxtapose this story with one of optimism and nostalgia; that of the young Vito Corleone's escape from a mafia boss in Sicily and his eventual arrival in America. There is infinitely more colour and hope in these moments, and while these scenes may gloss over Vito's own violent journey, it seems like Coppola is making a point about where he feels his country was heading. Of course, these flashbacks are made even more welcome by the astonishing performance from a young Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II currently sits in between The Godfather and The Dark Knight as #3 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and while I have little faith in the accuracy of a list that relies so heavily on popularity, it must be one of the most difficult and uncompromising movies in there. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that so many people love it, given the lack of flashy moments of violence the genre is so popular for. It's an experiment that could have gone so horribly wrong, and one that certainly wouldn't have been made outside of the innovative 1970s. Yet Coppola gets everything spectacularly right, from the inspirational casting of the Oscar- nominated Gazzo and Strasberg, to the chilling penultimate scene which sees James Caan's Sonny briefly return. In that final moment we realise that Michael has always been alone, destined to carve his own path, while forever gazing into the past to ponder what could have been."

Vito's story could stand alone from Michael's, but both compliment the other in ways that cannot be described. Scenes end on cliffhangers. When one starts, we want to be back with the other. The Corleone family is corrupt, and Part II just shows how deep their roots run. This second act is more intense, more involving, incredibly climactic, leaving it's audience wanting more.

It also shows the early life of Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) Michael's father and the celebrated Godfather. Michael's story involves his rise to power . Vito's story involves his early start in the business after he is forced into the US from Italy as a child. The two stories are told in a parallel fashion.

","Quite possibly the greatest sequel ever made. <br/><br/>The continuing saga of the Corleone crime family tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) growing up in Sicily and in 1910s New York; and follows Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the 1950s as he attempts to expand the family business.<br/><br/>A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. Too many movies are designed merely to amuse or entertain for 90 minutes or so. But there are other movies that cling to you, stay in your subconscious and you don't forget them. ""Jaws"" for example, who does not hear the ""Jaws"" theme and worry a little about what's below them when they are swimming just a little too far out in the ocean!! <br/><br/>Godfather 2 is another of those movies. Even before the short opening credits have finished, the movie already starts to take effect. This is not just a gangster movie, it's a movie that poses deep moral problems for all of the main characters. It doesn't attempt to answer questions. The rights and wrongs that these people do to each other. What would I have done, had I been in Michael Corleone's shoes? <br/><br/>Of the cast, Al Pacino deserved the Oscar for his work in this, the middle of his three Oscar Nominations for Best Actor in a row 73-75. ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" the other two. Even if Dustin Hoffman (Lenny) or Jack Nicholson (Chinatown) won that night, you could still argue that Pacino deserved it for his tour de force performance. But Art Carney winning (Harry & Tonto) makes the decision not to give it to Pacino all the more baffling. He is simply the core of a movie, which runs at over 3 hours long.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall effectively underplays as his mild mannered adviser Tom Hagan. An Oscar nominated Talia Shire shows she deserved a better career than being type cast a Adrian Balboa in the ""Rocky"" franchise. Her scene towards the end with Pacino should have seen her take the award home, but she was inexplicably beaten by Ingrid Bergman (For Murder On The Orient Express) Bruno Kirby looks more than at home in his scenes with De Niro and it's a wonder how he never got more work in this genre. Next gangster movie he made was again with Pacino and this time with Johnny Depp 1997's ""Donnie Branco"" which is a shame, he'd have made a great Al Capone. Lee Strasberg deserves special mention too for his role as Hyman Roth as does Joe Spinelli. A young actress called Kathleen Beller makes an impression in her small role, and it's a shame she never had more of an acting career.<br/><br/>And that is without even mentioning The Superb Robert De Niro who did win the Oscar Beating his costars Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo as well as after Astaire and a young Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot) to the award. This was a young De Niro when Mean Streets was the only movie he'd made of more, and you could already see his future as one of our greats."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","2","3","22 June 2008"," ""Part 2"" is its own masterpiece, but more so a perfect extension of the original
","The most brilliant thing about ""The Godfather: Part II"" is that Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola has seamlessly extended the original, and when I say seamless, I mean that Coppola has created a sequel that looks and feels like the original and actually makes the first film better. If I could, I would go back and change my rating of ""The Godfather"" to an 11 and make this a 10. With the exception of the Lord of the Rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why ""Part II"" is so good.<br/><br/>At an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, ""Part II"" tells not only the story of Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of Don Vito Corleone (DeNiro) who was played by Brando in the original. To the modern viewer, DeNiro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of Brando's performance. Leading man Pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as Michael as this time we see the weight of being Don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. As usual, it's too difficult to explain the ""business"" plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film.<br/><br/>The acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and Coppola some of that credit. This film had three best supporting actor nominees at the Oscar's for goodness sake. If the Golden Globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. My personal favorite is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I would trust him with my life too.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for New York, Italy, Cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. Coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. The ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. While ""The Godfather"" has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original.<br/><br/>Of course, in terms of themes, ""The Godfather: Part II"" continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. The themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through Michael's relationship with his wife and brother Fredo. The back-in-time plot arch with Vito sheds additional light on the ""Michael"" part of the film as well. All of it just makes ""Part II"" a rock-solid classic."
"bluedeluca","10","2","3","9 November 2003"," The greatest American film Ever Made
","Citizen Cane, Casablanca, Lawerence Of Arabia and The Godfather are the American classics that usually vie for top film honors on all time great lists. Well, I can't argue those choices, but I can argue for the inclusion of, in my humble opinion, the greatest American film ever made, The Godfather Part II.<br/><br/>I truly believe that Coppola topped himself with his second installment of the operatic crime drama. The parallel story structure was expertly crafted, with the rise of Michael story line soaring to Shakespearean heights. The acting, editing, cinematogragphy and writing are so tight that I can't pick a single flaw, a single moment that doesn't work or isn't pitch perfect. One thing I will concede is that for some, the story might unfold a touch slower than The GodFather and of course James Caan and Marlon Brando are only in it for a couple of scenes at the end. The major acting assignments in Godfather II fall solely in the hands of two film icons, Robert Deniro and Al Pacino both are unbelievable, both are at their best, especially Deniro who gives the audience no doubt that he will grow up to become the ""Don"" himself.<br/><br/>Other notable performances are John Cazale and Lee Strasberg, actually every casting decision is note perfect, we believe everyones performance so much that they will forever be linked to those creations. I think the thing I love the most is the arc that Michael goes through, where he ends up at the end of Godfather II is so tragic and honest that the last shot of Pacino sitting, that look of pain, of loneliness of inexplicable loss, is engraved on my soul. Its a story of fathers and sons, we witness the connection of fates of choices and of lives over a century, its amazing. I know it is recognized but I think it should be regarded as a better film than the first one, by a slim margin but a margin nonetheless."

","This movie accomplishes what very few sequels ever do, it rivals its predecessor in quality.  This film doesn't hit a wrong note at any point.

I can't argue with the top 3 rating given by IMDb users."
"lambiepie-2","10","2","3","2 July 2003"," A rare film and occurance, indeed. Hollywood Take Note.
","This should have NEVER happened.<br/><br/>The Godfather part one was a wonderful film in 1972. We got to know the family, the business, the violence.<br/><br/>In 1974, Francis Ford Coppola does a sequel. And it's just as brilliant as the original.<br/><br/>I'm writing this in 2003 which will definately go down in film history as ""The Year of the Sequels"" and not one of those will come near this rare occurance of an epic of a saga. The real term here is ""saga"".<br/><br/>I got the feeling watching that ""The Godfather part two"" was NOT done for ""sequel's"" sake. It was done to complete a story, to answer questions and to get into your mind as to why things turned out for these folks the they way they did. Some things in the Godfather part two you never saw coming. That is the mark of good filmmaking...keeping you on your toes. A few things you KNEW were coming, you may have been upset to see why, but you watch to see HOW it will unfold.<br/><br/>The Godfather part 2 gives you history about Vito and at the same time shows you how his youngest son Michael is taking hold. You're interested in both..watching the past and present unfold and realizing HOW their futures entwine. A rare film making experience.<br/><br/>And even rarer than that, The Godfather part one is chosen best film of 1972, the Godfather part two is chosen best film of 1974. Both, deservingly so.<br/><br/>I got to see The Godfather part 2 as a salute to Francis Ford Coppola on the Los Angeles based ""Z"" channel immediately following The Godfather part one. The only other film I sat this long through mesmerized and thrilled with at that time was ""Fanny and Alexander""... and when you're young, its HARD to sit still.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part 2 is a rare film indeed, another to include in the top 25 of all time."

I won't go into plot, I'll just praise it to high heaven and hope that if you haven't seen this, you'll buy the DVD TONIGHT to check it out. Amazing."

He is simply unbelievable.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is a different Michael Corleone from the first movie, but plays him to perfection.

","A great continuation of the world that was introduced to us in the original Godfather. This work would make even Mario Puzo himself proud.<br/><br/>Found the duality between father and son poetic. Great way to show how Don Vito and Michael forged their own paths with different motivations. Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.<br/><br/>Justice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s.

","It pains me to give any installment of The Goldfather' only 8 out of 10. The trilogy is definitely one of my leitmotifs and I rewatch all three about every six months or so. Nevertheless, Part II is probably the least enjoyable to watch, though I would never skip over it.<br/><br/>Why exactly is this? The acting is superb; the cinematography is great; thematically, the film furthers and develops all the notes hit in the first. Nevertheless, the story, while ""good"" such as it is, it doesn't quite deliver the gripping goods of the first. The backstory of erstwhile Godfather Vito Corleone and the development of his career was worth telling and artistically interesting to contrast with Michael's own headship of the family. Interspersing the two as the editors did may or may not have been a great choice, as it arguably cuts into the building tension of the younger Don's journey.<br/><br/>Still, it's not clear that that journey would, uninterrupted, have made for a gripping drama on par with that of Part I. The first doled out a lot of lavish character development and courtly intrigue with just the right amount of shocking action punctuated in. Whatever the inaccuracies with respect to the real-world mafia, the first certainly captured the dynamic of real-world diplomacy and warfare (whether conventional or criminal) in bouts of rising pressure and preparation sometimes - usually with little of any warning - giving way to open battle. There isn't a ton of action in this one, certainly not on the level of the first.<br/><br/>Still, it makes for a good evening. I tend nowadays to be doing chores when I have it on - I've seen it often enough - but it's not unpleasant to watch and as with the first there is always a lot of ""new"" stuff to catch or forgotten stuff to rediscover upon rewatch. These are big, dense films, and should leave the real aficionados satisfies in any event."
"reggienunez","9","1","1","19 December 2019"," Masterpiece- a truly epic film
","Often considered the greatest sequel ever made The Godfather 2 is an excellent film in its own right and an even better companion to the first Godfather. The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. The Godfather 2 is a masterpiece and should be a must watch for any serious cinema lover."

"peeedeee-94281","7","1","1","20 November 2019"," A Good but Not Great Sequel (The First Part is Way Better)
","I commend Coppola for taking on Pt 2 and filling in a bit of Viteo Corleone's history, and continuing Michael's saga, with parallels between the two.
It was a good sequel, but I didn't find it as engaging as the first one, which I've seen countless number of times. I just watched Pt 2 recently after not having seen it for a number of years.
I'm not sure why it doesn't have the same feeling as the first. I think the lack of direction (i.e. a clear plot line) didn't help. There was an attempt on Michael's life, and there was talk here and there of doing some extra business, but a lot of it just seemed vague. Much of the movie was spent on the strained relationship between Michael and his family.
Another missed opportunity was explaining Don Vito Corleone's rise to power. You see him assassinate the neighbourhood Don at one point, but then we fast forward years later when he's grown a mustache and is doing favors for people, and vice versa. But we don't get any information on whether he's affiliated with the crime boss that was the boss of the guy he killed, or if he had formed a completely different family. I guess that would have been a 4.5hr movie.
Overall, a good, but not great sequel. Not as quotable either, like the first movie. Did it deserve the Best Oscar Nom and Win. I guess so. There were a lot of great movies that year. But I think the juggernaut of the Godfather saga was too much to pass up giving it the win."
"mackrj-34546","10","1","1","12 November 2019"," The Godfather Part II
","Two years later after the initial release of the masterpiece that redefined cinema for the good, writer-director Francis Ford Coopla wanted a sequel that would outdo the original. For this purpose alone, when the film was released Christmas Day 1974, the movie was moderately successful and soon became a modern day epic and the best sequel Hollywood has ever produced. Without further ado, here's my review of the second chapter of the The Corleone Family legacy, The Godfather, Part II.<br/><br/>The opening shot of the film tells us what happened directly after the first film's closing moments. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now Don and Godfather of the Corleone Family. Setting the family business in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Michael's promise to keep the family completely legitimate, selling interests in hotels and casinos throughout the States and in Cuba. As this is going down, and Michael is facing unexpected consequences and family life in every turn, the movie brilliantly flashbacks into the young life of Michael's father, young Vito Corleone (in an Oscar-winning performance from Robert De Niro) from his childhood to early adulthood in Hell's Kitchen, succeeding himself as a Don with an offer he couldn't refuse and is introduced to the criminal underworld.<br/><br/>I saw The Godfather, Part II the day after I saw the first one. It's more longer than the first, but it was very necessary. The acting here is a lot more complex than its processor. Pacino gives one of the most brilliant performances of his career as a flawed and evil man trying to make his family legitimately the best in the crime world. De Niro gives his second best career work (the first being Scorsese's Raging Bull.) The scenery here is gorgeously crafted filmed in several different locations including New York, Cuba, Lake Tahoe and Sicily. Each frame is a work of art at its highest level. The storytelling is perfect, mixing in past and present, as we go along.<br/><br/>The magic of these two timeless films are the heart and soul of moviemaking. Coppola directs with such vivid imagery that it's no surprise that this also would win Best Picture. Both films rightly deserved to win no matter what.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Godfather, Part II is one of the best sequels ever made and not to be missed. I highly recommend this one and the first movie. This is certainly an offer you can't refuse.<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I watched this movie I was amazed that how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role of it has been played by a famous and good actor before. And most problem to play younger Don was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando. But deniro didn't hesitate or felt under pressure for a single moment in the movie. And some times he was even better than brando himself.
Michael Corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by Pacino. A man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and somehow he started to enjoy it. This was the fate of Michael in this segment. From being a sad army veteran to a needed devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his legacy and his Father.
In this movie you would also like the match cut between Vito's timeline and Michael's timeline.
A Cameo from James caan was very soothing and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant again.
Francis Ford Coppola should be given all awards for making The godfather 1&2."
"proud_luddite","9","1","1","8 June 2019"," Magnificent
","Both a prequel and a sequel to ""The Godfather"", this film tells parallel stories in different time periods. The early one takes place in the early 1900s when Vito Corleone escapes a traumatic childhood in Sicily and becomes part of the crime scene in New York City . The later story in the 1950s has Vito's son Michael taking over the family's business of organized crime.<br/><br/>As both crime drama and family drama, this film earns high marks in both categories. The later story includes a patriarch who is so ruthless and power-hungry that it would normally be tempting to despise him and those around him. Yet, the skillful directing by Francis Ford Coppola successfully tricks the audience into showing great interest to the clan almost to the point of sympathy.<br/><br/>The later story is sometimes difficult to follow. It's extremely busy with many details and characters that are sometimes difficult to follow and remember. Luckily, the earlier story is straightforward. Each story is enhanced with differing styles of photography by the very talented Gordon Willis. The music of Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola is also beautiful.<br/><br/>Despite the mentioned flaw, this film has so much talent involved that it ends up as a memorable experience even after multiple viewings. The supporting cast members John Cazale, Michael Gazzo, Lee Strasberg, and Talia Shire all have at least one scene that gives them a chance to shine. As Vito, Robert DeNiro shows greatness in the role that brought him to fame. But the highlight of the cast is Al Pacino as Michael who personifies the worst side of humanity in subtle ways especially in two scenes. In one, where he has a serious confrontation with his wife, his still face can't fully betray his anger as his jaw shakes. In another scene, he is viewed from a distance behind a glass screen door. Even at a distance, his silent pose conveys soullessness and evil.<br/><br/>Coppola's directing is at its best in crowd scenes, particularly a street festival in the earlier story where a murder is being planned; and a New Year's Eve party in Havana in the later story. Overall, ""The Godfather Part II"" has aged very well.<br/><br/>RATING: 9 out of 10<br/><br/>Outstanding Achievements:<br/><br/>Directing by Francis Ford Coppola<br/><br/>Acting by Al Pacino"

"aleeuw","10","1","1","12 March 2001"," DeNiro and Pacino team up in this historic monument
","The Godfather was incredible, but this one is even better. Pacino is even cooler then in the first part, and DeNiro shows everybody how to become a Don. A arguable downside in the first part could possibly be the fact that Brando was a gentleman, not a Don. DeNiro does this a lot better. Of course the quote ""I'm gonna make him an offer he don't refuse"" is used again, and a lot have been added, like ""keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"". Pacino is better in the second part because here he plays a Don all the time. He's a cold-blooded killer, exceeding his father. He ditches his sister, brother and wife and becomes the most powerful man in the US. Everytime a Pacino scene ends, you don't want it to end, and the same happens when a DeNiro scene ends. Connie Corleone is incredibly annoying, Fredo Corleone is incredibly pathetic and Michael and Vito are incredible. Probably an underrated actor in part I and II is Robert Duvall. You never see him mentioned but he acts great. Frank Pentangeli is very funny. Don Fanucci is a ""Chazzer"", and if you don't know what a Chazzer is,  you ought to watch Scarface. 2 downsides are: No Santino (James Caan), and the fact that Pacino and DeNiro never play a scene together."

"OddJob-6","10","1","1","20 August 1999"," The greatest movie I've ever seen
","""The Godfather"" introduced to pop culture the inside of a fictional mafia family that many drew connections.  The big secret is that GF II better's the original.   It may be the only sequel in movie history to accomplish this feat (The Empire Strikes Back is debatable).  For three hours and twenty minutes we are shown a two prong plot where Michael Corleone must deal with his current enemies while at the same time driving a wedge between his family.  The other plotline is the rise of Vito Corleone.  This is well played by Robert DeNiro, who received an Oscar for his performance.   The movie viewer has a complex soap opera that does not disappoint.  It's deep and dark. It shows that unlike his father, Michael has to sacrifice his wife and children to hold the family name.  Meanwhile, Vito shows his ability to lead by taking out the local boss and establishing his own racket. Michael is seen as the tragic figure, the one member of the family who wanted to be legit and turns out to be more ruthless than his father.   It's a shame this wasn't the original Godfather.  Many love to mimic Brando's great performance, this movie is pure genius."
"JSMOOTH1","10","1","1","28 June 1999"," Best Sequel Ever Made!!!!
","The Godfather part II is by far the best sequel ever made.  Francis Ford Coppala did a great job of directing this movie.  Al Pacino will always be known as Micheal Corleone to me and I don't see how he didn't win the Oscar for best actor.  Robert DeNiro also did an outstanding job playing the young Vito Corleone.  It is amazing to watch Micheal Corleone evolve from a young, unassuming war hero who knows nothing about the family business to the cold, ruthless Don we see at the end of the movie.  My friends and I have debated on wheather or not Fredo had to die.  My friends all say that Fredo was too dumb and careless therefore he had to die; I feel that Fredo had learned his lesson and was content on being a good brother to Micheal and a good uncle to Micheal's children.  Anyway, the Godfather part II is by far one of my favorite movies of all times and I strongly recommend it along with part one to everyone.  I was very disappointed in the Godfather part III so for me the Godfather concludes at the end of part II with Micheal sitting on the bench thinking back on his life."
"HAL9000-16","10","1","1","23 June 1999"," A sequel that equals the excellence of the first
","Now, this film was superior, to say the least. One of my top 10 favorite films of all time. I thought this film was every bit as excellent as the first Godfather. What elevates this film making it better than any other film sequel ever made, is the fact that the film is a sequel and a prequel in one.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro does a brilliant job reprising the role that Marlon Brando made so famous as Vito Corleone, showing how the Corleone family rose to power, and in the present day Michael Corleone, (Al Pacino in his best performance yet) is now the head of the family business, who gets so caught up in success and himself that he ends up losing his entire family. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and Talia Shire also do fine jobs reprising their roles.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in The Godfather Part II is at the end, when Michael has flashbacks to the way his family used to be, and how everyone left him alone at the table when he announced he enlisted in the Marines, which fades into the final shot of the film as you see Michael Corleone sitting all alone with no one else in his life (as if he were in hell for his sins). It was an intensely gripping scene.<br/><br/>You haven't seen enough if you have only seen The Godfather, so Part II is one of those rare sequels which completes the story. Need I say more?"
"Mr. Film","9","1","1","18 May 1999"," The Best Sequel of All Time
","A brilliant companion to the first film, ""The Godfather Part II"" follows the Corleones into the late fifties, when the family business, as well as the family itself, undergoes changes. Don Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, delivers a very convincing performance alongside Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. The story is crafted to fit the times and also to help define the characters and show their growth, and in some cases, their demise. When it's all finished, ""The Godfather Part II"" is thoroughly satisfying and moving. An exceptional film."
"Mec-6","10","1","1","15 May 1999"," The only FLAWLESS film in motion picture history.
","The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the only movie ever made with not one single flaw. While other movies may be great, they are all flawed. I have see this phenomenal sequel many times and still have not spotted a flaw. From a great story line to first class acting, this picture has it all.<br/><br/>If that doesn't say enough, all you have to think about is that this masterpiece is a sequel. It is a follow-up story to a classic. Usually, sequels are often weak and never live up to the original. The Godfather: Part II is the exception to the rule as it not only equals the original, it makes it subordinate!"
"PIST-OFF","10","1","1","29 April 1999"," Another movie you can't refuse.
","There's so many good things in this movie it's ridiculous. Great performances all around from Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasburg, John Cazale and especially from Robert DeNiro who is the only one who could fill Marlon Brando's shoes. DeNiro does such a great job at acting as Brando's Vito Corleone that he won an Oscar. The first time two actors won an Oscar for playing the same character. Great writing by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Highly under-appreciated but great acting by Richard Bright and Bruno Kirby in bit parts. A well written score is a staple of this movie. Flawless directing of the two coinciding stories of young Vito Corleone and his aging son Michael as the heads of a powerful mob family. I especially love the scenes of young Vito Corleone as an up and coming mobster and wish there were more of them. I would have liked to know the orgins of Luca Brasi, Johnny Fontaine, and Tom Hagen. As well as Sonny's rise to power. The book covers Luca Brasi's orgins with the Corleone's but... This is a worthy sequel to the flawless movie The Godfather. Awesome."

","In these days when Lord of the Rings (FOTR) hit the box office and fantasy cinema is having its second peak after Star Wars, the best thing that a person who hate fantasy should do is watching this movie.<br/><br/>Godfather part II shines with the actors. De Niro and Pacino are on top of their undeniable talents. The most striking two things about the movie except great directing and acting, are the story of a father and son simultaneously (showing them nearly at the same age) and the great story that includes shocking moments like murder of Don Corleone (DeNiro) or his revenge after coming back to his hometown after years. What can I say, it worths every minute you spend and it is better than Godfather Part I..."
"mc20138","10","1","1","11 October 2001"," The greatest sequel ever, that's even better than the original
","The first godfather was one of the most special films ever produced, but the second is a sequel and a prequel mixed into one spellbinding three hour movie event.  The fact that Robert de Niro played a young Marlon Brando is ironic as the young de Niro was fast claiming the crown as one of the best actors of that or any other generation.  The detail in the locations and set design is immense and well worth a closer look.  The acting is amongst the finest ever seen on the screen and the direction is simply out of this world.  Overall, one of the greatest films ever made, with an ensemble cast and script to match."
"Elizabeth-328","Null","1","1","3 October 2001"," Because the original just wasn't good enough
","""The Godfather: Part II"" is one of the best sequels ever made, because it's so unlike other sequels.  It not only tells the ongoing story of Michael Corleone, but it also tells the story of his father's rise to being the Godfather.  Al Pacino superbly reprises his role of Michael, and Robert De Niro is, in one word, perfect as Vito Corleone.  Imagine not only learning your lines, but learning them in Italian, and all the while trying to sound like Marlon Brando.  If you can't imagine any one else besides Brando as Don Vito, just check out De Niro's brilliant, Oscar-winning performance.  This is a must-see for any film fan, and especially any fan of the first ""Godfather.""  I actually know people who prefer this sequel to the already fantastic original.  I can't say enough about this movie.  My one piece of advice is see ""The Godfather: Part II."""

Not only is this the greatest sequel ever, but one of the greatest movies ever. The Godfather II is more entertaining and more compelling in my opinion. What really makes this great however are the parallel story lines following Michael Corleone and a young Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Robert DeNiro. As with the first Godfather, the ensemble acting is superb, especially from Pacino and the aforementioned DeNiro. This is simply put about as good as movie entertainment gets. 10/10"
"scorsese-3","10","1","1","21 February 1999"," A cinematic epic by Coppola
","The Godfather II is not really a movie about the mafia. The themes that run throughout the film are of power,corruption of power and family. Coppola expertly tells the parallel stories of a father and his son with the use of flashbacks and flashforwards. He simultaneously shows how the father builds an empire and how his son subsequently unwittingly destroys it. The scenes involving the son Michael Corleone are very serious in nature,whereas the scenes involving the father,a young Vito Corleone, are presented in a more jovial manner.Before a flashback or flashforward, Coppola uses an effective technique of having children or the mention of children in the scene in order to emphasize the generational link through children. The flasback scenes are also photographed using different methods of lighting to contrast the different moods.Metaphorically, the story of the Corleones parallels the rise and subsequent corruption of America. The ultimate symbol of America in the form of the Statue of Liberty appears throughout the film. The assassination of Hyman Roth the jewish Mafia chieftain, is eerily similar to the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald the alleged assassin of President John Kennedy. Coppola effectively uses symbols such as the orange to represent evil. Several scenes show characters that do evil holding an orange (the fruit being a biblical symbol of evil).In an early scene Johnny Ola an emissary for Hyman Roth brings an orange to Michael Corleone from Miami. In a flashback scene, Don Fannucci (the black hand), is seen handling an orange before his demise. Michael Corleone is eating an orange as he plots the murder of his enemies. Coppola also uses catholic religious rituals as backdrops in major murder sequences. As Vito Corleone murders Don Fannucci there is a religious procession on the street. As Michael's brother Fredo is being murdered he is reciting the Hail Mary prayer. In the end Michael loses his soul and family to maintain his power. A great film by a talented director."

A truly unsavory person.a rotten husband and father,he leaves little to admire,unlike his predecessor. Robert DeNiro gives another one of his elliptical performances.

However Part II is one of those films that people always go on about being a better sequel than the first...unfortunately it is even more boring and slow than the first.<br/><br/>Again its incredibly long, and literally nothing happens in this film! Only one 'big' event happens (Michael's home being shot up), which isn't that exciting, and the whole film slowly develops around this. There is also the De Niro 'becoming' Don Vito side story which I don't think adds anything to the story at all. He goes from being a normal guy to then shooting the main boss in the town then instantly somehow becomes The Don..with no retaliation what so ever, and it doesn't even show you him becoming The Don. The next time it cuts to his story he is already The Don. Maybe I missed a part (which is possible as I ended up messing around on the internet while watching as it was that boring)"

Some of this seemed forced and contrived and overall the story is quite grim and depressing. Even in The Godfather there were a few scenes here and there that were light and slightly amusing. You get none of that here. Everything here is black.<br/><br/>I also think that this a little bit too long.

","This is my first review and I wanted this to be about a great movie. I'm from Turkey and sorry for my bad English. <br/><br/>I haven't seen the third movie yet but for now, this movie was better than the first one. Why? Because in this movie we saw the young Vito Corleone's life which was a good subject to curious about. About that, the other awesome part was Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone. I've gotta say that, nobody could act any better. His moves, his gestures, the way he speak they all was like Marlon Brando's. Actually that's why I love this series so much, there are just great actors ever; Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale...<br/><br/>And then there is Al Pacino as ""the Godfather"" on the other side which is really awesome. He really is the one who should be the Godfather after Marlon Brando. He acted very good and he had this severity which is a trait if you are a ""Godfather"". <br/><br/>The scenario and fiction was better for the first movie I think, because in this movie they showed two stories and that was the key for me. They gone to the past, they came back to the present during all the movie, while we warm up ups, the whole 3 hours were gone. As soon as possible I am going to watch the last movie but I heard some rumors like ""the third movie wasn't that good after all"" kind of things, anyway I hope that is not correct. <br/><br/>I am freaking recommend to you this awesome production to watch. Take care."

"borisreviews","2","9","27","26 June 2013"," The First One was a Mess, the Second Is No Different
","Coming off the disappointment of the first ""Godfather,"" Coppola continues his overrated trilogy with the weak and incoherent Part II. The story outlines the earlier life of Vito Corleone in the early 20s and follows Michael Corleone in the 50s, but does so with very little coherency or flow. <br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola has shown very limited improvement from the first ""Godfather"", failing to realize the weaknesses of the first. The dialogue is still lacking authenticity, and the crypto-fascist undertones are still ever present. It doesn't help when any of the actors, in particular Al Pacino and Robert de Niro, fail to deliver any of their lines with any real conviction. <br/><br/>The story is fairly interesting, but the lack of quality in the script is hard to overcome, and especially so in the hands of Coppola, who has proved over and over again that he does not deserve to be in the company of such legendary directors like Paul W.S. Anderson, Michael Bay, and Wych Kaosayananda. <br/><br/>Watching the film, it's obvious the troubles Coppola had in handling the material. There are many inconsistencies in the mood and atmosphere, and he doesn't seem to hold a grasp of the material that was so masterfully outlined by Mario Puzo. <br/><br/>The film hasn't aged well at all, and the boring cinematography highlights that combined with all the weaknesses pointed out in my review. ""The Godfather Part II"" marginally improves upon the first ""Godfather,"" but still contains many weaknesses that make it hard to enjoy or appreciate."

My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.<br/><br/>After such a disappointment I didn't set up my hopes too high for its second installment... well, at least I can say I am not disappointed now because this is indeed a bad movie just like I expected.

It's confusing nonsense - the first plot, about Michael, is incoherent with way too many loose ends, while the second plot is unnecessary and doesn't tie to the first film (why wouldn't Vito Corleone have an Italian accent if he spoke Italian for so long?). The film should've been about half the length that it was - the writing is atrocious. The only high point of this film is the acting by Al Pacino."

","This must be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out, and then again a couple days ago. Unlike Godfather I, almost nothing was memorable from the first viewing of this movie. It evaporates into instant oblivion, never to rise again. It's a slow, boring study of an obsessive, boring, violent man. Many of the lesser characters are even more uninteresting. And for this it's highly rated? The attention given to the incidents in Cuba seem to be an attempt to add something lively to the movie, but just go to show how little there is to the main story. Bright, patriot son can't break away, starts slow, downward spiral, and ends up alone, friendless and depressed. And this is a great movie?"
"billy-jackson56","1","14","53","17 September 2010"," Best sequel ever?
","even worse then the original and that is saying something! firstly this film suffers from the fact that it is not American gangster and the film makers should have thought twice about making a film like this after the fantastic American gangster set the bar so high for every other gangster film that would be made in latter years. I guess you can detect the sarcasm there but I have read the reviews of the afore mention movies and am getting pretty ticked off with every gangster film that gets made being compared to this and its jerk off predecessor, this is over long, boring and confusing rubbish with very little substance I don't know how the director of Your a big boy now and Finnians rainbow ever got to adapt the first film in the first place probably because he was an Italian American it is a shame they didn't wait around for Scorsese he's been making these kind of movies for the last thousand years. I don't know what it is about short badly dressed street thugs going around saying badder bing and shooting someone in a pizza restaurant is so appealing to everyone who happens to be a film buff I guess it's a hero worship thing you have to look up to somebody so why not some idiot who makes poorly adapted films from boring source material or dick heads who go around inflicting torment and anguish on normal people, I won't reviewing the third movie as it is just as bad as this probably not so bad because it doesn't go on for four years like this film does and Coppola did an interesting thing at the end of that one when he had Pacino screaming like a girl on the steps outside the opera with the music lifted from raging bull"

","Millions of people worldwide suffer from insomnia, that is difficulty in sleeping. However, Coppola, the genius filmmaker who brought us Apocalypse Now and The Godfather has utilized his mastery of the human psychology to also brought us the definitive cure for insomnia: The Godfather 2. This is a film specially designed to adjust to the human brainwaves in such a way to induce in a profound sleepiness.<br/><br/>Running at the monumental length of 200 minutes, with a convoluted mess of a story, made up of flashbacks, a few strong emotional moments and tons of other very boring moments, with one of the most boring scores ever made (please, that little ""Italian"" noise in the background surely is boring!, this film surely has made happy millions of people suffering from insomnia.<br/><br/>Coppola has made a masterwork of cinema: instead of using films to provoke emotions he managed to created an audio-visual experience that cuts the brain off and enables it to fall into sleep. Truly a work that deserves the Nobel Prize of Medicine. Bravo Coppola!<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you have insomnia!"
"evanston_dad","7","4","11","26 July 2006"," Oh, Those Corleones....
","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.<br/><br/>Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.<br/><br/>Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).<br/><br/>Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.<br/><br/>Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

","It's baggy, wholly unnecessary and doesn't hold a candle to the original but yet is also an example of one of the finest sequels of all time and a phenomenal piece of film-making regardless of its few flaws. The 'Godfather: Part II (1974)' is an oddity in more ways than one, since it simply shouldn't work but totally does. There's almost no way you could believe that the piece powers past the three-hour mark, which it does thanks mainly to its unneeded and honestly less interesting flashback plots seemingly disconnected from the main story. There's not a moment in the foremost narrative I'd suggest cutting even for a second, and even those flashback bits are breathlessly entertaining (in a much more instantly gratifying way than the slow-burning main narrative.) Every second of the picture adds up to an experience that seems sweepingly massive yet strangely intimate, an effortlessly engaging examination of the fall of an empire and the nostalgic sadness at the heart of a man who's soul is slowly turning to stone. 8/10"

","I rated this movie a 1 star not because it wasn't entertaining or wasn't cinematically compelling. I rated this movie one star because the message this movie delivers is ignorantly backwards. Throughout this film, we watch (in vivid detail) as Chris Kyle assassinates hundreds of Iraqi men, women, and even children in order to protect American troops. And yet, this movie ends a memorial. I understand that Chris Kyle did his job well. But that does not mean he should be honored as a hero. <br/><br/>I love the United States. This is an amazing country. And so it bothers me when Hollywood portrays an American hero as someone who is willing to kill people without critically evaluating why they should be killed, who sees war as purely good versus evil, and who is hopelessly blind to the bigger picture. <br/><br/>If there is ever to be peace in this world - heck, if we want to protect the US - we need to glorify people who are compassionate, who can put themselves in other people's shoes, and who act in ways that promote trust and love - instead of fueling the cycle of anger and hate. <br/><br/>Go see this movie. But please don't swallow it up without thinking first."
"JaydoDre","8","2","4","15 November 2014"," Getting a bit overly dramatic, but still really good
","The problem with Godfather II is that it goes a bit too far for the sake of false drama. It is like a kid who gets hit by a parent, cries and as he is crying he keeps thinking about how sad his life is and how everyone would feel sorry once he is dead, and the kid keeps getting a kick out of this self-made drama.<br/><br/>Without spoiling much, the main protagonist, crime boss Michael Corleone, eventually starts making moves that feel unnecessary, unless you view them as a means by the writers of the story to create more crime drama.<br/><br/>The story of Godfather II has some weak and some strong points. If you retrace the steps of the storyline after you finish watching the film, they are not necessarily illogical but they do sit kind of loose in the plot. These plot points feel more like vehicles for specific dramatic scenes than a natural story. On the other hand, the story does provide some great historical perspective on the history of the mafia and also general commentary on certain social aspects of life.<br/><br/>Everything else about this film was pretty good. It is understandable how this film reached its position as one of the top films of the last century.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. In fact, it is what serves as the main course and the desert. You do not go to Godfather movies for action; you go to them for the interaction between all these great actors. These shots are up close and personal, with strong dramatic shadows on characters' faces. The experience is sort of like eating a good steak, no salt or pepper needed."

Marlon Brando was excellent, but unlike Brando's, Al Pacino's character was far more complicated. He couldn't just say, ""I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" in a slick Italian voice and accomplish the role. He so masterfully and ingeniously displayed the coldness of his character. He can say so much without opening his mouth. His stare, his movement, his subtly, everything is just incredible. The supporting cast is very good as well, perhaps the worst performance being that of Talia Shire, who is still alright.<br/><br/>The two storyline thing is fine. It worked, and it worked well.

"Surecure","10","2","4","24 May 2005"," Arguably the greatest sequel of all time
","It can easily be argued that The Godfather Part 2 is the greatest sequel ever crafted in the history of film, and possibly a better film than its predecessor. It is always a difficult task to better a film in its sequel, doubly so when the original film is a masterpiece of cinematic perfection such as the Godfather was. However, Francis Ford Coppola proved that it is possible to improve on perfection.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is brilliant in the counterpoint created between Vito Corleone's rise to power and Michael Corleone's tragic fall from grace. Each character does what they must in order to strengthen the Corleone family. But, Michael's failures are made even more tragic when juxtaposed against Vito's successes. Whereas Vito was able to strengthen his family's bonds, Michael frays them to tragic ends.<br/><br/>Coppola yet again proves his understanding of the relationship between camera and performance. It is not enough to have a lush cinematic experience without engaging performances, and Coppola is able to achieve this masterful balance. The performances by the entire cast are as picture perfect as is possible, and the interaction between even the smallest roles are pristine. Noteworthy is the scene in the Washington Hotel where Kaye (Diane Keaton) opens the eyes of Michael (Al Pacino) to the depths their relationship has achieved. It remains one of the most powerfully performed scenes to ever have been captured on film.<br/><br/>Like it's predecessor, The Godfather Part II is one of those rare moments of cinematic perfection, well deserving of its place of reverence in the history of film."

","someone made the comment that he didn't understand why the flashbacks to don corleone's rise to power (with de niro as don vito) were included, that it romanticized the Mob.  i think the reason that we have the 2 stories is that they parallel each other.  while we are seeing how michael corleone is developing as a mob boss and as a man, and what forces are shaping him, we also see the same things in his father's early life - how don vito reacted to events, how he made plans and how he became the man he was.  although both men lived a life of crime the difference in the two is striking and real - don vito worked his way out of poverty and immigration and tried to help his fellow italians in a way that seemed to work for him.  don vito never lost his sense of caring for people in general and that they depended on him.he never lost his love for his family.  he never lost the common touch, the things that would endear a man to a community and win their loyalty.  when we look at michael in his criminal growth we see he becomes a completely different man - cold, ruthless, uncaring and increasingly isolated both from his family and from the greater community.  don vito actually served, however wrongfully, a purpose in his community and did some good - he provided political and financial assistance, and a basic justice to many people who would have been denied it otherwise.  michael corleone however is just a nasty, vicious, unfeeling, opportunist who does not have the same human touch his father did. and i think that is the main revelation of the 2 movies and why we have the flashbacks.  frankly i prefer the first movie, and the flashbacks in the 2nd movie - don vito was a better man."

Also included in the film is many historical allusions as it takes place during the dawn of the Cold War. The setting of Cuba during one point in the film is an interesting reference to the political and socioeconomic situation of that country at the time.<br/><br/>The only obvious problem with this film is that it is split into two storylines...

The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel."

","The Godfather: Part II is a story of how an empire falls. In this case, a criminal empire. It's acting and dialogue are of the same caliber of the first movie and the story is even better. The characters lose in this movie, there's a sense of dread and looming destruction in this movie. Combined with the rise of Vito Corleone, the Fall of Micheal Corleone feels like the end of this story. The Godfather: Part II is a brilliant movie and should be seen by anybody who loves film."

","You can see why this is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. The story, the script, the directing and the acting is on point. It's almost poetic in the way it carries itself. It's a very good character study of Michal corleone and creates this comparison between him and his father Vito as one built the family and the other is trying to maintain it. Filmmaking has changed very much from the 70s and that is clear in this film, as it's slow paced to the point of stopping entirely at moments. Most of the time it worked but some of the time it dragged a little. Furthermore it's a very dialogue heavy film, meaning you need to pay close attention to everything, which in a three hour film is a little different at times. Despite this, it's clear why this is hailed as such a good film, as it's one of the best examples of the continuation of a story from its predecessor. It very effectively shows the struggles this man has with both maintaining g his reputation and his personal life and both performances by De niro and pachino show this struggle between the cold calculating side and the emational side. Would recommend a watch, that is if you have the time."

"NicelyPutMovies","9","0","0","22 April 2020"," More of a stand alone epic. Either way a triumph
","The Godfather, Superman, Evil Dead. There are textbook answers to the question of sequels that are better than the original. The sequel of The Godfather, though, is a very different project to the first, engaging in something so unfathomably far-reaching and ambitious, a story of such epic proportions, that if it had gone wrong, it would have gone WRONG. Instead, we have a rolling, multi-dimensional, poly-era masterpiece. We must not compare the two as it does not make the prequel any less formidable (as is often the case with a successful sequel) but it is worthy of standing alone but also being recognised as part of the saga. A rare position and a lucky one but it seems to rather deserve it.<br/><br/>
In the first review, tribute was paid to those who claim to not like the first film. Tribute in the form of contemptuous scorn and disrespectful suspicion. Here it will be the same. Once again if someone says it is too much for them, or they like simpler films, or have a problem with the violence, etc and do not like it for those reasons, this is perfectly fine. However, any folk saying it is just not any good are not being honest with themselves. It is a spellbinding triumph of incalculable dimensions with timeless honourable merit and standard-bearing assumed by its creators. So, if this is you, get some therapy, and another film review. You do not belong here. For the rest of you, let us begin.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Very differently we begin in Corleone, Sicily. We learn of the brutal instances that cause Vito to leave, alone and orphaned on a strange vessel, marked for death by a Mafia chieftain, headed for the New World. As he lands on what would become Ellis island, we see an understated but vital scene. Young Vito, a mute and barely eight years old walks in front of a crowd of fellow immigrants all staring at the Statue of Liberty. Vito also looks, but unlike his fellow boat-people, he is walking forward while looking up to the symbol of America while everyone around him stands still. The analogy does not take much figuring out.
Smallpox quarantined, alone, and scared, for the first time, in his small single room with a table and a bed, we hear his voice as he sings to himself.<br/><br/>
Time leaps to his grandson, Anthony, many years later in Tahoe, Nevada, at the same age. The rise of the family under Michael (Al Pacino) has moved into politics, a naive senator tries to strong-arm. An entertaining piece. A series of events leads to a violent head, Michael leaves to find out who betrayed them and nearly cost him his life. Temporarily the illegitimate German-Irish lawyer and Michaels assumed brother, Tom Hagen is at the helm after being stepped-over in the first movie's climax.
Things take hold in Cuba, in a story meant to mirror that of a true Mafia event, The character of Hyman Roth, played by acting legend Lee Strasberg is painfully obvious in its basis upon famous Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky. A capable but mute bodyguard accompanies Michael everywhere as he weaves around finding out who betrayed them, who paid them too, and how to come out on top in both the long term and in the Cuban deal<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As happened in real life, history decides the latter as Cuba collapses under Bautista as Fidel Castro takes power and throws the Mafia out., The traitor is revealed and Michael must act, but how he acts will be determined by actions he must control. Back home a wronged subordinate, manipulated by Michael's enemies, turns government witness to a senate committee (once again drawing from an event of recent history). Michael must also outwit the US Senate, treachery is everywhere and duplicity is lurking.
Michael uses his wit and cunning with typical aplomb to outwit and crush his enemies at a cost of maybe losing his family. His main betrayal coming from a source that troubles him for the rest of is life. He remains at the top and yet it is at a terrible cost.<br/><br/>
As all this happens, the second unit story evolves. Young Vito played in breathless mystery by a spellbinding pre-embarrassment Robert DeNiro in post-WWI New York. For you young-'uns who see Bad Grandpa, Meet the Fockers, and Joker, you may wonder why he is so revered, and it is a good question. The answer, is probably more than anywhere else, evident here.
A young Vito, a grocery boy, is made unemployed by a Black-Hand (a particularly ferocious offshoot of the mafia) operatives and thus christened into the crime world by that often-occurring phenom in these movies, the life-changing chance encounter. This time is with a jolly but lethal neighbourhood tough called Clemenza. From here he rises, using his quiet viper-like strength and ability to listen and not react. He rises to the top of New York and returns to his home of Sicily to repay those who forced him out. If anyone has not seen it, they should check the deleted scenes on YouTube for a more detailed explanation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The two parallels play together perfectly. The rolling camerawork of following young Vito across the rooftops of Little Italy as he pursues his quarry, interspersed with pyrotechnics and scenery from the Saint Genarro festival is something to behold. It shows that panoramic shots do not need to have half of Montana in the background and can even be poorly lit. All of the scenes of this section are dim and rather dusky and shot at close quarters. This is to express the claustrophobic nature of railway cold-water flats and tenement rows in early 20th-century New York. Somehow though, it has an epic feel too. In fairness, the cinematography of part II is way superior to the first installment, but that is possibly the way it is meant to be. The way a young colt of an experienced stud racehorse will have speed and strength its parents didn't, but all are remembered as fondly.<br/><br/>
A lot more happens in this installment. As mentioned, Cuba falls. Then the act of betrayal at Michael's home is far beyond anything seen before, and the brutal slaying of an innocent prostitute simply to aid a blackmail case by the fearsome Al Neri (Richard Bright) is an act far beyond the romanticised broad-Brooklynese movie-star, ferret-faced behatted mobsters of the first film. One of the moral criticisms is that it glorified the Mafia (a word never uttered in the film) and it led to a backlash against this romanticised image of mobsters only killing other killers and raining gold on the innocent. You certainly do not feel this way at the end of part 2<br/><br/>
It is full of crescendo-like scenes. The music of Nino Rota is used to explain for those looking away. The camerawork is ambitious, for example, a scene in a courtroom where Michael uses a defendant's brother to silence him, is often praised, but I have always found it clunky and out of pace. I think trying for too many cuts and bustling tension is a bridge too far in a movie that is all about subtlety. For example, Connie wants the children to leave the room, they ignore her, although they are so very young, just a glance from Michael shows his power among all who he rules.
Paradoxically, we are shown that Vito does it differently, he gives people a chance to not fear him Take for instance, a quirky little comedy involving a reactionary landlord of a friend of Vito's wife is another testament to Nino Rota and his score. With a different tune it could have been terrifying, yet here it has a flutey Italian jig playing, so it is taken lightly. Michael never has such a frivolous sound accompaniment. His interactions have the whistling background of deep piano foreboding and in one of the most depressing scenes I have ever encountered, he returns to his wife, who is sewing and there is no love left. He gives no one a chance and is cruel, particularly to his step-brother, Tom, who is loyal beyond question.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A very complicated movie that no-one could fully comprehend in one sitting. For the most part, there is no book to refer to (except for Vito's segment being part of the original novel). It deserves multiple watching, it is a towering achievement in modern motion-picture artistry that will provide food for all thoughts. At once it is both a soap-opera and a mystery. It remains never-bettered by imitators. This is mostly due to it has been, aside from the hilariously inferior Once Upon a Time in America, largely unattempted. Not being one to romanticise the past, it is daft to say it could never happen I truly hope it does as it would be some kind of film to watch.
Until that day

"Diablo1616","9","0","0","20 April 2020"," Found the duality between father and son poetic.
","When I watched this movie I was amazed how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role which has previously played by a famous and good actor before and much problem to play younger Vito was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando but Bob De niro didn't hesitate or felt under pressure for a single moment in the movie. And some times he was even better than brando himself.
Michael Corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by Al Pacino. A man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and some where he started to enjoy it. This was the fate of Michael in this segment. From being a sad army veteran to a necerary devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his father's legacy and his crime empire.
In this movie you would also like the match cut between Vito's timeline and Michael's timeline.
A Cameo from James caan as Sonny in the end of movie was very soothing and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant again.
Francis Ford Coppola should be given all kind of accolades for making The godfather part one and two"

"zeekwunlau","9","0","0","12 April 2020"," Never unite outsiders against your family
","No matter how stormy it is outside, the family is always the warmest haven.<br/><br/>The new and old godfathers are family-oriented, loyal and dedicated, but their endings are different. The wife married by the old godfather is a Sicilian. The woman there is pure and kind and cares for her family, and she lives in a mafia, so she can accept her husband's career. And they are supported by the trouble and together, so the relationship between husband and wife has been very harmonious. The old godfather is a person with a great sense of family responsibility. The original intention of the struggle is also to make the family better. No matter how much trouble is encountered outside, it is always a breeze to return home. Go to the theater to see beautiful women with friends. Friends said that the actress is beautiful. He said that is what you think, in my mind, only the wife and children are the most beautiful. So he will educate children, men who do n't take time to spend with their family, not real men. He will ask Mike if his wife and children are doing well. In his mind, no matter how big the outside career is, the family is always the most important. Why the godfather is a must-see movie for men to grow up, indeed, learn from the old godfather how to be a real man<br/><br/>The new godfather, under his father's words and examples, also paid great attention to the family. So he will fight back when his father is stabbed. After the death of his brother, he took the burden of the family, even if his original intention did not want to go this way. When Fredo helps an outsider talk about him, he will be very angry and say that you will not be allowed to unite outsiders to fight against the family, never. This also helped Fredo to betray the family several times, and finally he was buried and buried. Mike and Kay feel more that the two are suitable to talk together, and the elements of love are quite few. Kay called and asked Mike to say that she loved her, but Mike never said. And he fled to Sicily without saying a word, and never contacted him later. Perhaps he had always wanted to marry a wife like his mother, so when in Sicily, he would fall in love with the Sicilian girl at first sight. And soon a wedding was held with the girl, why many people talked for a long time but couldn't get married, and can quickly marry another person after breaking up, it is important to meet the right person at the right time. Unfortunately, the two were together for a short time, and the newlywed wife was killed by the bodyguard. Since then, the girl has always been a cinnabar mole in his heart. Mike came back to Kay only a year later, when the family was in a precarious situation, and Kay was the most suitable wife. Because they knew each other well, Kay also loved him. After all, he waited for six years, so the two got married. But the two of them did not hold a grand wedding in the movie, maybe the form was forced at that time. Kay is a native American. Her education and religious belief made her unable to accept Mike's triad family and even less understand the business he did. Therefore, the two were in conflict, and eventually moved away. Later, Kay killed Mike's child and said some unsympathetic words, completely breaking Mike's heart. So when Kay wanted to leave without keeping, Mike secretly closed the door when he secretly visited his children to leave. Like the last scene in Godfather 1, the door between family business and her. If the first wife is not killed, perhaps all three will be happier. Kay can find a thorough American marriage and establish a happy family. The first wife will be like Mike 's mother, praying for him to have children, taking care of the family, and not afraid of blaming him for his career. It is a pity there is no if, the road to the king is finally lonely."
"DemonKiki","10","0","0","10 April 2020"," Character and fate
","Different personalities determine different fate, and the contrast of fate is the core technique of the godfather series to build the story. Like the older brother Paul of Victor Jr. mentioned at the beginning of Godfather 2, it should be a young boy with strong blood. He vowed to avenge his father, but the result was the same as his father. On the contrary, Victor, who spoke little, was able to escape from danger and miraculously escaped into life. This is like the contrast between the second generation Sonny and Mike. A strong but too impulsive, and a calm and low-key yet bold. The fate of the two brothers is also surprisingly similar. This is a direct portrayal of character determining fate.<br/><br/>Similar examples abound in this series. The most obvious contrast is that the hot side of Widow's character corresponds to the cold side of Mike's character, which makes the two generations of godfathers dominate the road differently. The same is true for the supporting actors. The two chiefs, Clemenza and Tessio, one is a little bit reckless, and the other shows a shrewdness in calmness. This different character leads them to make different judgments at critical moments. By mistake.<br/><br/>Also has some more marginal supporting characters. Their character and fate are also closely linked, which makes the Godfather series of movies show a true to cruel atmosphere. Like Moglin mentioned when Hemingros sent his power to Mike, he knew that Mo's temperament would easily offend people, so he was not surprised when he learned that Mo died in a bad life. And Frank Pantancurie said when he mentioned his brother, he could have been king here, but he stayed in the small village with two donkeys in his hometown.<br/><br/>The group image created by the response between these personalities and fate makes me care about my personality and fate, and calls for correspondence in my heart. This is a deep and excellent way for Godfather 2 to impress the audience."

Therefore, there is more room to character study.<br/><br/>I loved the parallel between Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. Both were once humble and completly away from the mob and they both were corrupted by power, with all the casualities associated with that.
In that regard, I loved the final shot in which we see Michael some years before, declaring that we would make his own destiny away from the family business, because at that point we are so used to see Michael as the ""Godfather"" that we more or less ""forget"" who he once was.<br/><br/>The movie is also utterly suspensful, just an exchange of looks can make you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance was just indescribable and Robert De Niro's slow incorporation of the singular Marlon Brando's voice just astonished me.<br/><br/>The moment in which Kay said that it was an abortion and not a miscarriage was probably one of the most painful experiences I ever had while watching a movie.<br/><br/>A movie that will certainly stay in your mind forever."

Plus, there is a huge difference in the mafia style in Godfather and Scarface for exaple, a complete opposite, yet, he manages to clinge both rolls.

","There is a chapter in Godfather Trilogy analysis called ""Major Character Analysis"", which makes some comparisons between the two godfathers. Some of these comparisons seem superficial, so here's a personal comparison between Vito and Michael godfathers.<br/><br/>The differences on the surface of Vito and Michael, I have always believed, must not be analyzed solely by the differences in the character of two people, but I prefer to analyze the way these two people behave from the times and experiences they live in.<br/><br/>One notable difference in careers is that Vito have a good grasp of the godfather role (ease), while Michael have been making great achievements but always seem laborious; another notable difference, for example, is that Vito maintain the family fairly well, and Michael is much worse. The authors of Godfather Trilogy Analysis tend to interpret both as Vito is a very enthusiastic person, but Michael is a cold-blooded.. The analysis is simple, however, because one obvious thing is that Michael have different personalities before and after becoming a godfather, that is to say, many of Michael personalities have evolved after becoming godfathers.<br/><br/>For three reasons Vito have a good grasp of the role: experience, interest, and historical background. Vito is from a poor boy who has nothing step by step to the godfather's throne, from childhood to adulthood along the way with a variety of people, including his close friends as brothers, but also his opponents. He was also closest to and tortured by two different-style gang bosses (both Italian style and American style). From the experience, it Vito clear how to be a gangster who is feared by the enemy, trusted by his godson and loved by his loved ones. And do Michael have such experiences? Too bad. He may have never thought of inheriting a profession like his father since childhood. He wants to live like the average American, he has an American name, he has an American sense of honor (joining the Navy), he looks for 100% of American women as girlfriends. So Santino death, Fredo incompetence led to the arrival of the godfather position is too sudden for Michael, how can we expect such an inexperienced man to be able to make the godfather as handy as his father in the short term? Vito used to help people solve the trivial things of rent. Michael? To represent huge family affairs and mass killings of real guns. Vito got Clemenza such a capable arm along the way, adopted and cultivated Tom Hagen such a perfect-minded family lawyer; and"

This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.<br/><br/>Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history.

This large span breaks through the limitations of the individual and the times, creating a sense of destiny that is endless and repeated, and the fate of the characters is placed. Under the big times. It is the grand narrative necessary for the epic; in the narrative technique, the story develops from a single-line narrative to a two-line parallel narrative,The fate of the characters is placed under the great era, which is the essential grand narrative of the epic; in the narrative technique, the story from a single-line narrative into a two-line parallel narrative, telling the two generations of godfather ups and downs of the fate of the road, this approach has a formal sense of rigorous symmetry.

","If the first is a landmark gangster epic, then the second is undoubtedly more refined and beautiful than the first. The connection between the two main lines in time and space tells the different struggle history of the two generations of the godfather. They are two extremes. Vito Corleone became the godfather because of the family, so the family relationship is more harmonious. Mike Corleone became the godfather for his career. A mild and indifferent extreme difference also makes their lives completely different, and this difference is also reflected in their different worldviews. If you have more career, you will have less family. It is still the same formula, but it makes people feel the delicate emotions and the difficult growth of a man. Maybe this movie is more suitable for young people to watch, and more suitable for the people who are going through it.

","Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...<br/><br/>The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...<br/><br/>De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...<br/><br/>The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...<br/><br/>Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters..."

"one-nine-eighty","10","0","0","31 January 2019"," The sequel to the best family film ever
","As the name would suggest, Godfather Part 2 is the sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather film. This film is an extreme rarity because it divides feelings; some people have suggested that this sequel is actually better than the first film (which doesn't really happen often for sequels), while other die-hard fans would argue that a sequel could never out-rate an original.<br/><br/>Godfather 2 could actually be split into 2 separate films, both showing separate events, in different times, with only a family name and blood being the connecting factor. One film is a rewind to a time already gone - a young Vito Corleone (the Godfather in the first film - played here by Robert De Niro). The other film; living in the present but with stark teachings of the past coming into fruition.<br/><br/>It's been 7 years since the events of the first film, and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) attempts to expand and develop the family business as the head of the Corleone Mafia family - looking to get a toehold in Las Vegas and Cuba. Woven into this we also get to see a young Vito Coleone in flashbacks as he comes from Sicily to America and makes a new life for himself. The film uses these two stories to show similarities and contrast between father and son, separated by 30-40 odd years. This film is a masterpiece in storytelling, expanding on a world we've been introduced to via the first film, and moving forward with sublime character development and a complete story. Throw in a 'who-done-it' for Michael to solve (trying to find the mole in 'the family'), as well as the stresses he has to deal with from domestic family life and there is an awful lot going on.<br/><br/>It could probably be argued that rather than being a sequel, this is a follow on. Coppola expands on the groundwork laid out in the first film - it's not a whole new adventure, more the next chapter in a story that we, the audience, have been tantalized with in the first film. Like the first film, it's not just a film about crime and mafia; it's as much a film about a man's struggle to live in the world that life has dealt him. It is brilliantly climaxed as we see Michael, alone in his own compound at the end of the film, like he's strapped in his own head dealing with the thoughts and plots going on - playing a mental game of chess with himself in order to stay one step ahead of his real life enemies.<br/><br/>Pacino and De Niro are both fantastic in their respective roles, and the supporting cast is brilliant. There is plenty going on, and in some instances it's what you don't see which is as important as what is explained to you.<br/><br/>I love this film, I have no issue with awarding this 10 out of 10 the same as I gave the first Godfather film."

and the end of Vitos arc in the movie was great when he gave revenge and also that final shot were we see the Michael before The Godfather and the Micheal after and we can see how they are vastly different with the posture and look showing that Michael is different.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie is great would rewatch."

","The end of Godfather Part I already hinted that Part II will continue with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) being the new head of the family.<br/><br/>
They change the location to Nevada and introduce a lot of new characters, depicturing Michael's own way of being 'The Godfather'.
Additional they also show many flashbacks to the life of his father, Vito Corleone, how he got introduced to the Mafia as a kid in his home in Corleone, Sicily and his rise to a Mafia Godfather as an adult, played by Robert DeNiro, who fits the role very well, in 1917 onwards in the ghettos of New York City.<br/><br/>
All in all, the movie is very lenghty and complex, I am not even sure I understood everything fully and might have to rewatch some parts or read through synopsises."

","If you've heard of the saying lightning doesn't strike twice, guess what, you've been chaotically proven wrong here. The original movie on its own is cinematic brilliance delivered at it very best and has a cult following since generations. The second one however, is an inch even more perfect. May it be young Michael (Al Pacino) filling the boots of his infamous yet benevolent father Vito, may it be the portrayal of young Don Corleone played by Robert De Niro who is flawless at his job and may it be the transition of events before and after the movie, it all falls perfectly in place. It's also De Niro's first academy award win pretty reminiscent of the fact he subtly carves out Vito's early life struggle in America, his abandoning of his natives in Italy and rise to power in America. Diane Keaton (Kay) plays a woman who feels oppressed being a part of a family that is a part of a notorious criminal conglomerate. Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) plays a shrewd advocate who is also the consigliere to the family. John Cazale (Fredo) plays the passive push-around as he was in the prequel but has more depth and purpose to his character. Overall it has more than what any ordinary Mafia based movie can offer. It shows the struggle of power to be the very best, and eventually the realization that the top spot isn't a single persons affair and knocking down your counter part by cunning and treacherous means is the only way to hail supreme in the business. And yes, all this coupled with a perfect setup to the post independence american scenario while reminiscing Vito's early days. I'd go for eleven even if i entitled to do it for only a single movie."

","As I mentioned last time, the first Godfather from 1972 is widely considered a landmark in film history, considered one of the best American films of all time. Dark, brutal yet also hyper realistic, with no gangster film like that ever seen before. So the idea of a follow up in 1974 was a bit strange. Granted, Coppola was back in the director's chair, but some fans were wondering; what else was there to tell? Well, in my opinion, this movie took a bold chance and further explored how much humanity can be sacrificed for the ""greater good"" and sometimes that doesn't have a boundary. We see Al Pacino as Michael in a desperate attempt to hold onto power while dealing with family, betrayal and violence. It makes the viewer wonder if he has any decent mercy left. But on top of that, and why I personally like this film, we also get the backstory to a character that was done by one of the greatest performances of all time. Who could possibly play the younger version of the Oscar-winning Marlon Brando? Robert De Niro, of course. This not only won him his first Oscar for acting, but also cemented him as one of the big heavy-hitters in terms of acting in the gangster genre. Seeing how a child can come from obscurity in Sicily, with everything trying to kill you, yet become successful enough to become the epitome of power at a price. This was the first sequel to win Best Picture and remains the only one to win along with its predecessor. At a time when The Godfather was said to be the perfect movie that can never be topped, Godfather 2 tried and not only succeeded but exceeded everyone's expectations. It's hard enough making something like Godfather successful once but to do it twice and BOTH times win Best Picture? That is a DANG impressive achievement. It literally ""gave us an offer we just couldn't refuse."""

We get to see how the Family got started, and that the spiritual, moral and financial dilemmas that father and son had to face, spanning nearly a century, were not as different as either one of them might have thought. <br/><br/>The continuation of a story that deepens the situations and our insight into the characters; Gordon Willis' peerless photography; Dean Tavoularis' amazing sets and Theodora Van Runkle's costumes; the Nino Rota/Carmine Coppola themes that are so familiar to us now that they're almost subliminal, and that note-perfect casting of all the supporting players, even the appearance of some faces you may have forgotten were associated with the series, especially people like THE SOPRANO'S Dominic Chianese and CITY SLICKERS' Bruno Kirby. <br/><br/>Part Three never stood a chance."

The Godfather: Part II is a sequel as well as a prequel, comparing Michael's rise into power with Vito's, making the story even more depressing.  I've always found Vito's storyline more interesting, but the ending of the film, in which Michael murders or alienates everyone close to him, is perfectly executed.

The Godfather Part II<br/><br/>
Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola, 1974<br/><br/>
Stunning and utterly compelling sequel. <br/><br/>A side story telling the saga of how the Corleone family came to America is told in conjunction with the continuous saga of new Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This is done with a puppeteer's focused hand (pun intended) by co-writer/director Coppola and the result is amazing. He seems to somehow intertwine the two stories of the old and new Don effortlessly and deliver grand entertainment.<br/><br/>
Deservedly the movie won an Oscar for Best Picture  and for a sequel that's no small feat. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro is exquisite (watch those subtle Brando mannerisms) and under-plays elegantly as the young Vito Corleone, while Robert Duvall is brilliant once more as Tom Hagan  a voice of reason in a dark and sinister mob world. <br/><br/> By and large Al Pacino's film though. Michael Corleone was a great character and a great role for one of the greatest American actors of the 20th century. The new Don has become spiteful and Pacino's performance is harrowingly intense. His anger and pity comes so naturally; it's simply disturbing. Probably Pacino's finest hour."

I could not stop watching this movie the first time, and every time I start to watch part of it, I have to watch it to the very end.<br/><br/>The story is both a prequel and a continuation of ""The Godfather.""  We see a young Vito Corleone's rise to power.  We also see his son Michael's consolidation of that power at the cost of his soul.

His scenes are so rivetting, I really didn't care that I couldn't understand a word.<br/><br/>In any other movie, Michael Corleone would be the villian.  As the main character, we don't have the luxury of seeing him as the ""bad-guy who must be stopped.""  Al Pacino portrays him with a Machivellian brilliance that kept me glued in front of the TV.<br/><br/>This film's only flaw is that sometimes you don't want to switch from Vito to Michael because you're so wrapped up in what's going on.

","The Godfather: Part II is without doubt the most impressive example of film-making ever.

Despite the absence of Marlon Brando and James Caan the cast is incredibly strong, notably Robert DeNiro who flawlessly plays the young Vito Corleone. Al Pacino gained excellent, well-deserved reviews as he convincingly plays the cool Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also deserves a mention for his vital role in the movie, he plays the family's lawyer Tom Hagen as impeccably as in the original Godfather. Before I saw the sequel, I believed that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever made but the Godfather Part II surpasses the original, which is not common. I thought having two stories running parallel throughout the movie was a unique and intelligent idea but the most impressive element of the movie was the broader picture of the mafia family's dealings given to the audience. As great as the original was, I thought it was somewhat limited. However, where its predecessor fails the Godfather: Part  II succeeds resulting in an exquisite movie."

","Is The Godfather Part II better than the first film?  It is difficult to decide, but there is no disputing that these two films must always be considered together, as part of a greater whole.<br/><br/>When first I viewed both parts, I was a teenager.  I found the first film to be much more satisfying.  My initial argument was that part I covered a longer period in less screen time, and was therefore better-paced and more interesting.  Since then, however, my opinion has changed somewhat.<br/><br/>I was able to see both films back-to-back a couple of years ago, and found that Part II really had moved up in my ranking.  I have heard the argument that part I ended with Michael's full corruption, and therefore didn't need to be sequelized.  However, I feel Part II is much more the second half of the story than just an overlong epilogue, as some people say.<br/><br/>While THE GODFATHER: THE COMPLETE EPIC (parts I & II chronologized) is a good telling of the story, this film is stronger for the juxtaposition of Vito's rise to glory with Michael's fall from grace.  To watch for six and a half hours, only to see Pacino's Michael turn from the young, optimistic, ""It's my family, Kay.  It's not me"" boy to the cold, lonely man who has just had his own brother murdered, it is one of the most affecting transformations in film history.  In the third film (unnecessary and inferior, to be sure, but not a bad picture), the only truly moving scene is Michael's confession in the garden, which refers to the events of Part II. The end of Part III is even a pale copy of the final 1959 scene in Part II, with Michael on the bench, surveying his dying empire.<br/><br/>The final scene in Part II, the flashback to Pearl Harbor day, is perhaps the most touching reminder of the man Michael once could have grown up to be, especially after seeing what he has become: fatherless, brotherless, and without his estranged wife and children.  And ultimately powerless.  A beautiful elegy for a life that could have been."

Coppola insists on giving us literally every element from book to film - boring, irrelevant bits as well. And yet those very same ""boring bits"" work so well in the hands of the Master that it gives the movie (any of his movies in fact) a more intelligent & rounded gloss.<br/><br/>I must admit to preferring G2 to the original because it offered so much richness & character-defining elements than the first. Although Brando was very good & suitably threatening in the first, he would also bring the pace of the film down to a stroll bringing the other characters down with him.<br/><br/>However, with the ""unknown"" De Niro playing the young Vito in G2 we get to see a revolution in his character development, in fact all the main characters including Pacino's, Keaton's & Duvell's are given greater scope to expand on their originals.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Robert Duvell, probably one of the most outrageously under-rated stars of our time, who possesses more talent in one those ""Mona Lisa"" like smirks than a lot of so-called big A1 stars of today!<br/><br/>I truly loved G2, more so in the cinema than on video because an epic ""Italian opera"" such as this deserves room to breath and a 29"" TV screen just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>G2 is better than the first, although it is just as dependent on it in order to build on the original's foundation.

The film shows that while Vito had a very strong, ambitious character, Michael showed equal strength but underneath he hid sadness and depression.<br/><br/>Of course, a complex character comparison/contrast like this needs great actors to fulfill the job. Al Pacino, fresh from his Oscar-nominated turn in The Godfather delivers one of his most memorable performances while Robert De Niro, a relative unknown then delivers an Oscar-winning performance.

The only sequel to ever win Best Picture, it does surpass the original in many ways. They're both great movies and the Godfather series is the best ever made, including Part III which was nowhere near as good as the others but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>
I prefer II over I. I just think it's more interesting, getting into the darker side of the mob. Al Pacino is outstanding as Michael Corleone. Robert DeNiro plays Vito as a young man in Little Italy. That was part of the book, but not in the first one. I love this movie. It's about as perfect as a movie could be. II together with I & III represent one of the great achievements in movie history. I thank Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and the many talented people who brought us these great movies. It's things like The Godfather series that make us love movies so much."

Lee Strasberg the legendary acting coach and teacher turns in a top performance himself as Hyman Roth friend  yet enemy to Michael .

Dominic Chianese as Johnny Ola `Sicilian Messenger Boy' to the powerful Roth.    <br/><br/>  Part Two is a much more complex picture than the first as many more characters are involved in the dual story line.

","It doesn't happen very often, but now and then a sequel - if you can call this film such a thing - ends up improving upon the themes and dramas of the first film. In this second slice of Corleone murder, intrigue and family ties, one misses Brando for about five minutes, and then Pacino takes the screen in what must surely be the finest piece of acting he has ever done. An Oscar for Scent Of A Woman? Typical blindness on the part of Academy voters, because Pacino blows everyone else away with just a look of hatred and coldness from his eyes, and by the way he reacts on the screen. By the end of the film he looks like a 20th century Richard III, complete with a blood-red shirt and a pale, almost lifeless face. Coppola, already scoring points that year for his excellent conspiracy drama, The Conversation, delivers what is, in my opinion, the best ever film made between the years 1970- 1979. In short, from start to finish, this film is totally mesmerising. DeNiro steps into Brando's shoes as the younger Don in a wonderfully evocative recreation of New York in the early part of the century, and yet come his last scene you will have no problem in believing that this will be the man who, in twenty years time, would grow up to be Marlon Brando in The Godfather. Twenty-eight years of meatier gangster flicks (Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time In America) have failed to erode its power and undeniable genius. This is because The Godfather part two is like every other classic work of cinematic art - it never ages and its power will never fade. Alas, a third part helped to remove some of its shine, but only a tiny part. A third chapter wasn't really nessecary - The story of Michael Corleone ends right there - on Lake Tahoe.<br/><br/>Movies like this come round once every decade, so do yourselves all a big favour and sit down for 200 minutes and indulge in a brilliant movie experience.

"citizen_manary","10","0","0","21 October 2001"," Superlative (some spoilers)
","After seeing ""The Godfather"" for the first time, it instantly rose to the ranks of my favorite films. Because I loved the film so much, I didn't think either of its sequels could surpass it. However, I was wrong. The Godfather Part II contains some of the finest acting, direction, screenwriting and design that has ever been seen in film. To call this film spectacular is an understatement of near criminal proportions. This is a masterwork, and however varied Coppola's career has been since, ""II"" will always redeem him.<br/><br/>Enough people have described the plot, so I won't go into that. Instead, I'll focus on the performances. De Niro is wonderful as young Vito Corleone. De Niro uses more facial communication than speech in the film, like Brando in ""I"". In De Niro, we see a hungry young man who comes the the U.S. with anger and a desire for vengeance, and watch him evolve into a man who obtains the power to achieve it. Additionally, his character's arc provides the perfect contrast to Michael's. Young Vito is a man who builds ties with others, has good professional and personal relationships, and would never lose his family. The last shot of his character is a tender moment between father and son.<br/><br/>As good as De Niro is, Pacino outshines him (and everyone else) in his part as Michael. In the last film, we saw a young man who gradually became caught in an undesired life. Here, we see him grow into that life, and what he does with the power he's attained. Pacino is brutal in this film. He commands the screen whenever on it, and his character's destruction of the family and enterprise his father worked hard to create is devastating. You feel for Michael, a man who is despicable and has lost the honor he had at the beginning of the first film, but who has also been caught in a world that he never could have avoided, much as he might have tried. As Michael becomes colder, harder and continues drawing his family's organization away from what it originally was, Pacino's character continues to become more sympathetic. Even his eyes communicate the change this character has gone through from the beginning of ""I"" to the end of ""II"". It's a brilliantly played part, and it isn't surprising that Pacino hasn't been able to surpass it. In fact, it could be argued that this is the greatest performance captured in cinema.<br/><br/>The other performances are uniformly spectacular. Keaton and Duvall are standouts. However, John Cazale, someone who deserved a career like Pacino or De Niro's (though the career he did have while he was alive was impeccable) is also brilliant. Michael's destruction of his family has much to do with his relationship with Fredo, and Fredo's inadverdent betrayal. Cazale is brilliant as a man who has always been viewed as a weakling and lived in the shadow of his brothers and tries to get out, only to bring about his own fall in the process. It's nearly as devastating a part as Pacino's, and Cazale plays it perfectly.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It enhances ""I"", and surpasses it at the same time. While ""III"" is a good film, it doesn't achieve the perfection that the first two have. If you haven't watched this series already, set aside a day and enjoy film perfection."

","As I've said before, I really hate sequels.  Technically, this may not strictly be a sequel (since half of this, the flashback half, was in the original novel), but what the hell; this is the rare sequel which is not only great, but improves on the original.  If you held a gun to my head and asked me what my favorite movie was of all time, this would be the one. Though I disagree with Coppola, who felt he romanticized the Corleones in Part I, without that feeling, there would have been no Part II, and we must thank him for that.<br/><br/>The way time passes from present to pass effortlessly, the way we see how past affects present, the way the story of Michael Corleone achieves the level of Greek tragedy, the direction, the performances, the score, everything comes together even deeper than in the first one.  But the primary reason to see this is Al Pacino.  It is my humble opinion that not only is this the best of his five great performances from 1972-75 (the others being THE GODFATHER, SCARECROW, SERPICO, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON), it is the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, period (Liv Ullman's performance in PERSONA is the best performance by an actress I have seen). Michael Corleone becomes more closed off as he achieves power.  He alienates friends, family, even the people who work for him, because he completely closes himself off from humanity.  Yet we feel for him, partly because Pacino NEVER plays for our sympathy, but gives a closed performance.  It's easy to overact, it's hard to play still and close to the vest, and Pacino chooses the more difficult path.  We also feel for him because we can sense Michael acts this way because it's the only way he feels he can run things. If he ever came out of his detachment, he'd have to admit he was a failure and was being immoral(which he does in Part III).  A masterpiece."

","When you compare The Godfather to The Godfather, Part II, the only difference between the two films is the cast.  There is no James Caan and Marlon Brando. Now, that doesn't make the movie worse, as most people would think.  The storyline is interesting, yet very sad, although this movie is excellent, it is very sad.  The Godfather, however, is inspiring due to Marlon Brando's beautiful and incouraging acting.  Therefore, Al Pacino has to act twice as hard, and he's a great actor.  He does a fantastic job. Every scene he acts he acts with passion and courage.  Vito Corleone's childhood is also great, although the adaptation in the 1970's of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, was called, The Godfather, A Novel of a movie, (I think).  I watched that and it was the two Godfather's combined together.  Vito Corleone's childhood from Part II is combined at the beginning of the movie.  Amazing and terrific.  Definetly worth watching."

","I'm a decade or so too young to remember the cinematic days of the first two Godfather movies, but I bet that when rumours of a sequel first began to circulate, many moviegoers would have doubted the need for it and would have had serious doubts over whether it could possibly do justice to the masterpiece that was the first film.<br/><br/>Such sequel let-downs as Jurassic Park II and Die Hard II had sadly all become part-and-parcel of my 1990s moviegoing experience. The only rule of sequels which I was familiar with as I grew up was that they'd almost certainly get progressively worse from movie to movie. So, after loading the cassette for Godfather Part II, can you blame me for hitting the play button on my VCR with some trepidation?<br/><br/>Yes you can! I should have known better. The Godfather Part II is such an outstanding movie that, in fact, to call it a sequel to the first movie does it little justice. Call me clichéd, but 'companion piece' is indeed the best way to describe it in relation to the first. In terms of scope and magnitude of its vision, I don't think it has a rival, anywhere.<br/><br/>
It is also one of those movies in which every little department is so perfect, that without even one of them, you can imagine the whole thing collapsing.<br/><br/>Nothing needs to be said that hasn't already been uttered innumerable times regarding the casting and their respective performances. Pacino and De Niro are simply mesmerising with Duvall, Cazale and Strasberg providing the rock-solid support. Coppola and Puzo's script charts Michael's moral demise so graphically, it almost pains you to think back to the squeaky-clean war hero presented in The Godfather's opening. As for the bold move to write flashbacks, they serve a hugely meaningful purpose throughout the movie and without them, the main storyline wouldn't impact half as much as it does. Nino Rota's music captures in just one theme (that which first appears as the young Vito approaches Ellis Island with fellow asylum-seekers) the grandness and sinking tragedy of this movie, and his incidental music is magnificent without being intrusive.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest individual plaudit should be reserved for Gordon Willis's cinematography; It captures the mood of the film perfectly and he betters even his work on the original. In itself it could be labelled a Cinematographer's Bible. And anyone who has borne witness to that final shot of the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about, but for now, that's for my fellow sequel-doubters out there to discover. An unparallelled masterpiece."
"stryker-5","Null","0","0","26 February 1999"," ""You Can Never Lose Your Family""
","Here you have the supreme example of a sequel which eclipses its original.  ""The Godfather Part II"" is a majestic tragedy, operatic in its sweep, gigantic in its architecture and a stand-alone masterpiece in its own right - but a film which also amplifies and explains the film which went before it.  In the closing reverie sequence, the superbly-staged flashback, we finally understand what has driven Michael Corleone and why he has so persistently humiliated Tom Hagan.<br/><br/>Several narrative threads are embroidered into Michael's story.  The scene shifts neatly from Sicily in 1901 to New York in 1917 and 1941, and to Nevada and Cuba in 1958.  The period detail is nothing short of wonderful. The vendetta is enacted in the exact same locations which featured in Domingo's ""Cavalleria Rusticana"".  Same streets, same theme.<br/><br/>Brooding ominously over everything is The Family.  Many of the characters try to escape its clutches - Connie, Kay, Fredo, Frankie Pentangeli - but The Family is all-powerful and its reach is long.  Michael was Don Vito's favourite son, and this is more a curse than a blessing.  The college-educated marine officer expected and deserved to carve out a destiny for himself, but The Family had other plans.  Chosen by fate to be the new Don, Michael succeeds brilliantly but also succumbs to despair as love eludes him and paranoia sets in.  ""You wanna wipe everybody out?"" asks Tom. ""Just my enemies,"" answers Michael - as he plans the death of his own sibling.  By the end, Michael's very existence is surrounded by, and predicated upon, death.<br/><br/>Tom Hagan is the non-Italian who has, through loyalty and intelligence, risen high in The Family.  The Corleone lawyer and majordomo, Tom can always be relied upon to be calm, efficient and discreet.  Robert Duvall was rightly accorded second billing after Pacino for his fascinating, understated performance.  ""Tom isn't going to sit in with us,"" Michael tells Johnny Ola, and we see Tom masking his surprise at this humiliation.  At one point he asks directly, ""Why do you hurt me, Michael?""  For this man, the consummate staff officer, to ask such a thing shows the depth of his pain. At the very end of the film, Michael's desire to wound Tom is explained.<br/><br/>""I intend to squeeze you.  I don't like your kind of people,"" says the brash Senator Geary as he bargains over a corrupt gaming licence.  Later, The Family rescues him from a deeply compromising situation and the Senator becomes yet another Corleone bagman, speaking in defence of Michael at the Senate hearings.  The sunlit frivolity of the first communion party outside jars nicely with the dark dealings inside the tenebrous house, underlining Michael's remarks to Geary on the subject of hypocrisy.<br/><br/>Pacino is hugely authoritative as Michael, and carries much of the credit for the film's triumphant success, but it has to be said that Robert de Niro is astonishing as Don Vito.  He grows in assurance as he ages before our eyes, and combines the human decency and the cold ruthlessness which are both the hallmarks of Vito Corleone.  De Niro achieves all of this whilst marvellously and uncannily reproducing the mannerisms of Brando's creation.<br/><br/>Fredo is the weak brother.  Lacking Sonny's cheerful brutality and Michael's gravity, he is passed over for the succession. The Rosado brothers manipulate him and make a traitor of him.  John Cazale plays him beautifully as the nervy malcontent who feels he should be the Don, but who is given the whorehouse jobs.  By the end, Fredo has regressed into a childlike state, fishing with the kids and tearfully grateful for being allowed into Michael's presence.<br/><br/>The Fanucci sequence is terrific.  1917 comes to life for us as a crowded New York street scene transforms into a theatre interior.  We see a Neapolitan bel canto performance reproduced faultlessly.  This story-within-a-story explains Vito Andolini's rise to prominence with pace and historical imagination.  Similarly, Cuba on the eve of the communist takeover is brought vividly to life on the screen.  We share Michael's growing sense of unease as the Batista regime unravels, and it becomes clear that Fredo has betrayed The Family.  ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"" is Michael's motto, and we see him put this to devastating effect with Fredo and Hymie Roth.<br/><br/>For all Michael's success as a leader, he fails his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) and his private life is barren.  Kay has to be protected from The Family's enemies, but to her it feels like a claustrophobic imprisonment. Things have gone badly wrong by the time of Michael's return from Cuba (he has to be briefed on which Christmas present he has 'given' his son).  A richly emotional chiaroscuro scene with his mother brings Michael to admit that he has lost Kay's love.  She is the loser, becoming inexorably estranged from The Family and from her own children.  Michael symbolically obliterates her by closing the door in her face.<br/><br/>In the shifting sands of gangland treachery, it is hard to be sure who has double-crossed whom.  Did Roth deceive Michael, or is Michael now hopelessly paranoid?  What was the truth behind the bungled whacking of Frankie Five Angels?  One reality emerges from the chimera.  The Family alone is strong, and it crushes mercilessly those who fall victim to it. Even Don Michael."

His son Paulo, probably one to have give spiritual inheritence to Santino, swears revenge and of course is killed in turn.  Antonio's wife makes a reverent pleed to the Don to spare her last son, Vito.  He refuses with a simple and cold ""No.""  Vito escapes as his mother is killed.  When he arrives in Ellis Island, he is given his name ""Vito Corleone"".<br/><br/>
In Lake Tahoe, Navada, the Corleones have achieved wealth and are making their way.  A great celebration is made for Michael and Kay's son Anthony. Michael meets with a recsenting senator, who even made a nice a comment in a speech ""Anthony VYETO Corleone.""  He refuses to submit a gsambling licsense to Michael at a reasonable and fair price.  When the meeting ends, Michael finally leads up to put ""My offer is this.  Nothing.""<br/><br/>
Kay is preagnant with a child.  Connie has had at least one other failing marriage.  Her next choice is mostly a complete stranger and anyone can see that the relationship will be useless.  Michael even puts in to his sister like he does in battle talk ""Connie, if don't listen to me, and marry this man, you'll disapoint me.""  Michael truly is in the business he never wanted.<br/><br/>
Michael's intentions are to make a deal to own hotels in Vegas with long family friends Hyman Roth and Johnny Olah.  Roth coneects with the Rosato brothers who another long family friend Frank Pantangili despises.  So, he aks for the murder which is refuse.  Before Michael knows it, his bedroom is shattered by bullets from hitmen.  Thus brings us into the battle hyme.<br/><br/>
**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>
Vito lives in New York City in a ""minature Italy"" area with his wife and infant son.  He is finally brought into something when Clamenza asks him to hide revolvers for him.  There is a local mafia family known as the Black Hand.  One of the main men and collectors is Don Funnucci, an evil ""protector"".  Because of him, Vito loses his job at a baker, but kin heartedly reponds to his boss with ""You've always been good to me and watched over me like a father, and I won't forget it.""  When he arrives home, he is in fact enjoyed.  When he meets Clamenza, he rewards him by going into ""a friends"" house and taking a carpet for the apartment.<br/><br/>
When Vito and his friends' business in corrupted by Funnucci, Vito dfecides to make a go at it.  We get his line of ealier age ""I make him an offer he don't refuse.""  Some of the best directing is put in when Vito goes into an apartment from the rooftop.  He has a revolver and a dinner cloth.  Vito unscrews the lightbulb and Funnucci taps it to get it back then soon discovers Vito.  Vito fires through the cloth.  Funnucci does't pay sattention to his attacker  He wrather examines the wound as Vito fires more ans soon the cloth is on fire.  He finally gives him a mout shot and escapes to the roof where he throw the cloth aout and destroys the pistol by breakng it into pieces and throwing them into chimneys and pipes.  An absolutely genious scene.<br/><br/>
When Michael discovers that his brother Fredo is the traitor adn gies him the kiss of death, we must be skcocked at the emotion.  The script, of course, is real tight and spreads a lot.  They finally pull themselves out of tight spot with a senate comittee by intemadating thei key witness Pantangeli with his brother from Sicily.  I've seen the film five times and there's there's still a lot I could probably pick up on.  Kay leaves Michael and informs him that she delaberertly termanated their coming child.<br/><br/>
Vito takes his family on a trip to Sicily where he can expand hs olive oil business and take care of some certain matters.  When he makkes the visit to Don Ciccio, he show the respect of kissing his hand and respecting him verbally.  Then there's his line ""My father's name was Vito Andolini and this is for you!""  He slices him accross the stomach.  Brilliant cene, of course.  Then there's that train trip back where he holds Michaells hand out to wave good-bye.<br/><br/>
At the funeral of Mama Corleone, Connie says she'll stay closer to the family and convinces Michael to fordive Fredo who has been eliminated from the family as far as Michael is concerened.  there's the intensity of holding him and looking up at Neri who knows what's to be done.  Michael is determined to have Roth killed.  When Tom abjects he puts ""Tom, ya know you surprise me.  If one thing's certain.  If history has taught us anything, it's that you kill anyone.""  Also there's ""I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom.  Just my enemies.  That's all.""  Tom makes a visit to Pantangialli.  They talk about reference of the Corleone family being the Roman Empire.  Tom assures him ""Don't you worry about anything Franky Five Angles.""<br/><br/>
In Tahoe, Kay make a goodbye to the children.  Connie rushes her on account of Miachael who does show up and, like before, shuts her out at a doorway, now from her own family.  Fredo intends to take Anthony out on a boat ride to fish.  Anthony is called in to go to Reno, so Fredo goes alone with Al Neri.  Then there's the seguence like the one in the original with killings, only, of course, shorter.  Roth is to be handed over to protection at a Miami Airport and he give interviews.  Rocco, as a reporter impersonator gets close up and shoots him in the stomach.  Michael, being so nice and consederate, didn't bother at all tog ive Rocco protection and he was killed as well.  The FBI break open the bathroom door to find Pantangiali in the tub, filled with blood, dead.  Michael watches from the boat house as Fredo says his procedure for catching fish, a hail Marry.  When he finishes, we are closes on Michael and hear a shot ring.  Then we see Neri get up in the boat.  Michael then sits down.<br/><br/>
""Hey everyone, pay attention this is my friend Carlo Rizzi.""  The flashback is exactly what is needed for emotion.  It's the Godfather's birthday and the day or a few days after Pearl Harbor.  Sonny, looking for someone for his sister, introduces Carlo to Connie.  Then Sal Tessio comes in with a cake.  He referes to the men who have inlisted as ""A bunch of saps."" Michael questions him and says that he quit school to join the Marines.  An innocent and patriotic man who had recentment for his family who put him in an infirmary.  Sonny and the others are shcocked and unpleased with this news.  As their father comes in they go to sing ""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"" while Michael sits alone at the table.  Then there's the scene of Michael eing held by Vito, waving good-bye to Sicily.  Finally, there's the incredibly pignant scene on him in his side yard being closed in on. Miserable and completely alone.  He will now not be forgiven (at least by a good part of the audience) and is truly more evil then ever.<br/><br/>
The score, of course, is very emotional and filled with good compasition. Coppola got the oscar for directing he deserved this time.  Everything about the film is great.  The acting by Pacino and De Niro.  Cinemotagraphy Everything.  There's the great powerful paralax of a man arising to hope and being a hero to his people and there's the crookid,villainess successor who destroys what the whole matter of the particular orginazation was and was to protect.  Family.  This is an encrddible film and an abolute great sequel about a serious subject."

","I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film in awe rewinding the vcr to catch scenes again.  It is one of the few films ever to have made an indelible mark on popular culture with it's script even being referenced in the tv mafia drama ""The Sopranos"". Al Pacino's performance is unbelievable emanating the coldness of death that is alluded to in the novel.  Pacino is able to build upon the script to make Michael Corleone one of the greatest characters ever seen on celluloid.  His performance alone is worth watching by itself.  Michael's ascent to the top of the mafia in America and his descent in his family is the essence of this film.  Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall are excellent with John Cazale giving notice of his immense talent which was tragically never fully realised due to his premature death through illness.  The script is itself magnificent particularly where Michael and Fredo are together in the family home, Hyman Roth's (Lee Strasberg) speech on ""who gave the order"" and Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) apparent first use of ""make him an offer he can't refuse"".  The script helps to make this film the natural completion of the ""Godfather"" saga.  The third film is an irrelevance in the company of two of the greatest film's ever made as it is only average.  There may never be a better film made or story written as ""The Godfather Part II""."

"zensixties","5","7","24","10 August 2007"," Weak Soap-Operaish Followup to much better Original
","Godfather Part 2 is so hailed as the greatest film of all time it's time someone burst that overblown bubble and I've got the needle right here. So let's take a closer look at what should be considered a mediocre sequel to the classic film, The Godfather. First of all Marlon Brando is nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get random flashbacks to Robert Deniro as the young Vito. We get some good scenes of old Little Italy though there's a Keystone-cops feel to some of it, especially the comic relief of the slumlord scene.<br/><br/>Part 2 has a much bigger budget but a script with weakened plot lines and dialogue, basically trying to followup everything from Part 1 logically becoming formulaic and soap-operaish, and ending up falling flat.<br/><br/>The film begins with another celebration of some kind. A brother's betrayal aspires to be that of Hamlet, but without the depth or wit (or brevity). It's now the 1950s and Mike is in Nevada and is trying to buy a corrupt Senator. The Senator is I suppose the film producer element of the first, but with nothing creative like a horse head...just crass dialogue that doesn't ring true. We also get a Mafia hearing in Congress which should have ended up on the cutting room floor. We also get (the great?) Lee Strasberg as some old shirtless and feeble mobster. He may be a great teacher, but someone tell me why this is an Academy Award winning acting performance! Am I just dumb? Al Pacino is great as always, this performance following Serpico, but his dialogue doesn't ring true. When he begins, ""If history has taught us anything.."" I expect some deep wisdom to follow...needless to say it doesn't. Talia Shire's character is also weakened compared to the original's Connie. Here she just ""needs money"" and wants Mike to forgive Fredo because ""he's so sweet"". This mess of a sequel ends with a literal bloodbath, but following the formula of the first, and a final scene with the original cast (sans Brando) the actors of which were paid more than all their good work in the original. I'm not saying it isn't worth seeing, just that it's inferior to the original in many ways. But of course it isn't near as bad as Part 3. My final criticism is that all these mob films intentionally or not glorify criminals. Okay, now you can click ""no""."

","If you must see a Godfather film, see the 1st. Like #2, it's overrated and over-hyped, bot not nearly as much. Both are long films in need of more cuts, but 2 is like a film by a man who can't stop talking about himself and his friends.<br/><br/>The massive failing is the director gets far too much respect, as if he's a mafia godfather himself, so not nearly enough cuts are made, like Diane Keaton's awful acting. While it's easy enough to follow the 2 timelines, it's disappointing that because of the sloppy excesses of the main timeline, the 2 rarely tie together. Had it been up to me, I would have done only the early timeline as a prequel.<br/><br/>Pacino and DeNiro both deserve the acting credit they get. The whole film is filled with interesting, well acted male characters - probably what deceives many people into giving it excess credit. Unfortunately, great acting performances and characters don't add up to a masterpiece."
"pfgpowell-1","5","5","16","1 June 2009"," The rotten core at the centre of this well-made film
","What exactly are we talking about when we amateur critics write these reviews? What exactly is 'a film'? Certainly it is more than technical ability. It is more than just the acting, or the directing, or the story. It is everything which makes up that film. So The Godfather II (as did the first The Godfather) presents us all with something of a dilemma. It was made in the early Seventies when, possibly, the public, though not the police and the FBI, were largely unaware of the reality of the Mafia. The yellow press (called the red tops here in the UK) gave them unlimited publicity, and even when we were shown pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of bosses lying outside barbershops and restaurants, there was a certain thrill about it all. Then came The Sopranos, whose central conceit of a Mafia head of a family suffering from panic attacks was more or less the keynote to a certain disrespect of the whole shooting match, and the public's view is different. We now see the Mafia for what it they are: nasty, brutish, cynical, heartless, sadistic thugs with, it would seem, no redeeming features. Forget all that talk of 'honour' and 'loyalty', these men, and the women who tolerated their brutality and were quite happy to live off its proceeds, were and are scum. So what to make of films such as the Godfather series? They are extremely well-made, well-written, well-directed, well-acted, well-designed and they stand head and shoulders above their peers. But in an odd sort of way, these films are thoroughly devalued by the central lie they tell. Vito Corleone and his son Michael are portrayed as honourable men, wise men, men to be admired. They are almost portrayed, in their convoluted heroism, as honest men. But they are nothing of the kind. They are brutal and murderous and do not deserve to be admired. The men in The Sopranos apparently came far closer to portraying the real mafiosi. Indeed real mafiosi are widely quoted as saying as much. So why did Coppola choose to present them as something close to heroes? And that brings me back to my first question and the very real dilemma faced by someone making a judgement of these very well-made films: as the portrayal of what is basically scum as honourable men is so central to Coppola's films, where does that leave the films? I really have no answer. As a piece of entertainment, of course, the Godfather films are superb. But once you consider the wider context, the butchery, the misery, the killing, the heroin dealing, the pimping, the whoring, you do have to wonder. As film-making this would get 8/9 our of 10. But given the corrupt moral ambiguity at its centre, only a 5."
"barnabyrudge","10","3","8","9 April 2014"," A remarkable epic crime movie, utterly compelling as a sequel though it requires some knowledge of the previous movie to fully enjoy it.
","The Godfather: Part II has the rare distinction of being a sequel that is equal to, possibly even greater than, its predecessor. Indeed, it is one of the finest films ever made, a gangster picture that manages to be epic in scope as well as length, showcasing a number of brilliant performances and proving that, for all the fancy special effects in the world, nothing beats a truly compelling story. The only thing to bear in mind is that The Godfather: Part II relies heavily on a knowledge of the previous film – it is not one of those follow-ups that can be watched out of sequence with any hope of grasping what is going on. 'Sequel' might be the wrong word actually, as the film is divided into two sections, one continuing the story of the Corleone crime family from where it left off at the end of Part I, the other acting as a turn-of- the-century prequel, showing the rise of Vito Corleone from orphaned Sicilian immigrant to powerful Mob boss. In effect, The Godfather: Part II is therefore a continuation of, and prequel to, the existing narrative dealt with in the original.<br/><br/>Following the death of his father and older brother, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the new head of his family's empire, based now in Nevada having moved out of New York several years earlier. Running the 'business' is taking its toll on the once-honest Michael – his relationship with wife Kay (Diane Keaton) is frosty and distant; his brother Fredo (John Cazale) is becoming more of a burden than ever; he must deal with rumblings of discontent from New York; and his pledge to legitimise the Corleone family is further than ever from becoming a reality. Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt, Michael puts consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) in charge of the family for a while, while he goes away to deal with some business matters and investigate who tried to have him killed. His adventures bring him into contact with Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who may be Michael's ally or enemy. The story traces Michael's long descent into isolation and paranoia, alienating himself from everyone in his all- consuming quest to come out on top in this epic gangland-battle-of-wits. Interwoven into the story are a number of flashbacks showing the rise of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando's character from Part I, here portrayed by Robert De Niro). After arriving in New York a poor immigrant, Vito eventually finds honest work in a grocery store but is hounded out of his job by local gangster Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Making ends meet through petty burglaries, he gradually rises up the criminal ranks, killing Fanucci and eventually becoming a feared and respected figure in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Whereas The Godfather was criticised for glamorising violent crime and the Mafia, The Godfather: Part II shows things in a much uglier light. Families are torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; relationships are destroyed by the lack of communication; innocence is tarnished irrevocably. In short, the world seems somehow more rotten and corrupt in The Godfather: Part II. It's an altogether more ruthless film, harder-edged, shockingly authentic even. The performances are exemplary throughout. How Pacino didn't win the Best Actor Oscar of the year is beyond comprehension, creating as he does this incredible character whose grip on his empire comes at a terrible price. De Niro is excellent as the young Vito Corleone; Keaton fabulous as Michael's neglected wife; Duvall convincing as ever as the family lawyer; and Strasberg mesmerising as the slippery Hyman Roth, one of the truly great characters of gangster cinema. If it seems like in this review I have done nothing but shower superlatives upon this film, that's because I have. The Godfather: Part II is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies of all- time."
"jboothmillard","10","3","8","13 March 2005"," The Godfather Part II
","This is equally as great as the first, and another success for Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Francis Ford Coppola (he could have won the Oscar for the first). This film tells two stories of the Corleones, it tells the current events of the new Godfather, Michael Corleone, and the story of young Vito Corleone. BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino is brilliant at being a villain, the worst thing he did as the character was to kill his own brother. But it's Oscar and BAFTA winning Robert DeNiro as young Vito that's my favourite of the whole film, because he is very good at impersonating Brando, and being just as mean as him. He is just as good at being the Godfather as the late, great Marlon Brando was. Also starring Diane Keaton as Kay Corleone, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Oscar nominated Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Oscar nominated Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie Pentangeli. A lot more interesting and complex than the first, a masterpiece sequel, I only wish it was left here and there was no third film. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Nino Rota, Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Film Editing, and it as nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Robert De Niro was number 2, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was number 50, and Pacino number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Pacino and De Niro together were number 5 on The World's Greatest Actor, Michael Corleone was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.""), and along with the first film, both were number 2 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","And I write review based off the ENTIRE Godfather series. I may be in the minority, but I simply don't understand the hype all about these movies!!! Perhaps the most overrated trilogy ever. I really do believe so much of this hype & attention should be given to some other much BETTER films, like ""Iron Will"", which was a true story. Or the ""Great Escape"", another true story! Maybe it's just evident how much of a FETISH Hollywood has for violence, blood, gore, sexual innuendos, and bad language! That's NO ""ART"", you can trust me! I'm not much of a fan of Al Pacino, nor any of the work he has done - he just always seems to come off as scary & abusive (with his scary eyes & unpredictable attitudes.) <br/><br/>Couldn't Al Pacino take up a KINDER character role here and there sometime soon???<br/><br/>The film was a mess, and so was it's sequels! Everything is shot in the dark, most scenes are often times really boring, and half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying 'cause they're speaking in *freaking* Italian!! And don't forget the horrendous false cult of Catholicism especially being depicted on-screen; Catholics are DUPED. They worship idols, believe in a false Jesus, and are only all just about idolatry, bigotry, and superstition. <br/><br/>Though to be fair, I did like seeing Robert De Niro here and there, and I liked some of the talk concerning Israel & the Jewish people - because I have quite a soft spot for Jews, because they have literally got a long sad history of persecution, and deserve to be recognised for their incredible genius minds and intelligence.<br/><br/>But in the end, that really doesn't matter in a huge porous abomination nonsensical pile of worthless nothing that is this movie! And the other two. 2/10<br/><br/>PS: Everyone's saying ""the Godfather"" is the greatest film of all time. Nope, they're wrong! It's Groundhog Day!

"The-Sarkologist","6","4","13","3 March 2012"," Comparison Between Father and Son
","Well, it seems that I agree partially with Ebert on this film, except that he rated it higher than I did. The reason that I rated it lower is because there seems to be little to tie the entire film together. The character development and interaction is brilliant, but the plot itself seems to be quite loose and very thin in places. Also the movie seems to follow very closely to the style of the first film, with an almost sudden ending, where everybody that appears to be an antagonist is simply killed, or put out of the picture.<br/><br/>What this movie does well though is to offer a comparison between Don Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone. Here we see how Vito's family was killed by a powerful mafia Don in Sicily, and then flees to America to build his empire. We then jump to the present (in the film, which is 1959) to see the crowning glory of what his family became. The difference is that Michael Corleone is a cold and heartless man who slowly pushes everybody close to him away, while Vito Corleone, even though he can be a brutal murderer at times, is an honourable man who is there to help the poor and the weak. We see this when he bullies the landlord who bullies a poor widow tenant.<br/><br/>I guess the thing that strikes us most in this movie is how Michael and Vito Corleone change. Vito goes from being a poor orphan boy with small pox to a powerful Mafia Don, while Michael goes from being a rich family man to a cold and powerful man with no friends. In the final scenes he falls to the lowest and kills his brother.<br/><br/>I have never been all that great about sequels, and I feel that this movie is really no different."
"hadleya","Null","4","13","24 November 2004"," Spielberg meets Ed Wood - No Plot, Monumental Failure
","Why Francis Ford Coppolla received such accolade for this film is beyond me. I suppose he must've hired everyone in Hollywood to do this picture. Do you think everyone had a piece? Piece of what you may ask. A piece of a failure of monumental proportions. This movie reminded me of the Titanic - the boat, not the movie.<br/><br/>Why is this movie a failure? This film suffers from terrible dramatic fundamentals. It is a classic example of the movie drives the plot which is not the way it works. Rather, good drama has as its one trademark, the plot drives the movie. Any first year director in any dramatic medium should know this. You do the scenes so that the plot is revealed, not rewritten. The reader is kept on edge, waiting to see what happens next.<br/><br/>And that is the key. The following notes on the characters are inconsequential. This movie suffers most from appalling writing that undermines everything. Nice dialogue does nothing if the storyline makes no sense. Who cares? In this film, the reader is constantly wondering, 'what just happened there.' Did I miss something? What are they talking about? Do I need to remember all these characters? No, you don't, Francis just wanted to get his cousin in the picture, so he's wasting your time to do it.<br/><br/>That is why the first film, despite its relatively meager budget was a success. Coppola was forced to quell his massive ego and improvise to make it work. He was sloppy and sometimes almost juvenile, but it didn't matter. The plot was so good, all he really had to do is show up. And he almost blew that. Here you see the true Coppola at his ultimate worse. Now you know why the producers of the first film were so worried.<br/><br/>All I could think about during the entire film was, 'Where is Brando?'<br/><br/>Bobby Deniro and the Italian language were annoying. Deniro was annoying, in general. All I could think about was, ""okay, so deniro wants to join the gang...of misfits."" <br/><br/>Pacino was lost. I started muting his outbursts because they were so predictable. The key to a good outburst is it has to be explosive meaning unpredictable. In Al's case it was just load and annoying. I yawned. The rest of the film focused on Pacino's facial movements from the restaurant scene in the first film. It was like ""Okay Al, remember that restaurant scene? Let's have you do those facial expressions again, for three whole hours. Do you think we'll get tired of it?"" <br/><br/>Diane Keaton shouldn't have even been there. The stupid and pitiful moral struggles of family life made me wonder if Coppolla didn't spend his entire childhood watching the Brady bunch. What a load!!!!!! I can't believe he even attempted to address such things. Does he think I'm some kind of idiot? Obviously. ""But Daddy doesn't spend enough time with me."" ""Don't worry boy, he's in Cuba. I'll buy you a red toy car. let's go fishing."" I vomit.<br/><br/>The first half introduced so many utterly inconsequential characters, I couldn't help but wonder if they were all Coppolla's cousins. I've never seen so many gala affairs and parties in one film. I thought I was reading a travel brochure. <br/><br/>Coppolla had so overextended himself that at some point he was probably no longer even part of the film. I don't care how many hours he worked. All he did was serve the interests of his own ego. The artist was left helpless in a pile of rubble. It was a managerial catastrophe.<br/><br/>This movie was nothing more than a hackneyed soap opera overblown on a proportion that boggles the mind. Great sets, great music, great cameras, do nothing whatsoever if there is no storyline and the characters are uninteresting. ugh. I couldn't help but think that anyone who actually was a mobster would look at this and say, 'what a load of crap.'<br/><br/>Fortunately, you don't have to be a mobster to understand that you are being sold a bill of goods. All you have to do is read this. Oh, and for those who actually liked this film...I'll bet you liked Rocky II.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time."

","The only remarkable thing about Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather, Part II"" is the insistent manner in which it recalls how much better his original film was. Among other things, one remembers ""The Godfather's"" tremendous narrative drive and the dominating presence of Marlon Brando in the title role, which, though not large, unified the film and transformed a super-gangster movie into a unique family chronicle.<br/><br/>""Part II,"" also written by Mr. Coppola and Mario Puzo, is not a sequel in any engaging way. It's not really much of anything that can be easily defined.<br/><br/>It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own. Occasionally it repeats a point made in ""The Godfather"" (organized crime is just another kind of American business, say) but its insights are fairly lame at this point.<br/><br/>""The Godfather, Part II,"" which opened yesterday at five theaters, is not very far along before one realizes that it hasn't anything more to say. Everything of any interest was thoroughly covered in the original film, but like many people who have nothing to say, ""Part II"" won't shut up.<br/><br/>Not the least of its problems is its fractured form. ""Part II"" moves continually back and forth in time between two distinct narratives. It's the story of the young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be played by Marlon Brando in the first movie) seen first around the turn of the century in Sicily and then in 1917 in New York, where he's played by Robert De Niro, and it's the story of Vito's son, Michael, played again by Al Pacino, the new Mafia don who sets out to control Las Vegas in the late nineteen-fifties.<br/><br/>One story doesn't necessarily illuminate the other, it's just additional data, like footnotes. I can't readily imagine what Mr. Coppola and Mr. Puzo were trying to do, except to turn their first film into a long parenthesis that would fit between the halves of the new movie.<br/><br/>Even if ""Part II"" were a lot more cohesive, revealing and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self- parody it now seems.<br/><br/>Looking very expensive but spiritually desperate, ""Part II"" has the air of a very long, very elaborate revue sketch. Nothing is sacred. The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy—the exteriors are too bright and glow while the interiors are so dark you wonder if these Mafia chiefs can't afford to buy bigger light bulbs.<br/><br/>Nino Rota's old score keeps thumping away like a heavenly juke box. The performers, especially those repeating their original roles, seem locked into waxy rigid attitudes. Mr. Pacino, so fine the first time out, goes through the film looking glum, sighing wearily as he orders the execution of an old associate or a brother, winding up very lonely and powerful, which is just about the way he wound up before. Mr. De Niro, one of our best young actors, is interesting as the young Vito until, toward the end of his section of the film, he starts giving a nightclub imitation of Mr. Brando's elderly Vito.<br/><br/>There are a couple of notable exceptions. Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, makes an extraordinarily effective screen debut as Hyman Roth, the powerful Jewish mobster (reportedly modeled on Meyer Lansky) with whom Michael attempts to take over the Havana rackets under the Battista regime. Mr. Strasberg's Roth is a fascinating mixture of lust, ruthlessness and chicken soup. Michael V. Gazzo, the playwright (""A Hatful of Rain""), is also superb as a Corleone captain who crosses the Family. Another more or less non pro, G. D. Spradlin (a former politician, according to publicity sources) is absolutely right as a crooked, very WASPish United States Senator from Nevada.<br/><br/>The plot defies any rational synopsis, but it allows Mr. Coppola, in his role as director, to rework lots of scenes that were done far better the first time: family reunions, shoot-outs, ambushes and occasional dumb exchanges between Don Michael Corleone and his square, long-suffering wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Oh, Michael,"" says the slow-to-take-offense Kay when Michael is about to sew up the Vegas rackets, ""seven years ago you told me you'd be legitimate in five years."""

There is so much too it because it is telling two fully fledged stories, at times I did feel the separate plots could have been broken up in to two movies. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely marvelous, Al Pacino delivers one of the highlights of his career as we watch Michael Corleone become corrupt as he takes control of his father's empire. He is joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. <br/><br/>The main reason you would think this movie could not work out is because Marlon Brando could not be in it, but Robert De Niro manages to shine as a younger version of Vito Corleone, putting in an engrossing performance that is worthy to Brando's in every way, so much so that they are the only two actors to receive an Academy Award for portraying the same characters. Dramatic, intense and extremely well acted, The Godfather: Part II is a long journey, but it's worth every minute, I would recommend to all moviegoers. <br/><br/>As Michael takes over his father's business, we learn the origins of Vito and his empire. <br/><br/>Best Performance; Robert De Niro"
"droog67","10","2","5","27 February 2012"," The Godfather Part II Review
","""The Godfather Part II"", made in 1974, is the sequel to the movie ""The Godfather"", made in 1972. It's the dark and tragic story of a Sicilian mafia family, the Corleones. It's an amazing film that I consider to be superior to the first and one of the best films of all time. It starts with a 9 year old Vito Corleone, A.K.A. 'The Godfather"", the future head of the Corleone crime family. He is in Sicily at his father's funeral, who had been murdered by the local mafia. At the funeral Vito's older brother is also killed, and the mafia chief is determined to murder Vito too. His mother begs for his freedom, but the mafia chief knows that if he lets him go, Vito will one day come back for revenge. Vito's mother bravely picks up a knife and holds it to the chief's throat, allowing him to escape, but she is quickly gunned down. Vito then immigrates to New York and arrives at Ellis Island. The movie then flashes forward through time and the darker story of his son, Michael Corleone, begins.<br/><br/>The movie then starts to alternate between the stories of Vito Corleone as he rises in the New York Mafia in the 1920's, and Michael Corleone as he struggles to maintain his father's empire in the late 50's. So it acts as both a prequel and a sequel. I thought that this was the most interesting part of the film, because you see how Vito started with nothing and built an empire, while Michael starts with this empire and has to keep it all from crumbling. Another thing that you see throughout the film is the extreme transformation of the character of Michael. In just a few years, he had become more brutal and ruthless than Vito ever was. You see just how corrupted Michael had become when he does something at the end that is horrifying and unforgivable. That's the point when his job and corruption from power had driven him to do something that destroys his family and himself.<br/><br/>Another strong part of the film is its performances. The movie dominated the Academy Awards nominations for Best Supporting Actor/Actress, with Robert De Niro (Vito Corleone), Michael V. Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli), Talia Shire (Connie Corleone), and Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth) all nominated for that category, and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Robert De Niro was the one awarded the Oscar, one of the many awards that the film has been given. Robert De Niro was also awarded an Oscar for his performance as the character). Al Pacino also did a great job of portraying the change of his character from the first film and throughout this one. He went from a young WWII veteran trying to break away from his family's ""business"" to being the country's most powerful mob bosses.<br/><br/>All of these things are what make the movie a masterpiece. It won many awards, including Best Picture at the 1974 Academy Awards. The characters are great, which is helped by the award-winning performances of the actors. The two alternating stories are what made the movie so much more interesting than the first. It's currently number 32 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years100 Movies list, and number 3 on IMDb's top 250 movies list. I agree with the reviews, and I think that it is one of the greatest films ever made."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","5","11 February 2011"," A Shakespearian tragedy for a Macchiavellian triumph ...
","By tracing a parallel story between Vito's ascension to power and the consolidation of this very power by his son Michael, ""The Godfather Part II"" has an epic scope that remarkably contrasts with the 'intimate feeling' of the first opus. Yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'Family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of ""Part I"" but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between Politics, Business and Crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the American Dream. This is also why the film is regarded as an epic.<br/><br/>In ""Part II"", it's not a Five-Families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with Sonny, Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, when the Corleones were fighting for their survival. The bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. Indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from Tessio, Vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by Michael in ""Part II"", the fact that ""loyalty relies on business"". What a world where you can't call your friends ""friends"" because they are only your ""associates"" but you still call your enemies ""enemies""! What a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your ""friends""! And what a world when even your brother can betray you!<br/><br/>""Part II"" is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people –after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as Sonny- Even Michael has these words about Fredo, ""he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death"". Life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in Nevada, but it's not New York City anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. The film opens with a conversation between Michael Corleone and Senator Geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to ""squeeze him"".<br/><br/>Michael's reply sets the tone of the film ""Senator, my offer is this: nothing"", he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. If politicians and criminals play in the same arena: business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. Crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting ""bigger than US Steel"" as Hyman Roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, Las Vegas, pre-Revolution Cuba, even be able to elect a new President. If Coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against ""Part II"", and the directing plays a significant role to that.<br/><br/>Indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where Neri shuts the door on Kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the Corleone's inner circle and ""the good team won"" and could savor the victory behind the closed door. Michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the Don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect.<br/><br/>But in Part II, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while Michael could count on the loyalty of Neri, Rocco, Hagen and even Fredo at the end of the first part, in Part II, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. So, while ""Part I"" established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, ""Part I""I highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to Michael's descent into paranoia.<br/><br/>The first film was a consolidation of power, built on Family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of Vito Corleone, we find him again with the traits of Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role. He represents the heritage of Michael Corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of ""Part II"" is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like Vito Corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where Machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. Times have changed and Michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed ""lose his family"". The tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it.<br/><br/>The second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of Crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in what I believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. It's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic I mean. For me, it's perfect the way it is."
"a15haddad","9","2","5","15 February 2005"," The greatest sequel ever? Absolutely
","The Godfather: Part II came out in 1974 with incredible hype, but when it first was released it was labeled a disappointment. Only a few months later, however, it could be heard among many a debate that this movie was superior to the original. <br/><br/>The plot is arguably even more intense and chilling and, unlike its predecessor, it tells two tales: one of how Michael Corleone tightens his grip on the criminal underworld in the late 1950s and another of the beginnings of his father, Vito, this time played by Robert De Niro to outstanding effect, and his business empire. It is this near-seamless change that propels The Godfather: Part II into the discussion of the greatest movies ever, where it belongs right there with the first. <br/><br/>Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone and this time plays him even better. On top of that, De Niro, in the role that made him famous, is sublime as Vito. While De Niro's performance is not as memorable as Marlon Brando's and his character not quite as endearing, it is still one of the highlights in the history of acting in the cinema. It's sad that when most people today think of De Niro it is for his performances in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, or, God forbid, 21st century comedies like Showtime or Analyze This. It's simply amazing that the Holy Trinity of modern American actors- Brando, Pacino, and De Niro, in that order- all were stars in the first two Godfather pictures, and the first two's careers are still highlighted by it.<br/><br/>However, I do not find this film to be on the exact same level as the original for a variety of reasons. Make no mistake, this is an outstanding film in its own right, the best sequel ever, and the praise I could give it is very similar to the praise I give The Godfather for it's consistent brilliance and masterful direction. Never before have I seen a pair of films that are so beautifully orchestrated. But unlike its predecessor this movie has a couple flaws.<br/><br/>The biggest one is with the Vito Corleone section. In the book, this part is detailed from Vito's birth right up to the events in the Godfather. However, here it only goes to about a Roosevelt administration away from the start of the events detailed in The Godfather. For someone who has only watched the movies this is a huge chunk of backstory that is missing. While Coppola chose to focus on the Don Fanucci part of Vito's epic tale, there is so much more of this brilliant story that is left untold. If an entire movie was centered around this, then the pace this story takes would be perfect. But this is but a part of The Godfather: Part II. You cannot tell two epics in one movie, and there is simply not enough time at this pace to cap off the story satisfyingly. The current model speaks nothing of the war that brought Don Corleone to power. <br/><br/>Not only that, but literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON in this tale is Italian and speaks Italian. I understand how large Little Italy was at this time but are you telling me that Vito in his time does not meet one pure American? Is his life that secluded? Once again, I understand the message that Coppola is getting across just fine, the sense of unity and family the Italians have, much like the first one, but it's done less believably here. It's also a bit harder to relate to Italian dialect.<br/><br/>The majority of my complaints lie on the Vito tale. The tale involving Michael Corleone is absolutely compelling. Emphasize that as much as possible. It's arguably more thought-provoking than its predecessor, and I would say it is more chilling, with a few parts that will absolutely make your jaw drop. That's one thing about the original, it did not have too many of those moments, but this movie has them in abundance. And not to mention Al Pacino makes these scenes come alive, he is just so fearsome and intimidating when provoked. However, surprisingly, many important plot mechanics of this movie are things you might not pick up your first time through. The major plot dynamic of the original was the transition between Vito Corleone as the Don of the Corleone family to Michael Corleone. In this movie the major mechanic is Michael's relationship with Fredo. It is this that represents the film's greatest intellectual stimulation and chill. Especially the ending, which is among the most haunting and memorable scenes you shall ever see, up there with the original's baptism. It has a bit more closure than that of its predecessor. Still, when I think of The Godfather, I think of Marlon Brando rasping out memorable lines, of Don Barzini falling down the steps, of Michael Corleone shooting Virgil Solozzo in a restaurant. It is only after this that I remember the famous aspects of The Godfather: Part II. The most likely reason for this is that it is a sequel, and we always remember what we saw first. Still, something about this movie is not quite as memorable. It lacks that extra something that made The Godfather so unique. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It certainly has better cinematography than the original, some of the best I've seen. But it is less than it's original: just barely, but still less. Somehow the plot is just not as large or alive, the scenes not as enjoyable. Don't take this out of context: this movie still has the magic. It has moral considerations and character depth just like the original, this time mostly about the damnation of Michael. Do not let comparisons distract you from the spectacle. 9.4.<br/><br/>""If one thing in life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anybody."""

","I really enjoyed watching Part II, but I would not say it was as good or better than Part I. In Part I, there is the story of the descent of Michael into the ""family business"". Part II is more like a good mafia story without much more. Only at the end, does Michael see the consequences of his choices but is so deeply trapped that he no longer cares. I liked the ending of the first story, leaving us only to imagine Michael's future. I was also much more confused by the Hyman conspiracy plot. On the plus side, I appreciated the flashbacks much more. It was a great insight into the man that was to become Don Corleone. I wonder how great the movie would have been if they merely expanded on that storyline."
"brandon_j_snider","7","3","10","12 July 2004"," Bloated, overrated uneven nonsense
","I used to think this film was great, but then I grew up. Greater sophistication means greater appreciation for the majestic perfection of the original. Unfortunately, it also means the glaring faults of this flick are all the more obvious with each viewing. This film contrasts the rising nationwide fame and influence of Michael Corleone, a more cold-blooded version of his brilliant father Don Vito, with the early life of Don Vito and the beginnings of the Corleone crime family. Problem is, even though Robert De Niro's portrayal of Vito is brilliant, to be honest, we don't care. The current situation in late 1950's Las Vegas is more interesting and faster paced, making the retro turn-of-the-century scenes anti-climactic and an unwelcome break in the real action. More flaws abound. An assassination attempt against Michael is blamed on two different parties at once, and we are left wondering which one Michael really thinks betrayed him. When Michael finally tells Fredo, we are left wondering if he's telling the truth, when I think we're supposed to be fully aware at that point. Michael always knows a lot more than we do, and that's a problem. Hyman Roth could have been a great movie villain, but nothing he does or says in this movie makes any real sense. Again, his motives are murky, and he knows more than we do. Is he motivated by revenge for Michael's killing of Moe Greene? or by greed? we're never sure. His health is so bad, we might believe he should retire, but why he doesn't is left unclear. There are several major choices made by characters in this movie that I didn't buy. One by Michael, one by Fredo, one by Kay. Of them all, I'm most inclined to buy Fredo's, but even then, the flick doesn't explain it properly. At the end of this flick, as a result of Michael's choice, Connie should have a very emotional reaction, similar to her final scene in the first film, but Coppola, inexplicably and unfairly, robs her of that. The film ends before we can see it. I think there was a constant tug-of-war between Coppola and Puzo that resulted in these issues. The first flick was a direct adaptation of the book, but there was no book this time around. The purpose of this flick, which it accomplishes to a certain degree, is to show Don Vito building a family and a life in America, and his cold-blooded heir Michael destroying it. If the plot threads had made more sense, this could have been a great film."

The scenes between Michael and Kay drag the movie to a halt. The storyline between Michael and brother Fredo plays out in an unbelievable way. Despite all the famous lines, the scenes don't ring true. Michael hates Fredo inside at the ball but wants to save him minutes later on the street. Only to hate him again when they get home. And they constantly refer to Marlon Brando. They must say ""Papa"" or ""Pop"" 40 times. Constantly reminding the audience that the first movie was better is not a good move. When I was a kid I wanted ""The Towering Inferno"" to win Best Picture because I thought it was a better movie. I still do. ""Chinatown"" should have won that year.

"nf-22226","7","1","2","13 April 2019"," Not the best of the trilogy
","This movie, coming after the first, is a change of pace. The micheal segments of the film are more politcal, strategic, and focused on the sematics of the mafia than the previous film, and because of this it loses its charm from the last film. Aswell as this, because of how uncaring and heartless micheal is, its hard to attach to him as a character, the character isnt interesting enough in other ways to be likeable to me. the main aspect which saves the film is the vito corleone flashbacks, these segments are great insight into vitos past, with great acting from robert de niro, honestly if this was the main part of the film, this would easily be better than pt 1. The ending atleast is nicely thought provoking, and makes you wonder what happened to micheal, but the rest of the micheal segments arent amazing. Pt 1 be better indeed"

"MovieManChuck","10","1","2","29 July 2018"," The best movie sequel of all time.
","4/4 ESSENTIAL<br/><br/>In typical follow-up movies, there is a certain element from the original that ages, corrodes, or just evaporates. After watching The Godfather, one of the best movies ever made, I found it hard to believe that Part II would improve upon its predecessor despite the critical acclaim. However, The Godfather Part II is truly a phenomenal movie (just as good if not better than the original), and in addition to continuing the story, it compliments The Godfather perfectly.<br/><br/>If The Godfather was taught you to respect the Corleone family's power, then The Godfather Part II gives a broader scope to that power. It alternates the journeys of a younger Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This is to chronicle the rise and fall of the Corleone family. Vito rose to prominence through gaining the favor of the people, and liberating them from Don Fanucci. Michael operates out of self-interest, which causes chaos within the family, and ultimately burns bridges. By the end of the movie, you know full well that the Corleone family dynasty is crumbling, they won't even be legit too much longer. The Corleones are like the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>This movie also features two amazing lead actors. De Niro and Pacino both gave bold performances which both influenced the flow of the movie, and the perception of reality. It was possible to capture the wisdom and of Vito, and the greed of Michael in a way that truly sticks with you. This was also in part to a very well conceived soundtrack, great location shots alive with colors, a very intricate screenplay, and Coppola, a great director who knows how to conduct beautiful cinema.<br/><br/>If there is any statement that The Godfather Part II successfully makes, its that the complexity of the Corleones could not be realized with only one feature film. This movie casts new light on the family you've come to love, and the portrayal gives the movie a darker tone. The Godfather Part II is a winner in all categories: entertaining, brilliant, deep, it flawlessly parallels two stories, and it's brutally realistic in it's demonstration of power."
"brandinscottlindsey","9","1","2","23 June 2018"," A Second Serving of Greatness
","The Godfather: Part II is just as good as the original. Alternating between the current story of Michael Corleone and his crime enterprise and the roots of the family business, a young Vito Corleone in Italy, the audience is treated to a second-helping of an already fantastic story. Viewers get to see more history behind the beloved characters, while at the same time, the story continues to develop. Michael continues to expand the Corleone family business while faced with betrayal, inner-family conflict, and legal trouble.<br/><br/>The Godfather II continues the themes portrayed in the first film in the series. Loyalty, devotion to family, and defending the down-trodden remain essential to the story and characters, and as before, these features are displayed against a backdrop of vigilantism. There is a duality with helping those in need and putting your family first, while at the same time, using evil or illegal methods against others. The Godfather II walks the line between these opposing ideals perfectly.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoyed the first film will most likely enjoy the second just as much. It is simply more of a good thing. The running time may be long for some viewers, but the movie is good enough that you'll barely notice."

","The Godfather II not only surpasses his predecessor in cinematographic quality, but it becomes the best film of this trilogy. It's just amazing how a story is so well managed in a movie and see the evolution of the characters from the first film. In addition, the parallel between the story of Michael and the young Vio Corleone further reinforces the characters and their purpose in history. Michael is now a worthy successor to his father and is definitely the godfather while showing the network of betrayal and mistrust he is subject to and the brilliant way in which he overcomes the obstacles and gets his purpose.<br/><br/>The film has few details as part of a brilliant subtext to make us understand better, and immerse ourselves in the complexity of its history. The direction is magnificent at all levels, demanding more from the actors and pleasing the audience. Photography and visual complements, as well as lighting, are totally adequate, giving the film an excellent atmosphere that blends perfectly with the story. No doubt, Francis Ford Coppola made us an offer we could not refuse."

","I think Godfather 2 was one of the greatest sequels Hollywood ever made and I thought they could never top the original. there are no spoilers here because I'm not going to mention anything about what went on in the sequel, just that it was great, and the actor that played young Vito was super, direction was like no other film I've ever seen, a lot of gangster movies were made but this was no ordinary gangster movie, absolutely the best mob movie ever made. In this film, there was no need for any suspension of disbelieve because it was so real, I really believe that's the way it actually happened."

","This is one of those rare movies that as a sequel that actually makes since and that's simply good. It's outstanding to have both the original and sequel to be brilliant.

Which is a job well done."
"Frosst","10","1","2","23 January 2017"," And so the saga continues
","Having written a review for The Godfather it feels, when thinking about it, like a travesty not to write a review for the sequel; The Godfather Part II. Especially after having written my first review such a long time ago, however I have to say that I'm not that much into writing reviews hence the reason I've only written one. But I've decided I will give it a fair shot although I'm wondering how many people will even read it.<br/><br/>It should of course go without saying that this isn't as much of a sequel as it is a continuation of the first film, calling it a sequel is to underestimate the importance of this film. As masterfully done as the first one it's for me extremely difficult to actually pick one over the other, the only reason I have The Godfather higher than Part II is not because it's better but because of it being the beginning of the journey, the very introduction to this world, if you'll call it that. (Brando's magnificent performance may also have something to do with this) In The Godfather Part 2 Michael Corleone has, as we all know, become the new Don and the film which takes place in the 50's sees Michael becoming corrupt with greed and power. He pretty much becomes just like his father, it's a transformation so interestingly compelling and grandeur that one can't stop but feel sorry for him in some ways. Meanwhile the story of Vito Corleone from childhood to adulthood is chronicled through the use of flashbacks. We see him arrive to America from Sicily, only a child, and how he creates his Mafia empire. The actor portraying him is of course Robert De Niro whose performance is electrifying. These flashbacks are spoken in Italian which I found to be interesting. But while De Niro captures the mannerisms of Don Vito Corleone it's Al Pacino who gives the best performance as Michael Corleone. He's even better here than in the first film, of course this time Marlon Brando wasn't around who could overshadow everyone, and it's only because of his fantastic performance that you're able to feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>Al Pacino was very good in the first film but here he's even greater. The supporting cast is great too; the ever wonderful Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and of course the late John Cazale. The acting is just as great as in the first film. Francis Ford Coppolas directing is amazing as is the cinematography. <br/><br/>There is really nothing more to be said about this masterpiece. I know I'm late with this review, but being someone who never really wrote reviews this is my second but not last one.<br/><br/>And fitting that it should be about my second favorite film and the second greatest in Cinema..."
"phillipfawcett-92318","10","1","2","5 December 2016"," *** Top 10 ***
","Phillip Fawcett says it is hard to choose which single Godfather movie should go into the top 10 at the expense of the others. The saga really needs to be taken as a whole - even the 3rd installment, generally seen as the weakest, rounds the epic story off in poetic fashion - and as such would go into my personal top 10 of all-time movies as a trilogy.<br/><br/>That said, I single out Godfather II if I must. This is the most self-contained in theme and form, tracking the origins of the Corleone dynasty and the rise to crime of Michael Corleone. It is the ultimate portrayal of a man allowing himself to fall to the corruptions of power , and lose his morality to murderous evil. He is both victim of fate, of forces which seemed to compel him into this monstrous world, and a willful sinner.<br/><br/>The final scene, as he sits alone in his spacious grounds reflecting on his life, encapsulates the true theme of this tale: not 'the mafia', not 'murder', not 'American-Italian culture', but that of a human being losing his soul."

It provides an amazing experience with story telling point of view but also from character actions that constantly show us how they evolved and became one of the greatest and most dangerous people. Absolutely most memorable scene is when Vito (De Niro) is following Don Fanucci on top of the buildings and jumping from one to another and then finally get to his home and gets a gun goes in hall to wait for him and after he arrived it was absolutely magnificent scene with his killing. Amazing story told by Coppola with fights in family outside family and just beautiful performances by our two men in leading chair.

"ivo-cobra8","10","1","2","17 October 2015"," A classic Epic Masterpiece it's one of the most best sequels of all time
","The Godfather Part II (1974) is one of the best sequel's out there! Following the story right from the first film! I love this film as much a is love the first one. Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II presents two parallel story lines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone did do a strong lead and a wonderful perfect job he acted in this film superb and strong. Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone did a brilliant performance I have ever saw. He played an Italian immigrate superb and brilliant, there isn't any connection that he is American at all, his ascent is gone. It is like he was born an Italian by birth.<br/><br/>I love this film Because you get both sides of the story, because you're able to see where De Niro's coming from, just seeing those guys in the movie. Again, I think there's something that, when a sequel can hit it right, to keep pushing, instead of, ""Let's capitalize on what we did the first time."" And for me, maybe one the first movies where I felt like, ""Ooh, we're getting a backstory."" That, to me, was really thrilling. And just to see those guys, that young and hungry. That's it, that is the right thing there. Coppola is at the top of his form in both films.Simply as a story, the Michael scenes in ""The Godfather: Part II"" engage our emotions. I admire the way Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he handles delicate decisions involving Hyman Roth (Strasberg), the boss of Miami; Fredo (Cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of Sonny (James Caan). Who has done what? Why? Michael floats various narratives past various principals, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess; he has to envision the moves without seeing them.<br/><br/>But finally it is all about Michael. Even the attack on the night of his son's first communion party is on his bedroom, not our bedroom. His wife, Kay (Keaton), leaves him, and his focus does not waver: He will keep his son. Tom Hagen (Duvall), the most trusted confidant of father and son, considered a brother, is finally even suspected. In Michael's life, paranoia is a useful defense mechanism.Coppola shows Michael breaking down under the pressure. We remember that he was once a proud war hero, a successful college student, building a legitimate lifestyle. But on their wedding day, Kay first began to fully realize what an all-controlling cocoon the Corleone clan was. There would always be things she could not be told about, could not be trusted with. Finally Michael has no one to tell or trust except his elderly mother (Morgana King). Michael's desperation in that intense conversation explains everything about the film's final shot.<br/><br/>The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel crime dramas.<br/><br/>The most memorable best epic Francis Ford Coppola's classic masterpiece sequel ever, the film stunned everything for brilliance to superb acting.

","This, perhaps the greatest sequel ever, tells the parallel stories of Michael's struggles as the new Godfather and the rise of the legendary Vito Corleone. The presentation of Vito's story is particularly impressive, with DeNiro in a fine performance. Michael's story tends to bog down at times but never fails to be compelling. Pacino is terrific, as are Duvall, Cazale, and Strasberg. The cinematography is beautiful and Rota builds on his memorable score from the first film. Coppola pushes all the right buttons, letting the stories unfold majestically. Having made the two Godfather films by age 35, the talented director had nowhere to go but down."

"mukherjeesubham93","10","1","2","24 May 2015"," excellence part 2
","The godfather part 2 which acts as both a sequel as well as prequel to the 1972 classic, had the same men who had helped that motion picture become what it was....to say the least. But easier said than done, this time the job was tougher, because a sequel or prequel or succeeding film in this case, comes with a certain baggage of expectations, but Coppola had ended the godfather pretty cleverly, now we can't obviously assume that he was planning a sequel because sequels were not a common thing back then....but still Mario puzo and Coppola pack in enough punch to make this 1974 film not only the best follow up ever made but also arguably make one of the most ambitious, innovative and risky film ever undertaken a classic....just like the first one. this film continues right from where the first one ended, right from there, you just don't feel you have ever left the corleones, not for once, it was that effortless....but the masterstroke in this one was the prequel track where we see how don Vito became don Vito in 1930s new york....so the film actually beautifully highlights how Michael and Vito expanded the corleone empire.... Coppola once again manages to make some scenes memorable, which haunt you long after you've left the movie and the cinematography and musical score is also very good. Al pacino plays Michael corleone with outstanding aplomb and maturity. The first movie not only gifted him super stardom overnight but also matured him as an actor. I personally consider this to be the best performance not to get an Oscar. Another time he let's his eyes do the talking and silences speak. Just watch out for a few scenes towards the end...it will surely send a shiver down your spine and give you goosebumps. Robert De niro plays the young don Vito corleone in the parallel track of the movie, almost all his dialouges being in Italian. He had large shoes to fill because a certain Marlon Brando played the same character in the previous one and got an Oscar. But De niro, an icon now but relatively unknown that time, completely nailed the role. Right from the way he speaks to the way he walks and his mannerisms, he is excellent. Not for once you feel he is not Vito's younger self and that is quite a task. The academy jury also thought so, making don Vito the only character in movie history to be awarded Oscar twice. Talia share, Diane Keaton, Robert duvall are all excellent.the only probable issue which people have with this movie is the fact it is three and a half hours long and also some of the scenes could well have been left out. But if you loved the first one, there is no reason you won't love this one. It is not only godfather part 2, it is excellence part 2 also."
"musautsho","10","1","2","5 March 2015"," Nice Movie
","Robert De Niro became the only actor to win and Oscar for taking over another actor's Oscar-winning performance. He was not, however, the first or last such actor to be nominated for this. Gérard Depardieu was nominated for Best Actor in Cyrano DE Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for Jose Ferrer. Like Brando, Ferrer had played his role in English. Like DeNiro, Depardieu played the role in the character's native language; in this case French. Years later, Jeff Bridges would be nominated for his performance in True Grit (1969). John Wayne had won his only Oscar for his performance in the original film, which also featured Robert Duva."
"bryankmc","10","1","2","25 February 2015"," Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under ""sprawl""
","The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch- blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.<br/><br/>Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see."

","This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other .

"KingCritic","10","1","2","26 December 2014"," KIng Coppolla hits a home run again!
","People say that The Godfather: Part II is one of the greatest hits in history.And I cannot disagree!It hits exactly what I was looking for in a Godfather sequel.It puts all the other godfather movies to shame,and hits all the marks from the previous movie spot on.The reason I gave it a 9 of 10 was because it went a over the line a couple times with some things, and is a tad bit lengthy but still enjoyable.Although it is not part of the book and just a long extension of it but still incredibly entertaining.I doubt the only other legitimate criticsm is that this movie is freaking awesome!It always keeps the ball rolling and never backtracks you,and always keeps you up and going with famous scenes and unforgettable one liners.This movie was a launching pad for many famous modern day actors to make their mark.For 1970 this was immensely un cheesy and one of my very favorite movies.I highly suggest watching this movie if you have 4 hours of your time to sit back and watch a masterpiece.I suggest to watch the first one just to catch up.I have never seen a better sequel since The Winter Soldier.The only way you cannot enjoy this movie if you're only in to modern day crap!"
"disinterested_spectator","9","1","2","23 December 2014"," The Traitor in the Family Is Who?
","Although this is a great movie, it is logically flawed, and in such a way that once grasped, it is impossible to ignore. Early in the movie, Michael walks into his bedroom, where Kay is sleeping. She wakes up and asks him why the drapes are open. He looks around at the open drapes, apparently sees something outside, and drops to the floor as machine gun bullets riddle the bedroom. The compound is sealed off, and Michael gives orders that the gunmen be taken alive, but they are found shot dead shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Michael tells Tom Hagen that there is a traitor in the family, and so he is turning power over to him while he, Michael, disappears for a while. Though Tom is only an adopted brother (and not Sicilian), and though Fredo is Michael's older brother, yet he does not turn temporary control over to Fredo because ""he is weak and stupid."" So far, so good.<br/><br/>But Fredo turns out to be the traitor in the family. Does that mean he is the one who opened the drapes in the bedroom while Kay was sleeping? And does that also mean that Fredo was the one who executed the two hit men before they could talk? If he did all that, I am ready to believe that he was the one who set up his father Vito for the hit in the first ""Godfather"" movie. But given his character, we cannot believe Fredo did any of these things.<br/><br/>But in that case, what was it that Fredo did that was so bad? Fredo says that Johnny Ola enlisted his aid because Michael was being tough in the negotiations about Cuba. So what does that mean, that occasionally Fredo was supposed to say to Michael, ""Don't you think you're being a little tough in the negotiations""? For that he deserves death?<br/><br/>Furthermore, the person who did open the curtains and executed the hit men is the real traitor in the family. There are plenty on the compound who might have done that, and that person, whoever he is, is still a threat to Michael. But Michael seems to be oblivious to this obvious implication."
"clouds88","9","1","2","20 December 2014"," The Epic part 2
","As stated in my review of Godfather 1 , There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.<br/><br/>Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.<br/><br/>The first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the Don, shows Michael taking over his father's place. Subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old Don. The charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man.<br/><br/>The movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world America wherein begins our former godfather's story. The story of young Vito Corleone runs parallel to the present day Don. The story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present.<br/><br/>In one scene, the relationship with present Don and his kid is intercepted by the young Vito Corleone, a young and handsome R. De Niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men.<br/><br/>Attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this.<br/><br/>There are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of Robert De Niro and long for him to come back on screen.<br/><br/>As the movie unfolds, we see how the Don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. In one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-à-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families.<br/><br/>While Don Vito was as much a family man as he was a Godfather, his son, Michael fails to keep his family together. Like the icy cold winter snow, the relationship between the husband and wife is harsh and dry. True to his words, the ""Times were changing "".<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by De Niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son.<br/><br/>The love for his wife and kids in Niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in Michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie.<br/><br/>The story ends similar to the first movie, where all the Don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not.<br/><br/>Climax of movie sums up the life of Michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father."
"bailey33","10","1","2","15 September 2014"," Top 5 greatest movie of all time.
","The Godfather Part II is one of the top 5 greatest films ever created winning 26 awards and 16 other nominations. This timeless film is one of the best sequels, which equals, if not, surpasses the original film. Part two continues the story of the mafia family, the Corleone's. Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino has come into his own as the new Godfather with the passing of his father Vito Corleone at the end of part one. Marlon Brando played Vito Corleone, in his older years, portrayed in part one. In this film Robert De Niro plays the younger version, shown through flashbacks, of Vito. The beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. The flashbacks give the audience the full back-story of how young Vito became the Godfather and how the Corleone family became one of the most influential and feared mafia families in America.<br/><br/>Unlike, the film Goodfellas, also starring De Niro, a great film in it's own right, this film shows how Michael uses calculated decisions in ""business"" to handle conflict. In Goodfellas the main characters tend to ""fly from the hip"" and the theme is based more on the friendship of the main characters and how corruption tears their friendship apart. Part II of the Godfather's theme is about a young man that never wanted to be apart of the family ""business"" but out of necessity he was thrust into being the Godfather. Michael struggles in this film, because I think he's ultimate goal is to make the family legitimate. The character Michael is very intelligent and sinister; he will do anything to keep his family safe. This makes Michael very relatable to the audience, as most men have that same desire to provide and protect their family. Pacino's portrayal of Michael is nothing less than brilliant. <br/><br/>Throughout the film you have flashbacks of young Vito that correspond with the same conflicts facing Michael in current time that provide a highly specialized mood. Coppola's genius becomes apparent, as the audience is privy to this cycle of corruption and danger that this lifestyle brings. What makes this so compelling is how the same conflicts arise, but are handled differently due to the changes in society. The way Coppola cuts the scenes in to the flashbacks are flawless and makes the story flow in a very unique way. <br/><br/>The film uses an objective camera placement throughout much of the film. The use of this technique, in my opinion, was used to make the audience feel as if they were watching the plot unfold as a spectator, because the audience isn't a member of the Corleone family. The respect and secrecy of the family business requires Michael to keep things within the family. The scene when Michael tells his older brother Fredo, to never speak outside the family again reinforces this key element to the plot. The cinematographer used an array of angles, but the most significant angles come from the mid-to extreme close-up shots of Michal and Vito. The audience can see and almost feel the emotion in the faces of these two characters. In fact, most of the flashback scenes end and begin with a mid-to extreme close-up of these two characters. <br/><br/>Wardrobe and music in this film must be mentioned as well, as both won Oscars in their respective categories. The costume design used in this film was excellent and portrayed a very realistic sense of the time period being told. Each character had a specific wardrobe that fit the year, scene, and the overall plot seamlessly. The music in the film is extraordinary as well, providing chilling and exciting effect in key moments throughout the film. The score of this film rates very high amongst other films. The theme of family, the need to provide and keep them safe, and the desire to elevate your status is relatable to a vast audience; this is why this film is timeless."
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","2","30 August 2014"," ""The Godfather Part II"", Is The Prime Example Of How Sequels Should Be Made.
","Mario Puzo's epic ""The Godfather"" novel, has gone on to set high standards in both literature and cinema. Considering how the first one had managed to encapsulate so very well it's ""Welcome to the Family"" ideology. It gives the sequel a chance to now stand on its own two feet, without the necessities of an origin story.<br/><br/>Well it actually turns out we need those origin chapters more than ever. We are shown the past of how Vito Corleone, became the Don, in contrast of his son Micheal (Al Pacino). Usually watching any flashback sequence in a movie feels so hard for me to get into, it happens so abruptly it feels less like an aid to the story but more of a throw in. Francis Ford Coppola's execution is genius, because watching Vito's upbringing is shown and depicted perfectly with the ""Sepia"" feel, murky streets of little Italy and a Oscar winning performance from a then unknown Robert De Niro. Seeing this perfectly executed with Michael's story in comparison, it just instantly draws us in so well there's not many other films that do it this well.<br/><br/>Following the ""current events"" of the movie. Michael is slowly growing distant from the family, and ultimately paranoia is settling in without help from the older, weaker brother Fredo (A truly incredible performance from the late John Cazale). By the time things escalate towards the end of the film, the family is ultimately destroyed. Michael has officially isolated himself from both his own family and the other families, leaving him quiet and reminiscing. It is here we ask: ""Do we see Micheal as a man with a blood lust, or a tragic soul""? Your choice. ""The Godfather Part II"" is a stunning sequel, feeling more like a 7 hour long epic rather than a trilogy. But if you loved the first movie, I would not be hesitant to watch this one. It is one of Coppola's finest pieces of writing and cinematography .<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The American dream is continuously turned on its head, in this more than perfect sequel. 10/10."
"rajatdahiyax","10","1","2","21 August 2014"," A brilliant Sequel!!!!!!!
","Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption."
"Hotwok2013","Null","1","2","7 August 2014"," The greatest movie sequel ever made.
","""The Godfather Part 2"" is that rarest of movies in that it surpasses a really brilliant first movie. Shown in flashbacks it shows the rise of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) in New York City & alternates forward to his son Michael (Al Pacino) who eventually succeeds him as head of the Corleone mafia family. De Niro & Pacino are two of the greatest movie actors of all time but I have to say that, to my mind, De Niro is just fantastic in his role. Great too is Robert Duvall as family lawyer & counsellor Tom Hagen. John Cazale who plays Michael's brother Fredo is also excellent. He had the misfortune to die of cancer at only 42 years of age but the good luck to appear in only five 1970's movies all of which are regarded as classics. For anyone who has never seen this movie do so at the first opportunity because there is no doubt it is one of the greatest, (some say THE greatest), movie ever made. As a piece of celluloid storytelling it remains unsurpassed."
"jbirks106","9","1","2","27 July 2014"," Great acting but distracting structure
","The original ""Godfather"" created the template for every mob movie thereafter. Gangsters previously were either celebrated or loathed, but never well understood. Then ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" released five years earlier, attempted to humanize criminals by showing not only the spectacular bank heists and subsequent car chases, but also the mundane, banal and tragic nature of such a lifestyle. But B&C weren't Mafiosi. ""Godfather"" portrayed the Mafia as a unique and fascinating subset of society. Along with the requisite violence, we see the gangsters with their families, at weddings and christenings, or planning a multiple murder over takeout Chinese. Most of all, it is a portrait of Michael Corleone, the war hero and prodigal son, who returns to the fold and ends up running the show.<br/><br/>In ""Godfather II"" Michael is running much more than a crime family. He's a big shot whose son's first communion is celebrated by senators and other luminaries. As Hyman Roth famously tells him, ""Michael, we're bigger than US Steel."" But his personal life is disintegrating. Michael has promised Kay, his wife, that he's ""going legitimate"" but it's clearly not working, and we wonder about the sincerity of the promise. The family narrowly escapes a hit following the communion ceremony, initiating a series of retributions that we know will not stop. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, a series of flashbacks to Sicily show Vito, the paterfamilias, as a young boy who himself survives an assassination attempt (his mother is not so lucky), sails to America and sets himself up as a street hood who through guile and guts takes over the neighborhood rackets. He is respected and feared, but he's not without compassion. When his wife tells him of a friend who's having trouble keeping her apartment, Vito intervenes on her behalf. He didn't have to do it, and there's really nothing in it for him.<br/><br/>This is the central contrast in the film. Vito is undoubtedly a criminal who'll kill anyone in his way, but there's a humanity behind his calculations. Michael, who disdains his criminal family at the beginning of ""Godfather I"" and shows a naïve, even playful side, has lost his humanity by the end of that picture, and that hardness only deepens in ""Godfather II"". The only glimpse we see of that earlier man occurs in a scene with his mother, in which he asks how his father kept the family together. It's a rare example of self-doubt in an otherwise scheming, manipulative and deeply cynical personality. When he learns that his weak older brother, Fredo, helped set up the botched Lake Tahoe hit, he permits him to live, but only while their mother lives. By the end of the movie Michael has lost his family (his natural one), and any remnant of human feeling.<br/><br/>The structure of ""Godfather II"" is problematic for me. The repeated flashbacks to the young Vito, while engaging, interrupt the flow of the film. That this is a strategic error on Coppolla's part was demonstrated when one of the networks aired a miniseries, ""The Godfather Saga"" a few years after the sequel. It took a strictly chronological approach: beginning with scenes of young Vito in Sicily from ""Godfather II"" and then continuing with ""Godfather I"". (Some scenes were edited or omitted entirely, in conformance with network TV standards, while others not appearing in the films were included.) This merging of narratives conveyed all the power of both movies without the distracting flashback device to form a much more coherent whole. <br/><br/>What to say about the cast of ""Godfather II""? It is uniformly excellent. DeNiro's Vito is pitch-perfect. Keaton's performance as Kay is striking in its nuanced disaffection as she grows to realize that her husband has no inclination to go straight. Dominic Chianese gives a strong performance as Johnny Ola, a quarter-century ahead of Junior Soprano. Michael V. Gazzo, as the harried, doomed Frankie Pentangeli, won a supporting-actor nod, and his might be the best performance of the film. Talia Shire, as sister Connie, shines as the floozy who -- like Michael in the first film -- finally returns to the fold.<br/><br/>But it's Pacino and Cazale who really carry this picture. Theirs is a complex, combustible relationship: the strong, ruthless younger brother and the skittish, increasingly resentful older brother share two memorable, but radically different, scenes. In the first, Fredo has just arrived in Havana with Roth's $2 million. They repair to a street cafe for daiquiris as Michael pretends to confide in Fredo -- in fact everything he says is a lie. But Fredo is appreciative of the confidence and regrets that the two never spoke so intimately before. Later, after Fredo stupidly reveals to Michael his association with Roth and Ola, Michael severs their relationship in the harshest terms. Fredo is practically recumbent in his chair, even as he insists that ""I'm smart! Not stupid like everybody says. I want respect!"" But he's not smart: he's a dead man, and everybody knows it but him. Cazale plays the pathos for all it's worth. <br/><br/>The film ends with yet another flashback. It's Christmas, and the brothers have planned a welcome-home for the Don (never seen). Michael announces that he's joining the Army, winning congratulations from Fredo, bewilderment from Tom, and scorn from Sonny. This is evidently Michael's reverie, perhaps driven by the guilt of killing Fredo and his brutal treatment of Kay. Flash to present: Michael is seated outside his Tahoe estate, his only companions the fallen leaves whipping around his feet.<br/><br/>It's a real tour de force, this movie. It is flawed in its conception but brilliant in its execution. I can see why many people think it's the best sequel ever, even better than the original. I just can't take it that far. It may be the best sequel, but it nonetheless suffers by comparison to its predecessor."

"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","12 May 2009"," I didn't think it was possible. I honestly didn't think it was possible.
","""The Godfather"" (1972) was, and still is, in my eyes as well as the eyes of most people, one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and without any doubts, the one that featured the quintessential cast for a mafia movie. It took me a long time to getting around to it, but at last a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to see director Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of the trilogy. And during that long span of time, I had heard a lot about ""The Godfather: Part II"" and how some have even built up the nerve to call it better than the original. I doubted it would even come close, even if it was great. Boy, was I wrong. ""The Godfather"" (1972) is still great and a true masterpiece, but much to my surprise and delight, Part II is even better. That's what I call a feat.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason why ""The Godfather: Part II"" matches and overpowers the original is because—at least to me—that it is really not a sequel, but rather a continuation of the first film, which was really just a warm-up for what was to follow. The first film ended with Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone dying and his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) turning from the weak little college kid who wanted nothing to do with his family, turning out to become the exact image of his father. And in Part II, we still have him as the image of his fatheronly worse. While Don Vito was ruthless, he was also sympathetic and likable. The new Michael Corleone, by contrast, is one of the most bone-chilling villains ever seen. Part II follows his endeavors as he carries on in his father's name and mixed up with this continuation is a flashback sequence. You see, Part II is both a continuation and a prequel to the original. Inter-spliced with the sequel footage is a second story detailing the past of Vito Corleone, now played by a young Robert De Niro in an Oscar-winning performance as the dumb-witted boy from Sicily who became one of the most powerful mobsters alive.<br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part II"", like its predecessor, is a legendary film for many reasons. Apart from being one of the most important and entertaining films ever made, it also set new standards and records that have yet to be matched. It because the first sequel to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it started the now-common formula of using roman numerals for sequel titles, it has the irony where it, as well as the original, have an Academy Award win for two different actors playing the same characters (Marlon Brando as an old Vito Corleone in the original and Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone in Part II), Michael Corleone is one of the more frightening villains ever realized, and the look of violence and horror of a mafia world is twice as terrifying as what was seen in the first film. And of course, it marked the beginning of Robert De Niro's career.<br/><br/>The irony of the first ""The Godfather"" (1972) was how Michael Corleone was transformed from a ""nice college boy"" to quote his brother into a vicious crime lord who at the end of the first film authorizes the assassinations of all of his competitors without flicking an eyelash. And the irony of ""The Godfather: Part II"" is not only is he now worse than his father ever was, but Michael Corleone is still driving himself down a road to his own relentless destruction and the moral destruction of those around him. His son, his wife, his sister, brother, brother-in-law, and close friends are both brought closer to him and alienated from him at the same time. Alienated because they fear him. Brought closer because they know better than to run away.<br/><br/>In regards to the film's second story, the prequel about Vito Corleone, it's not only brilliant, but necessary and phenomenal. The prequel is one of the few major chapters from Mario Puzo's incredible book that could not be fitted into the original film. That's alright, because to me, the flashback was the only slow and unnecessary part that Puzo wrote. But here, in this film, in this continuation, it not only fits and correlates, but belongs. Again, it's to show how Michael Corleone is more vicious, more dangerous, more terrible than his father, who was at one time brutal and devilish. There was originally a scene that called for Marlon Brando to return as an old Vito Corleone, but I think the magic of this prequel footage would have been lost if it had, for we then compare the Brando performance from the original, the De Niro performance from the sequel, see how they blend perfectly together, and our imaginations become our eyes and ears.<br/><br/>In regards to the film's music score, Nino Rota scores even higher than he did with his soundtrack for the first film. One noticeable thing is how the original theme score was sad and almost depressing, but the music for Part II is even more sad and even more depressing, for it's really a tragic story. Rota knew what Coppola and Puzo were trying to show with their second film and he was dead-on with his somber, almost ironic musical score.<br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part II"" also boasts a great deal of truly shocking moments that at times makes you jump in your seat and at other times, hang your jaws in awe, in a bitter disbelief to accept what has happened and the latter most certainly comes about in the final shots. And that ultimately is the power of Coppola's film and that is why it is considered so terrific, even to the point of surpassing its superb predecessor. I honestly didn't think it was possible for Part II to be better than the original, but it is. This is a compliment of the highest order."
"ackstasis","9","1","2","12 March 2009"," ""Your country ain't your blood. Remember that""
","To call 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)' a sequel doesn't quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in 'The Godfather (1972).' This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he'd just been ""baptised"" into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody he's ever cared about. Michael's plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in 'The Godfather,' is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called ""American Dream"" in which Vito believes so passionately.<br/><br/>As with 'The Godfather,' Coppola's film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesn't disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacino's scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction I've ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the 'Godfather' cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>'The Godfather: Part II' is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesn't quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, 'Part II' leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. It's a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesn't seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct 'The Godfather: Part III (1990),' which charts, I believe, Michael Corleone's inevitable downfall. Hopefully I won't be disappointed."

","Why did i wrote the ""ONE""???<br/><br/>Because this is-BE READY-...THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! Does it sounds corny or clichéd? NO! And i will explain later...Enough of searching for the best movie, because The Godfather part II is the ""ONE"".<br/><br/>We can argue about for example The Shawshank redemption is the best, or citizen Kane, or The Godfather, Deer hunter, Taxi driver, Raging bull...and truly indeed they could be the ""ONE"". But for me this is truly the best, and let me tell you why!<br/><br/>First and foremost this is ACTING and DIRECTING at the highest level possible. You got Al Pacino, Robert DOE Niro, Lee Strasberg ( master of acting ), John Cazale and Michael V.Gazzo to be leaded by Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>The movie starts where ""original"" ends with congratulations to the new Godfather and then you are ""transported"" in Sicily 40 and some years in the past, where young Vito is with his mother at the funeral of his father that has been killed by the local Don. At the funeral Vito's older brother also gets killed so logical next one should be Vito, but that would never happened because Vito immigrates to New York. Meanwhile the movie shifts to Nevada where Michael ( Al Pacino ) holds the meetings between his business partners and enemies ( but hey,they don't know that )at his son's party! Then he is tried to be killed in his house, so he leaves everything to Tom's ( Robert Duvall ) hands and goes to Miami to fix this problem with his friend/enemy Hyman Roth ( Lee Strasberg ). At the end he fixes his business life and becomes even stronger as The Godfather but his private life is at rock bottom after his wife,sister,friends leaves him all alone at the top. On the other hand Vito ( Rober DOE Niro ) climbs to the top don in New York and he manages to do that and he is also respected as a person because he is man of his own words.

","Sequels to Oscar winning films normally don't type out to be that good and end up being flops. Luckily The Godfather: Part II is just as good as the original. It is a bold mix of a sequel and a prequel, showing Michael Corleane's decline in character as he leads the Corleane crime family in the late 1950s/early 1960s, and showing Vito from a poor orphan Silian boy in 1901 and rises up the ranks of the Mafia from 1917 onwards.<br/><br/>Michael Corleane had been running the family for around five years and moved them to Nevanda. Things seem to be going well, he has political influence and is gaining money from legitimate means. But they are turning times ahead, having to deal with a conflict with a Jewish Gangster, Hyman Roth, a traitor within his ranks, the FBI and a Senate committee investigation. He is suffering family problems (both crime and personal) and is around during the Cuban revolution. Vito starts the film as a 9-year-old boy and all the male members of his family have been murdered by Don Cirrio, a powerful local Mafia chief in Silicy. He see his mother beg for mercy before getting killed by Cirrio's men and flees to New York. In 1917 the Italian neighbourhood he lives was run by local gangster, Don Fanucci. He gets tired of his iron fist rule and ends up murdering the man and taking his position. With that he becomes respected in the Italian community and a leading gangster and then looks for revenge for his family.<br/><br/>This a complex, well plotted film, with many aspects of Mafia life being looked at from a board time-period. It is well written, brilliantly directed, Francis Ford Coppala at his best, and some great acting. It also has some good quotes which I think are some of the best in the series, like the 'I know it was you' bit and 'You are not a friend and your are not a brother'.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is a great example of a gangster film and I believe that it approach of a sequel/prequel influenced other films like Infernal Affairs Part II and III. This was a very worthy Oscar winning film and I think that this film is just as good as the first. I don't know how it compares to Part III because I haven't watched it, but I haven't heard good think about it."
"Cody2310","10","1","2","25 May 2008"," Breathtaking...
","I cannot begin to explain the brilliance of this film. It is without a doubt my favorite film and arguably one of the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Al Pacino gives the best performance of his career, alongside Godfather Part I, Scarface, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Scent of a Woman. Pacino shows us the dark, ruthless and powerful side of Michael Corleone that was only shown for a brief time in the Godfather and delivers it to perfection. The loss of Marlon Brando has absolutely no effect on the film because he is still there in spirit and Pacino more than makes up for the absence.<br/><br/>We are also given a glimpse of Vito Corleones early career as a Mafia figure. Robert DeNiro gives an amazing performance. Through this we are able to make the connection between Vito and Michael. We learn that Michael has, in fact, great reluctance compared to Vito in the process of living and accepting the Mafia way of life, although their motives are exactly the same: family.<br/><br/>This film is more than good acting and plot, it is epic story telling at its best. Although very different in many ways from Godfather Part I, which chronicles family, Part II we realize the entire Godfather saga is more about the epic tragedy that is Michaels life rather than the Corleones.<br/><br/>I have watched this film dozens and dozens of times and I never get bored. It is dramatic, suspenseful, emotional and clever. The script is phenomenal, the story is capturing and engaging and the acting is mind-blowing. If you have not seen this, or any of the Godfathers, WATCH THEM! (in order of course)Best ever. 10/10 would be an understatement for this film and for the Godfathers in general."
"HelloTexas11","9","1","2","5 January 2008"," the saga continues
","The first 'Godfather' film was a beautifully rendered, violent and at times even warmhearted look inside a Mafia crime family. It deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall and the rest of the cast. I think it's fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples' minds, somehow it did. It is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the first's narrative. 'The Godfather Part II' has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest American film, period. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. The 'sequel' part of the film concerns Michael Corleone's attempts to hold his family and its 'business' together after the death of Vito Corleone. Times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in Havana's casinos with the help of Hyman Roth, a former associate of his father's, and the pre-Castro, pro-business government in Cuba. The plot of 'Part II' is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really aren't, and it's hard to know who is sincere about what. The only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. Killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. Toward the end, Tom Hagen even asks Michael Corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. No, Michael says, just our enemies. But when one of those 'enemies' turns out to be his own brother, Fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the Corleone family, and not for the better. Francis Ford Coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the Corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when Michael gives the order to have Fredo murdered. The 'prequel' segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how Vito Corleone arrived in America and began to build his empire. Robert DeNiro does not so much replace Marlon Brando as offer an interpretation of Corleone as a young man. There is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived Italians, living in their own section of New York, bits of broken English beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. It's all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. Unlike the 1950's plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. Vito Corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the Corleone crime family. He kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the Black Hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. He even finds time to travel back to Sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. 'The Godfather Part II' is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. It is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. It is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasn't. In spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the Corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in 'The Godfather;' I don't think that's the case at the end of 'The Godfather Part II.'"
"jack1141994","9","1","2","8 February 2007"," A SO much better movie then its predecessor.
","The Godfather Part 2 was definitely one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is so much better than the first in the trilogy in every way, the effects, the acting, the dialogue, the setting and just everything. It is set over such a WIDE environment. It is a very long movie which might bore the young ones that like action-packed car chases/ explosions (which really p**ses me off) but it is an excellent movie for the REAL movie goers out there. Reasons it better than no.1: The special effects are way more up to scratch, the acting is so much better (it almost seems that all the actors from the previous outing have magically gained skills), and the structure is much more secure. It is a must-see movie that intelligent people will love."
"dwpeak","10","1","2","20 January 2007"," Redefines ""Sequel""
","There is no question; this is the best sequel ever made. ""The Godfather: Part II"" is also among the best films of our time. It is another dark, stunning portrait from a master director. A pitch-perfect screenplay leads the brilliant actors through a world few filmmakers can accurately show. It is a masterful companion piece to ""The Godfather (1972).""<br/><br/>This movie tells us two stories in two different times. One is about Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) criminal organization, and how he is struggling with opposition, his failing marriage, and his kids that don't understand the truth behind their father's seemingly gentle eyes. Michael is trying to buy ""legitimate businesses"" during the Cuban Revolution with the help of Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), but there may be more to the picture than either of them realize. It is also the story of Michael's adopted brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who feels he is starting to be left out of the picture. Diane Keaton as Kay is ever more strained from her murderous husband, and Connie (Talia Shire) is losing confidence in her brother. John Cazale as Michael's brother, Fredo, is beginning to get confused about what is best for his family. The movie's parallel story is about the immigration and early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), and his rise to power in the early 1900s. The struggles, the love, and the violence that dictate the future of the Don's decisions.<br/><br/>As I have already mentioned, the movie is brilliant, and so are the stories. While Michael's rise in the criminal underworld is fascinating, I found the story of the young Vito Corleone to be even more so. It is the only part of the book that Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola left out in the first one. It is done here magnificently. I still like the first one a little bit better than this one. It is very close, but I think there's a good reason: we were knocked off of our feet by ""The Godfather,"" because we did not know what was coming. It was the first time. This is the second time. Is that a negative? No, this film weaves in perfect acting by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale, and Lee Strasberg with superb storytelling, magnificent direction, beautiful cinematography, a worthy script, and and an overall great production. Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives one of the shows of his life. He steals our attention with his magnificent acting. One of his best career moves.<br/><br/>Thanks to Francis Ford Coppola, the director/co-writer/producer, who has transformed an amazing book into two movies that will remain is history forever as masterpieces. Thanks to co-writer Mario Puzo, who without his book and screen writing, there would not be this movie. Beautiful."
"kostasxrysogelos","10","1","2","10 September 2006"," The second best sequel, after ""The New Testament"".
","It's rare, almost impossible, but it can happen, and when it does, it puts a smile on our face. Yes, the ""Godfather, part II"" is better than the first one. ANd since the first part of the trilogy is probably the best American movie ever made, this one is nominated as one of the best movies ever made. Am I exaggerating? Check out my arguments please, and then make up your mind.<br/><br/>It's a long and slowly evoking film. I must say that I almost understand the people who say they're bored from it. But to the people who know a thing or two about cinematography, it's an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>The plot is great. While we see Pacino's life sinking into a nightmare of uncertainty and solitude -by the end of the movie, he's lost his wife, his mother and his brothers, we are brought in parallel to an early-20th century New York, where young and poor immigrant, Vito Corleone -Pacino's father- makes his first steps into the world of blood and domination. The two figures don't appear ever at the same time on the screen. In that way we can compare the major difference between them: Vito is poor but going up. Michael is rich and powerful, but he's losing each one of the people he loves. Thus, whereas the first movie deals with power, this one's dealing with relationships and feelings.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding. DeNiro symbolizes the Corleone character, by avoiding showing too much on his face -Brando did the opposite in the first part. Pacino is also splendid. He isn't a young and ambitious man anymore. In this movie he is a man who has lost control.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also magnificent. Starting from where the fist movie ended, Coppola avoids too much general plans and gives weight to the gros plans. The photography is very nice and the music, once more, over the top.<br/><br/>It's OK if you don't like it. It's very long -more than three hours, slow and difficult. But I won't change my mind: It's really one of the very-very best ever made. Humangousely recommended. Cheers."

What i enjoyed most was the transition of Michael corleone from what seemed to be a good guy in the first movie, to a villain by the end of the 2nd film.

","This is one of the rare cases of a sequel having more to say than its predecessor. This time a full investment is made in a visual world...here we have depth in addition to the width of the coverage: the proper dimensions of an empire.<br/><br/>The Corleone compound lies in unkempt disarray, like Charles Foster Kane's Xanadu, a museum of memories.<br/><br/>'Part II' is another coup for Willis' lighting and Coppola's ability to capture a world in this fashion; this time, everything, even the outdoor scenery, is defined by light and shadow.<br/><br/>Freed (mostly) from the shackles of the novel, Coppola could explore narrative. We seamlessly jump back and forth in time, following two story arcs with opposite conclusions; a third regression in time completes the equation.<br/><br/>This movie marks several turning points -- DeNiro, hot off of ""Mean Streets"" and ""Bang the Drum..."" would establish his method for good, squarely on top of Brando's method. And Pacino would establish the template for all of his future thunderings."
"creekin111","10","1","2","12 February 2006"," My #4 favorite film of all time (including part 2)
","What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.<br/><br/>The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far.<br/><br/>Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family."
"ebiros2","10","1","2","24 January 2006"," A Classic in its own right
","This is one of the few movies where the sequel is better than the original. Cinematography is better than the original, and story line tighter. The story is about change of guard from the old Corlione (Vito) to the new God father (Michael), and I thought acting by both Marlon Brando and Al Pachino was notch above the original. The unlikely son who went to college and had no interest in the family business now takes over the family as the new Don. Al Pachino shows his maturity as an actor by playing the role of the new Don masterfully, and his transition from his first role to that of the new God father is portrayed naturally.<br/><br/>This is one movie I believe will last till the end days of cinema. A classic in its own right."
"okazaky","10","1","2","16 December 2005"," One of the best films in film history
","The Godfather saga continues with full momentum in this second installment. Al Pacino and Rober Deniro fit their roles like a glove. Any fan of films should have already seen this masterpiece. If not go rush to the store now. Vito's consolidation of power and the founding of the Corleone Empire is delivered in perfection. Any questions the audience had about the inner workings of the Corleone organization is answered very clearly. One of the best endings also, it really makes you hungry for more, at the same time not disappointed or cheated. Robert Duvall returns again to play the legal representative of the Corleone family as well as Diane Keaton as Michael Corleone's (Pacino) wife. Both fill the roles well, particularly Duvall who plays the character who always plays it safe. Not a common trait among the organization. Only Francis Ford Coppola could have pulled so many complex strings together to create this landmark film."
"diand_","9","1","2","16 June 2005"," Masterclass Method acting
","With even the former director of the Actors Studio and proponent of method acting Lee Strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brando's Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.<br/><br/>Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.<br/><br/>Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michael's failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.<br/><br/>Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. That's why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and he's in fact only excellent in 'business'."

","Magnificent from beginning to end, The Godfather Part II is a superb film that betters what was already a perfect film to begin with. Much more epic in scope and retaining a lot of symbolism and Shakespeare like tragedy, Coppola and Puzo have created a work of art once again. Flashing forward a couple of years after the end of the first film, we find that Michael has well and truly amassed himself as the head of the family. Struggling to turn the business into a legitimate empire, the film flashbacks to the early days of  his father's building of the family business, in what is the first stroke of genius of this sequel. The flashback sequences make the film a much more epic affair and in doing so we see the differences not only in father and son, which is the main thrust of the story of the second part of this trilogy, but we see how much America has changed and how much the dynasty of the Corleone family has altered from small street business to potential empire. The real joy in the flashbacks here is how different father and son are. Whereas we see the love between them in the first film and how much Vito loved Michael, here we see the vast differences between them. As Michael tries to legitimize the family business, we see how increasingly alien like and withdrawn he becomes from those around him. His wife Kay, his 'brother' Tom, his blood brother Fredo and how it all ends in tragedy and with Michael ordering the death of the brother who betrays him. Coppola successfully integrates the flashbacks of a young Vito into all of this. Enhanced by the wonderful performance of Robert De Niro (very young here), we see how Vito built his own empire and we see how different he was to his own son, how he loved his wife very much, how he treated friends with respect, how he immersed himself into their lives, not only of those of his friends and family, but of the people he tried to help on the streets. It is this comparison that makes The Godfather Part II such a brilliant film.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is a masterclass in the art of storytelling. If Shakespeare were alive today, this is the type of film he would be writing. Betrayal plays a big part of this film, as does tragedy. Both the betrayal and the tragedy fall at the hands of the hapless Fredo, betraying his brother and then dying at the hands of a hit organized by Michael himself. John Cazale is a stand out amongst many in this film and the moment where he prays in the boat just before he is killed is one of the most haunting moments ever put on to film. It is both sad in many ways. It reinforces how much Fredo had destroyed the relationship with a brother that he loved and further isolates Michael into his shell, prompting a flashback to happier times and a piece of news that only Fredo reacted warmly to. All of this makes up for a fantastic film. It is truly the greatest sequel ever made. The story is well told, the acting is pure class and the flashback structure is done very well.<br/><br/>This is as perfect as perfection will come."

Somehow, the Godfather trilogy has entered the mythology of cinema, and modern history. Perhaps it is because the Corleone family symbolizes the modern capitalist system in America, and how one family rises to the top through vicious means.

"sarem","10","1","2","24 November 1999"," The Best, Classic, Epic, Scintallating, ADDICTIVE
","The Godfather II is the best film in the business. Although I'm a great fan of Godfather, I believe that the second part is far more compelling than its former. Two reasons, I believe Mario Puzo, while writing Godfather, wanted to highlight the fact that even mafisios or even Gangsters always, have a good side to them. WITH EVERY EVIL THERE IS GOOD. This message was beautifully portrayed in Godfather II, while Godfather was not as effective. With the brilliance of Al Pacino  matching Marlon Brando, and amazing acting by Robert de Niro, this movie is the titanic of all movies...the best sequeal ever made, and better yet, the best movie ever conceived. Should be Number 1!!!"
"bldsimple2","10","1","2","29 October 1999"," The Best Film Of All Time (in my humble opinion)
","Call me biased.  For years I thought that the original Godfather was the end-all be-all of films and that there was no way they could ever top it. After years of people crushing me to see Part II (and the heavy weight of the Oscar Gold it had won) I finally caved in, rented it, and came away from it a changed man.<br/><br/>It is difficult in any film to tell two separate stories that co-exist on the same level.  They accomplished that.  It is near blasphemous to take a heralded character in the original and watch him self-destruct in a sequel. They pulled it off.  And it is unthinkable that one brother could possibly betray another.  Believe it.<br/><br/>Part II tells the parallel stories of a Young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro speaking virtually no English) rising to prominence in New York's Hells Kitchen and his son Michael (Al Pacino in his best performance ever), many years after Vito's death, trying to make sense of the business he never wanted to be a part of.  The Rise and The Fall of two very different, but ultimately the same, men.<br/><br/>Vito's inherent goodness bleeds through his performance.  Once doing away with the ""Black Hand"" who rules the streets through terror and oppression, Vito takes control of his neighborhood through kindness and compassion.  He knows the problems of his people and understands why, in some situations, they can not afford to go to the police for help.  He is their Robin Hood.<br/><br/>However, several decades later on the banks of Lake Tahoe, his youngest son Michael has embraced the hypocrisy of his profession.  He intimidates his adversaries, yanks power from his father's trusted counselor, and turns his older brother Fredo (the much missed John Cazale) into a glorified errand boy.  After an attempt on his life is botched, Michael goes on an international trek to consolidate his potential enemies and turn them against one another.  It is on this journey that he learns the true nature of his enemy and realizes that to overcome him, he may lose his soul.<br/><br/>Shakespearean to a fault, emotional as hell and one of the best (tragic) endings I have ever encountered.  See this before you attempt to see Godfather Part III (it spoils the ending)."
"FLC","9","1","2","4 October 1998"," A sequel which is as good as the original, if not better
","The Godfather was a hard act to follow. It had an enthralling plot and the acting was second to none. So, when part two was released, you could be forgiven for being sceptical back in the seventies. But this film  was and still is pure class. With the death of Don Vito Corleone, Michael had to inherit the title, and he did it well. It covers everything you could think of and Robert De Niro is brilliance as the young Vito. Excellent."
"bix171","10","1","2","1 April 2002"," Special
","A masterpiece in its own right, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's deepened history of a family's attempted assimilation into an America that increasingly resists them is told by creators that clearly love their people equally as much as they loathe them. Coppola and Puzo juggle two stories, the growth of the Corleone family under the direction of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) as he grimly tries to take the business legitimate, and the early life of his orphaned father (played here Robert De Niro in a bemused but attentive manner, with dialogue almost entirely in Italian) as he struggles to find his place in the New World. The filmmakers (and this is a collaboration between director and co-scenarist, make no mistake) with the success of the first film have the freedom to relax and tell a thorough story and it unfolds over more than three hours with pinpoint precision and convincing detail. The history it encompasses includes a fascinating foray into Cuba on the eve of revolution and it seems fresh, significant--a subject hitherto unexplored on the big screen; it makes the film seem special, independent of its older sibling. The performances are, again, wonderful and include a startlingly bitter Diane Keaton, a nuanced, graceful Lee Strasberg and a heartbreaking John Cazale. While no film can quite stand alongside its predecessor, this one comes as close as one can come and no film can quite stand alongside this one either."

"DhavalVyas","8","2","7","13 November 2005"," A solid sequel, but a little long.
","'The Godfather, Part II' is often considered the best sequel ever made. Although it is a powerful and moving story, the film has deep flaws that are not revealed upon initial viewings. First of all, the movie has many of the fine qualities that made the original movie a classic. All the performances are incredible and emotional; Al Pacino give one of the best performances I've ever seen. The complex story is slowly and subtly developed by Coopola's nearly unmatched talent as a director. Certain moments are so haunting and unforgettable, they have become classic moments in the history of film-making. I don't need to tell which sequences these are because so many people are already familiar with them.<br/><br/>With all the great things the movie has going for it, 'Part II' has a lot of flaws that reveal themselves after careful viewings. The flashbacks nearly ruin the movie. Although they explain the beginnings of the Corleone family, they greatly deter the on - going struggle of Michael with his enemies and his own family. The flashbacks also make the movie way too long. The failed murder attempt of Frankie Pentangeli is so confusing I couldn't figure out who was doing what. The film should have done a better job of explaining the pre-Castro Cubian situation to the viewer; the actions of the rebels and the rioting are also confusing. Kay (Michael's wife) and Fredo (Michael's brother) has sudden bursts of anger that come out of nowhere. The film does a poor job of showing beforehand why the two characters were so mad at Michael.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, 'The Godfather, Part II' has many positives that outweigh the negatives. If anything, one should just see the movie for the performance given by Al Pacino. Al Pacino commands the movie by stealing every scene he is in. His character is frightening, untouchable, cold, calculating, and invincible. It is one of the most awesome displays of acting ever put on film."
"m.v.hermanni","6","3","13","10 October 2009"," Much to positive regarding the mafia.
","In my opinion, ""The Godfather 2"" is much to positive regarding the mafia, even sympathetic to it.<br/><br/>With the two layers of the narrative, the rise of Vito Corleone, caring and with a loving wife, cut against Michael Corleone, struggling and living in disharmony, the movie actually portraits the changes to society that had taken place between the pre-war and post-war society and between Sicily and America as something bad. It follows a ""The Good old times ""clichÃ©, which is in itself already ideology of the mafia.<br/><br/>This motive is already present in the first movie, but more subtle: Michael finds his true love in an uneducated, maybe underage Sicilian women, that is pimped by her parents to this mighty man and he only returns to the educated, working girlfriend in America because a) his true love has been killed and b) after 1 year he found no other option in the USA.<br/><br/>Especially the portrait of Michael's wife shows a huge anger against women, who are not completely obedient to their husband: This women performs an abortion, because she does not want to give another air to her husband.<br/><br/>This is the same kind of stuff the trials against witches of the middle ages are made off: it is pure hatred and an attempt to link independence of a women to wickedness and insanity.<br/><br/>So in my opinion, the movie is poisoned by the material it tries to put on screen - and this is a warning to every cinematographer, that the subject of a movie is not to be taken easy, the subject might dominate. If it is about power like with the mafia, it might taint the whole result."

Unfortunately, the film takes a hard right half an hour in and turns into a convoluted game of Clue that I struggled to understand or care about. Al Pacino, whose transformation was complete at the end of the original masterpiece, does great work and works much of the movie magic where the script allows him to. DeNiro is captivatingly subtle in his role as young Vito Corleone, and the trio of Keaton, Cazale and Duvall, who flew under the radar in the original, do some fantastic work as well. However, the film's plot focuses heavily on a mystery that is too confusing to follow and Francis Ford Coppola falls into the errors of the original by introducing swathes of interchangeable Italian-American men who are impossible to tell apart. <br/><br/>As time goes on I am sure that I'll remember the best moments fondly and will be tempted to bump it up, but that will only be because I forgot how agonising it was to sit through 3 hours and 20 minutes."

","The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br/><br/>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.<br/><br/>Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""Keep your friends close ....."", ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.<br/><br/>All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","5 January 2016"," The Greatest Sequel Of All Time, And Certainly The Most Honoured.
","Making a sequel that can manage to live up to the expectations of the original is an achievement in itself. But when the original film is being universally hailed as the greatest motion picture ever made, measuring up to that same feat is undeniably a near impossible task. But then, that's exactly what The Godfather Part II manages to accomplish by building upon the original in ways most sequels never dare to and is possibly the only film in existence that has the calibre to challenge the reputation of The Godfather. Boasting all the ingredients that made its predecessor one of world cinema's greatest triumphs, The Godfather Part II remains one of the most critically & artistically successful films in cinema history and amongst all sequels, is certainly the most honoured.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II tells the story of two generations of the Corleone family, thus serving as both a sequel & a prequel to the original, transitioning within the same film. The prequel portion is illustrated in a series of flashbacks and depicts the life of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the previous film & by Robert De Niro in this one) and shows his rise from a poor immigrant in 1910s New York to the highly powerful & respected boss of the Corleone crime family. The sequel portion deals with the aftermath of the events of the first film and continues the journey of Michael Corleone as the new Don and shows him tightening his grip on his family business and expanding it into Vegas & Cuba. The two parallel dramas within the same film also serve as antonyms to each other, considering that one part follows Vito Corleone's rise to power through love, fear & respect while the other part represents the fall of Michael Corleone from the ruthless boss of a vast empire to a lonely & empty shell of a human being.<br/><br/>Continuing the saga from where it signed off in the previous part, Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo, this time, bring the origin & evolution of the Corleone crime family on-screen through flashbacks but also carry forward its current legacy in the sequel segment of the story. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is much improved than it was in The Godfather and presents him in complete control of all filmmaking aspects. The screenplay is expertly written by Coppola & Mario Puzo, adapting the prequel part from the novel while envisioning the sequel part from scratch and, just like the previous film, contains some of the most memorable quotes in movie history. Cinematography inherits the same Technicolor print from the original and adds different contrasts to distinguish the two parallel timelines occurring within the film. Editing is equally impressive for it balances the two stories beautifully and keeps the pace in check throughout its 200 minutes of runtime. Art Direction & Set Decoration shows major enhancements over its predecessor. And finally, the music by Nino Rota is even better, building upon the iconic score of The Godfather and exploring newer territories in this one.<br/><br/>One of this saga's biggest strength has been its remarkable cast & splendid performances. The Godfather Part II features Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire in their reprising roles while also adding Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo & others to its strong ensemble. Al Pacino has given many spectacular performances in his film career but his work in this film remains his best. The cold & ruthless Michael Corleone, played exceptionally well by Al Pacino, returns to screen as more evolved & unforgiving and this performance of Pacino easily ranks among the finest that cinema has to offer. Robert De Niro comes next with an equally magical performance as young Vito Corleone and brilliantly modified his voice & expressions to match the attributes that Marlon Brando brought to this character in the previous film. John Cazale gets more screen time and delivers a heartbreaking performance as Fredo Corleone. Lee Strasberg & Michael V. Gazzo also chip in with strong inputs as Hyman Roth & Frank Pentangeli, respectively. And other impressive contributions come from Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, & Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, everything about this sequel just works. It is more star-studded than the first film and all the filmmaking methods introduced in The Godfather appear seamlessly evolved in this second part. Fans will always be divided over which is a superior film but there is no denying that both movies are paramount examples of flawless filmmaking. As for the two stories that are masterfully intertwined within this film, I personally prefer the flashback segment more than Michael's tale for it was much better filmed, more captivating & also added quite an amount of artistic touch to the whole narrative, comparatively. From start to finish, this masterpiece improves upon the original in such impressive ways that not only it succeeds as a successful follow-up to its predecessor but also shares the same class of greatness with it and both films, since their inception, have been highly instrumental in influencing its genre as well as cinema aesthetics. Displaying greatness in all aspects of filmmaking, The Godfather Part II is an ingenious work of expert artistry in both front & behind the camera and serves wonderfully as an epic conclusion to the violent history of the Corleone crime family. Certainly the greatest & most respected sequel of all time and one of the greatest treasures of world cinema, The Godfather Part II comes one hundred percent recommended."
"slokes","8","1","3","30 May 2015"," Family Is Destiny
","The rise of a great man is set against the fall of his son in this powerful second installment of the ""Godfather"" franchise. ""The Godfather Part II"" is an eminently worthy successor to the classic first film, not nearly as accessible but entertaining and gripping in its own right.<br/><br/>When we reconnect with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he is firmly established as head of the Corleone crime family, now based in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and as lethal as ever. As Michael asserts control over his dominion, we occasionally go back in time to see his father Vito (Robert De Niro) finding his own path to criminal power.<br/><br/>Michael speaks with more authority than honesty, we learn right away. ""Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy, but never think it applies to my family,"" he says. The irony and tragedy of ""Godfather Part II"" is how that hypocrisy is in fact never stronger than when it comes to Michael's family, which is all but destroyed by Michael's iron grip in service of evil ends.<br/><br/>As sequels go, few are regarded as measuring up to the magnificence of ""Godfather Part II."" It's everything you expect from the first film, building on the final moments we saw there of Michael accepting his destiny as Mafia don and developing what that all means. Weighing in at over three hours, with lengthy flashbacks, it manages to hold your focus as director-co-writer Francis Ford Coppola plays cards you didn't know were in the deck. The pacing is deliberate, never ponderous.<br/><br/>Like the first ""Godfather,"" I found I enjoyed ""Part II"" more with repeat viewings. Occasionally, as in an opening sequence set in Sicily that is revisited late in the movie, the drama gets a bit strained as the revenge theme is overplayed. Otherwise, the same subtlety that makes the first movie so great is in ample evidence here.<br/><br/>Pacino is fantastic as the older, harder Michael. We don't quite root for him anymore, the way we did in the first film (another weakness of ""Part II"" as I see it), but his command in the role is startling to witness. In the first movie, we saw him get bloody; this time the wounds are more internal as he plays his scenes with dead-eyed calm. ""I've already made my move,"" he tells his brother Fredo (John Cazale), regarding his latest venture in Cuba with a suspect business partner named Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg).<br/><br/>Cazale and Strasberg give the most memorable supporting performances (De Niro is more a co-lead even though he has less screen time than Pacino). Cazale is more of a hot mess than ever, entertainingly so until the stakes get too high. Strasberg is so low-key and charming you almost find yourself trusting him, until a key scene when his mask slips regarding a former associate named Moe Greene.<br/><br/>Other performances, many by returnees from the first film, are accomplished if somewhat superfluous, particularly Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's wife Kay, and Talia Shire as Michael's sister Connie. All of them have big moments, but are also left in the dust, somewhat by design as the theme of this film is Michael's loss of family ties.<br/><br/>The Vito sections could have been deadly, but Coppola here is at his peak as a director, working from a section of the source novel by co-screenwriter Mario Puzo that was left off the first film. Taking his cues from Marlon Brando's original characterization, but lending his own unmistakable spin, De Niro plays Vito as coy, gentle, but highly dangerous.<br/><br/>I love how Vito speaks almost entirely in his native Sicilian dialect, except at certain key moments when he uses English, depicted here as the language of power. He handles the problem of a don who wants to ""wet my beak"" in Vito's business with cold calculation. It amounts to a power play not only against the don, but his buddies Clemenza and Tessio, who soon find themselves taking orders from their former underling.<br/><br/>The film climaxes, as the first movie did, with a trio of interconnected sequences showing Michael's brutal effectiveness against his enemies. This time, however, there's no sense of triumph. Michael's revenge is too excessive, his ""enemies"" too reduced or ambiguous to merit their ends in our eyes. That of course is the message of ""Godfather Part II.""<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Godfather Part II"" is a masterful if muted examination of the price of family, how the ties that bind too often strangle. I don't think it packs the same punch as the first film, but hardly any film does. What it does well is bring the themes of the first film into sharper focus, so sharp they leave one feeling the scars."

","At the end of ""The Godfather"", we have seen Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) change from a young man who wanted to stand apart from his family to one who did not hesitate to take up the reigns of control. In ""Part II"" , we see him lose his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. The devolution of Michael Corleone is counterpointed by flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito (Robert De Niro). These scenes, taking place in Sicily and old New York, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. What we have are two compelling narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. ""The Godfather: Part II"" then becomes a film that everyone who values movies at all should see."

"blazesnakes9","10","1","3","27 November 2013"," One great sequel
","In 1972, Francis Ford Coppola directed the film, The Godfather. It told the story of a family that was involved with the mafia. The son that came home from the war was given a job to look after the family after his father died. In the end of that movie, his own son became the new godfather. Now comes The Godfather: Part II. But, before I start my review on The Godfather; Part II, let me tell you about my rule of thumb on sequels. For many years, sequels have been trashed, criticized harshly and been disowned. Audiences do go to see sequels, but they don't understand the concept of a great or good sequel. So, I will turn your attention to my review of The Godfather: Part II. The movie tells us two story lines, one showing us how the original godfather, Vito Corleone, came to America in the beginning of the 20th century and one telling us the story of Michael Corleone, taking over his father's empire. Corleone, in a younger age, is played by Robert De Niro, who won a Best Supporting Actor in 1975 at the Academy Awards, and his journey in New York leads him into becoming the godfather of the original film. But even though this is a sequel, this movie is actually a prequel to the original film. Corleone's story is one of the main points of the movie and how he rose to power over the years before 1958. The other main point involves his son, Michael, played by Al Pacino, coming into play as being the godfather after his father dies in the original and in this movie, he takes on his father's job, where his relationship with his wife, played by Diane Keaton, takes a toll and he begins to experience the life of a matriarch, more specific, a hard-working matriarch. Pacino in this movie give a memorable performance in this movie and also in the original. But, there's something different about Michael Corleone. He's more powerful than the original film. If you remember the first movie, you'll realizes that he didn't want to be with the family, or be involved with the family's business because he wanted to live his own life. But, when his father died, however, he accepts the role of being the new godfather. To me, this movie is ranked pretty much up to the original, but this sequel and some sequels are bad and some sequels are good. The Godfather: Part II is a great sequel, more far-reaching than ever and much more in depth with the original. Why is it that great of a sequel? Well, first of all, the movie takes the characters to a new place and have them go on a different scenario in which they can drawback to the original. The business that Michael gets involved with in Cuba in 1958 is well-told. The drawbacks in this movie relies on flashbacks from Don Vito's early career in the early 1920's and 1930's. The movie features some of the other family members of the Corleone's clan, like Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall and Sonny Corleone, one of the Corleone sons, played by James Caan. To me, those flashbacks builds up the supporting parts that made The Godfather great. Not only great, but also revolutionary. If you put all of the pieces together, than you got yourself an epic story of one man, who was poor as a little boy from Italy, grow up and became inventive with his ideas and made himself an empire of his own people and his own family. His actions were direct and his journey was worth watching. It's amazing that audiences will buy a movie like this and see it and go to the movies to see this movie and not understand the supporting backdrop to The Godfather. Coppola directed this movie and amazingly, he won an Oscar for Best Director and the movie itself won Best Picture. The Godfather: Part II was the first sequel to every win an Academy Award. Even though I am not a member of the Academy, my opinion this movie is that it fully deserved the Oscar and does make sense for its story-telling and its magnificent scope of Don Vito's life. The transformation is far more superior than other movie character every to be told or made. The enormous ground-braking history behind the two Godfather movies brings out the American Dream. The two other movies is not about living in the American Dream, where you can pursue happiness and live life. The American Dream in the two Godfather movies is more different than what one's will say. The truth is that the American Dream consists of hard work and dignity. Anyone can pursue the American Dream, but only one will succeed by pursuing their own journey and making the best out of something giant. Giant like the empire Vito build on. It's more than a mob story. The Godfather: Part II is a great movie, with more in depth information amongst the characters and story-telling at its finest. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"raphaklopper","10","1","3","7 October 2013"," Part 2 of the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here are the reviews of parts 1-2-3 together)
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.<br/><br/>While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.<br/><br/>As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.<br/><br/>The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.<br/><br/>But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .<br/><br/>Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10"
"Christian_Dimartino","10","1","3","24 June 2013"," Even better than the original, and the original was flawless.
","Francis Ford Coppola won three Oscars for his work on the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, the rare sequel that outdoes the original. The original was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it. And I must say that it is pretty difficult to outdo a masterpiece. But Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo really knock it out of the park the second time.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II tells two stories this time: One is of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who now has a family with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), but really nobody, including his sister Connie (Talia Shire) loves him because he has let the power go to his head. After an assassination attempt, Michael goes on the hunt for the bastard who tried to kill him. The second story is the back story of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), whose family was murdered when he was a boy, and basically he too is seeking vengeance.<br/><br/>What I love about The Godfather Part II, besides the fact that it tells two stories, is that it covers the ground that the original film did, but this one digs deeper. The first film mainly focused on family and betrayal. This one focuses on betrayal in the family, which makes for a much juicier and shocking story. The Godfather Part II is a stunner, mainly because you never know where it's going to go, or how it's going to get there.<br/><br/>The sequel is more interesting than its predecessor. This one feels a little more like a thriller. Pacino gives one of his best performances here. Here he plays such a complex character. You know that he never wanted any of this, and it is terrible just to see how far he will take it. What started off as a nice man slowly turns into a monster, and that is sort of what keeps the film afloat.<br/><br/>The Godfather trilogy is a special one, and this one is the main reason why. This film is a masterpiece, and it is no wonder that it became the first sequel ever to win best picture. It is a difficult decision, because I really do love the first one. But this is a much more interesting and fascinating film than the original. Either way, they are both very amazing movies. I don't know when Francis Ford Coppola will make another movie. But what I do know is that he won't be able to make another one like this again.<br/><br/>A+"
"im2cool4","9","1","3","14 June 2013"," Best Sequel of all Time
","The Godfather part 2 is one of the best movies of all time. In GF1 we are introduced to most of the characters in this second film and GF2 builds on that massively. At this point we as the viewer see Michael Corleone almost as a villain now. Al Pacino really deserved a Oscar for this film he was just brilliant and in my opinion this his best acting on film(big statement because he has many other great films) for example when Kay Adams tells Michael that she got an abortion he flips out. Also in another scene where he is picking up the kids from Kay he gives this look to Kay which such a vicious look without saying a word.These are just some of the examples of Pacino's great acting in this. Another aspect that I love about this movie is John Cazales role as Fredo Corleone. We got a view of Fredo in the first movie and it left us wanting more and we did get more in this second movie Cazale plays his role to a T and he makes you feel sorry for his character during the latter of the film. I can go on and on about this movie and its fascinating characters. A"
"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","3","30 May 2013"," Malevelontly chilling
","In ways, I guess I could say that the first Godfather changed my outlook on film, in that you can enjoy movies for their artistic aspects, and that you don't necessarily have to understand the film inside out, in that you can enjoy for what it offers, and that is basically the experience of it. When I watch a gangster movie, I felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first Godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but I actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. I have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre.<br/><br/>And the things The Godfather did in setting the bar, Part II further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. To see Michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. What Don Vito Corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see Michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. What makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from Michael, that makes him just pure evil. What is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and I cannot give enough credit to Al Pacino. He deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who I think shines just as much as Al in the film is Robert De Niro and his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone during his rise to power. I would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than Marlon Brando portray the original Don, but Robert De Niro actually exceeded my expectations. From his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair.<br/><br/>And not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. We know how Michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how Vito and Michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. The Godfather Part II shows what is set forth by Michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character.<br/><br/>I originally preferred the first one, but then I realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. While the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but I like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while I prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. To make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of Francis Ford Coppola's talent as a director. Even if the first Godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. The Godfather Part II is a film that you should definitely not miss out on."
"cinefreakdude","10","1","3","26 April 2012"," Puts the EQUAL in sequel.
","The Godfather Part II is truly an amazing film. Absolutely fantastic performances from everyone in the entire cast. I think that Al Pacino should have won best actor at the Oscars. This film is easily one of the greatest sequels ever made. Complex story, amazingly shot, and beautifully scored, The Godfather Part II deserves to be called a true masterpiece of cinema, and a tortured influential saga of crime, family, and corruption. Films like this arn't made anymore. This is just as good a film as The Godfather part I, and possibly a little better. A must-see classic. Every minute in this movie is made with care and every frame bubbles with dramatic tension and amazing cinematography. 100%"
"ferguson-6","10","1","3","20 April 2012"," This is the business we have chosen
","Six weeks ago was The Godfather in a theatre setting. This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are  and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.<br/><br/>This sequel explores three time periods: the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community ""leader"" is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.<br/><br/>The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro  the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.<br/><br/>A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking."
"hall895","9","1","3","23 January 2011"," An epic tale. Two epic tales in fact.
","Remember that young idealist Michael Corleone from the opening wedding scene in The Godfather? That Michael Corleone doesn't exist anymore. His descent began in the original film as he took over the family business. In Part II the now ruthlessly evil Michael bottoms out. He has money, he has power. But at what cost? It is hard to comprehend what he has become, so sad to see him cost himself everything he really holds dear. And, in a stroke of genius, as we watch Michael fall director Francis Ford Coppola at the same time flashes back and allows us to see Michael's father rise. The rise of Vito Corleone, the fall of Michael. Either story on its own would be epic. Interwoven together the two stories combine to make The Godfather: Part II one of the most audacious and most brilliant films ever made.<br/><br/>After a brief introduction to the Vito storyline Part II thrusts us right back into that familiar Godfather world which we left at the end of the first film. It is now 1958 and Michael has moved family operations to Nevada. We open at the family compound in Lake Tahoe with an elaborate party celebrating Michael's son's First Communion. Yes, the parallels with the first film's wedding scene are obvious. Rather than Vito it is now Michael who everyone waits to see. Even his sister Connie will have to get in line and wait her turn for an audience with Michael. The real business of the day, involving a proposed Corleone takeover of another casino to add to their empire, is conducted between Michael and Nevada Senator Pat Geary. We see that Michael is so powerful, and so sure of himself, that he thinks nothing of being totally dismissive and insulting towards a United States Senator. Safe to say this is not the most cordial of business meetings. Nothing seems to be decided and Geary, a true sleaze in his own right, leaves but you know we'll see him again. Michael moves on to his next meeting with Frank Pentangeli, who is now running the old Corleone New York territory. This meeting is bitter and hostile as can be. It's been a long day for Michael Corleone. And it's about to get much, much worse. An attempt is made on Michael's life. Bullets come flying into his bedroom. He and his family emerge unscathed and you know the film is now going to kick into high gear. This is going to get really, really good. And then the film immediately transports you back to 1917 and the story of Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>So is Coppola pulling the rug out from under you by leaving Michael's story just when you can't wait to see what happens next? Not at all. Vito's story will prove to be just as compelling as Michael's. And throughout the film Coppola chooses the absolutely perfect times to jump from one story to the other, at emotional high points, places where the connections between the two stories are the most poignant. It's brave, brilliant film making. The audience is treated to two fabulous stories which fit together absolutely perfectly. As the film plays out we see Vito begin to acquire power and Michael consumed by power. We see the great love Vito has for his family as we watch Michael's family fall apart around him. We know Vito is capable of some evil things but he still has some heart to him. Michael has clearly lost his heart somewhere along the way. Just telling Michael's story would have been enough to make this a great film. Weaving young Vito's story in so seamlessly is what makes the film something truly special.<br/><br/>As with the first film Coppola is helped here by universally brilliant performances from his cast. And as with the first film it is Al Pacino who makes the biggest impression. His performance as Michael is as powerful and captivating as anything you've ever seen. Michael is such a complex character and his journey from the beginning of the first film to the end of this one is something that has to be seen to be believed. And over both films Pacino is spot-on perfect every step of the way. In the parallel story it is Robert De Niro who gets the critical role of young Vito and he does ever so well in giving life to the man who would one day be Brando. We of course have the familiar faces from the first film. Robert Duvall as lawyer Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's long-suffering wife Kay. There's Talia Shire and Morgana King. And most memorably of all John Cazale as hapless, hopeless Fredo. Part II also gives us great new characters, making room for new performers to make their mark on The Godfather saga. Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo, G. D. Spradlin, Gastone Moschin, Dominic Chianese...the list could go on and on. Such a huge cast and yet every performer seems to fit their role perfectly. The film tells two great stories and the acting is absolutely wonderful throughout. Some two hour movies seem to drag endlessly. This nearly three and a half hour movie absolutely flies by. A monumental achievement for Coppola, one of the best films of all time."
"Cali_Dude1","Null","1","3","29 November 2010"," The sequel that surpasses its predecessor
","These days, any old franchise can spin off a string of Roman numeral sequels. But back in 1974, it was almost unprecedented for the makers of a Best Picture Academy Award-winner to return to the well. It's significant that this is called The Godfather Part II rather than Godfather II, since Coppola and his collaborators did not give us more of the same, but extended the original story of the Corleone family backwards and forwards, while deepening the characterisations.<br/><br/>Darting back and forth in time, this follows Michael (Pacino) through the 1950s, as his would-be legitimate business gets into sleazy deals in Cuba and the US Senate, and he is forced to break the ultimate taboo by having his own brother murdered. Meanwhile, we see his father Vito (De Niro) as a young man, organising a street gang in turn-of-the-century New York. Coppola, steeped in Italian-American myth of the immigrant experience, canonises Vito, who founds the Mafia to protect his people from more predatory dons, while exposing the way Vito's family business harbours the seed of his son's monstrously corrupt empire.<br/><br/>This was the film in which Pacino and De Niro were first teamed, though the exigencies of the narrative mean that they never actually meet. Both are electrifying but Pacino is especially strong, his hollow gaze showing the high price Michael has paid for his position. And with supporting roles from the likes of Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Lee Strasberg, to say nothing of Roger Corman and Harry Dean Stanton in bit parts, this is nothing short of magisterial.<br/><br/>Courtesy: Empire magazine"

He is seen as cold and calculating. Basically, this movie has two parts to it. A flashback of the young Don Vito and the current Don in Michael.<br/><br/>The acting here is perfect. Robert De Niro really strengthened the cast with his amazing performance. Al Pacino and Diane Keaton delivered strong performances.<br/><br/>I cant describe how much I was amazed.

"harrycloke","Null","1","3","2 September 2010"," The best number two.
","The Godfather Part II was the film that made sequels respectable – a true piece of art that remains quite as powerful now as it was when it was made. The reason for this is simple: Coppola is a master storyteller. Too often a sequel is ruined because it seems obsessed with the mantra: ""bigger is better"" – more action, more explosions, and more special effects. Part II succeeds because it places its focus on its characters and lets the story unravel around them. In some respects however, Part II is a bloated film with many affecting and individual characters spanning two story lines, abundant with plot twists, drama and yes -- plenty of action, all packed into its eye-watering 200 minute runtime. It's a testament to Coppola's ability that he is able to balance all these individual elements and create what is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Part II follows Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) efforts to strengthen the family business through expanding his gambling ventures into revolutionary Cuba. After an attempt on his life, he must plot and scheme to ensure that those responsible are punished without derailing his business endeavours. Interweaved with this story we see the life of Vito Corleone, (played by Robert DeNiro) from his tragic upbringing in Sicily at the turn of the 20th Century, to his rise to power in New York. Coppola's decision to include both stories is not just a means to test his audience's endurance abilities – it allows for his viewers to analyse the differences between Michael and Vito - between father and son. Those who have no interest in exercising their critical faculties can simply sit back and enjoy a smartly structured and expertly paced story of ambition and loss in capitalist America.<br/><br/>For a movie that places such an emphasis on family; in particular upon the relationship between father and son, we see surprisingly little of Michael together with his children. Vito was an intelligent man who had genuine love for his children, and knew from his miserable upbringing the effect that the Mafioso lifestyle could have for his family. By placing these two stories together we can better understand decisions Don Vito made in Part I in attempting to avoid bloodshed and compare the frenzied decisions made by Michael in Part II. It's questionable what kind of a man Michael would have been if he had genuine loving relationship with his children, or indeed the rest of his family, who leave him, one by one, over the course of this film. Furthermore one might question whether Michael had genuine love for any of these people – throughout the film there is evidence that he finds value in people and things because they are his brother, his family, his property. Take the scene where Kay confronts Michael about a possible divorce his anger stems from the fact that she is trying to take away his children, who get most of their love and nourishment from their mother and who receive little interest from himself. There's further evidence in his treatment of family consigliere Tom Hagen (a wonderful, understated performance by Duvall) who, not being a blood brother, Michael always seems to give the short stick.<br/><br/>Eventually Michael's choices and lifestyle leaves him safe, but alone, as he slowly alienates everybody who cared for him. This loss is reflected in Coppola's haunting final shot, where we see Michael alone, contemplating his actions. Pacino's performance works because he shows us two sides of Michael – quiet and pensive at one moment, then a raging, scheming monster the next. This is the kind of controlled intensity which a Pacino performance sometimes lacks. Yes, the times where Michael loses his cool are spectacular in their bombast – particularly when his wife Kay confronts him about his children; but these are not the only images I am confronted with when I think about what makes the performance great. For instance, Michael's simmering unrevealed rage at Senator Geary's attack on him, his family and his people. Michael's quiet disbelief and anger as his brother Fredo unwittingly reveals his treachery. Michael alone at the dinner table as his brothers rush away to greet their father in a flashback. These snapshots of an isolated man can serve to humanize a character, who gives us no real cause for sympathy.<br/><br/>Then there's Nino Rota's masterful score, which is of such importance to the film that it is impossible to imagine the two apart. Robert DeNiro's superb Oscar-winning performance – indeed fantastic performances across the board. Spectacular cinematography of Sicily and New York. I could go on, but there's no need – everything that could be said about this film has already been said. The joy is in experiencing it for one's self."
"The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan","10","1","3","18 April 2010"," One of the few sequels that I like more than the original.
","This is great. First let's talk about the acting. It is awful.....no I'm just kidding, it's actually f**king great. My favorite actors of all in the movie are Pacino and De Nero. They are just plain off great. They literally could not be better. Now let's talk about the plot. It's both a prequel and a sequel to the first Godfather movie from 1972. I'm not going to tell you how, but lets just say it's really good how they do it. Francis Ford Coppola is a cinematic genius, his directing in this movie is brilliant. Actually brilliant is the wrong word, fantastic now that is a better way of summing up the directing. Well this is on hell of a great movie. I can't even really do it justice it is just a great movie that needs to be seen to be believed."

"Sanou_san","10","1","3","9 September 2009"," Brilliantly excellent sequel
","Some bickered that Godfather 2 was an insult to be called a sequel, but I don't mind them arguing such. Admittedly I watched the film first before Godfather 1 and was astounded with its beauty even after I watched Godfather 1. I realized well after watching Godfather 2 how the character of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone developed well throughout the film, and I quite grasped as well very well his character after I watched Godfather 1. The film was double layered. Viewers would understand in this film Vito Corleone's origin, how he grew and feared by many. On the other hand shows the present son of Vito: Michael, who is struggling to deal with his father's family business left to him. The characters and atmosphere were simply superb, and you could understand well how the story progresses. How Michael got the similarity of the situation he is experiencing as contrast to his father during the early times. We see Vito Corleone 's life progresses during his early years, and we see Michael, being the youngest of the family, adhere to his father's legacy and lived through defending his family and business. We can see how well the father and son got their similarity of managing their business and tried well not to mix family in it. I was so touched in Godfather 1 concerning Michael's affection to his family, most especially to his father. And I was moved with his affection towards his family now in Godfather 2 after his father died how he held on what was dearly important to him. I got the bleak understanding how crime worlds works except since after I watched Godfather 1. Italian countrymen got their pride, their history, their nature, and Mario Puzo had brilliantly depicted a beautiful story out of it. Funny though after I watched the film I didn't even realized that it was Robert De Niro who plays the part of the early Vito Corleone, how mesmerizing."
"insomniac_rod","10","1","3","9 August 2009"," Darker sequel that focuses more on the Corleon's take on the legal and politics aspects. The best film ever made, probably yes...
","This movie can be watched as two different movies that connect masterfully when the actual events are about to reach a climax. ""The Godfather"" plot gets more into the political aspects rather than on mafia wars or vendettas and that brings in consequence more dramatic situations inside the family. Thus the film has a darker, more tense tone.<br/><br/>It focuses more on the personal consequences provoked by the family's criminal empire in the US and in Cuba. Michael's character is explored and taken to a new darker level. We understand that his personal life is falling to pieces as his wife provoked an abortion and plans to leave him, while, at the same time, he faces a betrayal from his older brother and the burdens of his sister's life. Michael, unlike Vito, is more cold hearted but marvelous when playing his cards. Vito made sure to establish his criminal empire before others could consider him as an enemy and with his guts, he decides to take down the mafia leader in the zone, Don Fanucci. Later, Vito starts a huge oil business and executes a long time vendetta. That was Vito Corleone, a brilliant negotiator, persuasion leader, calmed down, and smart Italian-American who started from zero and thanks to his family's support, loyal associates, and leadership; soon started his own empire.<br/><br/>When both character's reach a similar climatic situation; it's up to Michael to learn through his mother how his father would act in order to keep his family safe or how to deal with a certain problem. After plenty of intermissions that show us Vito's start in mafia; we construct in our mind a parallel story that will give us the ""weapons"" to know how Michael is gonna act.<br/><br/>Vito, in his younger years, demonstrated to be very protective of his family and members of his ""other family"". He didn't have to face betrayal or similar situations when he started to build the empire; unlike Michael who is in a very complex situation that not only deals with politics.<br/><br/>The trial that the Corleones face is absolutely brilliant on the political side because Michael moves his cards in such a class act manner that witnesses who have the chance to take the business down suddenly regret on their accusations. Michael is now a brilliant politician who has controls the strings of senators, judges, mafia bosses, etc. His the most powerful criminal in the country.<br/><br/>This makes Michael a true menacing leader with such power that he is feared, respected by everyone, including his close family.<br/><br/>So the movie focuses primarly on Michael and Hyman Roth, making Vito in his young years a supporting character along with Clemenza and Tessio. The supporting characters from the actual events include favorites such as Al Neri (although he was in part 1), Rocco, Fredo once again, Willi Cicci, Frank, Connie, and Mother Corleone. Tom Hagen deserves a special spot for being the equilibrium of the family on the most difficult situations. He's just a splendid sidekick and opposite at the same time for Michael.<br/><br/>Special mention for Michael's extremely creepy and lethal capo-bodyguard who provided some of the most suspenseful scenes in cinema history just by making presence. He must be a role model for the Giallo sub-genre.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie is absolutely amazing, beautiful. The funeral scene is sad and intense, while the Cuban new year's eve party is glamorous, colorful, and nerve tensing. I enjoyed big time the carnival in Vito's younger years.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent, just excellent. It's a mix of classic score executed by orchestras, mixed with creepy piano elements, and classical/popular Italian melodies.<br/><br/>The acting is just wonderful. Al Pacino delivers the acting display of his career. Michael Corleone is a brilliant man, with an admirable temper, excellent knowledge of politics and human behavior. Al Pacino demonstrates he can act in EVERY single possible situation. Robert De Niro's performance is highly regarded because of his masterful display of Marlon Brando's behavior translated translated through the Vito Corleone character. The movie focuses on both actor's characters and that's why you just explore them at full. The acting by Robert Duvall is a glory. The rest of the cast is just wonderful and deserve to be congratulated but let's face it; this is all about Pacino and DeNiro.<br/><br/>To be honest, myself as a die-hard Horror cinema expert, I can say this sequel is amongst the most tense, suspenseful and stressing but pleasant viewing experiences I've ever experienced.<br/><br/>There's plenty of tension, high-quality action sequences (my favorites include Michael's murder attempt which is later spectacular when his gunmen search for the assassin's; Frank's murder attempt when Cicci gets injured; the Cuban citizens rebellion, and the climax when Frank commits suicide, Roth gets killed, Fredo pays for his betrayal, etc.).<br/><br/>I loved the final sequence when the flashback takes place and Michael is left alone, drinking tea or wine I can't remember... he just thinks and plans his future in that moment. It's a brilliant scene.<br/><br/>Please watch this movie because it's a lesson of life through tense situations that happen in real life, for some.<br/><br/>Ford Coppola's delicate, classy direction makes this a great visual experience in all the sense of the word; he creates a whole new world in which we are invited without having to be worried. Now, when a movie is part of your life you can say it's more than a great experience."
"Jag85","Null","1","3","30 April 2009"," Not as good as the original, but still a great crime film
","My opinions on this movie are a bit mixed. The opening for the film was brilliant as it delves into the early life of Vito Corleone and then flash-forwards to the story of his son Michael Corleone following the events of The Godfather (1972). It was all interesting up until it started faltering during the lengthy middle portion of the film, when Michael travels around to various different places meeting different underworld figures. The pacing and editing was quite bad during the middle portion, so much so that I even found it somewhat boring to watch. It could have been better if Francis Ford Coppola was willing to trim some bits here and there during the middle portion. Nevertheless, the final portion of the film was back on track and largely made up for the weak middle portion. Like the original Godfather, the last 80 minutes of The Godfather Part II were very gripping and moving, with the ending probably being even more powerful than that of the original. The film had the potential to be just as good as, if not better than, the original Godfather if only if it wasn't for the overall inconsistency and the weak middle portion of the film.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Al Pacino was again brilliant as Michael Corleone, while Robert De Niro was also very believable as a young Vito Corleone. The other cast members were also impressive, with some of the more minor characters from the first film, like John Cazale (as Fredo Corleone) and Diane Keaton (as Kay), getting more major roles this time around. Although I have criticized this film quite a bit, those criticisms are only relative to its predecessor, as The Godfather Part II is still quite easily among the greatest crime films of all time in its own right.<br/><br/>9/10"

"kyle-cruse","9","1","3","20 August 2008"," Almost as good as Part 1
","What an impressive film. I rank ""The Godfather: Part II"" as the third greatest sequel I've ever seen, behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Toy Story 2."" Like those two films, this sequel does not attempt to use the same structure and style as the original. Godfather II shows Michael Corelone's (Al Pacino) struggle to hold his father's crime empire together as he begins to abuse his power, and this is combined with flashback scenes showing how Vito Corleone (played excellently by Robert DeNiro in an Oscar-winning role here) came to form his empire. I don't even understand why I like the film so much, as it grows more depressing and disheartening as the film goes on. Nevertheless, it is amazingly brilliant nonetheless. At almost three and a half hours long, the film is not slow-paced at all. It moves along smoothly, yet it takes plenty of time to adequately convey both stories in great detail. The flashbacks are the real highlight of this film, and watching Robert DeNiro as he begins to gain power is engaging and very interesting to watch. It's amazing how much different Michael's character is in this film from the first one. This doesn't top the first film for me, probably because Marlon Brando, who made part I so great, is not in it. Nevertheless, this is easily the best picture of 1974, and the performances are some of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

This movie was similar to the first in the basic story within the family, also a lot of the characters from the first are in this movie also. However, there are new challenges that cross the Corleone family. There are also new characters, some the family is familiar with and some not. There are also new enemies and obstacles the family face. One of the main differences is that the story does not take place only in New York. In fact, only a fraction is in New York, most takes place in Nevada, Florida, and even Cuba. There seem to be a few different stories within the main plot of this movie. And they all work quite well. This movie will be loved by fans of the first."

","Well when it comes to movie sequels i am usually very skeptical. Many film sequels leave me disappointed and wanting something better. When i watched this movie i realized that it was as good if not better than the first which is saying a lot. Al Pacino gives yet another Oscar worthy performance and the story continues to keep you interested. This is one of my all time favorite films. The movie progresses the story from where it left off and shows the struggle of the corleone family to stay out of trouble with the law. Michael becomes a darker more evil character than in the first film. The other characters develop into deeper more sophisticated people, and the flashbacks of Vitos childhood ad depth to this film that is a masterpiece in its own right."
"cameron-burn","10","1","3","9 August 2007"," The Godfather is more important. But the Godfather part 2 is better
","The Godfather is a more important film, of course it is. But the Godfather part 2 is a better film. It's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of Italian-American myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? The Godfather Part 2 was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked. <br/><br/>When The Godfather premiered in New York on 14 March 1972, co-screenwriter and novelist Mario Puzo had already started work on the sequel. That's how sure Paramount were that they had a monster hit on their hands, despite some exhibitors turning up their noses at a preview screening: too little action, too much talking, and too long - proof that in no way are exhibitors a bunch of popcorn-selling philistines. After two days of release, cinema managers were being offered bribes by punters desperate to get to the front of the queues which busted the proverbial block. There was something of the Mafia about the way in which Paramount doubled ticket prices for weekend shows to squeeze extra revenue from their new cash cow. The sequel, announced on 16 April and working titled Don-Michael, was a commercial inevitability (""When you've got a licence to make Coca-Cola, make Coca-Cola! Said Charlie Bluhdorn, head of Gulf and Western, who owned Paramount). The Godfather grossed $101 million in its first 18 weeks, and nobody was going to stop the studio having another cake and eating it. But Francis Ford Coppola, the young director whom the studio had almost fired from the Godfather but who was now feted by Hollywood and the world, wasn't that interested. So they offered him a million dollars plus a huge 13% of the profits and total artistic control. Altogether now: it was an offer he couldn't refuse. <br/><br/>Thus, out of this sticky climate of money-grabbing corporate opportunism did cinemas greatest part2 emerge. Pub debates about the diminishing returns of the sequel usually collapse at the mention of it's name. So why does it work? Why isn't it Police Academy2:their first assignment? Much of it has to do with the unique power of it's own part one, which established it's family of characters so vividly. Audiences were gagging for more of Michael, Tom, Kay, Fredo and Connie. Bit the Coppola-Puzo masterstroke was to develop the saga in two directions, forwards through the faustian ascendance of Don Michael, and backwards into the early 1900s, tracing Vito Andolini's first steps into mafia hood (he earns the surname Corleone-the name of his home village-through a mix-up at Ellis Island's immigration control). <br/><br/>As with all of Coppola's best work, the casting was inspired.(And as with The Godfather, fans can while away hours mulling over who might have been cast. Try this one: dying Miami mobster Hyman Roth, played with precision by acting coach Lee Strasberg in the film-could have been Laurence Olivier, Ella Kazan, or blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo!) Robert De Niro, plucked from the rising star racks after Mean Streets, seems born to play the young Marlon Brando, Pacino, Coppolas wildcard in casting the Godfather, grows into the central role of Michael in perfect parallel with his character, and Diane Keaton proves the quiet lynchpin( which is no mean feat in this male-dominated film). <br/><br/>Everything that was majestic and mythic about the First film is more so in Part2,its scenes deliberately matching the original. Author of the essential Godfather book, Peter Cowie, describes the two-part saga in musical terms, as ""Coppolas suite"", with bass lines , motifs and rhyming patterns. (""As a whole, Coppola said, the first film ought to haunt the second like a spectre."") So instead of constantly reminding us that the first film is better, part 2 builds on it's operatic sweep and cranks up the drama, both narratively and visually. Cinematographer Gordon Willis goes into sublime sepia overdrive for the flashbacks. Production designer Dean Tavoularis tops his own evocative 1940s New York streets with a living, breathing Italian immigrant community circa 1912(actually the Ukranian quarter). The epic 26 minute wedding scene that opened part one is echoed in part2 by the altogether tackier confirmation party at the new Corleone compound in Lake Tahoe(the lake itself claiming the life of one of the family in part2s chilling climax.) Actually, claiming that the second is better than the first is like saying Lennon's better than Mcartney. One cannot exist in isolation from the other ; they must be watched by anyone who loves American Film consecutively. <br/><br/>Apparently, they made a part3 too. 10/10"

","The Godfather Part II is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. That's not to say I didn't like it; on the contrary, I loved it. The film expands the character and arc of that which is Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino (reprising his role from the first flawless film). It is a saga in all senses of the word. <br/><br/>The most obvious thing to be disappointed by was its comparison to its predecessor. No one can compare ""The Godfather"" to anything else. It's a league of its own. As a stand-alone movie, ""II"" is great. Fantastic. But not flawless.<br/><br/>The one major thing I found was its pacing. If I were the director, I could have ended it 45 minutes earlier. The immediate plot arcs are resolved, and all that is left to tell is Michael's descent into darkness. If that was the story Coppola wanted to tell, fine. I just preferred a more upbeat ending (call me what you will). I almost got up to turn off the DVD, but then there was another scene. And another. They, truthfully, felt like add-ons. <br/><br/>This is not to say, once again, that I didn't love the movie. Easily one of the best ever. It just COULD HAVE been better. Once you have tasted filet mignon, would you go back to hamburger? Perhaps. But you might rather that burger be made out of the filet. This movie was more like a 40 oz. prime rib steak- tasty, juicy, so flavorful, but just too darn big to love."

","The Godfather Part II<br/><br/>Along with The Godfather, The Godfather Part II is second only to Goodfellas as the greatest movie ever. This is equal to The Godfather Part 1 in every way. When there is a superiority in Part 1, Part 2 corrects that.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is just as good as The Godfather Part 1. There are two stories. If this had not been done right it would have been disastrous. Fortunately it was done right every step of the way. The first story deals with Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) rise to power and becoming the Godfather. The other story deals with a bloody war between Michael Corleone and Meyer Lansky based mobster, Hyman Roth.<br/><br/>Acting: The characters are not as interesting as the characters of its predecessor because it is a sequel. However it matches this with its slightly superior and superb acting. Al Pacino gives the greatest performance of his life and one of the greatest performances of all time, reprising his role as Michael Corleone and giving an absolutely chilling performance as a man who slowly and subtly succumbs more and more into the world of crime. This is the movie where he should have won Best Actor. Robert De Niro gave another fantastic performance winning Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the you Vito Corleone. John Cazale gave a nomination worthy performance as Fredo Corleone expanding the character from the Godfather by himself and giving new meaning to the word Fredo. Other great performances include Talia Shire, Morgana King, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasberg, and Michael V. Gazzo.<br/><br/>Genre/Quality: The movie still stays the same with crime but also raises more family issues. While the 1st film appeared to glorify crime, the continued series deals with the dark side in this movie. As with the first movie the music is great. Camera angles are fantastic. Transition between the 50's and early 1900's are also great.

"freaky_dave","8","1","3","14 April 2006"," A very good sequel, but I still prefer the first film
","Both The Godfather and The Godfather part II are really good films. Both have excellent performances, and both films move at that same leisurely pace that never becomes boring. But the film I prefer is the first, even though the second is more detailed about what the Corleone family does. I guess I prefer it because it was more original, and Marlon Brando, who doesn't appear in the second even though Francis Ford Coppola tried getting him to reprise his role at the end of the movie, isn't there.<br/><br/>With The Godfather part II we have two stories going on. And that is the other weakness of the second film. One involves Michael Corleone (Pacino)as the new Don maintaining his power and pushing to keep his control. The second involves the early life of Vito Corleone and how he became the Godfather of the first film. Robert DeNiro, in an exceptional performance, plays the part of the young Vito Corleone. Both stories are played back and forth, and as big events happen in one the plot shifts to the other, which is a little distracting. I would've preferred that Copolla stuck with one story instead because it would've worked a lot better. Of course I can understand why he did it. He wanted to get two of the biggest stars of their generation together in one film, and both Pacino and DeNiro were up to the challenge even though Brando was still irreplaceable.<br/><br/>DeNiro looks really young, and Al Pacino looks much older than in the first, even though both films were only separated by two years. I don't know if it was clever make-up or just Pacino's phenomenal acting that made it so.<br/><br/>The ending of The Godfather part II is incredibly strong though as it shifts back to a time when Michael was certain he was never going to be part of the family business, only to shift back to the present as he sits by himself in his home after key events have happened. It was like a realization as Pacino's character completely accepts what he has become. Strong movie definitely, but the first film, in my opinion, is still better. However both films still should be seen. You can't just watch one and not the other. Godfather part II may not be the greatest sequel ever, but it is still one incredible experience."
"brainofj72","9","1","3","19 September 2005"," A Perfect Continuation
","WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR PARTS I AND II.<br/><br/>When ""The Godfather"" was released in 1972, it instantly became a classic, and has now gone on to become a cinematic legend. I find it rather surprising that ""The Godfather Part II"" was made at all, as ""The Godfather"" is not exactly a franchise film, but what is more surprising is just how good this sequel is.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" was the story of the Corleone crime family: Vito (Brando), the Don of the family; Michael (Pacino), his youngest son; Sonny (Caan), his hot-tempered first-born; Tom Hagen (Duvall), his adopted son and legal adviser; Fredo (Cazale), his middle child; Connie (Shire), his daughter; and Kay Adams (Keaton), Michael's girlfriend. Over the course of the film, Vito is seriously injured, causing Sonny to become Don, but due to his temper, he is promptly shot dead, thus causing Michael to take over duties as Don, and he and Kay are married.<br/><br/>""The Godfather Part II"" begins right where ""The Godfather"" left off and continues chronicling the struggles of the Corleone family as they attempt to become a legitimate organization amidst the corruption they are tied to. But the film also switches back and forth between this storyline and that of young Vito (Baldini, De Niro), showing us how he rose to power.<br/><br/>""The Godfather Part II"" has about the same pace as the first film, the same beautiful gold-tinted cinematography, the same operatic approach to the subject matter, and I think it is almost on par as far as quality. But the thing that really makes ""Part II"" amazing is Pacino's mesmerizing performance as Michael. He was spellbinding in Part I, as well, but this film really gives him a lot more opportunity to develop his character. The most compelling moments in the film are not the scenes of confrontation or violence, but the scenes of Pacino's intense brooding. No other actor has ever so effectively developed their character without uttering so much as a single solitary syllable. A perfect example of this is the scene where Michael and Fredo embrace after Michael had told him he never wanted to see him again. The look in Pacino's eyes is just out of this world. Actually, Cazale's performance is notable, as well.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's direction skill is at its pinnacle with this brilliant piece of celluloid, and this, unfortunately, was to be his second to last great film (his last being ""Apocalypse Now""). Another thing that majorly contributes to not just Part II, but the entire trilogy's greatness is Nino Rota's absolutely beautiful and undeniably memorable score. Not since 1944's ""Laura"" has a composer utilized a repeated theme so well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ""Godfather"" series failed to become a trilogy of masterpieces when the bland Part III put a blemish on its greatness, but the sheer power and remarkable film-making of the first two chapters will be forever remembered as two of the very finest films ever made, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>9/10"
"aharmas","8","1","3","1 August 2005"," Towering Achievement by Pacino
","This film always manages to lose my interest during its second half. The deterioration of the Corleone family structure is unfortunately a very complex task to portray. With Al Pacino's superb turn as the man who loses his soul, the film hits amazing highs. There are moments in the first half, where we understand the roots of what later became the Corleone empire. Robert De Niro does his best to convey the essence of the young Corleone, but its the reenactment of an era through the loving art direction and touching score that provide the soul of the period.<br/><br/>The story line sets up the decay that destroy Michael Corleone. Sadly, following the road to its devastating resolution can prove to be a rather arduous task. There are unforgettable moments, as the more seasoned performers use subtle gestures and deliver lines that point to the overall tragedy surrounding the different characters.<br/><br/>""Godfather II"" ends with a much darker version of ""Godfather I"". All seems lost because this time, the Don lives on, and manages to keep his dynasty going. The question is at what price?"
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","3","26 July 2005"," an equal sequel
","Everyone has probably heard that ""The Godfather: Part II"" is as good as the original, and it's true. Perhaps it's better, that's debatable. Picking up where the first film left off, we see the Corleones' control over Las Vegas. Also, Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), one of his father's former cohorts. Meanwhile, in flashbacks, we see young Vito Andolini immigrate from the town of Corleone, Sicily, to New York City in the early 20th century. As he ages (the adult Vito is played by Robert DeNiro), Vito becomes increasingly involved in Mafia business.<br/><br/>The climax (at least in my opinion, it was the climax) happens in Cuba on New Year's Eve in 1958. You may recall that the Mafia helped prop up Fulgencio Batista and his reign of terror. Anyway, while Michael and Fredo (John Cazale) are at a party at the Presidential Palace, Michael angrily yells at Fredo ""I know it was you, Fredo! You broke my heart!"" At that moment, just as it turns into 1959, the revolutionary forces enter Havana, proclaiming the revolution's victory. The combination of these two events shows that things won't be the same anymore, whether in the Corleone family or in Cuba. To be certain, Kay (Diane Keaton) has some unexpected news for Michael when he returns home.<br/><br/>The point is, this movie disproves the notion that all sequels suck. This sequel is a masterpiece, with splendid performances by Pacino, Keaton, DeNiro, Cazale, Strasberg, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. But of course, most of all, this movie's superbness owes to director Francis Ford Coppola. He knows exactly how to make a movie, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 10/10."

","Again, what can be said that hasn't already been said?<br/><br/>The acting and direction are flawless, and we get a clearer view of The Family and their background. I've never felt de Niro's performance was Oscar winning because his part in the movie simply isn't big enough, but he should easily have won several others for other performances over the years.<br/><br/>If anything, the plot is more complex and involving than the first film. Pacino's change from the first film is revolutionary, and Cazale is perfect as the unfortunate Fredo, and the rest of the massive cast are excellent.

","What's the point here? Michael distrusts everyone and again have most of everyone killed. Michael turned darker and darker as if he wasn't sinister enough already. I like the DeNiro segment much better. At least he demonstrated a person we can empathize with. Not so with Michael. I know of no one (thank God) like him and same for most of us. His is a totally disgusting,inhuman character without redemption. Why should we even watch over half of the movie with him in it if we don't like the character? It was at least interesting in the first movie that we get to witness the transformation of ""that's my family (not me),Kate"" Michael to cold killer mastermind. Since he had become that, what's the point of watching this character losing more of his humanity as if he had some left. Good thing must be said about the production thought, it was even more sumptuously filmed and choreographed than the original. But that's the only credible thing. By the way has anyone notice Diane Keatin never appear again after getting slapped (a single great shot to the cheek) by Michael?"
"canadude","10","1","3","15 February 2004"," godfather part II is still the second
","*spoilers* I recently decided to give Godfather Part II a second try (no pun intended) and I still must say that I like Part I more. There are several reasons for this and normally I would avoid talking about a movie's predecessor in reviewing it, but it is a *sequel*, and it's called Godfather PART II, not Godfather II. This, of course, implies a direct connection not only to the characters, but also to the story of the first one. So - the second part is both a prequel and a sequel merged into one movie. It's a great prequel in that it tells the story of the rise of Vito Carleone so naturally and realistically that the metamorphosis from boy to gangster is seamless. De Niro is phenomenal as Michael's father, a role performed almost entirely in Italian (hardly a handicap for De Niro whose first language [I believe] is English). He has the emotional range that Al Pacino had in the first Godfather. From extreme benevolence, even grief (Fredo gets sick vs. old Don Carleone in the first movie gets sick) he turns to cold-blooded, calculated murder. However, Godfather Part II focuses primarily on Michael, telling his story as both a continuation of the first part's tale and as an antithesis to Vito Carleone's rise to power. In that, Godfather Part II is one of the best sequel's ever made, it fleshes out the original story and it adds more plot and character depth to the original. The movie doesn't serve at all as a money-making scheme, but rather a second part of a book that's already got you hooked. Still, I belong to the group of the purists, those who enjoy the first part more than the second. While Godfather Part I portrays Michael's almost unknowing (definitely subtle) takeover of the family, Godfather Part II already finds him knowing his way around the family, capable of doing anything to his enemies. It's about Michael's complete collapse - he murders or gets rid of virtually every person in the movie, including (most tragically) his own brother, ultimately alienating himself from the family he seeks to protect. The tragedy here, however, is in some sense less subtle and nuanced than the tragedy of Godfather Part I, which is about a deep and complex father-son relationship that foretells its own ending. There exists an element of love and responsibility that naturally leads to and cannot escape from Michael's return to his family. Godfather Part II re-examines these themes (which detracts from some of its originality - but that is hardly a complaint), but Michael's character has somehow shed any notion of mercy or restraint. In fact, he does not change in any significant way, but merely continues down the path the first film set for him. The murder of his brother is simply yet another point of no return, much like the scene with the doors closing on Diane Keaton's character ending the first film. In any case, my point is that the Michael Carleone section of Godfather Part II is mostly an entertainingly told story that expands on what was already introduced in the first film, which I believe is much stronger. The best part of Godfather Part II is De Niro's performance, and its contrasting role in Michael's descent into continuing alienation and violence. (And of course it is remarkably directed by Francis Ford Coppola, with a good performance by Al Pacino, but it remains in the shadow of the first Godfather - inevitably so.)"
"Angry_Arguer","8","1","3","19 January 2004"," Apocrypha
","This is when Pacino still tried to be human, though right after 'Serpico'. This is in his pre-DePalma days.<br/><br/>That and the plot itself are needless in this case.  As with the original, crime drama plots follow similar story topics.  The differences lie in the acting, editing, characters, and camera.<br/><br/>The editing here is less refined, trying to be Kubrick when this is Coppola. It isn't ponderous, but it's a contradictory style--much like 'The Thin Red Line'.<br/><br/>The camera is the same as before, not trying to do anything we haven't seen. Even Frankenheimer's 'Manchurian Candidate' contains more visual fluency than this effort.<br/><br/>The characters/acting are where the giant U-turn occurs this time.  This has no basis on Puzo's book, but is completely constructed in Coppola's mind and in the actors' presentation.  Are these rational steps being made?  Most aren't.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise--DeNiro as Brando.  In a context like this (instead of vice-versa), the range is almost unlimited.  Coppola is one of few directors to use Brando effectively, as 'Apocalypse' would prove, and here DeNiro does his best work.  Everything after this (Scorsese's works, 'Deer Hunter', 'Heat') becomes useless.  In those cases he is bored.  In 'Untouchables' he's energetic.  Here--he's duplicating a master.<br/><br/>For that reason alone you should see this.  See 'Apocalypse Now' after this to see Coppola do the real cinematic deal.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

The acting is, of course, superb and Robert De Niro is brilliant in his supporting role as the young Vito.  What is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this great movie is that it is almost entirely fresh.  In other words, it was not tied directly to a book like the original and afforded the script writers room to be even more creative.  A masterpiece."

","While I can appreciate its moral complexities, the absolutely brilliant acting, which includes Pacino's most subtle and nuanced performance, and Coppola's fine directorial work, ""The Godfather: Part II"" doesn't have the narrative drive of its predecessor.<br/><br/>Also, the split narrative, bouncing between the history of how the Corleones gained power, and Michael's continuing moral decline, doesn't quite mesh for me. I'm open to the idea that I'm missing something, though I've enjoyed other films with multiple narratives, but Part II seems glued together instead of fitting organically.<br/><br/>It's still a fine film, and though I'd rank it lower than it is currently, it would definitely be in the top seventy-five."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","8","1","3","11 May 2003"," Sequel to a classic
","Two years after the original Godfather was released, the Godfather Part II came out. This time, it scored Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Art- set direction. It has been labeled by many fans of film and critics alike to be the only film that actually is superior to the original. It also remains in Oscar history the only film sequel to win best Picture as well as the original. I beg to differ with the critics and fans. The sheer beauty of the Godfather is lost in this film. It plays upon images that have already been seen before instead of catching the eye of the viewer with better photography. The musical score is a stand out job, really adding to the effect of the film. Al Pacino is good here as the now corrupted Micheal, but his acting seems a bit less focused then it should be and it doesn't seem as if he's really acting. In support is Robert De Niro, who took home his first Oscar and didn't even speak a word of english in the movie. He shines in this role as his life leads onto from being a peasant to being a crime lord. The flashback sequences are frustratingly too organized, and instead of giving the viewer something to ponder about it rather just shows them the images. Coppola's direction is arguably a lot more confident and realistic, another thing that adds to the effect. The script is rather good as well, focusing on each character as specifically as possible, but it's not quite as good as the original. The Godfather Part II loses itself in time, making it over three hours and feeling a bit stretched with the entire Cube sequence. Unfortunately, Roman Polanski's Chinatown was released the same year and lost a majority of it's Oscars to this movie. In my opinion, Chinatown should've taken Best Picture and Best Art- Set direction. The Godfather Part II packs in a lot more stuff then the first one, it tries hard to really knock the message in tight. It does, but the movie itself feels too overdone. Good sequel, nowhere near the original however. 8.5/10"

","A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors.<br/><br/>I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia.

"Magenta_Bob","8","1","4","27 July 2013"," You once told me: 'In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago.
","The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years.<br/><br/>That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed ""don"", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all â€“ the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I."

The brutal side of Michael was slightly reduced as of the previous movie, his character was more powerful than he were violent. Although, Pachino keeps on this particular continual troubled face until the very end, he brings this deep and heavy feeling to his character which sets the mode for the whole movie, and the look he express to some individuals, just like he already killed them in his mind 3 times already.

"donuthaters12","8","1","4","11 July 2013"," A Flaw Preventing This Film From Being A Masterpiece
","This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br/><br/>This film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.<br/><br/>Coppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.<br/><br/>Gordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.<br/><br/>The music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.<br/><br/>I may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch."
"Josh_The_Third","8","1","4","25 June 2013"," A great movie that completes it's prequel
","A foreword: I watched Part I with my friends three days ago. Now I know it is a classic, but the style of the first movie is really anything but modern - a very long slow sit-through that younger movie goers like me might be perplexed with. Which is why I wanted to watch the second part.<br/><br/>Now that was a good decision! sure I won't say part II is a better movie, but it has a slightly different pace, for example it has more scenes. But the more important thing is that it completes part I brilliantly, and perhaps necessarily; <br/><br/>Because the strength of this movie is how the stories of Michael and the story of Vito reflect each other. Separated, those are simple Mafia-esque plots. But the movie shows us the bigger picture: how these men's lives came to be what they are, how they connect, where they differ, etc. The viewer is overwhelmed by the complex meaning underlying this connection and all it's subtle truths, putting everything into a grand perspective like no other movie has done before. <br/><br/>For me this film hasn't been so much about crime and the ethical questions behind it, but more a story of a family, and perhaps a story about an inevitable connection between people's lives, how are bound by this thread of revenge and violence. I mean, all Michael has ever wanted is to keep his family safe and make the corleone legitimate, but alas, he is of course bound by a things that happened decades before he was born.<br/><br/>It's a dark conclusion but the humanity of it is just portrayed great- Making Mikael a very good anti-hero character, much thanx to the excellent Al Pachino of course. Great movie and I will check out the third part once I get the chance."
"gcas44-677-689235","10","1","4","5 May 2013"," The Greatest Piece of Art to Ever Grace the Earth!
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? I do believe that The Godfather: Part II is an example of cinematic gold... Scratch that... Cinematic platinum. Everything, from the acting, story, script, directing, cinematography, sound, lighting; you name it, is perfect. <br/><br/>Many people agree with me that Part II is a tad bit better than Part I. However, many people also don't, only because the great Marlon Brando was not in Part II (not including flashbacks). However, a young Robert De Niro made up for Brando's absence to give possibly the best performance of his life as the young Vito Corleone. He also did a great job in delivering the Sicilian dialect of Italian (since that consisted of most of his lines). <br/><br/>I cannot go on any further without mentioning spoilers, so I will leave it at this. This movie definitely has to be seen before you die. The length of this movie is actually a good thing, as well. It just draws you into it even more, and time flies without you even noticing. So if you have about 3 1/2 hours of time to watch a great movie, put this on and relive the magic. And if it's your first time watching it (be sure to watch Part I first), then you're in for something magical. There's a reason why this film is preserved in the National Film Registry and the Library of Congress."
"TStefanov","10","1","4","15 July 2012"," A masterpiece of modern cinema
","The Godfather Part II is arguably the greatest film ever made. Every single bit of it is a model of perfection, it's just amazing. Francis Ford Coppola has managed to do something very difficult - to surpass the first part of The Godfather saga. The cinematography, the dialogue, the script, the acting and every other part of this movie are impeccable and amazing. I strongly believe that Al Pacino's performance in this film is maybe the greatest acting performance of all time. The way he develops his character from a young, innocent boy to a ruthless crime lord is mind-blowing. I cannot believe that he lost the Oscar, since this performance, in my humble opinion, is the best in his career. Robert De Niro is also mesmerizing, less than Pacino though, but nevertheless he won a very well-deserved Oscar. Robert Duvall shines as Tom Hagen and John Cazale is very convincing as Fredo. To sum it all up - this movie is a masterpiece, a must-see, it's literally flawless!"
"xliimiit","10","1","4","30 January 2012"," Absolutely Incredible
","This movie is a complete work of genius. I do not even consider it a sequel just a complete equal to its counterpart being the Godfather. The movie battles between two stories of the past and what is happening in the present day. It shows the corruption of the dark side of the American dream throughout the 1900's with Michael's story going on in the present and the background story of Vito beginning the advancement of his family in the early 1900's. The characters in this movie are very complex and evoke strong emotions throughout the movie. The audience feels the decisions they make as if they are the ones deciding. The work of cinematography is amazing. The camera angles and lighting are the most apparent in making specific scenes timeless. It has won many awards and is considered to be one of the greatest American made movies ever created. This movie is rated R for adult situations/ violence and language. It is also very time consuming coming to three hours and twenty minutes yet it is worth every minute of it."

Robert De Niro stars as Don Vito Corleone and makes a big impact in the film rising up through the ranks of the tough streets of America and raising his own family and mob. A political war which was evidently true to the Mafia and probley still is to pay for there way of life and to get the cops of there back. Al Pacino plays a great Mafiosi boss which you can imagine if you've ever seen Scarface. I feel he plays with more emotion in this than Scarface and maybe his best film.

Reassembling many of the talents who helped make the ""The Godfather"" A Legend and the most successful motion picture of its time, Francis Ford Coppola Produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision like any other. The Godfather 2 is undeniably the best sequel ever made, and maybe even superior to the Original ""The Godfather"" which is considered to be the best movie ever made by many critics and actors. The movie is one of the few movies close to perfection. Francis proved his worth and created the level of greatness when it came to direction in the movie industry through The Godfather Saga. The Acting skills shown in The Godfather 2 by Robert De Niro and AL Pacino are truly something you have to see to believe. Robert De Niro portrayed the character of the young Vito Corleone with such effort that he actually made people believe he was the young Marlon Brando. But AL Pacino even topped De Niro and gave a performance which is one of the few characters to be present on every list of great characters in the film history. AL Pacino's Portrayal of Micheal Corleone was so believable that people forget that they are watching a movie when he was performing. Legendary method actor Lee Strasbourg also made his debut in the film industry with this movie and he proved why he is considered to be such an Icon in the world of Acting. Even the characters which are not that important leave a mark of their own. The Godfather 2 is truly one of the greatest films ever made, and there never will be a sequel like this again or one this good."

","This movie is by far one of the best movies i have ever scene. There is no doubt that Francis Ford Coppola took much time on each aspect of the movie. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, with excellent shots portraying the rich history Sicily has. The acting is, yet again, flawless. Robert De Niro shows his true skill portraying young Vito, growing up in a corrupt and violent world. But who steals every scene is Al Pachino, playing Michael Corleone. Al Pachino portrays a man who is slowly breaking apart. A man who is torn between his family life, and his life of crime. Michael has gone from being an innocent military man, to a cold and bitter monster. Pachino held this role very delicately and with precision. What do you get out of that? An excellent performance which shows that he is truly a master of his craft. The plot is quite literally a roller-coaster of excitement, and surprise. With a sensational mixture of Michael fighting for his sanity being the don of the biggest mob in the US, intricately knitted with flashbacks of how Vito Corleone came to power. This movie is not a sequel, it is a clever brother of the film made two years before. A true masterpiece and will stand the test of time."
"supernma","10","1","4","13 June 2010"," One of the greatest films ever made
","""The Godfather Part II"" is Francis Ford Coppola's finest masterpiece. Some may say that title belongs to ""The Godfather"" or ""Apocalypse Now"", which are great films as well, but not quite as astounding as this one.<br/><br/>This is a film about family, about crime, about a marriage, about a father and his son. Spanning from the early 1900s to the 1950s, the scope alone is awe-inspiring. Telling both the story of Vito Corleone and his son Michael, jumping back and forth, a curiously touching, poetic kind of storytelling comes to life. The film is very unconventional in that regard, but it's also a fantastic family crime drama, with moments so intense and devastating that you'll never forget it.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is beautifully photographed and dressed, and the acting is some of the best you will ever see. All around, it's a perfect film. There's not much more one can say about it than that."

"rmax304823","8","1","4","25 May 2009"," Excellent dramatic story.
","I suppose everyone already knows the story -- Al Pacino as Michael Corleone rises to power in 1958, with multiple flashbacks to Robert DeNiro as his father Vito in the 1920s -- so we can dispense with a summary. Actually, the story itself is less important than the fact that the film naturally divides itself in two -- its execution and its moral message.<br/><br/>The execution is splendid in every regard. Coppola's direction is deliberately paced. There is a conspicuous absence of unsubtle and dizzying directorial razzle-dazzle, thank God -- a movie that doesn't give you a headache.<br/><br/>The performances are nearly flawless. There isn't a sour note in the entire cast, and especially outstanding is the acting of Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo (author of ""A Hatfull of Rain""), and Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci, who tackles the role with an understated grandiosity -- what operatic flourishes! But everyone is good.<br/><br/>The photography by Gordon Willis, as in its predecessor, is dominated by a burnished amber except for wintry Lake Tahoe where various shades of blue and a steely gray predominate. The production designer deserves credit. Nino Rota's orchestral score is memorable, a folksy melancholic tune. The script has some neat tag lines. When Strasberg and Pacino meet, they shake hands and exchange warm wishes, then when Pacino admits that he's going to kill a colleague of Strasberg, the latter shrugs, turns to his tuna fish sandwich, and says, ""He's small potatoes."" It's a chilling moment. The avuncular, sentimental old man is a ruthless murderer. That's the execution. The -- I don't know what to call it. I don't like the term ""moral of the movie."" Sounds like a high school term paper. And I'm not sure exactly what ""intentionality"" means in phenomenology, so I'll just say ""intention."" The intention of the film is thoroughly corrupt. Maybe Puzo and Coppola realized it, maybe not.<br/><br/>I think the director did, though. That's why he splices so much carnage into the rituals. Almost every scene of violence takes place during some sort of party or religious festival. I think -- I HOPE -- that Coppola was aware of the irony between the rites of intensification and the fact that the principles they embody are ignored almost at will. It's important to have your baby baptized as soon as possible, just as it's important to shoot a miscreant in the chest.<br/><br/>In a sense all the rituals, all the religion, are fakes. There is no license permitted, unlike Irish wakes, Polish weddings, or Russian parties. If, like Gazzo, you have too much wine and accidentally spill some on the vast tablecloth at an al fresco party, the glances are severe. No sexy dancing either. In a way, despite the faux gaiety, it's something like living in a prison, especially for women.<br/><br/>We're supposed to feel sorry for Michael who, at the end, is seen sitting alone in solemn grandeur, emotionally bankrupt. But Michael is really a rat who deserves everyone's contempt and execution by the state. It doesn't matter that he's young, handsome, well-spoken, powerful and rich. He's broken more laws than anyone can count. He lies, cheats, and murders at will. Those murders include an innocent whore who is horribly butchered simply in order to entrap the Senator from Nevada in Michael's thrall. He betrays his friends. He throws out his wife and prevents her from taking ""his"" children. He murders his own brother for a past mistake for which he's already been punished.<br/><br/>The original Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, had a set of allegiances extending outward from the family at its center -- to his ethnic group, his neighborhood, his co-conspirators in the business, and beyond that to some vague construct called ""the nation."" Al Pacino's Don has whittled it all down. At the center is ego, and beyond that, business. He's become a classical villain, a Richard III who has plucked down that crown, and if he now has buyer's remorse -- well, he should have thought things out earlier. <br/><br/>His tragedy is nothing compared to mine, which has been Shakespearean in its grandeur, really. In my adolescence, the love of my life, Juliet, poisoned herself. And when, in all modesty, I tried to become Emperor of Rome, the treacherous bastards assassinated me."
"Pedro_H","8","1","4","10 October 2006"," Very well made pulp fiction with a fantastic cast - but still a historical whitewash.
","A look back and look forward at how the Mafia don Vito Corleone gained his original power and the continuing saga of how a son (Michael) chooses to drive forward the criminal empire of his late father.<br/><br/>As the great American novel has not been written (an opinion just as popular in America as elsewhere) our cousins over the sea have no option but to over praise the work of better-than-average pulp writers. The vastly overrated Ernest Hemmingway, the junk master that was a Peter Benchley and the schlock with snobbery that is Thomas Harris. Don't get me wrong, all very readable - but great art? Great vision? Something you couldn't live a full and happy life without?<br/><br/>As the groundbreaking film maker Spaniard Luis Bunuel once said: ""Today's culture is unfortunately inseparable from economic and military power. A ruling Nation can impose its culture and give a worldwide fame to a second-rate writer like Hemingway. Steinbeck is important due to American guns. Had Dos Passos and Faulkner been born in Paraguay or in Turkey, who'd read them?"" The self-opinions of Mario Puzo (script and book) are probably in line with the above. Until he wrote the Godfather he even worried about keeping food on the table. How can you consider yourself an artist when you are writing rubbish like Earthquake? However, give him credit, he saw Hell's Kitchen for real and it shows.<br/><br/>With the Godfather saga many people mistake a heavy subject for heavy writing. However well done it is (production values are sky high and the casting is a dream) this isn't anything more than a thousand TV writers couldn't knock up. While simultaneously looking back and looking forward can be confusing (one of these things that you need to warned about) it leads you to believe that the ex don is a better person than the future don simply because he had so much pushed on to his plate and had to make tough decisions. However he kills to replace the corrupt and becomes equally corrupt himself. Only on a bigger scale.<br/><br/>Men of honour is nonsense - they beat/killed, threatened and bribed. They never made any money, they simply took money. If you are interested they took just as readily from criminals (like drug dealers) as they did from honest people. While this shows power being taken at the point of a gun - where are the goons beating the grocery store owner because he wouldn't pay the protection money? Such a scene would shatter this movie like it would a 1,000 foot drop would shatter a Chinese Ming vase.<br/><br/>Coppola doesn't like film editors - they want to cut out scenes of people looking in to the middle distance, waiting for people to arrive and generally repeating themselves. The Mafia is male world and the women don't have much of a life - they don't even get to bring in cups of tea. The men are not happy people, but if they paid their electricity bills and had a hobby it would help. The moral is an obvious one - money doesn't buy happiness. But it allows you to be miserable in (Long Island) comfort.<br/><br/>Director Coppola and writer Puzo had no choice but to write this as a tragedy. They lay it on too thick though, as they are trying to bring in higher morals to a story that doesn't have it and (as I said above) it doesn't want to kick over enough rocks. This accepted the cast is amazing - Robert DeNiro is on especially fine form - but the message(s) are uneven and dubious. All cons are full time liars and they even lie to themselves - in this little world the words mean little and we have too many of them."

The best scene is the surprise party for Vito and it was just brillant to add that scene in. I think that is one ingredient that helped this movie pick up best picture. Not to mention the godfather 2 is the first sequel to win best picture. This sequel may be better than the original and if not it is just as entertaining which makes at a good sequel.

","Been years since i last seen these films and it was time to view them once again. This part 2 i found to be a very long, drawn out affair. Reading the other numerous reviews on this site, one would think this is the movie of all movies. Well, perhaps that may be the case for some. But for the average movie goer to which this movie was made for, it was totally lacking compared to the first, original Godfather. There was not much for character development which made you feel distant to the characters. Too many scenes of unnecessary standing around with poor dialog that really needed a Brando type boost. I could not find that presence here at all. It was indeed a watchable movie with great cinematography and that classic look. Overall this movie seemed to abandon the gangster/mob genre and become more daisy drama. I think in the first half of the movie there was one gun scene and a mild at that. It truly dragged along carrying only the die hard fans of this saga and leaving behind a trail of dissatisfaction for those whom watched the original movie and expected epic type, early mob style composition."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","6","1","5","12 August 2017"," Overrated.
","There has been an argument raging for year about which is the better movie, Part one or Part two. It isn't even a contest. Part one is a much much muchhhhhh better film. If you took away the Robert De Niro's scenes, you can make the argument that this movie is in fact a bad film. Frankly De Niro saved this movie. Without the flashbacks this film is uninteresting and boring. Even the actors look bored. Sure, some parts of the plot are interesting but overall the execution this good enough to honestly make you give a sh!t. The first Godfather movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie on the other hand is one of the most overrated movies of all time. The next time I watch it I'm just going to save myself time and fast forward to the De Niro parts."

","This film Directed by Francis Ford Coppola is a absolute classic! In this film you can really see how much work was put into the film. Every scene is so diligently done that even the hard dialogue scenes are smooth and captivating. All of the acting was phenomenal along with the scenes that take place in Italy. As a viewer you get that authentic feel of the time and place throughout the whole film. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was a perfect fit for the role, he played each scene with such composure that made it so entertaining. This is overall one of my favorite movies of all time and I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys mafia movies or cinema in general! I give it a Ten out of Ten!"

"jcbutthead86","10","1","5","31 March 2014"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made,The Greatest Sequel Of All Time And An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful And Unforgettable Mastepiece From Francis Coppola.
","The Godfather Part II is not only one of the greatest films ever mad but is also the greatest sequel of all-time that is an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from a great cast,a wonderful script and a haunting score. All of those elements make The Godfather Part II film making and Francis Coppola at their best.<br/><br/>Set in Las Vegas,Nevada in the 1950s and in New York City in the 1910s and 20s,The Godfather Part II tells two parallel rise and fall stories. The rise story depicts the rise of young Vito Corleone(Robert De Niro),showing Vito as an Italian immigrant who gets into a life of Crime and becomes a Don. The fall is the story of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is still running the Corleone family in Las Vegas but has to deal with betrayal and the family falling apart.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is the greatest and most ambitious sequel of all-time that is not only an instant classic from the moment you watch it but also an amazing and powerful follow-up to the original giving viewers not only a great continuation of The Godfather saga but giving viewers the sequel to end all movie sequels. I won't say which film is better because in my opinion saying Part I or Part II is better than one another would be disrespectful to the two films because both are works of art. With The Godfather Part II Director Francis Ford Coppola has created not only created just a sequel but a film that is more epic with a bigger and larger scope than the first film giving viewers a powerful experience that never lets you go from the opening frame. With The Godfather Part II viewers are not just given a movie about the Mob,Gangsters or the Crime world but a movie about the on going tragedy,sadness and doom that hangs over The Corleone family while showing the rise of a young Vito Corleone. This film is probably more darker than the first film because when we see the fall of Michael Corleone and the rest of the Corleone family is almost like the fall of the Roman Empire. Unlike most sequels The Godfather Part II doesn't make the same story like the original but gives us something new and fresh with a great tale that is on par with the first film. The Godfather Part II is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not just in the way it's film but the length of the film(at 3 hrs and 20 minutes)but the film moves by seamlessly that you forget you are watching a three and half hour film. I think the film moves at a fast pace is because of the amazing storytelling that Coppola does with the film giving the movie a nonlinear style with the movie moving back and forth with the time periods but never getting lost in the narrative. In GFII we are given two tales about Michael's downfall and young Vito's rise. Michael,while still a don and running the Corleone family has become more ruthless and colder then he was in the first film further isolating himself from his other family members and becoming less trusting with the people all around him whether it's business associates or family where everyone was his enemy which leads to Michael's tragic fall. In contrast we see a young Vito Corleone,a man who is about business but is also about his family and friends despite being in the violent world of the Mob and Vito handles things with calm and cool style. When we see Michael and Vito the lighting is different with Michael constantly being surrounded by darkness and Vito is surrounded in bright light showing the contrast in atmosphere. With Michael and Vito we see how complex and different they are not just as Dons but as people. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is outstanding with scenes and dialog that is memorable and on par with the first film. While GFII isn't as violent or bloody as the original and doesn't have a huge body count GFII still has a few violent scenes that done with attention to detail and build-up. The ending of The Godfather Part II is one of the best endings in movie history because it's sad,tragic and somber matching the dark tone of the rest of the movie and the ending will punch you in the gut. A powerful ending.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Al Pacino is excellent,powerful and at his best as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being cold,intense and ruthless in the performance. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as Young Vito Corleone,with De Niro being cool and charismatic. Robert DuVall is wonderful once again as Tom Hagen,The Corleone's lawyer. John Cazale is amazing as Fredo Corleone,Michael's dim-witted older brother. Diane Keaton is outstanding as Kay,Michael's suffering wife. Talia Shire is sensational as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Lee Strasberg is terrific as Hyman Roth,an old time gangster and associate of the Corleone's. Michael V. Gazzo is captivating as Frank Pentangelli,a member of the Corleone family. Bruno Kurby and John Aprea are great Young Clemenza and Young Tesso. G.D Sparadin(Senator Pat Geary),Dominic Chianese(Johnny Ola),Frank Sivero(Genco)and Richard Bright(Al Neri)give great performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is amazing and stylish,with Coppola bringing a beautiful and haunting visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Coppola.<br/><br/>The score by Nino Rota is outstanding,powerful,haunting and beautiful matching the main scenes in the film. Great score,Rota.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster films,Mob movies,the first Godfather or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part II,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest films and sequels of all-time and is a movie that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"nrr817","10","1","5","1 February 2014"," Equal to the Perfect Original
","The Godfather: Part II, along with The Godfather, is the greatest film ever made. In all likelihood, anyone else who appreciates great films that has seen the two would agree that both are absolute masterpieces of film and are as close to perfect as you can get. <br/><br/>Part II maintained the rest of the core cast from the original with Michael (which Pacino deserved an Oscar for his portrayal), Tom, Kay, Fredo, and Connie. While Part II lacks Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Sonny (except for a flashback), Clemenza and Sollozzo, it makes up for it with De Niro's young version of Vito, Hyman Roth, and Frank Pentangeli. The beautiful music also carries over from the original. The two stories of Michael expanding his empire to Nevada and Cuba and how young Vito started his career in New York are perfectly played out.In fact, what many people don't know is that while the original is based on Mario Puzo's novel, Part II, with the exception of the story how Vito's rise to power, is completely original material. <br/><br/>The Godfather: Part II is a must watch for anyone who truly loves film. It is one of those films that you should watch at least once in your lifetime."
"epibee","7","1","5","17 February 2010"," Some touching moments, some over the top
","The Godfather Part II is an overall better experience than Part I mainly because of Robert De Niro's charismatic presence in the flashback scenes. Otherwise, the film has several unresolved twists and forced situations, which keep lingering even after it ends. <br/><br/>Michael (Pacino) is almost a psychic man who can read tiny almost invisible cues and understands what is in the future from mere observation of other's interactions. He plans ahead of everyone double his age, and removes hurdles from his path often before they are exposed. With the help of Tom (Duvall) he plans murders and defamation (senator in the brothel) and evades legal committees with unusual ease and adeptness which seemed pretty unreal. <br/><br/>Same goes for Vito's first murder, it was rather coincidental that Fanucci's family was absent on that day, and Vito's gunshot noise was exactly timed to be masked by the firecrackers, even when Fanucci clearly saw his assassin and could have counter attacked if the shooting was late by seconds. Or when Vito murders Ciccio, how his knife travels across the ribs, and how can he escape so easily from Ciccio's own house with a wounded gunman on the back of his car.<br/><br/>The movie lacks reality in several places, but there are some touching scenes like the flashback with the brothers during the end, or how baby Sonny cries on the rug that his father robbed for the first time. Or when Vito thanks his employer and refuses the gifts and comes back home to his wife after getting fired, and of course the strong sepia tone all over, which make this film stand out from the rest.<br/><br/>But I am sure, real life gangsters should not be so lucky as Michael or Vito Corleone were in this film."

","The first time I saw this movie, it made me up! although I saw the Godfather series not in the order because first I saw part 2 then the last one and after all the first one ""THE GODFATHER"". But when I think, among them part two was something else! The Godfather is a violent movie which is about a mafia family and their story and it is really a good one! Specially because it is from a perfect director and writer ""Francois Ford Capello"". I really recommend you to see all parts. This movie has a very slow theme and if you liked this director's film I recommend you to watch ""Apocalypse Now"" too 'cause that is a good movie as well."
"gazzo-2","Null","1","5","9 October 1999"," its good----BUT
","IT's not as good as the first one. This one is convoluted; some of the plot twists arbitrary(just who ordered Micheal Gazzo's attempted garroting? Who killed Frankie Five Angels? etc.) -it kind of plays like a film with a script that was being revised even while it was being shot.<br/><br/>And face it-no Marlon Brando-that is hard to make up for, you know? His presence in the first film was partially what made it such a classic.<br/><br/>
Now-don't get me wrong-I like this film a lot. Micheal V. Gazzo is one of my favorites and anything that used his talent to good effect is alright in my book. Loved Lee Strasberg doing the Meyer Lansky bit, terrific performance. Pacino, Cazale, Keaton, etc. are all great. This film has great suspense and some tragic scenes(Fredo goes fishing)-and I liked the parts showing the Senate's investigation of the Mob. All well and good.<br/><br/>Can't say that about the flashbacks, Deniro is alright and the tone is fine, but it Really does slow things down in a big way-I don't think you'd lose all that much if they just had yanked that chunk right outta the film completely. Allegedly Coppola was thinking of doing just that while making this, but didn't. You decide. It doesn't work as well for me.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good movie, ***1/2 outta ****. Def. better than the 3rd..."
"Leofwine_draca","8","1","6","7 April 2014"," Good, but not as good as the first
","A lot of people seem to consider THE GODFATHER PART II to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.<br/><br/>The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.<br/><br/>While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first."

","The Godfather Part II was a very good movie, very well written and acted, but not my favorite Godfather movie. Let me tell you why.<br/><br/>I didn't like when the movie would cut from one storyline to the other. (I like to focus on one thing at a time) Michael showed a very dark side of him in this movie, I.E hitting Kay, I like that. That's one of the things I liked about the movie, I like seeing a dark side of a character and how well the actor can play that part and Al Pacino portrayed him excellently . But they didn't go deep enough into Michael's emotions, you really didn't get a chance to understand him as well as in the Godfather III.<br/><br/>In all honesty I think that the Godfather and the Godfather III are the best in the series and are a major contribution to the cinema, I just hope they won't make a forth one. That'll ruin the series for sure."

"FilmCriticLalitRao","6","1","7","26 October 2014"," The Godfather Part II : American actress Diane Keaton shines in her role as Kay, a lady who would like to prevent the growth of a mafia family.
","As far as scope and size of a film is concerned, The Godfather Part II is a lot different than The Godfather I. It shows the extent to which a mafia family would go in order to eliminate its enemies. This is just one of several opinions a viewer can have about this film. It is for this reason there is nothing like brotherly love. A brother who has betrayed his brother has to be able to face the brother who has been betrayed. The viewers get to see the games which mafia bosses and politicians play with each other. It is amazing to watch how politicians squeeze gangsters finally in order to make quick money. They are also around when a mafia network decides to extend its operations from USA to Cuba. However, it would be perfectly fine to state that this film is also an extension of the concerns that were raised in The Godfather I. Director Francis Ford Coppola was right in choosing to direct two parallel stories in order to establish the presence of Corleone family in viewers' minds. There is a caveat related to the use of Italian language. The lack of subtitles when Italian is spoken by actors makes the comprehension of the film difficult as not everybody can be expected to know Italian."
"Doylenf","7","1","7","31 March 2008"," Not quite up to the first Godfather film--but chilling enough...
","""I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out. Just my enemies."" So says Michael Corleone (AL PACINO) in THE GODFATHER: PART II.<br/><br/>Pacino plays the part with somber seriousness that becomes a bit one dimensional by the time the film is midway over. Nor is the story as compelling as the first Godfather film. But you have to hand it to director Coppola, he keeps the viewer glued to the screen even when the pauses between dialog is a bit longer than needed. (No wonder the film is so long!!). And with the risk of being politically incorrect, you can almost smell the garlic in every scene, so realistic are the accents and the background flavor of the entire film.<br/><br/>So many plot developments are almost throwaways because the screenplay seems to be deliberately ambiguous about certain plot elements. And yet, the film has a certain holding power and all of the performances are more than competent. Especially poignant--and chilling--is the scene where Fredo's fishing expedition takes place with stormy looking clouds setting the eerie scene to perfection as the expected murder takes place.<br/><br/>With murderous intentions just around the corner in practically every scene, it's a fascinating film to watch, especially since the murders themselves are so deftly handled by the actors involved. DIANE KEATON is especially convincing in the final confrontation with Pacino.<br/><br/>I don't think GODFATHER II compares favorably to the original film with Brando, particularly since it's not always successful in telling two stories--the one involving the young Vito (ROBERT DeNIRO) and the present story--but it still packs a wallop when it gets to the intense moments. The double strand of stories doesn't always mesh well, a weakness of structure that hurts the film. Despite this major flaw, it's a superior piece of film-making."
"craig-hopton","7","1","8","13 June 2014"," Great performances from De Niro and Pacino but oh so slow
","Very similar to The Godfather - long (even longer than part 1) and oh so slow. It's just not my cup of tea at all. I don't find the story all that interesting - various criminal masterminds trying to wrestle power off each other.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this movie OK is the performances of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It really is a tour de force from both of them. Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone, is a nasty piece of work. He tries to emulate his father Vito Corleone, but he is mistrusting and has an evil streak. He's prepared to cut off, in fact kill, close family, and will not be satisfied until he gets his way. Al Pacino plays it brilliantly.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, playing the young Vito Corleone, makes a great contrast. More relaxed, friendly, but also prepared to commit crime and kill to forward the interests of his family. But you can't help but feel he has a warm heart.<br/><br/>Great performances like this aren't enough to turn a 3 hour plus dull storyline into a great movie though. I still got bored."

","Three years ago, I watched The first Godfather and while I enjoyed it, I didn't think of it as such a great film, partly citing the roles of Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Here, they're both still being somewhat underused but Ms. Keaton has a great scene when she reveals what really happened to her upcoming baby and Ms. Shire has a nearly as such scene when she mentions Fredo near the end. Speaking of whom, John Cazale is fine in reprising the role as the weak Corleone brother. And Al Pacino was probably at his very best in this, his second feat at portraying Michael Corleone especially during scenes with his mentor Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth. Francis Ford Coppola is aces as both the co-writer (with creator Mario Puzo) and director as he handles scenes from both the late '50s concerning Michael and the early 20th century concerning his father Vito, here played in an Oscar-winning turn by Robert De Niro speaking mostly in Italian. So on that note, I highly recommend The Godfather: Part II."

","The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br/><br/>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.<br/><br/>Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar."
"thinbeach","5","0","3","5 February 2019"," An offer you can refuse
","If you are going to watch unlikeable characters do unlikeable things, they ought to at least have some charisma. In the original this was provided by Vito and Sonny, whose presence here is sorely missed. Exascerbating the issue is that Michael has no further character development, with his transition from innocent son to murderous mafia overloard already complete, and nothing new added. There is not even any thematic progression - it ends on the exact same note as the original - that this is a bad life to live.<br/><br/>The film attempts to make up for these shortcomings by increasing scope, and we travel all across the us, to Sicily and Cuba, looking for other crooked rich guys to murder - I mean - do business with. With flashbacks to the younger years of Vito Corleone, this film is really two films in one. The flashbacks do nothing to aid the modern story, nor seem very believable, but in location and character are far more interesting, and had the filmmakers focused their sole attention there, might have made a very good prequel. I do love the sets, costumes and colour - not unlike an old oil painting - but it feels truncated. They must have been looking everywhere for scenes to cut, given its run time."

Did she not see the first movie?<br/><br/>Diane Keaton's character in The Godfather: Part II is a complete idiot. Diane Keaton's ""I had an abortion!"" monologue is grating on the nerves, in part because of her poor acting and in part because of her character's stupidity. However, in reviewing the second installment of one of the most overrated franchises in film history, I have to mention that scene. The other, much more famous part to the film is Al Pacino's ""kiss of death"". You can take ten seconds and watch that clip, or you can sit down and watch the entire three and a half hours.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro shows up in this movie, in an oddly-lit, hazy saturated, flashback to Vito Coleone's youth. I don't know why anyone cared so much about Marlon Brando that they wanted to watch scene after scene about a younger version of him and why he became bad, how he became worse, and all in Italian. Sure, you can watch a very young Robert De Niro speaking in a foreign language and killing people, but you can also rent any number of other Robert De Niro movies and turn on the subtitles.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>If a duration of 2:55 wasn't enough meat for you in Part I, Part II clocks in at an immense 3:22. This films tells the story Michael Corleone's upbringing in Sicily and into the 1950's as a Don in New York and his ambition to expand the family business into Vegas, Florida and Cuba. Much of this film revolves around family relationships and how hard it is to keep trust with various family members as well as others in his...line of work. It additionally portrays that the more power, respect or control Michael strives for the more he actually loses what matters most; trying to be vague there. That is the 10,000ft overview. This movie flows in from Part I and smoothly matches the tone and atmosphere and brutal violent moments. The absence of Brando is noticeable but of course Pacino has the chops to carry you through. It is a true epic."
"carlos37andre","9","0","1","30 December 2017"," It stills great, but Part I is better
","The movie is basically perfect in almost all the elements. Acting (Al Pacino is once again destroying on the role, De Niro is also great, well, everybody are great here), Coppola's direction is fantastic. The movie itself is technically perfect.<br/><br/>But, for me, some things make the movie not better as the first one. The first was (for me) straight to the point, it have one thing, and it moves the plot all along. Well, this isn't a rule or something, the movie can make something diferent and also be great (and this movie is great), but, some things dont fit as much for me. The whole young Don plot, at the end, I didn't saw that much that make this whole part of the movie all that relevant. It doesn't show really how Vito grow up on the mafia thing, I don't know, the parts are good, the mix with some scene of the present are really great, but, at the end, if their aren't here, the movie will still works the same. Another thing is the story of the movie itself, seems like they shows somethings, but not much as they should show, seems like that goal was to show 20 years of his life, and this is it.<br/><br/>But dont get me wrong, the movie is fantastic, was the longest movie that I saw and I really was hopping for more at the end, doesn't look like it's more than 3 hours long, and this is fantastic.<br/><br/>In the end of the movie is great to look how diferent Mike has became from Vito, when in the last scenes we see him almost completely alone, he lost all his family, and he has not became a better Don that his ever was.<br/><br/>Well, in short, The Godfather - Part II is a amazing film, but, for me, the masterpiece is the first one."
"Wuchakk","7","0","2","20 September 2017"," The ongoing story of Michael Corleone is mostly one-note drama while the story of young Vito is compelling
","RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part II"" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as 'Godfather' with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vito's life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.<br/><br/>MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michael's wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husband's shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.<br/><br/>The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michael's story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the character's interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. I'm not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. I'm just saying that he's not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. He's just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.<br/><br/>The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Life's hard enough without taking that shady route.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO it's not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. It's good for what it is, but it's overrated by people who can't see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film it's almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know it's sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC.

"InnerConflict","Null","0","2","17 July 2017"," (Spoilersreview!) Sure it's great, but seriously? How snobby can a fan base be? (Spoilers)
","The movie is great from a story perspective, it has great characters and acting, it's decent in execution but not perfect and it has a great score with a good length which adds sadly only to the mediocre pacing.<br/><br/>While everything is crafted well, some flaws still exist.<br/><br/>One being the child actors performance. His mother is shot in front of him and his facial expressions would make him seem like a facially catatonic schizophrenic. Not a single tear. Born psychopath? Despite him being portrayed as a person with heart for his loved ones, even if he has to go cliché godfather on Alfredo... Ludonarrative dissonance by accident. The prequel part is an average execution at best, with some really cheap text explaining what should have been shown instead of what they kept in it to drag unnecessary scenery and ambiance. A lot of deleted scene worthy material. You could cut time a big amount by not stretching so many moments unnecessarily and instead give me an actual reason to connect to Michael in his early years. The useless time jumping instead going proper with the development in a timeline, because it doesn't matter for understanding the story any way it's presented, so why not just cut to the chase and save the jumpery and just properly go from start to finish? Oh yeah, because people think it makes for some actual understanding of the actions in the present if you blend in the past. Sadly watching the past first and then the present would have had given 1 to 1 the same understanding to the viewer. Also the endless burials and festival scenes. Side character scenes where no one gives a crap 5 secs later, because the effect, the reason the next scene has to be fueled with, with the action of the prior, is not always reasonable to even been shot. Especially so many scenes in the time they show Vito raising Michael. Vito having no job wasn't the reason to become what he did, the reason to bring the streets don down in COMBINATION of needing to care for Michael is a solid reason which could have been boiled down to a more efficient scene. It's draggy and in the good moments. Michael's bodyguard trying to kill Hyman Roth, but he is failing as the regime soldiers march in at the wrong moment. Instead the director decides to shoot the scene so fast you don't know if Hyman AND the bodyguard are dead or just the bodyguard. Instead you anticipate the next scene where it's explained by Michael saying Hyman survived. And it's always happening like that. Not to mention, yes, this tries to be mature as possible but seriously. All the empty threats of striking at the right moment etc, and failing miserably with such cringe worthy scenes such as hyman's assassination... give me a break. Whenever the movie tried a climax, it either dragged it, broke it or failed at it, even if it's intentional, it's not satisfactory. What the movie was best at: good actors, with good dialogue, good acting and good presentation. What it failed at: pacing, climaxes, proper resolutions (best one actually was when it was an abortion and not a stillbirth) and often more than not, some clichés here and there with cringe worthy acting like with the character of Don Fanucci."

","The original ""Godfather"" ended with Kay literally being shut out of her husband's business (a deafening statement on her future). The same thing happens again in ""Part II"" but with devastating results. And that's emblematic of the movie as a whole; it marks every box on the sequel checklist (more this, bigger that) but in the context of a profoundly downbeat story. The brilliance of this film is the use of flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone (De Niro). It's contrasting his rise with Michael's fall and moral decay, tracking the various bombshells in each man's life (the hits on Fanucci and Ciccio, an abortion, 'You broke my heart, Fredo.""). It's ideal for showing just how badly Michael is operating under the strain of power. The paranoia is palpable. <br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part II"" is always the movie that's cited when discussing superior sequels. I don't know that I'd go that far, but I think it's a fantastic movie regardless, and certainly warrants any claims to greatness. If anything, it lacks the original's tight and near-perfect packaging, but makes up for that in undeniable ambition. Both are exceptional, but for different reasons. <br/><br/>8/10"

"CinematicInceptions","7","0","2","22 June 2017"," A disappointing continuation.
","Perhaps I just didn't pay enough attention while watching this second installment, but I though there was a lot lacking in this movie compared to the first Godfather. There were some good scenes and a few great lines, but as a whole there was not a lot contained in this story.<br/><br/>I liked the flashback at the end that showed how Michael has isolated himself from the rest of the family; it was a fitting cap to the events leading up to it. But otherwise I thought the story lacked direction. I got that Hyman Roth was an enemy, but the nature of his relationship with Michael and the Corleone empire was unclear to me. The plot as a whole for Michael's story line was just too hard to follow, and maybe that's because I just didn't do a good job watching it, but I paid pretty close attention the whole time and it still lost me at several points.<br/><br/>Vito's story line was more interesting to watch, and I actually would have preferred if the whole movie had centered on his rise to power in New York. DeNiro was well cast as the young Vito, though I don't know that he deserved an Oscar for his performance. I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a parallel between Michael's and Vito's stories, but if there was I couldn't see it. As seen in the first movie, Michael cares about keeping the family together in a very different way than Vito did, but I didn't see a lot of that here.<br/><br/>Overall though, it moved pretty slow and wasn't great to watch. Going back and reading the quotes page, there were scenes, lines, and characters that I had no memory of. There was just a different feel created between this and the first movie, which I did not like. Obviously a lot of people did because it's almost as highly touted as the original, but the characters just didn't seem as smart in this one. People like Fredo, Pentangeli, and even Hyman Roth brought the IQ down even for the more clever and ruthless characters like Michael and Tom Hagen.<br/><br/>It's not bad, it was just disappointing and makes me not want to see Part III. If you haven't seen this yet, I would think of this like a knock-off TV show to the original Godfather. It's the same world and has a lot of the same elements, but the two are loosely connected to the point that this second installment feels almost like a reboot that came out 20 years later as a sort of tribute to the original. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."
"RossRivero99","10","0","1","12 April 2017"," A masterful crime movie
","Even though ""The Godfather: Part II"" isn't as good as the first ""Godfather movie it is still one of the best mo movies ever made and is probably one of the best movie sequels ever done in all of movie history. The movie shifts back between the present day in the past but in the present the movie picks up where the first movie left off with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in charge of the Corleone crime family while still having his family members along with him, his step brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his older brother Fredo (John Cazale), as well as his younger sister Connie (Talia Shire). Also a new change was that he is married to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) and had two children. Unlike most directors who have directed mob movies in the past Coppola shows a different side to the people in the mob than others like Michael Curtiz or Martin Scorsese who have also directed masterful mob movies, but the only difference is that Coppola shows a more dramatic side as well as Curtiz, but Scorsese shows a much grittier and evil side. The flashbacks in the movie talk about the early life and the immigration to America of none other than Michael's father Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, whose dialogue is all Italian.) This movie isn't like any other sequel in any other franchise that I've ever seen because most franchises are for action/adventure type movies, but The Godfather series is the only popular crime franchise. However like the first Godfather movie this one is nearly as flawless as this one with a great story, great cast, excellent and very effective dialogue co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel), as well as excellent performances throughout. In this review i'll try not to spoil anything but some of the most effective scenes in the movie are where Kay divorces Michael, Vito exacts his revenge on the man who did his family harm, and where Michael doesn't love Fredo anymore. This was a great movie and it makes me much more eager to see part 3. Even though there were other great films in 1974 such as Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"", and ""The Conversation"" which Coppola also directed, but this one tops them all. In other words, this is the best movie of 1974."
"mitsubishiwarrior","9","0","1","4 April 2017"," A grounded yet impactful piece of art.
","Part II of The Godfather Trilogy banks lavishly on inherent yet subtle tension - a maneuvering sense of distrust and deceit envelops each frame, compromising for the lack of numbing action that was laden throughout the first installment of the trilogy. Michael Corleone, helmed impeccably by Al Pacino, now has a face creased by a mask of implacable hatred – his character arc now much more refined and polished as Francis Ford Coppola explores his newly formed salivation for power.<br/><br/>Once again, Coppola encompasses the sizzling world of Italian Mafia perfectly, but now with much more stunning narrative flourish as the audience delves deeper into the roots of the Corleone family. The transitions into Vito's early life are sublimely entertaining and masterfully executed, especially the opening scene of Vito's mother's death which immaculately sets the tone for a controlled and layered film. Not only this, but the explicitly violent vengeance by Vito towards the end of the film is directorial genius as Coppola presents a complete, impactful and invigorating tale of Vito in the most astute form imaginable.<br/><br/>However, it would be wrong not to mention the contrast in exhilaration between the subplots of Vito compared to Michael, with Al Pacino's story arc being far less entertaining or interesting (although it does have its fair share of enthrallment, including his tantalizing riff with Fredo). The absence of defining action or hard-hitting set pieces in the third act of Part II, with Coppola refraining from grandeur, and focusing more on the characters, is what sets the film apart from perfection, but it would be criminal to deny the brilliance of this film"

Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.<br/><br/>The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.<br/><br/>See this movie.

"MaxHaydon1994","10","0","1","17 November 2016"," Greatest sequel of all time
","With the perfection of the first Godfather film it would seem impossible that the sequel could match up. But such is the genius of Francis Ford Coppolla that it is considered by many as the greatest sequel of all time and many of those same people even consider it to be better than the first.<br/><br/>I for one do not agree, at least not about it being better then the original, however I find it difficult to dispute the claim that it's the best sequel of all time. The impossible job of proceeding Marlon Brando as the Godfather fell on the shoulders of Robert De Niro. He later went on to win best supporting actor, proving the impossible to be quite possible for someone of De Niro's talents. Brando and De Niro became the first actors to win Oscars for performances of the same character. De Niro's performance as a young Vito Corleone was the highlight of the sequel and it was genius from Copolla to move the story backwards as a pose to moving in a linear fashion.<br/><br/>Another masterstroke from Copolla was the rise of Michael who becomes the Don of the family. We see Michael become a man and bypass all his brothers straight to the top of the family. It's almost a romantic twist in an otherwise pretty gritty and dark story.<br/><br/>I would put the first and second Godfather films right up there with the best of all time, perhaps even in first and second place. You simply can't call yourself a film buff and not watch these films. 10/10"

","Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather II starring Al Pacino is a movie that I would argue is a perfect movie. I do not think it has any mistakes.

The movie makes you feel like what it would be like to be in the Mafia, and it fully grasps how horrible that would be. The movie is very realistic, and what I mean by that is that it is not a movie where one knows that the protagonist is going to win before the movie begins.

","As one Corleone rises, another falls. A tale of two men, told masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. The Godfather Part II is a darker, more sprawling and perhaps subtler beast than its predecessor. Fewer classic scenes but a ton more character development. You can almost see the fragile psychological mechanics of each character ticking away throughout the film. Al Pacino projects the demise of Michael's soul as if he is personally conjuring the storm cloud that follows his character in every scene. In contrast, De Niro shows Vito climbing the ladder of crime with scene-stealing power, control and charisma. Vito is at peace with himself and with his family. And that's all this film really is at the end. A story about family. Where Vito's family comes together in the cauldron of old Italian America, Michael's shatters into a million pieces. Having these two stories running parallel to one another is a masterstroke because Vito's story of new beginnings and hope for his family gives Michael's descent into cold, lonely crime lord even more tragic. The end scene in the Corleone family dining room where Michael announces that he is joining the marines and Fredo is the only person to give him support is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema."

","The continuation of the Godfather saga with two focuses: the ongoing story of the Corleone family, and Michael in particular, and Vito Corleone's (Michael's father) backstory. Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael's interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli's turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael's and a long- time ally of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael's life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.<br/><br/>A great follow-up to one of the greatest movies ever made. Gritty, solid plot, superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola and excellent performances. The closing scenes are incredibly powerful, showing just how much Michael has changed from the innocent man we met at the start of the first movie.<br/><br/>Six Oscar wins, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Robert De Niro won a Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Vito Corleone, making two Oscar wins for two different actors playing the same character (Marlon Brando got a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the first Godfather). Al Pacino, Michael V Gazzo, Lee Strasburg (of method acting fame) and Talia Shire also received acting Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Not quite in the same league as the first movie though. The first one had a much tighter plot and better pacing: this does feel a bit padded and slow at times. Not as enthralling and tension-filled as the first. Then again, we are comparing this movie to one of the greatest films of all time..."

","Michael Corleone (Pacino), his face now a creased mask of implacable hatred, has exacted vengeance on all his enemies – and then we suddenly cut back 20 years to the fresh-faced young Joe College, still capable of a boyish grin, startling his brothers over the dinner table by announcing he's joined the army, and stoutly defending his patriotism. It's a stunning narrative flourish: mysterious and moving.<br/><br/>The Godfather films have, with some reason, been accused of glamorizing the bullies of organized crime and indeed for being a how-to-behave manual for generations of wannabe wiseguys. But what power, even grandeur there is in these films: a top-down history of political intrigue.<br/><br/>It is commonplace to call Godfather 2 ""Shakespearean""; I find myself remembering the BBC's I, Claudius. After Vito's death, young Michael Corleone is susceptible to a new quasi-father figure, aging Florida boss Hyman Roth, played with quiet style and potency by Lee Strasberg. Michael is persuaded to test family loyalties by expanding his empire with Roth into Cuba: together they will typify the corruption that brought Fidel Castro into being. The action flashes back and forth with the life and career of young Vito Corleone, played by rail-thin Robert De Niro, in 1920s New York. Vito shows his instinctive grasp of how to combine strategic violence with operatic displays of sentimentality and generosity. As a teenager, he first sees how some ganging-up is needed against the florid local Don, who threatens the theater-owner's daughter. (When I was in Sicily, a guide told me the word ""mafia"" was derived from the phrase ""non tocca ma figlia"", ""don't touch my daughter"" – an interesting explanation that I have yet to see confirmed.)<br/><br/>Robert Duvall is brilliant as put-upon consigliere Tom, and Diane Keaton is memorable as Michael's outsider wife Kay, the sole unhappy voice of sanity and modernity"

","The Godfather Part II is a great film, but definitely not as good as its predecessor. I think it is paced a little more unevenly than the first part. I found that the courtroom scenes were a little dull at times. However, in other places, it was just as good as the original. Although compared to the novel, Fredo Corleone is portrayed as unfairly stupid, I still loved his character. He is just so tragic. All he wants is respect. I also loved the flashback scenes, as I felt that they had a great authenticity to them. De Niro was great as a young Vito Corleone.

","One of my most favorite films ever. Al Pacino on one side and Robert DeNiro on the other, both put on performance of a life time. Seeing the two playing different and yet the same roles. DeNiro steals the show and wins the Academy Awards for best supporting Actor. I couldn't believe that Al Pacino was once again, snubbed for his amazing performance. The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br/><br/>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by, and you realize how badly you miss great movies like this from today's Hunger games, Superman and other fast and furious type of films."

"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","12 April 2016"," Maybe one of the best sequels in history of cinema
","This film follows the movie ""The Godfather"" and continues the story of the Corleone family, now headed by Michael after the death of Vito. In this film, the audience is confronted with two realities: the rise of the family during Vito's adolescence, and the psychological contradictions of Michael, who want to get out of illegality, but needs it to prevent rival families to put at risk the safety of his family. From Nevada to Cuba, the illegal investment of the Corleone's will bring them a new golden age?<br/><br/>Like the previous film, it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novels of Mario Puzo, who collaborated on the script. The cast kept most of the actors from the previous film but introduces new characters as well. The soundtrack continued in the experienced hands of Nino Rota. It won six Oscars in 1974 (best film, best supporting actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best art direction and best soundtrack).<br/><br/>After the resounding success of ""The Godfather"", any sequel was condemned to fail but, on the contrary, this film has managed to maintain it's level high and the same popularity, which is a rarity when we talk about sequels. I cannot make big negative reviews except, perhaps, the very long duration of the film. Al Pacino had probably one of the greatest performances of his life as actor. Irreproachable, he incorporated Michael with an almost petrifying naturalness. The same can be said of Robert De Niro that, with his performance, opened the way for other important works of his career like ""Goodfellas."" Robert Duvall also had here one his most outstanding works. Those who like action scenes may not like this movie. Its a quieter film, where the deaths are violent but made with almost surgical precision. The Mafia does not kill at random. Tense from start to finish, it has a powerful suspense that holds the audience, but the complexity of the script, full of twists, can confuse the most inattentive, so pay attention."

","Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.<br/><br/>The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.<br/><br/>It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.<br/><br/>Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.<br/><br/>For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.<br/><br/>Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks —""they are animals anyway.""<br/><br/>This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.<br/><br/>The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.<br/><br/>Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college-educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.<br/><br/>The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.<br/><br/>THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes."

You can see how he changed, in Godfather 1 he looked so pure with a warm heart, a war hero whose father kept him from all the dirt so he can be a senator or a governor with an upper hand, but here his eyes just look empty scary and his face has only one firm impression that doesn't change the whole movie, like how he was so nervous and terrified to kill Mccluskey and Sollozzo but now he's able to pull the trigger in a blink of an eye, Al Pacino definitely done a wonderful job so you can notice that these can't be the same character just because it has the same name! now for Robert De Niro performance that was remarkable! the young Don Vito Corleone couldn't be played better how he speaks, sits and puts his hand on his cheek when he's listening carefully and that ""I'm going to make him an offer he can not refuse"" line it's all just perfect he really earned that Oscar. Connie and Fredo play an important role there too with of course Robert Duvall it all fits. the most thing I loved is how the flashbacks blend with the scenes of the movie and it's not disturbing or distracting you! now I know why this is a movie that people can't forget for more than 40 years."

","A true movie classic. Francis Ford Coppola unfolds two story lines past and present with graceful transitions. The beauty and symmetry of the lighting, sets, mixes with the symbolisms of the Catholic church, America, and family was directed brilliantly. The statue of liberty scene is a classic. Pacino, De Niro, and the rest of the cast creates a film energy which is captive for the audience. Pacino's mod boss role shines with strength, dishonesty, and cleverness. The ""senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy"" resonates what the film is about. De Niro aka Vito brilliants acts out a story of a man pushed into crime who is a ruthless killer, and also plays with his children. De Niro's dualism creates ironic realism of the Vito character. The Godfather Part two sub stories of betrayal, honor, dishonor, corruption, and the damage of the characters' sin is a story which leaves an impact.

This was the era when both Pacino and DeNiro were at their best and at their peaks.

","When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once."

","The Godfather Part II both continues the story of the first by following Michael, and makes flashbacks to the life of Vito Corleone, showing how he became the Godfather. In the movie Michael is trying to make his family strong, while trying to kill off his enemies. When in attempt is made on Michael's life he tries to root out the traitor in his family, who turn out to be his older, but less capable brother Fredo. The story is well done; Michael tries to hold his family together, and in doing so, resorts to violence. This dynamic is especially present when Micheal is eliminating all his enemies, and in doing so, decides to kill Fredo. The story has intrigue, drama, and violence which makes the movie both intriguing, yet questionable as it portrays the distinct morality of the Corleone family. Al Pacino continues to be a be an exceptional actor; he has the perfect mix of paranoia and fury when faced with certain situations. He asks friends and family questions to test their loyalty, and is shaken when he discovers that his child was aborted. The flashbacks of Vito are a good method to compare Micheal and his father, who he tried to be like. Robert De Niro is also a great actor, capturing the mannerisms that Marlon Brando had in his role as Vito. Though the flashbacks provide an interesting look into the Corleone family, they do take away from the focus of Micheal's story. All-in-all the film is a impressive and fitting sequel to the first movie."

"Rickting","9","0","1","14 November 2014"," The godfather of movie sequels
","The Godfather is one of the best films ever, so what can we expect when a follow up is attempted? A contender for the best sequel ever of course. This has 2 parallel time lines: Flashbacks showing the young Vito Corleone rising to power and the continuation of the first film showing Michael Corleone handling both business matters and his personal life. It shouldn't have been as good as it is, but it knocks most sequels ever made into a bin liner. It's not quite as brilliant as some say it is. It's a bit too sprawling and tries to pack too much in. While the length in the first was excessive but just bearable, the second one has a bit too much. It can be a bit confusing and dips, but rarely. Otherwise, this sequel has it all: Amazing acting from everyone, even better direction from Francis Ford Coppola than the first and a powerful, moving screenplay. The final hour of the film is perfection and the last shot of Michael sitting alone in isolation, having lost everyone, has more emotional power than most films would squeeze into a ten minute monologue.<br/><br/>Al Pacino gives one of the best movie performances of all time and it is a total outrage that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Everyone else is great. Although the script is a bit sprawling, it gets a lot done and is very powerful. Many of the scenes of assassinations are suspenseful and at times genuinely heart breaking. I didn't understand what was so great about Robert De Niro's performance, but you can certainly see Marlon Brando in his acting. Coppola's direction is less subtle this time and he shows even more of his directional brilliance. Some of the scenes, visually, and utterly phenomenal. It's darker, raises the stakes and expands the story like a sequel should. It's a moving, sobering story about power and how corrupting it is. In terms of sequels we could hardly have asked for a better follow up. Aside from the excessive length and the fact that it makes the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack & Jill even more painful, this is a sublime sequel and one which set the bench marks for all other sequels.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I know that there has to be some justice in this life, so everyone will pay for their sins and crimes someday. I shudder when I think what will happen to these folks for killing the ""Godfather"" franchise. ""Part III"" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. The other two movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice that was painfully taken; in this one it is as if violence was fun and part of life. There are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as ""so bad it is good"". This is merely ""so bad it is bad"". 7/10."

","While I do consider it an outstanding movie, I don't love the original The Godfather and its prequel/sequel is actually a bit of a step back, in my opinion. The 200 minutes are a lot too long and get boring, even as I anticipatorily watched the movie on two consecutive evenings, and neither of the cross-cut story parts was as interesting and thrilling as the one the original movie had to offer. That isn't to say that The Godfather Part II skimps on entertaining and rememberable scenes; in fact, the movie's best moments may even be more rememberable than The Godfather's. However, a lot of the scenes in between are just too long and not really necessary – what would have been needed a lot more were additional explanation scenes as the panoply of characters grows even bigger through the story being set in two different times and the dialogues give more focus to being pointed and quotable instead of making what happens fully clear. This is indubitably important, don't let me be misunderstood, but the huge plot that Mario Puzo has devised for The Godfather is simply too complex and convoluted to be easily grasped without having read the source material. Nevertheless, The Godfather Part II is a cinematic masterpiece that is sovereign and seminal on so many different layers, such as the beautifully picturesque cinematography, the smooth editing, the meticulously conceived set design, the innovative and unforgettable score by Nino Rota, and the tremendous acting cast that is reflected in the five Oscar nominations for acting (a tied record). Thus, The Godfather Part II is an undeniably excellent motion picture that merely suffers from the director's attempt to put too much in just one movie."

","Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits."

"illbebackreviews","10","0","2","16 April 2013"," Masterful in every possible way but is it the greatest sequel of all time?
","Two years after the masterpiece that is The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola decided it was time to direct and release Part II of what would become a trilogy. A movie like this is extremely difficult to review and to have expectations for, especially when it is considered by most to be much better than the original and perhaps the greatest sequel ever made. However, is this an over statement or not? Quite simply said, yes and no! Much like The Godfather, everything works amazingly in this film. In my opinion, it isn't the greatest sequel ever made, to that I say The Empire Strikes Back and I much prefer the original over it but that is by no means a way to say I dislike this film in the slightest. I love this film and that's certain and much like The Godfather, it took two viewings before I truly loved it.<br/><br/>*Spoilers contained throughout this review* It has been a few years since the death of Don Vito Corleone and Michael has now become the head of the Corleone Crime family as his business stretches through Nevada. An assassination attempt on his life leads him through a war with Hyman Roth whilst the story of a young Vito Corleone, the to be Don of the family, is portrayed marvellously by an inexperienced actor at the time, Robert De Niro in an Oscar winning performance The major issue I had with this film when its considered to be better than the original is how the absence of Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone really leaves a big and unfinished hole. That was my issue the first time as the word 'godfather' only brings one image into my mind. Not De Niro's Vito but Brando's. Despite amazing and legendary performances by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro, the absence of Marlon Brando still leaves an impact. Luckily this absence doesn't prove too costly for me this time around and most of it is well covered by the two.<br/><br/>The strength to the film is a tough one to pick but the acting still stands out. Apart from the acting, the storyline is extremely strong and powerful thanks to amazing De Niro and Al Pacino performances. Even that being said, the film is by no means more iconic or memorable than the first but a perfect continuation to what I believe, the greatest film of all time! The characters in this film are fantastic from a young Vito and his friends to Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola and various other characters such as Frank Pentanjali. Despite not having characters as memorable as Luca Brasi and Sonny and an older Vito, The Godfather Part II is extremely strong in terms of good characters and a fantastic and yet again, an immersive story.<br/><br/>Despite containing only a few words of English, my favourite proportion of the film would have to be the story of Vito Corleone as it provides all necessary background story perfectly. Contributing to a rough estimation of one third of the film's story, this is the stronger part of the film and thus, the more interesting part of it too! Words from De Niro such as 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!' may not be anywhere near as powerful coming from an inexperienced actor at the time but is nevertheless amazing. One of my favourite lines from De Niro would have to be when he talks to a young Michael stating that he loves him! This falls perfectly back in place with everything Vito stood for in the original film when he stated that he never wanted Michael mixed up in the family business. Vito Corleone was a flawless character in Part I but Part II improves upon everything about his character, giving him necessary backstory that ultimately works superbly in such a film.<br/><br/>The iconic soundtrack is yet again, amazing! The first few moments of the film when the soundtrack begins and the title fades in with a beautifully filmed shot of Michael Corleone as the Don was utterly amazing! That has to be my favourite film introduction moment alongside The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The soundtrack is powerful and moving from moments where Michael displays his love for his son to moments such as a young Vito talking to his son. The soundtrack perfectly adds the necessary amount of emotion to each scene without ever attempting to out do itself. Such perfected soundtrack works extremely powerfully in this film."

","Al Capone gives a whole different interpretation as the new Godfather. A good adult film to enjoy. Approximated the perfect length. With Al Capone we all learn the lesson which his father taught him. ""My father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer"" It seems that even the Xfiles used this lesson. Robert Duvall as the family lawyer becomes the ""family legal lion."" In this movie, the fictional history of Al Capone's father's rise as a mafioso is depicted. With this film and its predecessor, The Godfather, we are taught that crime does pay. In fact, it pays well for those who are very smart, very cunning, very rich, and very powerful -- otherwise you die. The music is similar to that of the Godfather. Where Marlon Brando was more of a loving man, Al Capone's godfather portrayal is one of of rigid ruthlessness. However, the ruthlessness is necessary for survival of the family's power."
"theonewithallthecontacts","10","0","2","25 March 2013"," This movie must never be deemed a sequel! It carries on the perfection of the first already perfect movie!
","In many ways, ""The Godfather Part II"" was the sequel that either matched or topped the original! It had twice the budget, it got nominated for 11 Oscars like the original and it won twice the Oscars with 6 wins: Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Art Direction - Set Decoration (Dean Travoularis, Angelo P. Graham), Best Music, Original Dramatic Score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), Best Adapted Screenplay (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), Best Director (Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Francis Ford Coppola, Gray Frederickson and Fred Roos). The movie didn't bring in as much money as the original, though. Many people see this as better than the original, and even the best movie of all time. For the time being, I actually prefer this movie over the original. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Gazale and Diane Keaton returned to star, and new actors were brought in, including Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strassberg.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part 2 would carry on the legacy of perfection that The Godfather presented to the world. One of the reasons being is the second spectacular screenplay by Coppola and Puzo! The movie is straightforward, and even though it's a more complicated plot than the first, it's not THAT hard to follow. Many iconic lines are introduced once again, and the idea of making this movie a prequel as well of a follow-up seems unique. <br/><br/>Al Pacino delivers an even more complex and disturbed performance as the now chilling and psychotic Michael Corleone. The Michael Corleone in the original movie was relaxed and could act human, whereas he (in this movie) coldly kills anyone, and I repeat, ANYONE who stands in his way. Pacinos performance is believable all the way, and the relaxed attitude he expresses on-screen, echoes back to the permanently relaxed Michael we saw in the original. He can talk almost robotic and give a cold stare to a man, and explode with rage in the next second, and Pacino sells it. Pacino delivered one of the greatest, if not the greatest villainous performance of all time, and possibly THE greatest performance of all time. Robert De Niro is one of the other stars in the movie! He plays the part of the young Vito Corleone with finesse and a nice calmness, all the while maintaining the virtues that made Brandos's first performance so special. His performance stands as one of the best supporting ones, and he isn't even my favorite supporting character in the movie. Michael V. Gazzo's aging and hot-headed Frankie Pentangeli is a joy to watch on-screen, although his performance is significantly weaker when compared to some of the other performances in this movie. Lee Strassberg delivers yet another spectacular and moving performance as the long-time gangster Hyman Roth. But the one supporting performance that really shined for me (more than in the original), John Gazale as the brother Fredo Corleone. His performance was delicately layered and moving all the way, and by the end of the film I felt such pity for the guy. Shoulda' been nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>The musical score in this movie is very much the same, and therefore as brilliant and as memorable as the first. The cinematography, the sound and the set decoration are spectacular, and makes the movie feel more epic.<br/><br/>I prefer this movie to the original for a number of reasons: For what seemed to be an impossible goal to make the movie better than the first for some, for the stronger characters, the stronger performances, the epic feel to it, the perfection carried on, the more complex plot and the magnificent ending. This movie must never be deemed a sequel! It carries on the perfection of the first already perfect movie. A must-watch for everyone! <br/><br/>10/10"

","Definitely enjoyed this Godfather more than the first one, as I thought the parallel stories helped add a bit of variation to the movie. I thought the format was great and the pacing throughout the movie helped keep interest.<br/><br/>While the beginning of Vito's story was great, I felt his rise to power occurred too quickly and the assassination of his father's killer was done too easily and without any shown planning.<br/><br/>Michael's story was done well, but I felt the sudden jump to the Senate hearing was rushed and unexplained.<br/><br/>If these flaws were corrected, I feel it could have been a much greater movie."

","Not only the arguments if this one is better than the first Godfather (Godfather II has been used by many as an example that sequels can be better than the original movie), but also the time line of the movie. So while this is the first movie that includes Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one movie, the time line constraints did not allow for them to be in the same scene (wouldn't make any sense, you'll understand when and if you have watched the movie). Also De Niro won an Oscar (funny fact, for the same role/character Marlon Brando won one in the first Godfather, must be a first and I don't know if it happened again, doubt it though) while Al Pacino didn't. And while it may seem unfair to Pacino, it was more than well deserved for De Niro, who really merged himself into the character that Brando created. From the way he talked, to gestures to mannerisms. Everything is there!<br/><br/>But the movie won a few Oscars and the acting was really good too. The story continues (though gives us a few flashbacks) from the ending of part 1. So while the first one is conclusive and has a satisfying ending itself, the story could be continued. Especially with the original author on board (Mr. Puzzi). There are new themes introduced in this movie. One big one is loneliness. And it's not only about being alone when you have power or being the Godfather. As with the first movie this explores quite a lot of things in Gang related family living.<br/><br/>A great movie that was even longer than the first one (and the sequel that came after it). But you probably won't mind the length. Especially if you buy into the drama, that really works. And even without it stating the time jumps/leaps it makes, you'll get the (time) change on your own. A great sequel to a great movie"

","The Godfather Part II stands among and will be seen as one of the best sequels out there thanks to the wonderful pairing of two fine actors with Al Pacino as Michael Coeleone, putting up such masterful display of acting that makes you want to hail him from the screen as ""The Godfather"" and the other actor that was exceptional was Robert De Niro who played young Vito Corleone. The movie casting is one that will remain in the mind of film watchers for a long time.<br/><br/>The film depicts the different paths in which the Corleone family took, as Vito took the high road of peace during his regime; Michael took the path of violence and taking all his enemies out the moment they show their face, to the point that no matter whom there were, friend or family you cross Michael you are dead.<br/><br/>Partially based on Mario Puzo's 1969 novel, The Godfather, this 1974 sequel is in part both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather movie released in 1972. The movie features two parallel dramas, one focusing on Michael Corleone's reign and him trying to gain control of the family business, the other story is based on flash backs of how Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rose from his childhood in Sicily Italy in 1901 to his coming to America and the founding of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>The plot shows how Michael was looking into expanding his family business to Las Vegas and Cuba. During the process, an attempt on his life was made, and the person behind it was someone close to him, this led to Michael taking out more people. Michael's ruthless behaviour affected his family and trusted friends.<br/><br/>Being the first film to have part II in its name, The Godfather part II was a box office success and it received critical acclaim as one of the best films ever made. The production had some production problems initially when Pacino not wanting to be part of it because he felt the script wasn't OK enough, so Coppola had to re-write it, before Pacino came on board.<br/><br/>The American Film Institute's 10th anniversary of greatest films has the movie rated number 32, and its ranked 3rd in IMDb's Top 100 Movies of all time, with its predecessor The Godfather ranked 2nd. It also got 11 Academy Awards nominations and it won Best Picture for that year. Out of the 11 nominations it won six Oscars which included Best Director for Francis Ford Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo.<br/><br/>Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Actor but didn't win although in the BAFTA Award he won the Best Actor award for the film.<br/><br/>The Godfather part II is a classic sequel to one of the best films ever made, so there is no need to see the first if you are not planning of crowning it with the second.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","'The Godfather' is an excellent movie. It displays the flip-side of the American dream, personal struggles to hold onto family values in an ever-changing world, and taps into the ultimate beauty of human relationships, even between the worst people. I saw 'The Godfather' a year ago, and thought it was superb. I do not, however, feel that it was is good as 'Citizen Kane' or '2001'; I just don't feel that it's a pinnacle of American filmmaking, and have always been puzzled by its credit as such. I just finished 'The Godfather, Part II', and now I understand. I enjoyed the first film, but this film left me stunned. The complexity and beauty of the emotions on screen were impeccable. The performances were among the finest ever committed to film, Mr. de Niro deserving special mention. This film doesn't go for easy answers, and doesn't pander to its audience: it is, in my opinion, the ultimate drama film. Perfectly nuanced screen writing and utterly superb direction give the impression of watching real life unfold in a setting designed for drama. The power of Al Pacino's performance didn't sink in until I realized that I'd been watching the credits roll for five minutes, thinking about his enigmatic facial expressions. I won't give anything away, but be ready for shock. People tease around the idea that this film is better than the first. They say it, but then back away, muttering about Marlon Brando. They think it, and then rub their hands together, considering Sonny Corleone. Well, I appreciate all other opinions, but I'll just say it: This is better than 'Goodfellas'. This is better than 'Scarface (both of them)'. And, finally, most controversially, this is better than 'The Godfather' This is the greatest gangster movie ever made, and the quality of this film validates the international acclaim of the duo.

Its not as good as the Godfather....but it is still a great movie. Its very well directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and Al Pacino gives a solid performance as the godfather. We are into the 1950s and organized crime is not quite as brutal as it was. Pacino has a lot on his plate...making deals with the unpredictable Hyman Roth (brilliantly played by Lee Strasberg) and finding the traitor in his family is Fredo. This huge mistake by Fredo will (must) cost him his life. (never go against the family) There are flashback sequences about Pacinos father (played by Robert Di Niro) ...his arrival in New York as a simple boy....and his rise to crime boss as he realizes shooting ""big shots"" makes people respect you. In the end Coppola ties things together with a few killings...as he did in the Godfather. This is never a boring film...there are many things ""going on"".

We have the commencement of ideals and the inevitable decay of the foundation they were built on. The second film of the series shows how power affects and how the lack of power can lead to betrayal. I hated the attempt to match the ending of the first movie, yet really felt Al Pacino's characterization of loneliness and lack of accomplishment, quite ironic for such a mighty man. Robert DiNero as young Vito Corleone, passing over rooftops before taking down the Don, and then pacing home against the backdrop of a fiery Little Italy sums up the original spirit of The Godfather."

","The Godfather Part II is a tale of two cities, New York at the turn of the 20th century and mid century Lake Tahoe where Vito and Michael Corleone's stories unfold. Much less violent than its predecessor, Part II focuses on Michael's abandonment by family, friends and eventual retreat into himself.<br/><br/>Our feature starts in Sicily them moves to New York, focusing on young Vito Corleone and his orphaned youth. He's said to be ""dumb"" because he never expresses himself, but you can see his furtive eyes observing everything and his open ears listening to every detail. Vito leaves Sicily orphaned and bereft of siblings, all of them dead at the hands of the local mob boss. He makes a new life for himself in New York, raising a family and overtaking a mob lord with quick wit and a quicker trigger finger. These scenes in 1910ish New York are superb, from the theatre to the grandiosity of the mob to the rigours of health in that area (Fredo is born with Pneumonia, for example) but our future Godfather survives it all, to his credit.<br/><br/>In present day Michael tries to solidify his empire through backroom deals, treachery and the disintegration of his family unit and friends. With Hyman Roth (a Florida mobster), he makes inroads into fertile Cuba but he and his family almost perish in a hit at his own home. Everyone turns on Michael, from a jealous Fredo (older brother given no responsibility) to an estranged Kay (who aborts his second son as she doesn't want to contribute to the mob nightmare any longer) to his mob associates. The only one who comes close to ""redeeming"" himself is Frank Pentangeli , the key witness for a Senate Investigating Committee into the Corleone's business who recants on the stand when a long-lost brother appears at the tribunal.<br/><br/>In the end, Michael is alone with his son Anthony while Kay and their daughter is gone, Fredo dead, the mob dispersed and the Corleone clan expanding from Vegas to Cuba to Tahoe to who knows where...this chapter is excellent, even surpassing the original in some spots in character development and analysis. Recommend highly, but see The Godfather first."

","The second part of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece managed to be at least as powerful and moving as the original. All the elements that made the first Godfather great, like the dark filmography and the beautiful music, are present in this film. Coppola, who now had more confidence and therefore, more control, managed to make a more somber film, a very successful approach. As for the cast, Al Pacino is back in his role as Michael Corleone, now head of the family. Marlon Brando gave place to another film legend: Robert De Niro, who gave a performance almost as good as Brando's in the first film. Robert Duvall is back as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton reprises her role as Kay, and, thanks to Coppola, John Cazale (who had a regretfully short career) and Talia Shire had more screen time and gave brilliant performances. As if all that wasn't enough, master Lee Strasberg came back from retirement as Hyman Roth. The Godfather Part II is a delight to every lover of the first film, but also appeal to everyone else."

","The Godfather Part Two opens right where the The Godfather left off. Nino Rota's masterful and romantic score whispers off in the distance. The screen fades in from total darkness, pure emptiness. We see a focused man sitting stoically in a leather bound armchair. Darkness expands around him on all sides. This man is Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. Around him his associates kneel, showing their utmost respect. Michael is being crowned the new Don of his family. In the last film, his father, a powerful New York mob boss, had passed away, requiring Michael to now lead his family. With this action, Michael is closing the door on his old life and returning fans are quickly reacquainted with this epic tale.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part Two was left with the task of filling an extremely large pair of shoes, as its predecessor is considered one of, if not the greatest, film of all time. The second film does surprisingly well in accomplishing this enormous undertaking. With its stellar combination of all elements that make a film great, The Godfather Part Two easily works its way into the discussion of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>This film effectively flips back and forth between two different plots in two separate time periods. After being reintroduced to Michael, we are immediately transported to the beautifully recreated island of Sicily at the turn of the century. We are then shown a young Vito Corleone (Andolini), Michael's father. We are also told that Vito's father was recently murdered and that his brother has fled to seek retribution, leaving only young and timid Vito and his mother. Vito's innocence is exemplified by the quietness and minimal dialogue in this opening scene. Quickly after, we are informed that his brother has also been killed by the same man and he and his mother go speak to the mob boss that has committed these acts. In attempting to plead with the local boss, his mother is murdered and Vito flees to New York. Once in New York, the plot documents Vito's exciting rise from a poor Italian peasant into one of New York's most powerful mob bosses. He overthrows the current boss, and he along with his friends, put themselves into power. During this portion of the film we are introduced to younger versions of characters from the first film, such as Peter Clemenza and Mama Corleone, Vito's wife. Throughout this tale, Vito also seeks retribution for the murders of his family. The final words he utters to his families killer are, ""My father's name was Antonio Andolini and this is for you"" This event show Vito's rise to power coming full circle.<br/><br/>Interwoven between this story is also the tale of Michael Corleone's personal struggle. He struggles in keeping control of his family and also trying to legitimize his business ventures, involving such groups as the US Senate. In this plot we see the development of Michael from the timid young man he was in the first movie to the true face of evil he becomes. Al Pacino's beautiful performance, such as his soulless glare and heartlessly delivered dialogue, accent the corruptness in his character. We also see his life slipping away from him in many different ways because of his terrible actions, most specifically the act he commits towards the end of the film. This final scene shows the completion of Michaels's transformation into pure evil. The plot ends with one of the greatest climaxes in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Even without the legendary Marlon Brando at the helm, this film still contains one of the greatest ensemble casts of all time. Al Pacino, now at the fore-front, is supported by the likes of Robert DeNiro as Vito Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Corelone and Robert Duval as Tom Hagen, to mention a few. Every character has an added depth due to these talented actors' ranges. This phenomenal cast makes the viewer care about family aspect of the film and believe that all of these actors could truly be related.<br/><br/>Though a long film, totaling over three hours in length, excellent pacing keeps the viewer interested at all times. There is never a truly dull moment in the plot. The expanded run time allows for a more complete tale to be told. Also, exceptional editing mixes both plots together. I disagree with Roger Ebert when he says the two plots, ""provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers"" I think the two plots strengthen the movie as a whole. Over the course of the movie, the viewer is never confused and the plots never seem to run over into each other.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola and Gordon Willis continue their partnership as director and cinematographer to create one the most visually compelling films of all time. In discussing Willis's cinematography, Vincent Canby of The New York Times said, ""The photography by Gordon Willis, so effective originally, is now comically fancy – the exteriors are too bright and glowy while the interiors are so dark"" He is discussing Willis common use of darkness in his shots. I feel that Willis's continued use of his dark and shadowy style adds a deeper emotion to every scene. Coppola's dynamic choices on shots contribute to the sensation in scenes, even ones with very little dialogue. Together they beautifully recreate settings such as Sicily, Las Vegas, Miami and Cuba.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part Two surpasses all goals that it set out to achieve. Its stellar cast highlights one of the best written tales of family and honor in the history of cinema. It is hard to define The Godfather Part Two as purely just a gangster movie. It is much more easily defined as a masterpiece. Combining all of the elements that produce a great film, the team behind The Godfather Part Two created one of the greatest movies of all time."
"Kubris","9","0","4","17 August 2011"," A continuation of the greatest movie ever made
","IMDb Top 250: 3 The Godfather Part II has a great distinction: it is the sequel to the greatest film ever. It has a lot to live up to. While the Godfather impresses you before it even starts, with Marlon Brando's iconic face on the poster, Part II has to earn your respect. To most, it equals- and to a few, it betters- the Godfather. But to me, it doesn't. Part II is an exceptional film that outclasses many films, but its predecessor is not one of them.<br/><br/>The Godfather showed the rise- or fall, however you look at it- of Michael Corleone, and Part II shows him at the height of his power, and his descent. The story is sprawling, like it should be. Betrayal, family, and oranges, Godfather staples, are seen throughout. But Part II doesn't have the charisma of Part I. Without Vito and Sonny, much of the famous Italian factor is lost. Like Michael, the story is more heartless than before.<br/><br/>Also in Part II is the origin of Vito Corleone, starring the then small-time Robert de Niro, in one of his best performances. These scenes are so awesome, they steal the show. When we learn about Vito, we don't want it to end, and when we watch Michael, we wish he was Vito instead. There's so much plot in this film, it could've been cut into 2 films, one a continuation and one an origin story, a la the Metal Gear Solid quadrilogy. Who knows the impact that could've had on the quality of Part III.<br/><br/>While the film lacks Sonny or Vito, the characters present are very well played. These actors could be these characters in real life. And when Oscar season came, it showed: 5 nominations. Pacino is at his conflicted peak, shown no better than his confrontation with Kay. He is the tent pole: all the other characters aren't on his level, another factor that makes me like Part I more. Others got the spotlight. But as I mentioned before, De Niro is the best part of this film. He sounds like the Don, looks, and charms the the Don. The sets of the 20's scenes are breathtaking. It's a pity there isn't a whole film about him.<br/><br/>Together, Godfathers I and II are the best films ever made. But separate, I believe the first part stands alone at the top. Mixing the 20's and late 50's, Part II has much to unravel, and in 3 hours and 20 minutes much is revealed. It's a great film, and one of the best sequels ever made. 9.2/10"

Al Pacino portrayed his character perfectly, and not just Al, everybody.<br/><br/>The plot was more confusing than the first one, and you may have to watch it more than once to get it, but of course I didn't mind watching it again. This one focuses more on Michael's relationship with family and friends rather than business (however, business was still a major part of the plot). We also go back into the old days when the original Godfather was just a young man, and we see how his character developed into the person he was in the first movie.<br/><br/>I didn't pay too much attention to the music in this one, partially because I was too busy trying to figure out what was going on. However I'm sure it's great...<br/><br/>Cinematography and effects. Once again, camera work is out-standing. And like the first movie, the action scenes were in good taste, and the death scenes were relevant to the plot. I explained this in my review of the first movie, so I don't want to repeat myself too much. The balance between dialogue and action was a bit heavier on the dialogue side this time.

Vito Corleone is a true icon as far as characters go. Pacino is once again great, but I did find his performance in Part 1 more of an achievement. The highlights are the flashbacks of the past life of Don Vito, probably the best scenes in the saga so far. However, I found Part II more inconsistent and ultimately at times less intriguing than Part I. However, it still makes up for a great story.

"nchuh2-1","9","0","3","12 February 2011"," Michael's soul
","The Godfather Part II needs a few viewings in order for one to truly grasp the emotional scope of the movie. On the surface it can be classified as a movie about betrayal and revenge. But it's much more than that. The arc that Michael Corleone goes through is the aspect that packs the emotional punch of the movie. What makes this movie so great is that he tries so hard to protect his family and keep them safe, but in the end, he ends up losing those he loves the most. He fails to realize at what cost he sold his soul. The ends don't always justify the means. <br/><br/>I must say it took me a few viewings to understand this all, but it was definitely worth it. As bad as he gets, you still feel sorry for him because you understand why he makes certain decisions. Watching the younger Vito grow into the great mafia don is also a great part of the movie. De Niro's ability to use body movements, facial tics, and expressions is what made his portrayal of Vito one for the ages. Please see the movie if you haven't yet. There's a reason it's been rated as a top-notch movie for the past 37+ years."

","How do you follow the greatest mobster movie of all time? By contrasting the uprising of Vito along with the fall of Michael at the same time. The scenes at first are subtle, yet powerful. Take for instance, the beginning where you have the humble Don singing in Italian at Ellis Island as a kid and the scene changes to Antony's first communion in Reno which is just a front for the Senator to do business with Michael about the acquaintance of new hotels for double the price of the arranged price in order to milk the family as much as possible. There is hatred for the current family that Michael controls from outsiders such as Senator Geary. The Vito plot flows smoothly of how Vito gains power by meeting Clemenza and killing the current powers in Little Italy in New York and later getting revenge on Don Ciccio in Corleone. He starts by stealing and then running molasses with several partners while doing favors for certain people. Michael's story is about Roth trying to take over Michael's control over the hotels he owns by having a partnership with Cuba, Michael's investment in some new hotels in Cuba, all while trying to overthrow him by having Fredo betray him unintentionally since he knew that everyone in the family stepped over him because he is weak minded. While Vito is becoming the new Don in the 20s, Michael does the unforgivable and orders the hit on his own brother since he never forgave him for his betrayal and the ending is truly the end of this franchise with the haunting comparison of a young Michael with his dad waving goodbye and then it goes back to a cold Michael pondering his brother's death. The irony also is that when Michael joins the Navy and everyone on the table questions his decision, Fredo is the only one who embraces his decision."

","It is by far the greatest sequel ever made to a movie. Francis Ford Coppola has a hit jackpot yet again. The first film of the Mario Puzo's trilogy was a great one. Some agree, some disagree, but in my opinion, part II was even slightly better. The movie is full of same style and originality that the first film. It works for mafia film. There has been done tremendous job on set designing. Especially on scenes which portray life of Vito Corleone at early 20's in New York. That's a wonderful piece of work. You could have no complaints at all. The screenplay is good. It shows how Vito Corleone started his family business, later called mafia. On the other hand, it follows life of his son Michael who tries to enlarge family business to Las Vegas and Havana.<br/><br/>Although there is no original Godfather (Marlon Brando), his son Michael (Al Pacino) shines. That's a statement act which became cornerstone in his career. So cool and fearless, like his father. Al Pacino is a deserved Oscar-winner here. This is the top of the mafia films.

But Part II fleshes out the history of the Corleone clan, showing the rise of young Don Vito and reflecting on the increasingly icy demeanour of his son Michael as he accommodates himself to becoming a ruthless don. The scenes in Sicily, beautifully shot, have a lyrical, almost Edenic quality, tinged with foreboding: we all know this idyll can not last. De Niro is spellbinding as young Vito, while Pacino almost visibly transforms himself into the man Michael Corleone is becoming. It's an astonishing popular masterpiece."
"rick_7","Null","0","1","8 April 2010"," A touch below the first film, but still extraordinary
","The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) is a brilliant film full of unforgettable moments, if marginally less coherent and effective than the original. Set seven years after the events of the first movie, it traces the increasingly alienated don, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), as he expands his criminal empire into Nevada and Havana, while fighting congressional hearings, assassination attempts, and betrayal from within his very family. His cold existence is contrasted with his father Vito's early years, as the future godfather (Robert De Niro leaving an indelible impression) escapes persecution in Sicily and finds a new life in America - where his neighbourhood is dominated by a grasping, merciless small-time Mafioso.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is slightly disjointed, but lays the groundwork for a final hour that is utterly unimpeachable - much like Michael Corleone himself. The visceral violence and quotable dialogue (""You keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"") are obvious surface pleasures, but once more the film's greatness lies in its more reflective, verbose moments. There's a superb scene between Michael and Fredo (John Cazale) that recalls the apex of the first film (Brando and Pacino's garden two-hander), with Cazale apparently trapped in his chair by rage and regret at being passed over by his father. ""It was the way Pop wanted it,"" Michael says. ""It ain't the way I wanted it,"" Cazale shrieks. ""I can handle things; I'm smart. Not like everybody says like dumb; I'm smart, and I want respect!"" The sequence in which Michael's wife (Diane Keaton) reveals the truth about her 'miscarriage' is also extraordinary to behold. Pacino doesn't just slap Kay across the face, he launches himself at her from across the room - like a coiled spring, or a cat; though really like nothing else on earth. Usually such concessions to melodramatic domestic drama are tawdry, upsetting and unbelievable, but Pacino's remarkable handling of the material makes it chilling, horrifying and impossible to forget.<br/><br/>This is a superbly-scripted, brilliantly-acted study of absolute moral corruption, but just as Michael is colder and more ruthless than his father, so The Godfather Part II is more clinical and less emotionally resonant than the first film, provoking a sense of melancholia in place of tears. That's unquestionably fitting, and it feels like nitpicking to point out shortcomings in a film so intelligent, incisive and compelling, but I am going to reverse a long-held view and contend that the sterility and occasionally haphazard plotting of this sequel makes it inferior to the first movie, if only by a fraction. It's still a masterpiece."

The darker side of the film feels more personal and less like the Sicilian dogma which the first film focuses on. The film splits a fair amount of time between Michael and his father's back-story. Much like the ending of the previous film, Michael allows himself to become a monster. He is a mere shadow of his father, and that is the real message of the film. The actions Michael Corleone take throughout this film would've been dismissed as dishonorable and unnecessary by his father.<br/><br/>The cinematography is near perfect.

Yes it may have been a lazy Sunday for me to watch all 375 minutes but it got me thinking about when these films were made. You could describe those minutes as a series of recollections from a sharp elderly person where the memories come out very clearly but not in chronological order. Therefore Part 2 could be a continuation of the original. That isn't taking anything away from either film but because they were made roughly two years apart its one way of looking at it. I think it is unlikely that these films could be made now because of all sorts of 'improvements' in technique due to technological advances. These two films were produced at the time that they should have been made. I am not interested in the politics which apparently surrounded the making of these films the end result is all to me and in this case the result is magnificent. This film is another masterpiece.

"johnnyboyz","8","0","2","28 June 2009"," Two split, and very compelling, stories of men going through their own emotional grinders told amidst a backdrop of honor, family ties and trust.
","The second Godfather film kicks off in a similar fashion to the first; with a large and overwhelming gathering of friends and family on a sunny day within the confines of the Corleone family grounds. The event is the Holy Communion for Michael Corleone's (Pacino) son, and much like the wedding with which the first film began, it represents the beginning of a new venture; of a new tale, or of a new chapter in life or in the franchise that is the Godfather films, a new addition to the lives of this collection of Mafia based individuals whom are forever being deconstructed on screen. And what a tale the piece eventually branches out into, giving us the next chapter in the lives of those in the 'present' tense, as well as seamlessly incorporating an interesting mesh of the rising of one gangster twinned with his lust for revenge.<br/><br/>This second strand is, of course, the tale of Vito Corleone (De Niro); an Italian immigrant of the Andolini family based on Scicily and his coming of age in early 20th Century New York. The Godfather Part II is an extremely assured film; a film that is mostly everything a crime film can be, complete with a patient and mature aesthetic which helps in the distinct placing of it in the annuals of contemporary American cinema. The film is split into two equilibriums, one occurring from the late 1950's onwards while predominantly focusing on Michael and his family and friends, where as the other initially unfolds in the very early years of the 20th Century before branching out into the 1920s. This segment sees Vito marry; get involved in petty crime; come up against a local crime kingpin as well as have a son but always retain an eye on a certain larger goal which awaits him back in Scicily.<br/><br/>Each of the two equilibriums offer very different studies of the human condition. The equilibrium in the 'present' tense takes on a certain amount of substance to do with honour and trust; as well as incorporating the notion of expansion and moving on, which ties in with the idea of modernity and branching out in an attempt to keep up with the times. These are ideas Michael brings up in the first Godfather film, mainly through fear of his family's safety that they need to 'go straight' but additionally because he feels real estate and so forth acts as a healthy means, money-wise, to sustain the family for the years to come. The other equilibrium sees a much more simplistic and routine chain of events; a tale of revenge and a certain degree of ruthlessness brought about within one man as this study of this character evolves him from an innocent and frightened child; to a young man who is very much observant of this new world he's in; to cold-blooded killer.<br/><br/>The installation of Vito's story here is simplistic but very well done in both a story telling and character driven sense. Vito becomes aware of the notion of crime in New York and learns of the rules of hierarchy. He observes his initial, more local, nemeses in Don Fanucci (Moschin) in a close to voyeuristic manner; not necessarily gazing at the individual but at what the individual is: feared but additionally respected. Vito is not afraid of Fanucci, but the study of Vito's involvement in crime, which begins with the stealing of someone's rug and the temporary holding of a neighbour's illegal firearms, act as lures into a world within the historically proclaimed 'new world' he has already arrived in. You might view Vito's tale as a tragedy, since it is Vito's entry into this line of work that will propel him into the mindset of a criminal and, ultimately, it is this line of work that develops the attribute of a cold blooded killer which enables him to fulfil his goal of revenge.<br/><br/>The passage of film looking at Vito sees the film revisit one of Vito's ideation from the first edition; the notion of always killing for business and that there is nothing personal behind 'hits' - it is strictly business. Vito and his goal as a young man in New York exist before these rules are drawn up; Vito's hatred of Don Ciccio for the death of his father during the prologue is not business, but very much personal. It might be this that makes Vito's strand of The Godfather Part II the better of the two, and it may well be the reason people have more of a reaction to this edition of the trilogy; in the sense it is a piece establishing ideals and ideation's; before having, what is arguably its strongest character, confront what we already know he believes in and threaten its integrity.<br/><br/>Michael's segment of the film covers broader, more personal issues such as life and family ties and marital relationships. It is about expanding an empire on the outside just as much as it is the narrowing down of an empire on the inside: finding out who is actually who and where they stand. There is one such brilliant scene in which Michael and Fredo (Cazale) confront one another and they fall out of favour. It is an establishing of power as Michael, standing, towers over Fredo who up to this point has become more and more of a loose cannon. Michael's segment of The Godfather Part II isn't so much about the mafia or crime as much as it is the human condition; it uses said setting as a means to explore these conditions within a criminal world, as death and increased pressure to make moves dominate person's lives. Its dedicated and calm approach to psychologically chaotic and unnerving subject matter allows the film to retain a certain juxtaposed sense of dread throughout. Perhaps undoubtedly, The Godfather Part II will remain a somewhat timeless study of emotion, angst and so much more."

The intertwined time line is genius. All actors do a good job and particularly de Niro.<br/><br/>This film is slow. Very slow. 200 minutes in a steady pace.

Coppola hasn't done much lately these days but it would be nice if he could direct another film soon. One that has his time and critical notions to get him some more Oscars.

"mrmoviefreak261-1","10","0","2","29 November 2008"," Best sequel ever made
","Godfather Part: II, I think, beats Godfather I. Reason why? Because it's genius, and it puts a great story in a more higher and crazier level, and it's not corny or disappointing. Michael Corleone is taking over his mob family, making drastic decisions and changes, that's pretty much defined, completely reckless. Godfather Part II is like a completely different story, because it's the new Godfather, who's more cruel that his father. Genius making itself more genius and smart. Godfather Part II is definitely, in my eyes, the best sequel ever made, and will probably be the greatest sequel. It's a wonder how such two great, and nearly perfect films could be ended with Godfather Part III, which was a complete letdown. Watch Part II, and don't watch Part III. Don't ruin a perfect sequel by watching an imperfect sequel."

","Michael Corleone: ""There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.""<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.<br/><br/>Review Although not as good as the first Godfather but a masterpiece nonetheless. The second chapter of the Corleone crime family is part prequel and part sequel as it chronicles the rise of a young Vito Corleone, played by a very young Robert De Niro, to Godfather status. The sequel part on the other hand tells of Michael's growing power over the Corleone crime organisation as he expands his grip from Nevada to 1950's Cuba.<br/><br/>A lot of people claims that this film is superior to the first Godfather but I beg to differ. I still find Godfather the best ever and this one coming in at a close second. With the absence of the movie magic that is Marlon Brando as the titular gangster, the backbone and spirit of Part II is just lost but at the least a very young and then unknown Robert De Niro gave justice to the Vito Corleone character and quite possibly one of his greatest performances of all time. What tops this cinematic milestone is Al Pacino as he leads a power house cast to greatness. From Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton and a terrific John Cazale, the powerhouse acting is one of the finest I've seen. The plot is more complex and involving the second time around as it delves deeper into the Corleone's family origins and it never gets boring and overly long as some people have suggested.<br/><br/>The Godfather II is a cinematic milestone. Highly recommended."

","The Godfather Part II is one of the most amazing films of all time. Al Pacino does a magnificent job of portraying the fading Michael Corleone, and cements the character into the memory of all.

John Cazale does a great job of creating the Fredo character, and his relationship with Michael is heartbreaking. As the end of the movie approaches, Michael has become a ruthless man. He has killed men for business, he has killed his own brother. And he is alone because of it. The second last scene takes us back to an earlier time. Everybody is happy and laughing, but Michael is again alone. The last scene is back in present time, and depicts Michael sitting on a bench alone, contemplating what he has done. This ending captures what the film is about, the human element in a violent story."

","At 200 minutes, the second installment in the timeless ""Godfather"" saga is the longest. And it just isn't quite as good as the delectable original. That being said, it definitely ranks right up there. With a broader, more epic storyline showing the parallels between father Vito (Robert De Niro in his best performance yet) and son Michael (the always, in these films, spot-on Al Pacino), GP2 fascinates audiences with its ingeniously undetectable staging and darker story (Kiss of Death and all).<br/><br/>It looks and feels only slightly different from the original, but the difference is good. This is not an attempt to capitalize on its predecessor. Nor is it an effort to repeat that classic. It is simply an expansion of the saga, another bookmark in the great tome of American cinema.

"vovazhd","10","0","1","14 January 2008"," More than worthy continuation of the Godfather saga
","The Godfather is considered to be among the greatest films ever made, both critically and publicly. Its sequel, The Godfather: Part II is a continuation of Michael Corleone's goal to create a powerful and respectable family empire. At the same time, the film gives a history of his father, Vito Corleone (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro), and his rise to power at a young age. Both of these plot lines are excellent parallels, although Michael's is much more depressing because of the internal conflict with his brother, Fredo.<br/><br/>The plot is much more widespread this time, but still packs a punch. There are so many classic scenes that you'll be left much influenced far after the film is over. Some of the technical aspects are taken directly from the first film, such as the music score (although it feels even more refined). The acting is also comparable to the first film; although Marlon Brando is lost, Robert De Niro completely makes up for this. The returning characters give performances that are worthy of the first film.<br/><br/>It is also longer than the already lengthy first film. All the time is used well, so thats not too big of a problem. The tension and suspense from the first film is lacking, but a new mood of uncertainty is produced. The conflict is based more on the characters than the plot itself.<br/><br/>The Godfather: Part II is as good as a sequel can get. Like its predecessor, it is worthy of a place among the all time great films. I would probably give the first one a nod because it was more fresh and original. But if you get yourself situated to watch this film, you cannot go wrong."
"dead47548","9","0","1","9 January 2008"," Sensational.
","Keeps the authentic, beautiful and rich feeling of the first film, while adding a level of intensity and interest throughout. The idea of producing parallel stories depicting the rise of a young Vito Corleone (played to perfection by Robert De Niro) and the loneliness and betrayal of Michael Corleone (the subtle and frighteningly intense Al Pacino) was a brilliant one. However, this is where the majority of the film's flaws lie. In creating these two separate stories, they made one much more interesting than the other. When watching the slow turn of paranoia and danger in Michael's life, all I can manage to think about is what will happen next in Vito Corleone's rise to becoming the Godfather. Either way, these are two of the strongest and most complex characters of all time. Vito loses his father, brother and mother to the same man who he luckily escapes from. He gains a family and rises to power, murdering another Don in the process in one of the most intensely suspenseful scenes of all time, and returns to confront this now bitter and alone man.<br/><br/>The death of Don Ciccio is one of the strongest scenes of the film, and certainly portrays how much more brilliant De Niro is when he's playing quiet strength instead of shouting at the top of his lungs. In the late Don Ciccio, we also see a parallel to the story of Michael Corleone throughout the film. A man who is simply trying to keep his family in tact, while remaining at the same level of respect and power as his late father. Instead, he falls into a world of betrayal on all fronts and the constant paranoia of being at the top of the food chain. He begins to feel as though he is the strongest man, waiting for the inevitable opportunity for another to bring him to the grave (just like what Vito had previously done many years ago). This leads to a life of utter alienation, even from his family. Three images in this film portray the most sympathetic form of isolation in cinematic history (Michael looking out the window as Fredo sails away, Michael sitting in the park bench alone at the end, and Michael sitting alone at the dinner table while everyone else joyously surprises Vito on his birthday). We see the loneliness and rejection of a man who lives his life for his family, but eventually loses them all. The final dinner scene has so much complexity it left me stunned well after the credits rolled. Definitely a film that has earned it's iconic status, featuring two performances that rightfully lit the fuel for the two most acclaimed careers the film industry has ever seen."

","Francis Ford Coppola's sequel to his original Godfather movie continues with the themes of greed, family and corruption whilst telling the tale of how an infamous mob lord's son handles the huge burden on his shoulders. (Don) Michael Corleone has changed vastly from when we first saw him at his sisters wedding in the original godfather. He no longer has the will to make a name for himself without having to rely on his background. He is still calm and calculating but with a more sinister feel and the feel of a man so powerful and brutal that he is feared by most people up to the point were his own family are frightened by his potential and he is left alone in his life which the ending symbolises. With the scenes of his father's past to give us an insight into the rise of the Corleone family and a further insight into the character of the original Godfather Vito Corleone. Michael makes wise investments in pre revolutionary Havana Whilst continuing with his business in the U.S some may argue the movie is giving a almost propaganda style view at communist Cuba. But if that was the case the American senators would be portrayed as straight politicians and not corrupt businessmen. So the movie ends with Michael delving into a brutal but yet cunning mindset up until the point were he kills his brother. There is no secret that he loves his family but the lengths he would go for them are terrifying. Michael ends the movie with his wife having left him taking his children. The ending shows how a young innocent men has turned to a point where he has alienated his wife and killed his brother. Fantastic film."

","This movie succeeds in both quality and follow-up. The first one is, no doubt, a masterpiece that had literally no flaws, with the exception of being very one, but a lot of older films are like that so might as well get over it. <br/><br/>This sequel is a couple of years after the original where young Michael Corleone just took over his late father's crime organization and, while, progressing, is also having some personal problems that interfere with his business. He has nearly been killed by a traitor within his organization, his wife is tired of living this way and ends up wanting a divorce, his sister wants to move back in, he is trying to take over a Las Vegas casino forcefully, etc. <br/><br/>While some people might think this is all pointless killings and depressing tragedies, it's really all about Michael and his actions which cause consequences around him. He had originally sworn not to be part of his father's illegal business and he ended up being like his dad anyway. <br/><br/>What's also cool about this film is it also explains his late father's background, which is explained through flashbacks. It consists of Vito coming to America, adopting henchmen and stopping another Don from ruining his and his town's life. <br/><br/>It's once again full of a full-star cast, excellent cinematography and scenery, courtroom drama, top-notch acting and good writing/directing."

","If you have not seen the first movie you won't understand this one fully. In fact it continues the Corleone story almost without break, with Don Vito's son taking brilliantly the role of his father. A few well inserted flashbacks will help you to understand better the biography of Don Vito thus completing a few aspects the first movie had left in the obscurity. The rest is the usual story of the struggle for power among mafia families but very well told in a captivating way. Which doesn't prevent the director to go on presenting those gangsters like human beings with their family problems interfering sometimes with their criminal activities. Murder is an ordinary event normally used to punish a betrayal but also to attain the gangsters' purposes in the attainment of their businesses. Although the acting lacks the superb performance of a sacred monster like Marlon Brando in the first part of this saga, it's good enough and all players do their parts convincingly well with special prominence to Al Pacino and Diane Keaton."

","This was not as good as the first, but still a really great film. With its ultra violent execution scenes and well deserved credited acting marks the second film in the ultimate gangster franchise. Director Francis Ford Coppola thought of the need to only make two films, this one and the first, but he didn't really intend to make a third but in the end did. Truly though, the first two were the best, i think there was no apparent reason for making the third one, which is supposed to be the worst/not as good one, compared to the first two classics. Number two follows Michael Corleones early life. It flash backs every now and then to his father Don Corleone played by Robert De Niro who does some dirty deals and some killings. So there are two parts to the story, these are: Michael, in present form and Don Corleone, so you can see what Don Corleone did to become Don.<br/><br/>The acting is top quality, most probably one of Al Pacinos greatest moments to shine and Robert De Niro, who also ma not be leading actor but still acts like he is. Diana Keaton, who plays Michael wife also demonstrates that she can bring to life the suffering and shocking conclusion of Michael and her splitting up, as you will see in the third one.<br/><br/>This film including the acting and direction all made this film worth wild, because of the extreme enthusiasm and dedication from both the cast and film crew."

","Marlon Brando plays no part in this sequel to 'The Godfather', but Al Pacino is still on hand, playing his son, and Robert de Nero joins the cast playing the Godfather's younger self. The two films together can thus be seen as representing the passing of a torch from the best actor of one generation to two of the best of the next. And it's amazing to see how fully the two youngsters come to inhabit their roles, and how fresh their portrayals are. The chronology of the story means they share no screen time; but when they eventually did come together on celluloid, over twenty years later in Michael Mann's 'Heat', they appeared as clapped-out, over-acting, stereotypes of themselves - whereas here they simply play their parts, to perfection. Pacino especially is good (while de Nero attempts to impersonate Brando); while among the supporting cast John Cazale (who also co-starred with Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon') is also exceptional . The film shares other virtues with its predecessor: a stately pace, but masterful directing ensuring that the film never bores; and a great, haunting score. However, I don't quite find this film the equal of its predecessor: it lacks a bit of focus in comparison. The two stories (of the Godfather's early years, and his son's later ones), do not fit seamlessly and the second, major story is too political, lacking the visceral impact of the story told in 'The Godfather Part One'; while the other story is simpler, but almost not political enough. A third story, maybe more interesting (how the Corleones got rich, presumably under prohibition) is not covered at all. In summary, for all the plaudits given to this film, I don't feel it adds that much to its predecessor; but it's still a film of the highest quality, and another reminder (if needed) of quite how good an actor the young Pacino was."

","Times go on a-changing. The second generation, with a few flashbacks to the very origins of the Corleone family, how the last male survivor of the family is smuggled out of Sicily to the USA where he can start a new line, by changing his name circumstantially since it is a not too wise customs officer that gives him unknowingly a new family name, and without forgetting the vengeance he will have to achieve later rather than sooner for the killing of his father and brothers by the local Don in his village in Sicily. We see him establish his business in the 1920s by killing the local mafia boss in his neighborhood and taking over in a more humane and just way. But this is a flashback. We are interested in the next generation and what they can do in the 1950s. The takeover has already been dealt with in the first part. The appointed son for this takeover has already asserted his power over the five families that could challenge him in the previous film. Now he tries to develop his business. Drugs had been allowed but he remains rather distant from that trafficking. He develops his business in gambling, hotels, entertainment, in one word luxury industry or commerce. He tries to get into Las Vegas but is rebuffed by a local Senator, so he forgets about it. Then he tries to move into Cuba and take over some business there but too late it is the arrival of Castro. So he goes back to New York and Nevada, back to his traditional activities. But these attempts enable Coppola to show some new problematics that are coming up in the second half of the 20th century. First of all the strong sectarianism Italians have to face from politicians who declare they support Italian-Americans as good patriots in front, and behind try to make them pay twice a service or to ostracize them out of their constituencies. At the same time they have to face congressional and judicial complications with hearings about their businesses and business practices that are accused of being too criminal to be accepted. In other words we are beyond the time of Al Capone and Prohibition. And the world is also changing. Cuba of course is a big change. But women are no longer what they used to be in this Sicilian culture. Women do not want to be simple ancillary appendices to men they do not see any more. This second generation Godfather is confronted to the abortion of his third child and second son by his wife while he is in Cuba witnessing Castro's conquest of the island. Then she tries to take his children away and eventually get a divorce. She will get nothing except a separation but not the children. He also has to fight against some remnants of the old world that are handicaps and obstacles to his projects, such as the fact that he is the head of the family business and yet he is not the eldest son : hence he has to face his elder brothers, and that has been going on for a long time. The world is changing his way this time and he has to fight against the survival of what the world used to be. At this point this trilogy is becoming a vast fresco about the history of Italian-Americans or should I say Sicilian-Americans ? When the fresco is too vast we can wonder if it does not lose some of its possible meaning by diluting it into too many elements, periods and events. But it is certainly interesting to follow this intricate family history that verges onto a sitcom at times.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

Tony claims his is the scenery in Sicily when Vito goes back to visit. I would have to agree to an extent, but when Vito scales the roofs in Little Italy, stalking Don Fanucci is simply magnificent.<br/><br/>The Godfather II is not so much a sequel.

The Godfather Part II is of course better than Part III in so many ways, but the first one will always be the superior. Now, I have to say though, that I really didn't find the movie as strong as the original, and I'm surprised that so many people think they're both equal when clearly they're not. II starts to suffer from over-bloatedness (which III had in spades). I wasn't involved in the Robert Deniro backstory as some people, I was somewhat groaning when we were going back in time.. But in the present time, like when Al Pacino is on the screen, THAT I enjoyed. I think Pacino is at his best here, since he knows the character so well. Keaton and all the rest of them are great too.

","The Godfather Part II is a complicated film. In its 3 hour run time it manages to pull off telling two stories. One that takes place in the 1950s, and one that takes place in the 1920s. In the 1920s we see Vito Corleone arriving in New York City and making a name for himself among the wealthy gangsters, starting a family, and eventually becoming Don of the Corleone crime family. The exact parallel is the 1950s story, where we see Vito's son Michael in his new role as Don of the Corleone family as he starts his own family. The Godfather Part II is a superior film to the original because it tells a much more interesting story, and it does a better job at portraying what an organized crime family is really like.<br/><br/>All of the great actors from the original are back including James Caan in a flashback sequence. Al Pacino comes across as a great bad guy, and he seems to be ten times more cold hearted than his father ever was. He's a changed man. He started off a legitimate man who wanted nothing to do with his family's business, but now he's more into it than ever before. This movie features Al Pacino's second best performance in a film (second to Dog Day Afternoon), and it shows what kind of actor he truly is. This is the film that made Robert De Niro a star, and rightly so. Robert De Niro portrays young Vito Corleone on his rise to power in New York. This is Robert De Niro's first big role and he plays it like he's been doing it for years. The best thing about it is that just about every line of his dialogue is in Italian, and yet you still enjoy his performance.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II contains the most realistic view of the mafia ever portrayed in film. In fact it's so realistic that the central characters don't even refer to it as the mafia. The Godfather Part II tells a more interesting story than the original, and it's more fun to sit through. The Godfather Part II is a great film that is both dramatic and epic as well as entertaining. Great movie.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I love this movie not only because I'm half Italian, but also because I liked the history of the Corleone family and how the film flips from Michael's story to his father's story. The cinematography in the film is fantastic, especially the scenes in Sicily, but that should not take anything away from the stirring and very moving sound track as well. The reason why I think this is better than the first Godfather film is the fact that we get to learn more about why Vito, michael's father, came to America, and how difficult it was to scrape a living in the era, especially for southern Italians who thought they would escape the mafia and poverty by emmigrating to America, only to find they had both already got there before them. Every time I see the scene when the ship arrives in New York, with the fantastic and very emotive score accompanying it, I can't help but cry my heart out, it just struck a chord. Please, don't just watch this film because of it's mafia content, because it has so much more to offer, not only with it's fantastic performances(De Niro particularly, as it's hard to speak Sicilian dialect at the best of times), but also because it gives us an insight in to why a group of people would want to leave their homeland."

","I'm of Hispanic descent, but happen to have picked up the Italian language to a point, that I can hold a conversation with a native speaker in most any subject, but I didn't understand almost nothing of what Deniro was talking about. He said a few ramblings that I understood, but the rest a nothing but a made up language made up to be Italian...then again, since I do have Sicilian friends, agreed with me. Sicily, a part of Italy, has its own dialect, but I never have heard it though. Since I have two close Sicilian friends, they really don't talk about their dialect. But if you ask me...if young Vito spoke a dialect, how come the children didn't speak the same dialect, especially in the Sollozo/McCluskey meeting Michael scene. Sollozo di speak the Italian I know, and Michael also spoke it well enough and understood it well enough to understand Sollozo so McCluskey wouldn't understand what they were talking about. Also an addition to Michael in Sicily when meeting Apollonia's father that he wanted to meet his daughter. He could have used the Sicilian dialect. Because according to on of my buddies, they are taught in reality two languages: Italian and Sicilian. In this case, Deniro could have practiced Italian a bit harder, the language itself is not difficult to speak and pronounce. But what irks me the most is butchering a beautiful language like Italian."

","I fell in love with ""The Godfather Part II"" the first time I saw it! And why not? No other movie that runs for a whopping 200 minutes, has held my interest like this one has! There is not a single wasted moment in this long running time. And what's more..it has my most favourite actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starring in it! Words are not enough to describe this great film, and as has rightly been said by many: to call it a sequel is an insult! This is yet another movie that gets better each time you see it.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II tells parallel stories of young Vito Corleone's early life and his son Michael's reign as Don Corleone. The contrast in the two eras has been shown beautifully. The colours used, the sets, the overall feel...everything has been shown to such fine detail, that it becomes impossible to even try and find a flaw in this film! The most important thing to mention here is that the flashback scenes of Vito's life appear at very apt moments! They are not placed haphazardly. Careful attention has been given to their placement, so that they fit beautifully in the present narrative of Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro delivers a mind-blowing performance as the young Vito. He has uncannily managed to look and behave exactly like the young Vito Corleone would (given Brando's depiction of the same character in the first movie). In some scenes it actually feels as if we are watching a young Brando portraying Vito Corleone! Al Pacino is stunning as the cold, ruthless, brooding Michael Corleone! He manages to express so much through his eyes, its almost eerie! John Cazale as Fredo has a lot to do in this movie and he pulls it off wonderfully. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen does complete justice to his role yet again! Other performances worth a very special mention include: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, Gaston Moschin as Don Fanucci and G.D. Spradlin as Senator Geary.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton is better in this movie than in the first as Kay; Talia Shire as Connie is adequate.<br/><br/>Also, special mention about the choice of actors playing the young Tessio and young Clemenza (John Aprea and Bruno Kirby respectively); they actually bear an uncanny resemblance to the older actors playing these same parts in Part I.<br/><br/>The cinematography, needless to say, is amazing! The sepia tone makes the film appear like a beautiful painting.... The score: once again, a class apart! <br/><br/>This is one ""sequel"" that truly surpasses the original! I try not to call it a sequel as far as possible, because the word ""sequel"" simply doesn't fit! ""The Godfather Part II"" is an offer that no one should/can ever refuse!! To do so would quite simply be a ""crime""....."

","Moving through the deep shadows and heavy glooms of his vast estate, Michael Corleone presides over the destruction of his own spirit in ""The Godfather, Part II."" The character we recall from ""The Godfather"" as the best and brightest of Don Vito's sons, the one who went to college and enlisted in the Marines, grows into a cold and ruthless man, obsessed with power. The film's closing scenes give us first a memory of a long-ago family dinner, and then Michael at mid-life, cruel, closed, and lonely. He's clearly intended as a tragic figure.<br/><br/>The Corleone saga, as painted by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo in two films totaling nearly seven hours, has been a sort of success story in reverse. In a crazy way, ""The Godfather"" and its sequel belong in the same category with those other epics of immigrant achievement in America, ""The Emigrants"" and ""The New Land."" The Corleone family worked hard, was ambitious, remembered friends, never forgave disloyalty, and started from humble beginnings to become the most powerful Mafia organization in the country. If it were not that the family business was crime, these films could be an inspiration for us all.<br/><br/>Coppola seems to hold a certain ambivalence toward his material. Don Vito Corleone as portrayed by Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather"" was a man of honor and dignity, and it was difficult not to sympathize with him, playing with his grandchild in the garden, at peace after a long lifetime of murder, extortion, and the rackets. What exactly were we supposed to think about him? How did Coppola feel toward the Godfather? ""The Godfather, Part II"" moves both forward and backward in time from the events in ""The Godfather,"" in an attempt to resolve our feelings about the Corleones. In doing so, it provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers, but it does something even more disappointing: It reveals a certain simplicity in Coppola's notions of motivation and characterization that wasn't there in the elegant masterpiece of his earlier film.<br/><br/>He gives us, first of all, the opening chapters in Don Vito's life. His family is killed by a Mafia don in Sicily, he comes to America at the age of nine, he grows up (to be played by Robert De Niro), and edges into a career of crime, first as a penny-ante crook and then as a neighborhood arranger and power broker: a man, as the movie never tires of reminding us, of respect."

","As a huge fan of the Godfather series, (yes I even like part three) I have to say that part two is my personal favorite. Part one shows us the title of Godfather being passed from Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to his son Michael (Al Pacino).<br/><br/>The second film begins with Vito as a young boy being smuggled out of Sicily after his entire family was murdered by the local mafia. Then the story re-joins Michael in his now powerful position as mafia Don, and head of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>The film is divided into sections of the present-day story of Michael trying to gear the family to bigger deals in Cuba with his fathers old partner Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) while also dealing with the uprising of the Cuban rebels; and the betrayal of his brother Fredo (John Cazale). One of the great scenes is when he gives Fredo the ""kiss of death"" at the New Year's party.<br/><br/>The other section of the film is comprised of a young Vito (as played by Robert De Niro) making his way in old town New York. It shows his way up the organized crime ladder, making friends and connections that would later (and earlier) carry the story.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola delivers masterful genius in this epic reprisal of a gangster classic. He uses soft, brown textures and dull sepia tones to perfection. The lighting has yet to be duplicated in any film. The way some of these shots are framed have been studied in film schools the world over. In short, if your looking for the epitamy of cinematic enjoyment mixed with that good ole' classic gangster violence, this is the movie for you. I would recommend it to anyone."

Deniro played young Vito Corleone, and the film showed how the Vito Corleone became so powerful, from a peasant in Sicily to a big-time Godfather! Deniro's part was a prequel to the original film. From my point of view, Rober De Niro wasn't trying to play as young Vito Corleone, but tried to play as young Marlon Brando (RIP). He played it so well, that the Deniro scenes were more enjoyable to watch than Pacino's scenes. The directing was great in this film, and how the camera angles taken, the lightening, and how well the movie flowed.<br/><br/>This film is probably the best film of the 19th century, with the best actors, the best directing and a great storyline.

"ian-smith","10","0","2","6 July 2005"," A Very Close Call
","When I first saw Godfather Part I, I was a little skeptical about the sequel. There really didn't seem to be a lot to build on. Now, a couple of years later, and far wiser, I must say that in my humble opinion, that Godfather Part II is just a little bit better than the first. Again, the same cast is here, save for the characters who passed away in the first chapter. Once again, I believe that the actors gave unscrupulous performances, some far better than they gave in the first Godfather. Talia Shire, for example: sure her character gets a lot more screen time in this one, however she seemed much more grounded and into character in this sequel. Al Pacino completely takes Michael Corleone to a completely new and fantastic level, completely making a 360 degree turn from the Michael we first met as a Marine Corps Captain who wanted nothing to do with the family business. He actually becomes a feared and somewhat hated character in these movies. In this sense, hated is not a bad thing. You want to hate him for killing his brother. You want to hate him for the way he treats his wife. The dramatic turn of events between Michael and Kay is so powerful it is awe-inspiring. And how can you not love the story that is also being told at the same time of a young Vito Corleone? A marvelous performance by a young Robert De Niro, who brings to life the beginnings of who would become the unquestioned lord of legalized crime. De Niro is marvelous, and the only actor who could have possibly pulled it off better is Marlon Brando himself, but for obvious reasons could not play this role. You see a young Vito witness the deaths of his mother, father, and older brother and escape from the local crime boss in Corleone, Italy on a ship bound for America. You see him as a young man, graciously losing his job because he had to be let go, and then gaining friends and earning respect whenever he himself kills the ""Black Hand"", a figure in the New York slums who took full advantage of his high position. The reason I believe this movie is better than the first is only because of the more complex story and the dramatic, bittersweet climax of the characters. This movie is truly brilliant, and it is a very close call between this one and the first which one is the best. Truly beautiful."

","I have a question for all you GF experts:(SPOILER) When Michael is talking to Frank Pantangeli at his old house, he tells Frank that his father (Don Vito) taught him to ""keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"". In the 40+ times I have seen this movie, I still don't understand that line at all. I know it is a Corleone family trait to make nice with a potential enemy and then kill him when he least expects it, Ir Pauly the driver and Sollozzo, but there has to be more to it than that.<br/><br/>Also, another line from GFII has always bothered me, when Michael is eating an orange (of course) and talking about killing Hyman Roth, he says to Rocco, ""If history has taught us anything, it's that anyone can be assassinated"", which in my (admittedly, mediocre) mind is nonsense. If ""anyone"" can be assassinated, then I think Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Khomeini, Saddam, Bin Laden, etc... easily disprove that theory.

","This movie is every bit as good as the original. Perhaps a bit less entertaining, but surely the more intelligent of the two movies. The plot line is far more complex and may be difficult to follow for those folks with less than ideal intellectual capacities. The plot line takes us back and forth from the present in Las Vegas, New York, Miami and Havana, Cuba to the past in Sicily where it traces the early life of the father Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the original and brought back to life by Robert Deniro in the flashback scenes) as he struggles to survive in Sicily as a child, eventually making his way to America. For those of you, like myself, of Italian-American heritage, the scene where the young boy arrives in Ellis Island is especially poignant.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but the central theme of the movie is that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) must come to grips with the fact that despite all his efforts, he cannot escape becoming the same kind of man as his father, perhaps even worse. And in the end he must deal with betrayal and confront the ironic ends to which he will go to ""protect his family"" at all costs. The lessons in this blown up morality play are profound and timeless.<br/><br/>Like the original movie, the acting is brilliant, perhaps even better than the first movie thanks to a stunning turn by Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth (very loosely based on real life mob figure Meyer Lansky) and a typically awesome performance by Robert Deniro as the young Vito.<br/><br/>10 out 10"

","GODFATHER II simply destroys the myth that most sequels to major films are usually inferior products and rather bad ideas. The film easily ranks as one of the finest sequels in movie history and, in fact, may be preferred by audiences to the original! While GODFATHER I is unquestionably a classic film and makes virtually every critic's all-time top 10 movie list, GODFATHER II stands right beside it combining the three mighty elements of movie making: engrossing script, brilliant direction, and powerful performances from every actor who steps in front of the camera. <br/><br/>The sequel simply has so many watchable and engrossing scenes in the Corleone family saga that audiences never seem to tire of them even after viewing them over and over for years. The opening sequence at the Corleone First Communion celebration along the blue waters of Lake Tahoe is a fresh and welcome juxtaposition to the grim, New York Depression years of GODFATHER I. The story moves intriguingly along as the confrontation between Michael Corleone and Nevada Senator Geary serve as the impetus for the family's new business interests: establishing a foothold in the Las Vegas hotel empire. Geary refuses to assist Corleone's attempt to acquire a liquor license; Michael's sister Connie (Talia Shire) asking for money so she can marry her beau Merle (Troy Donahue); the shift to Las Vegas where weak Fredo's buddy-buddy relationship with Hyman Roth (Lee Strassberg) seals his doom; the attempted Michael Corleone assassination attempt at the compound; senate racketeering hearings; the brilliant performance of acting maestro Lee Strasberg as Corleone antagonist Hyman Roth; the bitterly unforgiving retribution Michael delivers to his brother Freddo and wife Kay (Diane Keaton); and, of course, the entire flashback to the early Vito Corleone days in early 1900's New York where we witness Michael Corleone relieving the Italian community of the ""The Black Hand"" and thereby establishing the roots of the family syndicate.<br/><br/>Not to be overlooked, is the memorable performance of gravel-voiced Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) who plays one of the Corleone's most loyal lieutenants. Pentangeli's wrath over not being able to wipe out the competing Rosario Brothes spills over to his betrayal of the Corleone's which ultimately seals his own doom. After being placed in the Witness Protection Program and delivering a deposition, Pentangeli sits at the senate committee table ready to sing--until he glimpses the sudden appearance of his brother from Italy being escorted into the courtroom ominously by Michael. Pentangeli reverses himself and refuses to incriminate Corleone.<br/><br/>If there's a lesson that comes through just about every frame of all three GODFATHER films, it's that trusted disciples almost always become a Judas. Virtually every loyal Corleone lieutenant, it seems, eventually betrays the family and is doomed to be crushed under the Michael Corleone boot. Even poor Abe Vigoda goes over to the competition and ends up taken for a ride. <br/><br/>What comes through most effectively in the Corleone character--as it must come through--is Al Pacino's portrayal of the Godfather's iron fist and harsh retribution. Pacino's performance as the Don is a masterpiece in film history for its brilliant economy and understatement. Everything that needs to be stated or conveyed is done so with either a few sentences, harsh glare, or nod. Corleone's single, and most memorable verbal outburst, comes at his wife when she reveals she aborted the child he wanted. The vengeance Corleone exacts against those he feels betrayed him are conveyed with a sense of unswerving and inevitable doom: for when one double-crosses a Corleone, one pays the ultimate price. <br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance as Micahel Corleone is movie legend. And GODFATHER II should make everyone must-see list, especially those who were enthralled by GODFATHER I and the tale of the Corleone's.<br/><br/>Trivia: A woman I currently work with appears briefly in the Lake Tahoe celebration scene at the beginning of the film. She said she was vacationing near Homewood (east Lake Tahoe) during the filming of GODFATHER II when Coppola pulled her and many other extras off the street saying he needed ""a lot of people."" She received nothing for appearing.....Troy Donahue made a cameo as Connie's beau in GODFATHER II playing Merle--which was Donahue's first real name...<br/><br/>Dennis Caracciolo"

","It's hard to decide which is the better Godfather movie. The brilliant stroke here is that Coppola does not present a typical sequel. Events move both forward and backward. Roberto De Niro is at his best as the young Vito Corleone. The assassination of the local mafia don is a particularly effective moment. In a way this movie is a reference to the American dream of success but in this case it is the success of the gangster. Coppola is so great at making this a simple human drama that we forget that it is a film about a criminal element of our society. Older movies, like those with Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney showed us the gangster as cool but with no family ties. Here we see these immigrant people as family people but with a decidedly twisted morality. That morality is explained early in the Godfather 2 when we learn about Vito's past. The combination of this element with the more recent problems of power tha t Michael Corleone has to deal with make this a great and unusual film."

","In the Godfather, we saw Michael Corleone transform from idealistic youngest child to all-powerful mafia don. He successfully protected his family and led its resurrection. Part II is a roller-coaster in theme: Vito Corleone in his younger days(another one of De Niro's classic roles)rises from poverty, personal tragedy, and personal weakness to become the Godfather, a man whose family is healthy, safe, and affluent. He is a moral man, but does not rule out murder and crime as an option. He only uses it to help his family, however. The downward slope of this roller coaster is the story of Michael. I can't think of any tragedies I have seen in film that matches this one. Coppola does excellent at making us both sympathies and lament with a man who is evil, cruel, and destructive. Michael Corleone is now in firm control of the family. All seems well: his wife Kay is pregnant, they have two children already, Anthony and Mary. But these scenes early in the movie only serve as the diving board into the abyss. The night of his son's communion, an assassination is attempted against Michael. This is the beginning of the end. Michael trusts no one, save for Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall where were you for Part III? Save us from George Harrison please!!). But by the end, Michael trusts no one, especially after he finds out that his brother Fredo(another tragic character) was connected to his near assassination. Michael does some business in Cuba that only aids in the destruction of his soul. By the end, Kay and the children have left him, Fredo has been killed by him, and Michael is left alone. The end of the movie is a series of the best shots ever put into film(with the exception of some in Apocalypse Now). The dinner conversation summarizes the tragedy of Michael. He says he's joining the Marines and Tom and Sonny scold him. ""I have my own plan's for my future."" It is Don Vito's birthday and the family is there to greet him at the door for a song, but Michael sits alone at the table thinking. The final two images are of a train ride with Vito and Michael, showing a happy and successful Vito and young Michael and then the next, the most powerful shot of all time, is of Michael, sitting alone at his Nevada home. He sits there, broken, alone, invincible to his enemies but dead on the inside, a man whose sins will haunt him forever. Then the picture fades to black and in that instant will see what was wasted. Michael and Vito both were great men, but fate put them in their roles. Wasted greatness is the ultimate theme of the Godfather Trilogy and the tragedy of Michael Corleone is epic. Like Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet, destiny was against Michael. That is what ultimately makes us sympathetic."

Coppola manages to take a great original and somehow add to it in a way that elevates it from simply a good movie into true art.<br/><br/>The story of Michael Corleone is dramatic in that it explores very seriously some themes that, by comparison, the first film only touches upon. Sure, it explains that Michael had a strong chance to make something of himself very far away from his father, and that he threw it all away. But in Part II we finally see the real reason why Michael's path was doomed to failure: He and his father were very different men with very different lives.<br/><br/>The finality and veracity of that message is so effectively transmitted in film that it comes off looking like an adaptation of ancient Greek drama. And like Greek drama often does, Godfather II dramatizes a particular moral idea by taking it to extremes. The simple version of the message: Tradition itself is worthless. You can try to hold the same values from generation to generation, but times change and those values don't guide you through every new situation. Vito Corleone's experiences as a Sicilian immigrant to New York are one thing, but Michael learns some dramatically different lessons in Batista's exploited Cuba.<br/><br/>The storytelling is so great, and so effective with the cast (especially with regard to Robert de Niro's historical reconstruction), that you can almost feel yourself walking down the streets of the Lower East Side around the turn of the century, and the memories evoked seem to erupt from your own head rather than from the screen. Great script and an even better cast make this one a must-own for true movie fanatics."

","I'm not sure that I agree with some people that this film is even better than the first, but that is rather like saying is Beethoven 'better' than Mozart: both are geniuses. There are two towering, brilliant, outstanding performances from Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. I cannot think of two greater performances on screen - and ironically they didn't meet!<br/><br/>They seemed to make movies differently once: this is about 'atmosphere'. And the atmosphere generated is truly astonishing. It's such a contrast to today's cinematography which has to ladle on the obvious because, one assumes, people are too stupid to follow. One can only laugh at the notion that Jackson's Rings trilogy could find its way into a comparative top 10 with the Godfather. The latter belongs to a universe of brilliance and sophistication that Jackson's work won't achieve even if he goes through 100 successive re-incarnations trying to get there.<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert)<br/><br/>I love the contrasting way in which Vito builds friends out of nothing, but by careful and adept people-working, whereas Michael starts out with a clan, and ends up staring in loneliness across the lake. Pacino develops this aspect quite superbly, as de Niro does the converse.<br/><br/>It's outstanding stuff. And the two taken together may never be matched."

","The Godfather part two is as exceptional if not better than the original. It is true that the theme of soul corruption had been explored to great length by the end of the first film however through the genius of Coppola this is re-investigated albeit in greater depth. Michael's transition follows it's natural devastating conclusion, and his relationship aswell as his desire to emulate his father is far more prevalent. Michael's motives for becoming head of the family were like his father's, the protection and consolidation of his family, however  he loses sight of this and loses most of that foundation and solidarity through death and divorce and is left with no-one, this arguably becomes the greatest irony of the series with the perpetual insistence on the importance and virtues of the family.The second film is vital in charting this trajectory more clearly and the importance of family becomes secondary to that of survival and power. Coppola intelligently looks at the  situation in Cuba in the 1950s and the wealth and corruption in abundance under the direction of what would have been Battista's regime. From Cuba Michael learns that although money is power the determination of one individual to sacrifice his life for a cause is infinitely more powerful, in this instance Coppola offers us hope rather than nihilism.The story of Vito Corleone's rise to power adds a rich subtext to the film and the two are interwoven throughout highlighting the contradictions between Michael and his father who's life he so covets by the end of the film. Both part one and two in the Godfather series  inspire thought provoking analysis into the human condition and the sense of of catharsis at the end is more reminiscent of King Lear than a gangster flick. Coppola's achievement was to produce two entirely different films and with the genial masterpiece that is the Godfather as its backdrop part two is extremely accomplished and no simple task for any director."
"igm","9","0","1","5 March 2004"," A fine film that ages gracefully
","I have just watched <The Godfather: Part II> again.  It is an ambitious story, spanning more than fifty years.  It is a story of the first half of the twentieth century in America, as the country coped with waves of immigration, prohibition, war in Europe, the post-war boom, and rebellion in Cuba.<br/><br/>The first part of the Godfather trilogy offers only a foretaste of the heart of the Godfather story arc: the genesis of the Corleone family business with young Vito Corleone, played with easy confidence by Robert De Niro; and the hardening of Michael Corleone, played with mesmerizing intensity by Al Pacino.<br/><br/>* spoilers from here onward *<br/><br/>The movie is peppered with iconic and powerful images: a young Vito Corleone (Andolini) singing hymns while quarantined at Ellis Island, Vito executing his first hit with a towel-wrapped pistol, Michael bestowing a kiss of death on his brother Fredo, Michael gazing out his boathouse window as he awaits the fate of his brother, Hyman Roth's Lee-Harvey-Oswald-style assassination in a scrum of press and security.<br/><br/>The movie is shot artfully, though at times is lit a bit dimly.  The location selection and set decoration are attentively and evocatively rendered as we follow Vito's rise.  It is easy to forget that the segements showing Michael's fall are also period shots, set about twenty-five years prior to filming, as they are unforced and ring true.<br/><br/>The vengeful, unforgiving Sicilian code depicted in the film undoes all that is good in Vito and Michael.  They are devoted family men, loyal to their sympathizers, supportive of their community, and admired for their wisdom. But they kill to win their independence from authority, to secure their power, to eliminate dissenters, and to settle decades-old vendettas. Michael's obsession with securing his power causes him to imprison then estrange his wife, order the death of his own brother, betray his old friends, and embrace his rivals.  He is left with an empire and no one to share it with: his parents and brothers are dead, wife gone, children afraid, and so on.  His only solace is the brow-beaten sister who returns to live with him in the family compound, and his similarly brow-beaten adoptive brother, Tim Hagen.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall, as well as Talia Shire, Lee Strasberg, and Bruno Kirby.<br/><br/>I had previously recorded my vote for this movie as an eight, but have now revised it to a nine of ten.<br/><br/>igm"

The movie explores the dark side of being involved in crime, it's clearly more melancholy, it's again very atmospheric, especially New York in the yearly years of the 20th century.

","It must have seemed like a recipe for disaster. Following on from one of the most acclaimed films of all time a follow up without the principal character from the first film. But this film confounds the expectations by being the greatest sequel of all time.<br/><br/>This film is told in two strands. One strand continues from where the first finished with Michael now head of the family. Al Pacino puts in another outstanding performance and it is quite amazing that he didn't get an Oscar for either his performance in this or the original Godfather. Michael has a plan to make the Corleone family a legitimate business, but is thwarted by the code of conduct.<br/><br/>The other strand tells the story of Vito's early life and features Robert De Nero in the part of Vito. Vito is packed off to America as a young boy to escape certain death at the hands of the local Don. He takes on a new identity and soon kills Don Fanucci because he thinks he is not looking after his own kin.<br/><br/>The greatest sequel of all time with another fantastic script.

","Francis Ford Coppola was in his prime as a director in the 1970s with  GFI and II, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now.  This is probably one of the best sequels ever made because like all good sequels (Empire Strikes Back, Rocky II, etc.) it borrows from the original but has its own unique story that is more than the recycling of former themes, structures and philosophies.<br/><br/>Spoiler Warning.<br/><br/>GFII tells parallel stories of the young Vito Corleone and of his son Michael.  Coppola does a good job of knowing when to flash back and flash foward.  We see Vito as an orphan coming to America, establishing his influence by killing the local Don, building up his business and getting his revenge on the Don who ordered the death of his father, brother and mother. Michael tries to legitimize the family business by buying casinos, creating ties to political figures and investing in the Cuban government which will become communist at the beginning of 1959.  We see his personal life deteriorating as there is an assassination attempt that his brother, Fredo, was somewhat responsible for.<br/><br/>The lighting and music is great in this film.  I liked the acting by Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and especially Lee Strasburg as Hyman Roth.  It's a movie that could stand on its own.<br/><br/>
Most memorable scenes:  The images of the Statue of Liberty, the young Vito stalking Don Fanucci before killing him, Pacino's reaction to finding out Fredo is the traitor and later finding out his wife had an abortion, and the sequence that sees the death of Pentangeli, Roth and Fredo leading to a flashback that features men who have been murdered or alienated by Michael, except for Sonny.  Michael talked about not becoming a man like his father and years later we see he has become a much worser being.  He sits on a lawn chair and reflects upon the decisions and their consequences as the film fades darkly to the credits."

","There is one thing I feel sure about: the people who dislike ""The Godfather part 2"" or say ""Goodfellas"" is better, didn't understand the movie. The Godfather movies,like the book, are not to be taken as typical gangster stories or gangster stories at all. The first movie was how capitalism, the Catholic Church, big business and the goverment are all the same as organized crime. The second movie with a Marxist theme, is an expansion of that idea and tells how destructive capitalism is to three different types of Families. The movie did not intend to totally portray how the mafia works, but goes beyond that. With this in mind, The Godfather is a great movie and the violence is used to make a point.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if you do a little research, you will find out everything I said about the movie is true."

","Over the years, I have had an unusual history of often seeing important movie sequels before their predecessors. This is by no means intentional - merely bad timing. For a long time, this viewing pattern has occurred, oddly enough, with a few films that are considered among the greatest sequels ever made (""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""). I can add a new title to that list: ""The Godfather - Part II"". Yes, I must confess, I STILL have not yet seen the original 1972 crime classic about the beloved mafia family - but I'm sure I'll get around to it someday soon. I've seen PARTS of it here and there, anyway...and this epic, Oscar-winning sequel didn't surprise me in making me think of it as most likely superior to the first one (and certainly FAR superior to the third one in 1990, which I heard was a bit of a clunker, unfortunately).<br/><br/>In any case, this is truly one of the finest FILMS, not just sequels, I have ever seen, with a scope and power that very few other pictures can rival, quite frankly. I was blown away by much of the virtuoso performances from most of the actors - of course singling out Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as the most amazing ones, especially De Niro.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of storytelling, beautifully directed and told.

","The Godfather, Part II, The Two Towers and The Empire Strikes Back:  these are the only sequels to match the original.  What do thesee have in common? They are all continuations of a saga, rather than just additional stories. I do not distinguish necessarily between the greatness of the Godfather Parts I and II.  It is the same story, and both movies are ten times as good when viewed together in a 6 and a half hour marathon.  In Part II, an incredibly slow first hour concerning Michael's trying to find the people who want him killed, this returns to the compelling family drama that is truly the essence of the Godfather.  In the meantime, the story of young Vito, played by a young but still brilliant Robert De Niro, unfolds, intertwining his rise with the moral fall of Michael.  At the end, the arc is complete, and the final shot of MIchael sitting amongst the falling leaves, a man who has lost his family and his soul, a man totally alone, so unlike the innocent at the beginning of Part I, is the greatest end shot in history."

","...""The Godfather: Part II"" is probably the best sequel ever made.  As you all probably know, the story is cut in two: one half focuses on Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) battle to keep his power in the crime syndicate and the second focuses on Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) - the character played by Marlon Brando in the original - and his rise to power in America.  Both stories are done very well, but in the end the latter is more interesting. As everyone knows, Brando did a great performance and created a memorable character in the original, and it is very entertaining to watch De Niro give it a try.  Except after watching this film some may agree that De Niro did a better job.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Michael's story suffers from the loss of James Caan's character, Sonny Corleone.  He spiced up the first very much, and it truly is disappointing to see him disappear from the second.  Of course, Pacino still does an amazingly memorable (and villainous) performance.  The supporting players, consisting of Tom (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), Kay (Diane Keaton), Frankie (Michael V. Gazzo) and Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) also do well.<br/><br/>Coppola scored big on this one, and De Niro and Pacino make it even better, 9/10."

","I am one of those Godfather junkies (well at least the first two) who not only owns the DVD, but will stop to watch the movies every time I come across them while channel surfing. To be honest though, recently I am not as enthralled with The Godfather.  Over time, Part II has become a much better, richer movie going experience.  Not that there's anything wrong with The Godfather, I just happen to prefer this one.  I think that it paint a broader canvas thanks in part to jumping between the two stories.<br/><br/>
There are just so many wonderful scenes.  The film starts off with the story of how Vito Corleone came to America.  This part of the movie is in Sicilian and even shot on location in Sicily.  Then we jump to the 50's and the confirmation of Anthony, Vito's grandson.  Like the wedding in the first one, we get an idea of who the main players are going to be.  One of my favorite shots in this part is when Fredo's tramp wife meets Connie's gigolo fiance.  Coppola cuts to a shot Mama Corleone saying something to Consigliori Tom Hagen in Sicilian.  it is a brief shot, not more than 2 or 3 seconds but you get an idea of the relationship between them.  This is of interest to me as a Godfather obsessive since in the original novel, it is noted that the adopted Hagen never thought of Mama Corleone as a mother nor were they particularly close.  This shot shows how in the enusing years since her husband's death how they developed a bond.<br/><br/>There is so much good in this movie to rave about.  Coppola apparently loves commerative events: the wedding reception in the first movie, the aforementioned confimation party (which of course has little to do with the confirmation and everything to do with Michael's power) and New Year's in Cuba.<br/><br/>While we may remember the big scenes, there are also some wonderful simple scens just between two characters: Michael's visit to Hyman Roth in Miami, his drink with Fredo (a banana daquiri?) in Cuba, Kaye's leaving Michael (""this Sicilian thing"") and Tom's final meeting with Frankie Pantangelo. All these scenes are written with wonderful, intelligent dialogue accompanied by solid acting."

","The Godfather Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone and fills the background of Vito Corleone. Robert De Niro shines as Vito from his days in old New York. In some ways, I like Godfather better than Part II, but Robert De Niro's performance makes me rethink that. Al Pacino does great again as Michael and the same with John Cazale's Fredo, and Francis Ford Coppola shows why he is one of the best directors ever. In this second chapter, Michael gains complete control of the family and must find a traitor in their midsts. And we go back to the early 1900's New York and follow a young Vito's childhood and early adulthood. I think this is where the movie really picks up. Vito has always been my favorite (besides Sonny) so it was amazing to see his past. The movie does go on a little long and it slows up once in a while, but that is the only minor flaw. This is cinema at it's best. 9/10"
"silentium","10","0","1","30 July 2003"," ""Everytime I said a hail Mary I caught a fish.""
","Oh what an act Francis Ford had to follow! Seriously, under-taking a project such as this must've been extremely daunting. After all, the first Godfather film is no easy act to follow. But, Coppola continued to pay attention to his characters and the locations in which he staged them.<br/><br/>Without comparing this to its predecessor it's close to being without flaw. The prequel segments are beautifully done, shot, and staged. The pace is quicker and a lot more happens in this film, but in being the minority -- I don't think it's better than the first film. The parts with young Vito are certainly brilliant and Robert DeNiro gives a powerful performance of an emotionally restrained Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>The music is still good, although not as good as the score from the first. The main theme has changed, and I -- for one, miss it and think there's something seriously wanting about it. Yes, it's beautiful; but I don't believe it compares. <br/><br/>Al Pacino's performance here is un-rivaled, in almost any film. There are 4 pivotal performances I commend ahead of everything -- and that's: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather, Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and Robert DeNiro in The Godfather II. <br/><br/>There are so many great moments in this film. Michael confronting Fredo in Cuba, on New Years eve, is my favorite film of the sequel continuation. Otherwise it'd probably be Vito Corleone following Don Fanucci through the roof tops and then waits for him at his apartment. The light flickers on and off lighting up Vito's face and all you see is ice cold menace.<br/><br/>Some film fans like this film without even liking the first one, but I say the first is slightly superior, and only because Marlon Brando's missing and it just doesn't seem like ""The Godfather"" without him.<br/><br/>A+: A memorable experience."

","Certain sequels have the same movie title with ""Part 2"" after it. However some of these movies are completely different films than their predecessors. I beleive the Godfather and Godfather part 2 is the same movie. I read Puzo's book, and the majority of The Godfather pt. 2 is in the book The Godfather. Therefore, it is just a continuation of the story. Pt.2 also used the same exact sets that they used in the original film, (some of the ones used in the streets of sicily) it might of been shot on location, I think they were sets. <br/><br/>So as far as the ""second half"" of this film goes, I just can't find a film out there that I saw over 20 times, that still gives me goose bumps whenever I watch it over and over. The Godfather flicks still do that. The acting is uncomparable to anything, and Al Pacino and Robert Deniero are just phenomenal in this film. Pacino is just so cold hearted and emotionless in this movie that it boggles me.

I like the voyage in time and space that the viewer is allowed to take here: From the arid hinterland of Sicily to the stuffy brownstones in Hell's Kitchen to the grandeur of Lake Tahoe, to the elegant beachfront hotel in Cuba. In two occasions the meeting of crooks (that's more ore less what The Godfather in all parts is about) takes on the guise of a true art house movie: Hyman Roth's little birthday party on the roof terrace of a ritzy hotel in the Caribbeans and  above all  the passing around of an immensely tasteless golden telephone in the conference room of a Cuban ministry. Here it becomes more manifest than in any bloody murder scene: These guys are genuine carnivores!<br/><br/>I loved the outstanding performances of actors Lee Strasberg and John Cazale, both long gone now. Strasberg gives the sly, but old and exhausted schemer Hyman Roth a striking image. Amazing how much of a personality you can convey with moving so little! His difficult breathing, the faltering yet firm voice are just perfect. Cazale's portrayal of the Don's older, frustrated brother also left a lasting impression. You can almost grasp his unhappiness with your hands. The final conversation between him and the Don is a fantastic piece of acting. Slumped utterly dejected in a deck chair, he tries for the last time to stand up to his brother. ""I'm smart!"" he shouts, and his voice cracks miserably. I feel acting can't get better than that."

Fantastic directing, Acting, Script, and just about everything. <br/><br/>The Acting of course is top notch. Al Pacino is brilliant, and in my opinion even better as Don Michael Corleone. He can yell without overacting, every scene he yells at Kay, he makes me scared. The look on his face when Kay tells him she had an abortion is so memorable. Diane Keaton isn't bad as Kay but she is easily the weakest of everybody but she doesnt degrade the movie in anyway. John Cazale is good as Fredo (that never changes). Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg were nominated for their roles and they were great.<br/><br/>
The thing that makes Godfather II different from any other sequel is the fact that its a half sequel half prequel. Its what I admire most about Godfather II. And what makes it the best is that we get the standout supporting performance from none other than my favorite actor Robert De Niro. He is excellent as the young Vito Corleone.

While watching the movie, you can't help but be swept up by the history. Just the ambience of the movie is enough to make it great.

Very importantly, also back is Francis Ford Coppola as director! The acting is again first-rate as is the direction from Coppola. The script is again powerfully written and that power comes through on screen. This film goes back into the Corleone family background in Sicily and has a bit less action than the first film. There isn't as much violence, but if you've seen the first film, you know all about that already, so it's not really as necessary.

Probably the stand out performance in this movie is Robert DeNiro's breathtaking portrayal as young Vito Corleone (young Marlon Brando) and how he struggled in crime in America. Definetly more violent than the first, but sort of drags for a minute or two. Too bad James Caan isn't in this one, I liked his character! Marlon Brando is not in this one (because he died at the end of the first one). If you look very closely you will see the actor that plays Johnny Ola is none other than Dominic Chianse (the actor who portrays the role as the funny, bitter, and mean moboss Uncle Junior, in the hit television program on HBO ""The Sopranos""). If you haven't already, watch this!!! Don't watch it untill you've seen the first one. Grade: A"

","In my opinion, Godfather II is not better than Godfather I but its just as great. These two movies are the best Crime Dramas Ever Made. The acting is top notch, just like in the first movie. Al Pacino delivers an awesome performance. Talia Shire also delivers a good performance but I wish she was in it a little more. Robert Deniro stole the movie with his performance as the young Vito Corleone. No wonder he won best supporting actor. Diane Keaton's performance is actually better in this movie than the last one.<br/><br/>The movie's Directing is actually done better than in Part I. Another brilliant script was in this movie.

Even though the movie was a bit longer than Part I you really dont care when you see how well done the two stories were. I think if there was only one story the movie wouldn't have been as great. The first two Godfathers will always remain the Best Crime Drama Movies around. Thats another promise."

Pacino in GF I changed from a naive happy (in love) character into a ruthless killer.  For that alone he deserved best supporting actor for the Oscar. He also deserved best actor in GF II (He was so good in II), but his best transformation will always be the first movie.

","*Attention Spoilers*<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are two scenes in ""The Godfather Part II"" that completely describe the mastery and eloquence of this wonderful film. One scene is at the very beginning. I am referring to the party celebrating Michael's son's first communion. The music and atmosphere play in strict contrast to the beginning of the first film. In ""The Godfather"", the Corleone family was fully emersed into the Italian life. They were completely outside the American ideal, basing their lives on values learned through Sicilian experience and heiritage. The music during the wedding was Italian, even the food was Italian. During Michael's party in the second film, the music played is distinctly American, so much so that the pure blooded Italian, Frank Pantangali become upset and insulted by the whole presidings. He tries to get the band to play Italian music, and they rebel. He accuses Michael of ignoring his heiritage by moving to Las Vegas and drinking champaign (instead of the wine that Italians usually drink). The irony, is that Michael probably thought that ignoring his ancestory would help the family eventually become legitimate. Instead, by vacating everything thing that defines him, Michael becomes a castle among himself, a powerful man who is as hollow as he is evil.<br/><br/>The theme here, is that the American capitalist system is in many ways more corrupting than anything ever seen previously. For example, in the first film, the villains (including Vito), although evil and corrupt, are still men of honor and take action based on this honor, no matter how misguided. There may be backstabbing, but it is, as many would say, strictly business. Michael in this film, by contrast, seems to have forgone any resemblence of these honorable traits. He kills men without any basis other than for the acquisition of complete power. He commits fratracide because he wants to destroy all those who have wronged him, even though he has done more harm to his family then Fredo would ever think of doing (especially to all those close to him: Kay, Tom Hagen, his children, and of course Fredo). But again, he's only working under the system he's entered into. This is clear when he negotiates with a corrupt Senator at the beginning of the film. This Senator clearly has no guidelines or values to follow, he only wants what many people in his position want, money and more Power. But Michael is smarter, and understands that having such a man as an ally is better than killing him. Vito, by contrast, probably would have had Luca Brasi put a bullet through his head for a man of his power treating others of similar status with such disrespect. Thus, there is no longer a showing of decorum in the American system, only crass ""directness"" and dishonesty. I think, the corruption in the American system is part of the reason why ""The Sopranos"" is so popular today. With all the scandals like Enron, many criminals in white collar society can screw people over, even their friends and get a mere slap on the wrist. In ""The Sopranos"", if you go against the Family you get wacked. Plain and simple.<br/><br/>The Vito scenes in ""The Godfather Part II"" are used to contrast those of Michael. Yet, even though Vito's actions seem more honorable, he is slowly getting corrupted as well. It is clear, that killing the town boss was not a selfless act of a caring man. It was a power play, a way for Vito to acquire power himself, because just as he hated that boss, he strangely admired him as well. In a way, Vito loses his innocence the moment he witnesses the bosses power at the play, and continues on a dark path that Michael embarks and completes by the end of the film.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in all ""The Godfather"" films is the scene at the end, where we see all our favorite characters (except Vito), some dead, at the table and Michael announces that he is going into the army. This scene is one of great sadness, because Michael was such an intelligent man that he knew what the ""life"" would mean to his soul. He knew that he would lose everything if he went on that dark path, and that is the tragedy...<br/><br/>9/10 Grade: A"

","The Godfather (1972) was a hit and is today a cult classic and regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It still holds its ground today. And then in 1974 came it's sequel/prequel The Godfather Part II which is EQUALLY as good, possibly better, than The Godfather itself. It scooped 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor (Robert DeNiro).<br/><br/>Opening again with its mesmerising score by Nino Rota comes Michael Corleone taking a kiss on his hand, then revealing the throne, while Pacino plays it perfectly in one of films greatest performances. Then we are introduced to a marvel of sheer brilliance, flashbacks to the young Don Vito Corleone's time (played in Part I by Marlon Brando), involving brilliance after brilliance. The film continuously switches between the Vito flashbacks and the current time of Michael Corleone, before and after the time of the original film, and in each has a gripping and powerful story that pulls you in and doesn't allow you to escape. From brilliant storylines as traitors, break-ups and of course killings, The Godfather Part II is arguably better than Part I.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is absolutely brilliant as Michael, this is possibly his best performance. And while Pacino plays his character like a God, Robert DeNiro plays young Vito uncannily similar to Brando's original Vito. Both give two of films greatest performances. Like many have said this must've taken a pact with the devil because I don't know HOW they could do something like this, something equally, maybe better, than the greatest movie ever made (in my opinion), and in itself possibly the greatest. And when the tragic end comes, you can't help but feel that you have witnessed more than just a movie.<br/><br/>You have witnessed raw brilliance rarely acheived as great as it was here."
"dirx","Null","0","1","20 August 2002"," Moral education?
","It's sad that so many reviewers judge the ""Godfather""-movies according to the moral value of their characters: these are bad people and therefore it is a bad film, unless you show them as monsters. This is simply a wrong and a rather primitive approach. It is as wrong as saying that the paintings of Renoir are better than those of Rubens because Rubens' women are naked and just don't care about it. We don't need moral education by film directors. What filmmakers can give us is examples of what life (and death) can be. Only bad artists (like almost every Hollywood director) judge their characters. Coppola does not.<br/><br/>Michael, on the surface, is more cold and remorseless than Vito. But he has no choice, because he is also under a much higher pressure than Vito. His face has a pasty skin, almost yellow. The constant worrying about his family and business makes him look sick and exhausted. He is a man on the peak of his power (on the peak of the whole family history), but it is eating him up. That is why I saw him not only as a frightening but also as a pitiable man. Take the scene when he comes home from Cuba, sitting on the sofa and refreshing his eyes with a wet towel while hearing his wife has ""lost"" their child. Or when he watches Kay sewing and refuses to go kiss her. His loneliness is overwhelming.<br/><br/>But is Vito really a more warm-hearted, more ""social"" person than Micheal? E.g., young Vito lies without hesitation to his pals (Genco, Clemenza), if he can derive an advantage from it. His generous favors for his neighbors have the only purpose of building up a network of dependants. Typical for Vito (standing for the mob in general) is to use ""friendship"" for business, because to him the main things in friendship are obligation and debt - and not goodness and leniency. These are reserved for the family only. In this, Michael is his pupil, who merely expands these principles from neighbourly help into dimensions ""bigger than US Steel"". There is one single thing that Vito would not have done, as Michael knows: kill his brother (""Mrs. Corleone: But you can never lose your family - Michael: Times are changing.""). And this is the only time he is in doubt what to do.<br/><br/>But Michael *is* a complete different man. He reflects about his life and position in a way Vito never would have done. Vito acts by instinct, like a predator, while Michael is a modern manager, adopting elements of the culture of his homeland, with a WASP wife, army service and so on. Michael has *decided* to become a mobster, for the sake of his family, and is it with great effort and unprecedented success, while for Vito it is simply in his nature. That this permanent strain is far more wearing, sickening, seems to be clear. Therefore the change in Michael's character from Part II to III is not plausible to me. At least it should have been made more clearly *how* he became so gentle and well-balanced.<br/><br/>In German literature you can find a story very similar to this: in the novel ""Buddenbrooks"" by Thomas Mann, which has nothing to do with crime..."

The epilouge is excellent though with the court-case and final cold-blooded end for the weak willed Freddo.  DeNiro is magic here as the young Vito and thoroughly deserved his best supporting actor award, it was a difficult task to fill the enormous shoes of Brando's left behind from his unforegettable performance as the Don in the original but the young DeNiro was fantastic.

Not because of Vito's youth which is really useful for appreciating the Godfather - part I. This part really enlightens the first film and allows to understand many things untold in the previous one, especially the section in Sicily. But, may be compared to his father - and the parallel between the story of Vito and that of Michael along the film helps the comparison - Michael appears too hard, much more harder and less nice than we could have guessed from the first part. I also dislike and find strange, as a woman, some of Kay behaviors.

","I approached The Godfather Part II expecting a tantalizing movie experience like that I received from its predecessor.  I expected a romantic, epic intrusion into La Cosa Nostra. Instead, I was immersed in a world of ultimate sadness, yearning for catharsis.  The audience is tortured as a first-person observer of the decline of the once great Michael Corleone. Coppola, via an excellent screenplay, brilliantly portrays how a life of crime, murder, and self-pity take its toll on even the most formidable of souls.  As Michael falls further and further from grace, eventually committing the consummate sin in killing his own brother, we can feel little sorrow for Don Corleone. The Godfather Part II is a brilliant examination of the human dilemma, making the audience face with brutal realization the effects of a seemingly fancy-free world encountered in The Godfather. Perhaps what sets this movie apart into the pantheon of classical lore is its contrast of Michael disintegrating the family with Vito's building its foundation of trust, honor, and respect.  Coppola so perfectly intertwines two staggering stories  that the movie becomes absolutely irresistable. Kudos go to Mario Puzo and Coppola for their exquisite writing, Coppola for his outstanding direction, and especially to Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.  With the strength of two amazingly gifted performers, we allow ourselves to be swept away in an orgastic viewing experience.  I consider this the best piece of American cinema to ever grace the silver screen."

","It's hard to imagine how 1972's ""The Godfather"" could have been bettered.  A massive commercial and critical success, the first chapter of the Corleone saga was a breathtaking piece of film.  When work began on a sequel, few could have thought that it could be a more accomplished film than its predecessor.  It is.<br/><br/>Granted, ""The Godfather: Part II"" cannot be viewed to full effect without viewing the first film.  The complex nature of its storyline requires previous knowledge of characters and events.  But this is something director Francis Ford Coppola took as a given.  In fact most people that went to see this film had probably already seen the first more than once!<br/><br/>Coppola's biggest trump card was the retention of the majority of the cast of ""The Godfather"".  Only Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano declined to return.  Interestingly it is Castellano's Clemenza that is missed more sorely than Brando's Vito Corleone (Clemenza's character is replaced by Frankie Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo).  This film does not document the latter years of Vito's life, as in the first film, but continues the story of son Michael (Al Pacino), whilst also foretelling how Vito Andolini, an orphan from the town of Corelone in Sicily, ended up becoming one of the most powerful men in the United States. <br/><br/>
Pacino returns as the forlorn Michael.  Even more distant than at the conclusion of the original, Pacino's lack of emotion is utterly draining, yet brilliantly portrayed.  Other key characters such as Kaye (Diane Keaton), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Connie (Talia Shire) and Fredo (John Cazale) also return.  Cazale is brilliant as Fredo and his character, which was only a brief mention in the first film, is one of the pivotal elements of this sequel.  Method acting guru Lee Strasberg appears as Hyman Roth, Michael's cunning business partner and former associate of his father. <br/><br/>
The role of a 20-something Vito Corleone went to Robert De Niro.  In a 95% Italian speaking role, De Niro launched his career here.  The similarities between himself and Brando are superbly executed and we are convinced that they are one and the same.<br/><br/>The film opens in early 1900's Sicily.  In the town of Corleone the male population is slowly being decimated by a mafia lord.  Fearing her son's life, Vito Andolini's mother sends her youngest son away to leave the violent shores of Sicily for the opportunity of America.  Alone, stricken with smallpox and malnourished, young Vito takes the name of Corleone after his home village.  With the Statue of Liberty visible from his Ellis Island window, the world awaits him.<br/><br/>The film then jumps forward to the late 1950's.  Now relocated in Nevada, the Corleone family has made inroads into the casino business.  Michael's pursuits of power continue to grow.  Along the way his path is blocked by numerous naysayers, but the power of the Corleone family often ensures these obstacles are removed or altered without much effort.  Doggedly pursuing the goal of absolute power, Michael's single mindedness becomes his undoing.  A business partnership with aging criminal Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) is centred on hotels and casinos funded by US money in Havana.  Before the business deal gets off the ground Michael's intuition works to his advantage as he uncovers a double-cross.  He also finds a traitor inside the family and has to make a decision on how to deal with it.  We share Michael's despair as the slow deterioration of the Corleone empire unfolds.  It is an utterly engrossing yet bitter tragedy.<br/><br/>Watching the young Vito in tandem with Michael's decline is initially unsettling, yet once we get used to seeing De Niro as Vito we settle into 1900's New York easily enough.  Coppola's depiction of Corleone as a man simply striving to make a better world for his family smacks of dewy eyed reverence as little too much, but as an audience we take pride in Vito's code of honour.  Like a 20th century Robin Hood, Vito Corleone is a criminal we can be proud of.  De Niro's performance as Vito is excellent and he is supported by a stellar Bruno Kirby, who plays the young Peter Clemenza.  The early associations that Vito makes stay with him for life  unlike Michael's continuously deteriorating ties with the New York old school capo's. <br/><br/>
One thing that we notice with Michael's story is how much it represents the American dream gone wrong.  At one stage Roth says to Michael We're bigger than US Steel.'  The Mafia, which once operated as a community, now runs like a business.  As in big business, allegiances are easily made and broken and Michael finds that it is no longer about code and honour, but wealth and power.  This is clearly illustrated to the audience by the paralleled stories of Vito and Michael.<br/><br/>The end of ""The Godfather: Part II"" leaves the audience exhausted, but in a subliminal way.  It's a Shakespearian tragedy in the best sense.  It would have been best to end the story there, with an audience that etched out its own idea of where the Corleone family ended up.  But Coppola couldn't resist the temptation from Paramount to round the story off in the good but not great ""The Godfather: Part III"".  However, viewed in tandem with the original and the second sequel, it is this chapter of the saga that stands out.  Cinematic genius is not a term I throw around, but this film encapsulates it.  A timeless classic."
"edwjoolee","Null","0","1","11 March 2002"," Never a dull moment in this brilliant film.
","Godfather 2 is an incredible movie. Francis Ford Coppola has done an expert job of continuing and expanding upon the story of the first film, adding an incredible amount of detail and information that requires repeat viewing. The incorporation of the story chronicling the early life of Vito Corleone who goes from a grocery store errand boy to the local crime boss is fascinating and revealing, and seems to parallel the life of MIchael Corleone as he tries to juggle and strategize in his quest to further expand and legitimize his empire.   <br/><br/>Great nuanced performances from Robert De Niro (as the young Vito Corleone), Al Pacino, Lee strasburg (who expertly portrays the crafty and aging Hyman Roth), John Cazale and Diane Keaton further enliven this inspired film. Subtle and full of feeling, they bring incredible amount of depth to their performances. Check out Robert De Niro and Al Pacino especially, they are amazing to watch. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this classic film, do so by all means."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","1","7 March 2002"," More of the same, slightly better but still a tad boring..
","""The Godfather, Part II"" serves up more of the same, albeit slightly more interesting. It tells this time of the young Vito Corleone and how his son, Michael Corleone, ruthlessly accepts the Corleone mantel and responsibilities.<br/><br/>There's little to say about this, over the first. If you like one, then you'll like the other. To me, both are beautifully shot and crafted, with great performances all round. And both tend to drag a little, be that bit more dull than I desire in a movie.<br/><br/>I've said what I think of the original movie and so I can give this movie just a slightly higher mark (for having that bit more action and drama) an 8.2/10"
"hotnoodletuna","10","0","1","5 March 2002"," best film ever made
","this is the finest film ever made.  The Shakespearian elements of the family tragedy are beautifully portrayed.  The juxtaposition of De Niro's Vito to Pacino's Michael is wonderful, and the scene the young Vito Corleone sitting on the bed at Ellis Island alone is perhaps the most moving single image in film history."
"eibon09","Null","0","1","6 February 2002"," Back to Back Masterpieces
","Two different eras are depicted as comparisons of Vito, and his son Michael, and the generation that defines them.  Past sequences showing Vito as a young man are written with a feeling of nostalgia.  Contemporary moments involving Michael at same age is framed in a declining mode.  Two films in one to show how different father and son were from each other during the same age they are shown as.  One thing in common with both people are their tragic upbringing.<br/><br/>
The Godfather(1972) dealt with the family structure and the difficulties which comes with the territory.  The Godfather Part 2(1974) is a study in corruption and power.  The theme of power in The Godfather Part 2(1974) is explored in a historical perspective by director, Francis Ford Coppola. Power as represented by Michael Corleone is cold blooded, iron clad, and shadowly.  Also, film contrasts Michael and Vito in how their deal with power at a comparative age.<br/><br/>
There are some instances where Part 2 is better than Part 1.  First, the acting of Al Pacino is much improved and extraordinary.  Second, the characters and story expand to give them more depth.  Third,  Part 2 adds another dimension with inclusion of backstory to compliment main plot. Overall, The Godfather Part 2 is a masterful followup to the first film.<br/><br/>
Talia Shire develops her character further in Part 2 with her loose woman portrayal of ""Connie"" Corleone.  Robert Duvall again performs brilliantly in the role of Tom Hagen.  John Cazale gives a performance full of pathos and tragedy.  G.D. Spradlin is convincing two faced and sleezy as Senator Geary. Diane Keaton turns the character of Kay into someone who is unable to coexist with criminal element of Corleone family.<br/><br/>
Outstanding performance from Robert De Niro that was worthy of the Oscar he received for role in movie.  Mean Streets(1973) gave De Niro recognition and The Godfather Part 2(1974) give him a breakthrough role.  Among the five top performances, the legendary actor has contributed to the big screen.  One of many examples in why I think he is the greatest actor who ever lived.  He doesn't just play Vito Corleone, he becomes him.<br/><br/>
Plot focuses on the decline of the Corleone family, especially Michael Corleone.  Michael went from being an idealistic young man who didn't want to have anything to do with family business to becoming a cold and ruthless mob boss.  Al Pacino injects some new character facets which weren't in Part One.  Al Pacino brings a complexity to his role that makes Michael a tragic figure.  The moments involving ""Fredo"" and Michael are touching and tragic.<br/><br/>
Michael's marriage to Kay is more out of convenience and fear of loneliness than love.  Apparent in how they treat each other in the second film.  I believe things might have turned out differently for Michael as a human being if his first wife wasn't killed.  Hearing sequences balances between the comic and the dramatic.  The New York as depicted in Vito's youth feels authentic and nostalgic.<br/><br/>
Murder of Fanucci by young Vito Corleone is played out with heart beating anticipation.  In the book, THE GODFATHER, the murder of Fanucci is played in a more conventional manner with Vito following him to an empty warehouse where he kills him.  In the film, the murder of Fanucci is more stylized, and reliant on building out suspense and tension.  Handled well by both actors involved in scene and Francis Ford Coppola.  Fanucci is memorablely played by Milano Calibre 9(1972) star, Gastone Moschin.<br/><br/>
At one point before production started, Martin Scorsese was considered as a possible director for The Godfather Part 2.  Because of the first film's box office success, Francis Ford Coppola was kept on as director for second film.  James Caan makes a small but vital cameo during flashback scene near the end.  Reconstructs the events that lead to Cuban Revolution in subjective fashion.  A key line in Godfather trilogy is spoken by Michael when he says;""If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is you can kill anyone.""<br/><br/>
Its a key line because it symbolizes how the Corleones do business within their political and organized crimes ties.  There is a lot of truth to this line from Michael because its a representative of what has happened throughout, and will continue to happen in the course of human existence. Corleone family is beset by tragedy that began with murder of Vito's father, and continues on in Michael's generation.  One of the saddest moments in cinema history are ""Fredo""'s final moments in the house and the fishing boat.  Danny Aiello and Roger Corman have small roles with latter playing a Senator."

","Godfather part two is a sequel of equal stature to its predecessor. This installment follows the life of the Corleone family under the reign of Michael Corleone. This film explores the life of Don Corleone journeying from Sicily to America in the past whilst dealing with Michael and his take no prisoners attitude. All in all this film is a wonder with brilliant performance from De Niro and Pacino"

","Godfather part 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It has a flashback sequence that chronicles the young Vito Corleone, magnificently played by DeNiro, coming to America and getting into crime. Then it shows how Michael runs the business and how it turns into something big. The FBI starts a trial in order to bust Corleone as the family builds tension. Pacino is explosive as Michael who's marriage is failing because of the life. He makes a hard choices in order for whats best regardless of who gets hurt.  I really dig this movie. Duvall, Diane Keaton and the whole cast goes a great job. Coppola is a cinematic god. ****"

In the first film, I thought Marlon Brando was marvelous as Vito Corleone.  That part was this time for Robert De Niro.  He did it even better.  This movie must be made by the best crew in the whole world."
"caspian1978","9","0","3","15 April 2001"," A wonderful look at early Italian America
","The Godfather pt. 2 devotes a great deal of its story to the ways Michael (Al Pacino) and Vito (Bob De Niro) ran the family business. Jumping back and forth from the past to the present, Coppola captures early Italian America from the jammed city streets to the busy side walks of the Italian villages in Brooklyn. One of the greatest sequels of a film, the Godfather pt.2 is worthy to the original. Bob De Niro does more than an excellent job of portraying a young Marlon Brando in this film."
