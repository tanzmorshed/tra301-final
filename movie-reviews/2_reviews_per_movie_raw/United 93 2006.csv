"botner","Null","734","933","21 April 2006"," A powerful, tasteful and important film...
","I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.<br/><br/>For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood schlock, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.<br/><br/>What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be ""real people"". You're never thinking to yourself, 'oh that's Nicolas Cage', conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.<br/><br/>And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. <br/><br/>I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me, this film couldn't have been done in a more professional, classy way. This feels genuine; of course they are going to 'profit' off it, but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen."
"saraemiller1","8","504","651","28 April 2006"," Gut and heart wrenching...
","I was one of the people who said I wouldn't go see this movie because I felt they were capitalizing on a national tragedy and the trailer gave me nightmares. But, my curiosity got the best of me when I read several positive quotes by numerous critics outside the US. So, I picked up a ticket for the 2:00 show.<br/><br/>There truly are no words to describe the power of this film. The cinematography is excellent, albeit a little unsteady with the shaky lens thing going on. I found that the film very much followed the reports in the 9/11 Commission's book, as well as numerous others. They stuck to the facts and didn't add in any glorified scenes that weren't warranted. You saw the mass confusion as the various air traffic control centers tried to make sense of what was going on. You saw the events on the plane unfold as we think they did that morning. You saw ordinary Americans, scared and frightened, band together and try and keep that plane from hitting another target.<br/><br/>Do we know exactly what was said between people on the planes? No. But there are survivors who had messages from loved ones on their answering machines and people who talked to them that day. The film is a little violent for my tastes, but no more so than any 'Blockbuster' fictional hit out there right now, and this is reality as we know it. Any discrepancies are not for me or you to decide, as those secrets are buried in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>When it ended, I've never seen a more still theater. You could hear people breathing as they pulled themselves together. This is something that happened to our nation, and while it shouldn't take a movie to make people remember, maybe it does. Maybe we have forgotten or chosen to ignore what happened that day, falling to politics and quick to accuse people who didn't prevent it. Maybe we are against this movie because it makes us uncomfortable, as all meaningful things should. Who knows? Not I.<br/><br/>But, I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful, respectful manner, and many of the families affected on 9/11 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise? See the movie and then make your judgment call. You may find yourself surprised, just as I did."
"Richard_Lawson","8","345","454","28 April 2006"," Understated but powerful
","This movie approaches an incredibly sensitive subject in an entirely appropriate manner: with subtlety and understatement.<br/><br/>The actors look like real people and talk like real people talk. There are no dramatic exclamations. Even the signature ""Let's roll"" line is stated almost in passing without any special significance being brought to it. The movie was utterly convincing in portraying how real people would have responded. There were no Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipe types amongst the passengers; they were ordinary folk in extraordinary situations, responding the best way they could.<br/><br/>Kudos to the filmmakers for not allowing this to become an overwrought melodrama. Instead, we saw a glimpse into the confusion and pain of people in the middle of the events of 9/11. Because it was understated, because it felt real, the impact was much stronger and gut-wrenching."
"Father-Tiresias","Null","390","534","28 April 2006"," Prayers
","When this film was over a silence hung over the theater unlike any I had ever heard. My eyes watered as I left the hall, and I said a quick prayer as I exited; simply in honor of all the people who died on September 11th.<br/><br/>There is a sequence in this film where the passengers are portrayed praying, as are the terrorists. The languages and prayers are spliced together through a series of short scenes that depict the emotional impact that everyone was feeling.<br/><br/>That is what this movie is about. It does not deal with conspiracy theories. In fact, to do so would be more untrue than any other lie that the film-makers have been accused of telling. This movie is about what the people around the country were feeling as the tragedy of that day unfolded. No one was sitting there thinking, 'I wonder if our government was in on this?' All the people on that plane were thinking of only one thing: survival. That is what this movie portrays, and it addresses several themes in doing so, such as god, faith, unity, and the will to survive. These are not 'American' themes. They are human themes. The terrorists in the film are not portrayed in a horrible, demonizing light. In fact, the audience is ushered to feel sympathy for them in certain scenes. This movie was not made as propaganda, or as a means to make money. If one simply views the film, this becomes apparent. If any 9/11 movie is an attempt to make money, I would say it is Stone's 'World Trade Center.' This film was a prayer, not propaganda, and not propagating falsities. It was something that came from the heart, and after viewing the intense performances and believably real reactions, that also becomes apparent."
"nived84","10","297","414","28 April 2006"," The last 15 minutes will leave you speechless
","There are two reasons why people go to the movies. They either go to be amused, entertained or distracted from the pressures of the real world; it's called escapism. The other is to learn, experience, educate, inform and face what our world is all about. Films like Schindler's List, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, All the President's Men, and this week another film joins that list; Paul Greengrass' visceral and heartbreaking United 93. Some say it's too soon for a film about 9/11 to come out, but I disagree. I think this film is a bold and important reminder of why we're still fighting to this very day, and it puts us up close and personal with our very enemy; face to face. I don't think I've had such a profound and sober movie going experience like this since I saw The Passion of the Christ, and when the film was over how did the audience react? Applause.<br/><br/>United 93 is shot entirely with hand-held cameras to perfectly capture the realism of the events that happened that day. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass, who's previous films include 2004's blockbuster hit The Bourne Supremacy and the critically acclaimed 2002 docu-drama Bloody Sunday, and every frame of his vision is unflinching, intense and heart pounding from it's quiet beginning to it's nerve-wracking and stomach turning finale. The film is never exploitive of the events of 9/11 and always remains respectful to the memories of those on board that fateful plane.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the story, and everybody knows how it's going to end, but that never stops the film from being suspenseful. The film is pretty much void of any character development, and the film never, not even for a second feels like a movie, it looks like a documentary. And I'm sure the way Greengrass has captured the shock, confusion, chaos and panic of that morning is how it must have gone down. The cameras cover the action from all perspectives; from the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air traffic stations, and a military command room where soldiers try to figure out if and when they have the authority to shoot down a necessary target in order to protect Washington. One of the amazing things about United 93 is its casting. The casting of the film includes a number of real life United pilots, stewardesses, air traffic controllers and military personnel, many of them actually playing themselves. The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns, which lends great respectability and reality. We are seeing these people for the first time, with no previous knowledge of them as actors and it only works in their favor.<br/><br/>The film opens quietly with several hijackers going through their morning rituals, reading aloud from the Koran; praying to God and kneeling on the floor of their hotel room and then packing their things to head to the Newark airport. And from there we are introduced to several different air traffic controller technicians and we watch as they discover that two planes have been hi-jacked and eventually discover that they've hit the World Trade Center. These scenes are heartbreaking and feel somewhat surreal. But it's not until United flight 93 takes off that the towers are hit and the plane is up in the air when the terrorist's plans are set into motion.<br/><br/>The final fifteen minutes of United 93 will leave you speechless and paralyzed, as a group of passengers plan to attack and over throw the terrorists and try to take back the cockpit. It's intense, violent and overwhelmingly inspiring. The film is a well done memorial, dedicated to those who were killed on September 11th, and I truly believe that the film was done with the utmost respect to those involved and with amazing passion and sensitivity to ""get it right"". Director Paul Greengrass does get it right, and I honestly believe that it would have been impossible for it to have been done any better than it is here. United 93 is absolutely amazing, and to see a better or more important film this year seems very unlikely, and I think this film should be required viewing for all Americans, but when they feel that they are ready for it, because this is as real as it gets. This film is responsible film-making of the highest level and the experience is both sobering and cathartic."
"EUyeshima","10","280","403","28 April 2006"," Devastating, Relentless and Ultimately CatharticEssential Viewing. Period.
","A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized ""United 93"". At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.<br/><br/>The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. The film also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, it is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing."
"spgb284","10","313","475","28 April 2006"," Gutwreching, Powerful and Repsectful
","Never has a movie stunned me as much as ""United 93"". I was literally shaking during the final minutes of the film. Even though I knew the outcome I tried to fight it. I kept yelling under my voice ""come on guys, PUSH PUSH..., KEEP FIGHTING"". But unfortunately none of us can escape the eventual tragedy. I didn't leave the auditorium until the final credits ended. When I walk out of the theater, I felt like I felt on that dreadful day of September 11th, 2001...Numb.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass's film in no way exploits, sensationalizes or points fingers about what happened that day. There's no undertones or overtones. This the most respectful film i've ever seen. ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" come to mind when I think about impact and power. But both Spielberg's film's followed the film-making standards of; three acts, character development etc. Greengrass throws us into the events of 9/11/01 as if it were happening right now. In fact, we never even really get introduced the the people on the flight. All we know is that whatever happened on that plane was shear terror. And from that terror hero's rose and fought back.<br/><br/>I live in Southern California and even though the events of 9/11 happened across the country and didn't affect me directly, I still am shakken by the events. Where I live, most people have forgotten. It's a time in history I will never forget and dread every single day. I can only imagine what the families of the victims live with everyday.<br/><br/>""United 93"" was the most challenging film I've ever watched. It's not a popcorn flick and should not be seen for entertainment. It's a personal choice to see this film, in my opinion. But whatever you do never forget September 11th, 2001; it's victims and Hero's"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","80","119","22 September 2006"," Horrifying to go through it, but I think that this is a very important film for generations to come
","I was nervous to see any movie on September 11th due to the fact that in some ways I felt that it was too soon, seeing how we just had the 5th anniversary. Not to mention, I didn't want to go through that depression again and watch those horrifying events happen again, a girl at work had mentioned how she saw United 93 and World Trade Center, she said it was nothing like what you would expect of an action movie, it's more dedicated to those who lost their lives that tragic day.<br/><br/>United 93 is a truly inspiring tale about the 4th hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. I remember seeing this on the news on September 11th, we heard so many different things, that it was shot down, the passengers gained on the hijackers, and to be honest I'd rather believe that the passengers stuck together and prevented more lives from being perished that day. These people were truly incredible and the thing that I loved about the film was that it was made to show that they were not victims, they chose to not be so, they knew what they were facing and unfortunately died trying.<br/><br/>Another thing that I appreciated is that I think we did forget about those planes that were hijacked and the horror that the passengers must have gone through. We usually only think of the World Trade Centers when we think of September 11th. I could never imagine what thoughts were racing through those passenger's heads. It truly was devastating to just think what the families were going through when they received phone calls from their loved one's and having to say good bye. We can't forget those who were so brave to help others and those who unfortunately who crashed into the World Trade Center and Pentegon, nothing could be strong enough to say about them, my sincere condolences to the families.<br/><br/>I was wrong about these films, they truly are important. Even though it's fresh in most of our memories, let's not forget those who died trying to save others. God bless the souls on Flight United 93, you truly are hero's and will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mlambertint","9","115","176","5 July 2006"," United We Could
","Frozen, speechless, devastated. That's how I was at the end of the film and judging by the silence in the auditorium the whole audience felt the same. A remarkable achievement. Not a single cheap shot. Knowing, as we all know, what happened on that fatal September 11th. The time lapse between the first plane hitting the World Trade center and the second seemed interminable. The faces of the passengers, without even knowing their names, are still vivid in my mind. Extraordinary. Not to mention the terrorist's faces. So real, so human. Tears were running down my face as a chill run down my spine witnessing the terrorists as well as the passengers praying. God, seen through a different optical at different times for exactly the same reasons. The brave decision of the passengers to die trying to protect all of us is something that we in the ground we seem to have forgotten. We could all stand together as well in everybody's name for everybody's good. You see, here I am, inspired and aspiring to inspire."

","In 'United 93' we take a look at what might have happen to United flight 93 on September 11th. Of the aircraft that were hijacked on September 11th, only United flight 93 did not reach its intended target. This is the story about the events leading up to the hijacking and about the people who tried to save United flight 93.<br/><br/>At first I did not want to see this film. I had no desire to see someone's interpretation of what happened. However, I am glad I did see it. This is probably one of the most riveting and intense films I have ever seen. It is a little slow at first. But, as you follow the events as they unfold, you become captivating in this movie.<br/><br/>Several people have pointed fingers; wanting to blame someone for what happened. I think the more people that watch this will understand a little more about human nature. I do not think anything could have prevented these tragedies; we can only hope to prevent history from repeating itself."
"tenseventyone","9","156","286","26 April 2006"," A superb drama and tribute to those that died that day.
","On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were successfully hijacked. Three of them hit their target. UNITED 93 is the story of the fourth plane that was successfully thwarted from achieving its goal.<br/><br/>Its objective, to hit the White House, was thwarted by a group of individuals that were flying home to San Francisco from Newark on that fateful flight. The plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>We know this to be true. But what Writer/Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, Bourne Supremacy) did was take a sensitive and controversial subject and turn it into a drama that is both stunning and powerful. It brings to light the heroic actions taken by the passengers and crew to try and overtake a plane they knew was on a one-way trip to a terrorist act. We get insight of the real-time actions taken by the military, air-traffic and flight control personnel and how they tried in vain to take control of the situation (and ultimately grounding every single plane in flight that day).<br/><br/>However well the movie portrayed the crew and passengers, I found the portrayal of one of the hijackers (the pilot) a bit discomforting. Hopefully, Greengrass had some inside knowledge to make the viewer feel some sympathy for him and that it wasn't done just for the sheer entertainment value.<br/><br/>United 93 is a serious portrayal and memorial to those whose brave actions saved a Capitol but, unfortunately, was unable to save themselves. As the 5th year anniversary of 9/11 nears, take some time to remember these and the rest of those that died on that terrible day."

","United 93 is an unflinching drama that tells the story of the passengers and crew, their families on the ground and the flight controllers who watched in dawning horror as United Airlines Flight 93 became the fourth hijacked plane on the day of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil: September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>United 93 recreates the doomed trip in actual time, from takeoff to hijacking to the realization by those onboard that their plane was part of a coordinated attack unfolding on the ground beneath them. The film attempts to understand the abject fear and courageous decisions of those whoever the course of just 90 minutes transformed from a random assembly of disconnected strangers into bonded allies who confronted an unthinkable situation.<br/><br/>As 2006 marks the passing of five years since the epochal events of 9/11, the time has come for contemporary cinema's leading filmmakers to dramatically investigate the events of that day, its causes and its consequences, and the everyday individuals whose fates were forever altered while simply going about their common workday rituals.<br/><br/>There is no perfect record of the hijacking's exact details and hostage retaliation, the film takes a careful hand and partially improvises the events with an ensemble cast of unknown actors who were given studies of their United 93 counterparts.<br/><br/>United 93 intends to dignify the memory of those on that flight, the men and women whose sacrifice remains one of the most heroic legacies of the incomprehensible tragedies that unfolded on that autumn morning."
"berryj6","8","8","11","23 September 2008"," Hyper-realism and Paul Grenngrasses 'shakey camera' adds up to make one of the most powerful stories in recent years.
","The strange thing about United 93 (the name of the plane that never reached its destination) is that we know the cabin crew and their terrified passengers are tragically going to die. No matter how hard they try on-screen, we know they are doomed. This forces a strange mix of realism and hope upon the audience, and though they will exit depressed, the film has done 9/11 justice. During the entire film as it climaxes, switching between the sweating generals in the crowded, stuffy air traffic control bases and between the horrified yet defiant passengers on the plane. And the cinematography, plot, dialogue and directing all enforces this generally well, making the story of the people killed in 9/11 worthwhile and suitably strong.<br/><br/>The shaky camera in the film is used to full. It's not sickening, buts it is c0nsistent and creates a strong, extremely realistic sense. Even the lighting is right in the film, as the colour tones and natural sense only reinforce the super-realism that drives this tragic tale. The acting is not Oscar-winning, but it is deadly serious and super-consistent. Paul Greengrass puts the icing on this creditable cake with a strong-willed and unrelentless story-telling.<br/><br/>Though it could pack a harder punch, with a look into the evil behind the plane and the after-math"
"VIsForVictory","10","93","190","22 April 2006"," Americans need to face the ruthlessness of their enemies
","Some people have said that this movie is ""too soon"". When this heart-pounding, gut-twisting picture opens April 28, four years, seven months, and 17 days will have elapsed since 9/11. Is that too soon? Islamofascists do not know the words ""too soon."" Just 13 months after 9/11, Al Qaeda franchisees bombed nightclubs in Bali on October 12, 2002, killing 202 people, including seven Americans.<br/><br/>Exactly two and a half years after 9/11, Al Qaeda attacked trains in Madrid, on March 11, 2004, killing 191 commuters.<br/><br/>Nearly three years and 10 months after 9/11, Al Qaeda struck yet again, on July 7, 2005, killing 52 on the London Underground and a local bus.<br/><br/>Almost daily, Al Qaeda in Iraq blasts Iraqis, Americans, and others through ceaseless acts of stunning viciousness.<br/><br/>United 93 arrives just in time. As we bicker over Donald Rumsfeld's job security by day and obsess over American Idol by night, writer-director Paul Greengrass offers a harrowing reminder of what's in play on Earth today.<br/><br/>In a film of devastating emotional power, Greengrass traces that morning's mounting horrors. This is no PC film crafted by moral relativists in Malibu. As soon as Universal Studios' logo fades to black, a man quietly prays in Arabic. He holds a small Koran in his palms while sitting atop a motel bed. ""It's time,"" one hijacker announces, and their murderous journey begins.<br/><br/>United 93 should bury for good the absurd cliché that violent Muslim zealots are ""cowards."" Rather than watch their knees knock together like castanets, the four Al Qaeda agents on the doomed flight are focused and ruthless. When a cockpit screen announces, ""Two aircraft hit World Trade Center,"" the Al Qaeda agents celebrate. ""The brothers have hit the targets,"" says pilot Ziad Jarrah. ""We're in control,"" replies hijacker Saeed Al Ghamdi. ""Thanks be to God."" Behind them, ordinary Americans who had been eating omelets, knitting, and perusing travel guides quickly discern that their plane is a missile, and they mount a plan to retake it.<br/><br/>Though their jet slammed upside down into a field at 580 MPH, United 93's 44 passengers surely spared many more lives than they sacrificed. They also likely saved the U.S. Capitol, whose photo Jarrah affixes like prey to the airliner's steering column.<br/><br/>""That final image haunts me  a physical struggle for the controls of a gasoline-fueled 21st-Century flying machine between a band of suicidal religious fanatics and a group of innocents drawn from amongst us all,"" Greengrass said. ""It's really, in a way, the struggle for our world today."" Greengrass uses little known actors and even some real-life air-traffic controllers and military tacticians who were on duty on 9/11. They make the film feel like a documentary, or perhaps a reality TV show captured on celluloid. The cast appears perfectly authentic as they grapple with a growing sense of doom and an increasingly unfathomable challenge.<br/><br/>One performance stands out among many fine ones. Ben Sliney ran the FAA's Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, from which it coordinated air-traffic controllers' response to the hijackings. It also quickly grounded some 4,500 aircraft across America. Sliney supervised all this on 9/11, his first day on that job. He is portrayed rivetingly on screen by none other than Ben Sliney himself.<br/><br/>This fine film's verisimilitude parallels recent, real-world developments.<br/><br/>""Shall we pull it down?"" Jarrah asks another hijacker as passengers bang on the cockpit door.<br/><br/>""Yes, put it in it, and pull it down,"" the other replies. ""Allah is the greatest."" Those words are on tapes played at the death-penalty trial of Al Qaeda agent Zacarias Moussaoui. His Arctic demeanor mirrors the ice-cold evil that runs through the veins of those who have declared war on America and our allies.<br/><br/>United 93 is coming at the right time."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","16","27","30 July 2008"," A masterpiece
","The final scenes in United 93 have to be some of the most harrowing in cinema. What you witness is a frantic desire to live conflict with an insane desire to die. People become animals  rational thought gives way to instinct and barbarism, resulting in tragedy.<br/><br/>One of the most despairing images in this magnificent film has to be that of the passengers desperately pushing and driving one of their number towards the cockpit. The guy they're manoeuvring is a pilot of single engine planes and represents their one small hope of making it out of this alive. Knowing full well what happened to the passengers of United 93, the desperation is gut wrenching. You know they're not going to make it and that these are the death throes of those on board.<br/><br/>The agony of the final moments is amplified by the way that the pilot briefly manages to get his hands on the controls. Whether this happened in real life, no one knows, but it perfectly illustrates the conflict that occurred and the conflict that is happening now. Both sides desperately want to be in the driving seat but all the time things are spiralling out of control. In the end, everyone loses and nothing is gained.<br/><br/>Something else I like about the final moments is the disturbing catharsis when the passengers overwhelm the hijackers. This is probably the last time in the 'war on terror' where things will be black and white. The hijackers are wrong and deserve the brutal response of their captives. After this, though, everything becomes hazy and muddy. The tragedy gets twisted and it becomes the fuel for political greed.<br/><br/>But in that moment where the first hijacker gets overwhelmed and killed, there's a feeling of joy and exaltation that is primal. You're put in the position of the passengers and you feel the excitement they must have felt  maybe we can get out of this; maybe we can regain control. But it's a mass delusion. There's no turning back now. Things will never be the same.<br/><br/>But what's also great about the film is that there's no flag waving. This film isn't a call to arms. It isn't a rallying cry. Instead it's a grimly realistic depiction of the chaos that ensues when barbarism overwhelms normality. When something this audacious and unexpected occurs, all the controls that keep the world in check go flying out the window.<br/><br/>Some of the loons out there who want to believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories will point out that the response to the tragedy was too patchy and that communication couldn't be that bad. They've obviously never had a job. Sometimes it's hard enough to communicate clearly with someone downstairs in the same office as you, let alone in an office hundreds of miles away. Plus communication between governmental departments and agencies is notoriously poor. Therefore I can well believe that the response would be so impotent.<br/><br/>But the tale that unfolds in air traffic control centres and at NORAD is just as engrossing as the one in the plane. Like the passengers in United 93, they're wrestling with the enormity of the situation. No one can quite believe that this is happening and the sheer scale of the attack is beyond their comprehension. As a consequence people continually try and come to more realistic conclusions.<br/><br/>A clear, fast response also isn't helped by inaccurate information. When a plane hits the first tower, it's said that a small civil aircraft hit it. And then NORAD are told that American Airlines 11 is heading for Washington when it's actually hit the World Trade Centre. Yes technology is better these days, but we still don't live in a world where we have accurate information available at our fingertips the very second it happens. And it's galling to know that even the government has to get its updates from CNN.<br/><br/>A chilling moment that occurs in the film is when air traffic control are trying to communicate with American Airlines 11. The plane is over New York and they're desperately trying to talk to the pilot. But then the plane disappears off the screen. But even though we know it's hit the tower you can still understand the confusion. Even though the flight has disappeared, who can imagine such a thing? <br/><br/>Things only start to become clear when the second plane nears Manhattan. And then it's too late. People watching the smoking tower see the second plane crash into the other building. The attack is almost over before people can understand what's going on.<br/><br/>And the only reason that the fourth plane didn't hit the Capitol Building is because United 93 was delayed. Sure some imbeciles can question why the passengers of that flight didn't take the plane sooner, but they didn't know what was going on. When you don't know what's going on, you're powerless. But once they hear about the other flights, they decide to act. And the one bright spot in that miserable day is that these passengers fought back and prevented further loss of life.<br/><br/>But I really can't overstress how great this film is. There are no attempts to demonise. There are no attempts to play for false emotion. You're just dropped in this hellish situation and expected to deal with it. It just feels real.<br/><br/>And very often it feels painfully real. The build-up constantly had me on edge. The tension is palpable. And then there's the heartbreak of people phoning home and the desperation of the attack on the cockpit. Paul Greengrass has fashioned a masterpiece here. He's made a film that is visceral and heartbreaking and that makes no concessions to the audience. It's one of the greatest films of the last few years."

","Probably the best movie of the year! This movie handles the many different emotions it brings to the surface in a professional and technically proficient way - it is one of the most well-crafted ""docu-dramas"" I have ever seen. We sit in the plane with the heroes of that day, we watch it unfold from the perspectives of the flight controllers and NORAD, we feel the confusion, the torment, and ultimately, the victory in the end. It is a great commentary on the human spirit and a great achievement in cinematography and editing. Paul Greengrass has opened up a dialogue that hopefully will never stop - a positive dialogue about that horrible day."
"teh_mode","9","14","24","11 July 2006"," Intense and brilliant
","There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement, that can describe the feelings you endure along United 93. Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.<br/><br/>Shot in real time, on digital camera, United 93 begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves  particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behaviour, that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel an unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what Titanic was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.<br/><br/>Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-Titanic: there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of United 93 are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. As the film is shot in real time, it certainly tests the patience of this eras' ever demanding audience (my idiot of a brother had the audacity to walk out after 30 minutes), but I urge all of you to stick with it. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Britain, that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, United 93 is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film reviewer all I could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong."
"eichelbergersports","9","37","75","23 April 2006"," Powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work
","When the screening of ""United 93"" came to an end last week, several members of the San Diego Film Critics Society commented that this would be a very difficult film to review.<br/><br/>I concur with those sentiments, but I had no problem giving this a high recommendation. It's not an easy film to watch, but I believe people should see it, if not as a tribute to those who died, then as a remembrance that due vigilance is constantly necessary in these dark times.<br/><br/>Some may disagree and call it ""propaganda,"" but that is patently ridiculous.<br/><br/>Based on the United Airlines Flight 93, the fourth U.S. jet hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001 (and the only liner not to strike its intended target), this movie has the intentional feel of a documentary, and is thus difficult to really criticize.<br/><br/>Much of this reasoning is that the picture tells a straight enough story, with little or no dramatic embellishments (other than to speculate what exactly took place on-board the doomed craft) in real time, from take-off to its ultimate crash, approximately 90 minutes.<br/><br/>What there is, however, is a moving, powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work by director/writer Paul Greengrass (""Bourne Supremacy,"" ""Resurrected,"" ""Bloody Sunday""). Nevertheless, he will no doubt take some heat form some uninitiated film-goers who equate this movie with a piece of propaganda, but that could not be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Greengrass plays it fairly even down the line, and cockpit voice recordings, as well as last phone calls from passengers and crew seem to indicate his vision of the plane's hijacking seem pretty close to factual.<br/><br/>Of course, no one is going to know 100 percent of what happened aboard flight 93, since no one survived its ultimate crash in Shanksville, Penn. at 10:05 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. However, this much is true: Four terrorists, led by Saeed Al Ghamdi (Lewis Alsamari), forcibly commandeered the aircraft and most likely killed or disabled the crew, Capt. Jason Dahl (J.J. Johnson) and First Officer LeRoy Homer (Gary Commock), as well as one or more passengers.<br/><br/>One of the hijackers, Ahmed Al Haznawi (Omar Berdouni) has brandished a fake bomb, which keeps the passengers at bay long enough for Ghamdi to turn the San Francisco-bound craft east towards Washington, DC.<br/><br/>Stunned by the events, but believing them to be completely isolated, the passengers are shocked to discover  via cell and air phone conversations  that planes have already smashed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers and the Pentagon.<br/><br/>They now realize this is not a hostage situation, that the flight is to be used as a missile against an unknown target, and they will probably not escape with their lives.<br/><br/>It's then that the passengers, mainly Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche, ""War of the Worlds"") Joseph DeLuca (Ray Charleston, ""Out For A Kill""), Jeremy Glick (Peter Herman, ""The Treatment"") and Mark Bingham (Cheyenne Jackson, ""Curiosity""), attempt to retake the plane.<br/><br/>And while these scenes are gripping enough, the real fascination (for this scribbler, at least) comes from the segments in which the various civilian and military air traffic controllers, as well as other technicians, come to the cold realization that something horrible and unprecedented is taking place in the nation's skies that autumn morning.<br/><br/>The drama that builds as controllers scramble to identify possible hijacked planes (American Airline Flight 11 and United 175), and their investigation into 93's dilemma, is excruciatingly tense.<br/><br/>""United 93"" also exposes some serious miscommunication between civilian and military authorities, with no one knowing much of anything until it is way too late.<br/><br/>Another interesting touch is that Greengrass chose not to populate the picture with big names, which would have diluted the impact (in fact, several roles are actually played by real ATC personnel, recreating the positions they held in 2001 for this movie).<br/><br/>This is not an easy film to watch, but I could not look away. And while some make scoff at the conclusions made by Greengrass, this is nevertheless a moving and thought-provoking piece of work."

","This films gives us an insight at the lesser known aspect of September 11th, Flight 93's mysterious crash. The story is told excellently, with strong performances from unknown actors. This makes it all more believable, and leaves a bigger impact on us. Can you picture a famous figure such as Brad Pitt standing up against terrorists in such a serious drama? The problem with this type of film is that Americans, for the most, are not ready for this, and thus the film will be the target of much criticism trashing this movie, because it is too 'soon'. Didn't Apocalypse Now come out not a few years after the Vietnam war? The politics behind this movie will kill its reputation, and an excellent movie will be forgotten, much like last year's Jarhead.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent movie, I'm really looking forward to more of these such as the upcoming World Trade Center. 8/10"

How the cold terrorists hijacked the plane and how the Heroic passengers fought back. To me they are true heroes. They probably saved thousand of life that day.

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>A re-enactment of the terrifying events abroad United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11 2001, as several suicide bombers took control of the plane and attempted to crash it into The Pentagon. Due to the courage and determination of a group of passengers, the plane never reached it's target but unfortunately all the passengers on board were killed. Juxtaposed with this story is that of those working in the control tower and their desperate struggle to maintain order and their sanity as the terrifying events unravel.<br/><br/>The five years since the biggest act of terrorism America (and indeed the world) has ever witnessed have flown by. And film-makers (and potential film-makers) have actually shown an admirable deal of restraint in waiting so long before inevitably a film detailing these events was made. It's a controversial project that Paul Greengrass has taken on but from this, you get the impression no-one could have done it better if they'd tried.<br/><br/>United 93 is such a brilliant film because I struggle to think of a film that has succeeded so well in what it was setting out to do before. Because of the subject matter, it could never be described as an 'enjoyable' film, but it re-creates what must have happened on board that flight so meticulously it is genuinely almost as if you were actually on board the flight yourself at the time. There's no Hollywood style sensationalism or sentimentality, those trapped on board and those scurrying around on the ground all behave as humanly and realistically as though they were re-enacting a story on Crimewatch, their disbelief and horror captured magically. Even the terrorists themselves are given a wonderfully human edge, as we see their fear and apprehension, without ever being made to pity them the way we pity the other passengers. Their brilliantly human behaviour makes the tension on board the plane absolutely palpable and, as I said, feeling as though you could just as easily have been on board the plane with them.<br/><br/>It's a lot of little things that roll United 93 along. The opening featuring an overhead of the New York skyline at night as we hear Muslim prayers being sung by the terrorists in their rented hotel rooms gives a creepy and quietly foreboding sense that the big, bustling city where so many people are walking about minding their business and no one suspects a thing is under threat, the use of a digital camera, adding immeasurably to the 'real' feel the film has and the sudden ending which doesn't delve into the aftermath and make the film become sappy in any way. The film-makers set out to achieve a desired result and they got it spot on with this. If it's not still on my top ten list by the end of the year, something really brilliant will have to come along to knock it off. Never an easy or enjoyable film, but a brilliantly real one that genuinely plays as though someone recorded the events on board that plane for real and played them back to a shocked audience (though such a thing wouldn't be empirically possible, of course!) An absolute must-see. *****"
"garyprosser1","9","5","7","4 April 2019"," Blistering cinema
","The events of that sunny Tuesday morning in September 2001 need no introduction. As the cliche goes, everybody remembers where they were on 9/11 and thanks to a million documentaries, YouTube videos and opinion pieces, we all have a detailed knowledge of what happened. Or rather, we all have a detailed OPINION of what happened and how events unfolded. While many accept the official account of the day, still more are moved to question the words of officials.<br/><br/>Conspiracy theorists will tell you that the US Government were behind it, the CIA did it, President Bush sanctioned it; all to sway public opinion into backing military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are literally hundreds of exposés online that point to 'evidence'; where are the remains of the plane that hit The Pentagon? Why didn't the military act sooner in getting planes airborne? What brought the twin towers down when they should have stayed standing? Some of the questions posed by the doubters are valid and worthy of real debate, others can be safely dismissed as groundless nonsense and tin foil hat worthy paranoia.<br/><br/>Where 'United 93' shines so brightly is that it doesn't ask any questions like this. It doesn't ask you to lean either way politically and it doesn't offer any opinions of its own as to the reasons for the atrocities. It focuses on the insurmountable truths of the day: that four planes, containing innocent people, didn't make it to their destination. What the viewer sees is an almost real time account of the doomed Flight 93, it's passengers and crew and those on the ground who attempted to make sense of the unprecedented events unfolding before their very eyes.<br/><br/>We see the very familiar scenes (if you've ever flown with an airline) of boarding, of finding your seat, of placing orders for food; the usual hubbub that is involved in any flight. The crew attend to the passengers while the pilots go through their pre-flight routine while elsewhere, air traffic controllers fulfil the almost superhuman role that they do everyday. It's all so normal and you feel like a fly on the wall, observing both the process of flying that you are so familiar with and all the behind the scenes activity that you are blissfully unaware of. If anyone stands out, it's four men of Arab appearance but they stand out because we already know who they are. That morning, they don't stand out at all because, acting calmly and normally as they are, there is no reason why they should.<br/><br/>And then, it all changes.<br/><br/>From the moment it becomes apparent that flight AA11 may have been hijacked, the film becomes something else entirely. All routine starts to evaporate as confusion creeps in; what happens here? Who is in charge? Who needs to know what's going on? Then, flight UA175 stops responding. What the hell is going on? At Air Traffic Control, organised chaos starts to take over. Many of those onscreen are actual ATC staff (who were there, in real life, on the day) playing themselves and this masterstroke piece of casting is key to how real the scenes feel. At no point do you feel like you're watching actors act. The dialogue is technical, ordinary and devoid of the flourishes of a scriptwriter. The restrained panic is keenly felt and is then intensified when it becomes apparent that all is not right with flights AA77 and UA93. ""What is going on?"", people ask in the same way we all did. Then, flight AA11 strikes the North Tower of The World Trade Centre and the film switches up again.<br/><br/>Okay, so I could dissect the whole film but it's best just to watch it. Director Paul Greengrass has produced a masterpiece of film-making here; I cannot remember the last time I was so tense whilst watching a movie. At times, it was unbearable despite the fact that you and I know what happened. Flight 93 was intended for the White House but it never got there because the passengers and crew fought back.<br/><br/>In this regard, Greengrass is using his imagination to depict what happened on that flight because, of course, nobody knows. We only have the mobile phone calls made by passengers to loved ones in their last moments to inform us that plans were being made to fight the hijackers. We don't have detailed accounts of what the passengers did but I didn't doubt even one thing that the film depicted. Ordinary men and women, sensing that they HAD to fight back to have any chance at all of survival? That's completely believable and the way the film had them go about it rang completely true. They did what you, I and anyone else would do when desperate times call for desperate measures.<br/><br/>For a film to convey such tension and drama when the audience already knows the outcome is a testament to the filmmakers. 9/11 outstripped anything Hollywood could have written but this film is very un-Hollywood. There are no rousing calls to arms, no overblown depictions of fantastical heroism, no cheesy soundbites. The music is used very sparingly but when it is, it is incredibly effective. We don't get to know the back stories of the passengers and crew. Referring again to the fly-on-the-wall feel, it is as if we are a fellow passenger (or ATC member of staff) and all we know of those around us is what we learn in the moment. Like so many who watched this film, I asked myself again and again what I would have done. Would I have got up there and fought? Would I have hidden away? Would I have suddenly felt the need to pray? I don't know. Who really does? You and I have never (and almost certainly will never) be in such a situation but United 93 gets us as close as is humanly possible to being right there.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I exhaled out of sheer mental exhaustion at what I'd just seen. This film is extraordinary and not an easy watch but it's one I feel that you must see. You may well have done (seeing as it was released in 2006), in which case, watch it again. As a piece of cinema and for sheer emotional clout, it's the best film I've watched in a long time.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","This film will tell the story of United 93, the last of the four hijacked aircraft of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By accounts, this will be a very intense and well-told drama.<br/><br/>By a quirk of fate Flight 93 was delayed on the runway at Newark airport for 45 minutes. By the time it was airborne, the other three planes had reached their intended targets. As a result, the forty passengers and crew on board Flight 93 were the first to inhabit our new and terrifying post 9/11 world.<br/><br/>The terrible dilemma those passengers faced is the same we have been struggling with ever since. Do we sit passively and hope this all turns out okay? Or do we fight back and strike at them before they strike at us? And what will be the consequences if we do? That is why the story of Flight 93 continues to command our attention. Although we can only dimly understand what must have happened on that ninety minute flight, we can know from the two dozen phone calls and from the 30 minutes of Cockpit Voice recordings that it dramatizes and symbolizes everything that we face today.<br/><br/>Made with the full support of the families of those on board, FLIGHT 93 will track in real time the dramatic story of what happened inside the aircraft as well as on the ground, as passengers, crew, Civilian Air Traffic Controllers and Military Command Centers struggle to make sense of an unimagined and unimaginable crisis.<br/><br/>The film begins on a normal September morning at Newark airport. Crew members prepare for a routine commuter flight to San Francisco. They make safety checks, assign tasks, fuel the plane. Passengers arrive, check in, make last minute calls to colleagues and families before boarding the plane. As the cabin doors are hermetically sealed they all believe that everything is normal. That they are safe from the dangers of a turbulent world. But sitting in four first class seats right next to them is an Al Qaeda cell.<br/><br/>And so as the hijack unfolds, the film moves between the passengers and crew in the air and civilian and military air traffic controllers on the ground as each tries desperately to avert the flight's progress towards the Capitol Building in the heart of Washington D.C.<br/><br/>""Flight 93"" will take us through the events of 9/11 as they happen in real time - all the confusion, violence, courage and endurance of a day that changed our lives forever."

","I have just seen 'United 93' at the 2006 Auckland International Film Festival and consider this film to be a very important film that truly commemorates with honour the events of September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>Although other respondents have commented on some factual inaccuracies of the film, the film is extremely gripping and gives a good understanding of what may have occurred on board that aircraft. It also gave me an understanding of what it would have been like to have been at the Air Traffic Control tower in New York and seen the events taking place before their eyes. The scene where you are shown an aircraft crashing into the second World Trade Tower gave me an illuminating understanding of what emotions those people would have felt in actually seeing it take place before their eyes. I also gained a perspective on what it would have felt like as an American to have someone attacking their land.<br/><br/>The regular swapping between the various agencies that were trying to deal with this emergency increased the suspense of this film and showed what a difficult situation they were in.<br/><br/>This film is very respectful of what occurred and does not glorify or 'Hollywood-ize' the events in any way. The use of unknown actors increased the sense of reality of the film. You weren't focusing on any one actor - you were focusing on the events. Seeing the characters come to terms with the reality that they were not going to live through this experience was harrowing but also a fine study of human emotions.<br/><br/>I would highly encourage all who can to see this movie. I am very pleased that the families related to the tragedy were supportive of the film. It truly is a very respectful memorial to the events of this fateful day."
"BLBfootballs","9","2","2","15 April 2007"," They came.... but could we?
","This astonishingly powerful movie gives us as close to a documentary view of the real-time unfolding of 9/11 as anyone will likely ever be able to get.<br/><br/>I had initially resisted seeing United 93, remembering the actual day of 9/11 far too well to 'need' the reminder of this movie. But I hesitatingly relented. I was right to give in.<br/><br/>United 93 is not ""enjoyable"". Nor is it ""entertaining"". It is unexpectedly, almost overwhelmingly real and sometimes difficult to watch. The R-rating is deserved for scenes that depict with distressing realism the raw violence and coarse, cold malevolence of the murderers on board. But far from embellishing the unknown or exaggerating the more 'photogenic' recorded details, this account of the last stolen flight of 9/11 succeeds in its brilliantly understated, and fundamentally truthful, handover to the audience of what simply happened, and how it happened between 8am and 10am on 9/11/2001. In a way that those of us who watched from the outside would never have quite understood, United 93 displays the confusion, anger, immobility and infuriating false-positives that resulted when expert air traffic controllers and soldiers were caught flat-footed trying to detect the few actually hijacked airliners in a dizzying electronic waterfall of 4,000 simultaneous flights moving across America. <br/><br/>It also displays shocked professionals who traversed their emotions to tackle some of the toughest moral and tactical calls imaginable, all with the goal of saving innocent life. Perhaps as a contrast, we never see the political leaders who are ostensibly supposed to manage such a crisis, only hearing of them remotely as military officers urgently try to contact the President and then anybody who might have the authority to let them stop the now-hostile planes. <br/><br/>United 93 also avoids taking a smooth and easy way out by trying to ignore or muffle the Islamic religious commitments and motives of the terrorists. On the contrary, the film explores this element of contemporary terrorism unflinchingly. Along with their combination of anxiety, hesitation, and astonishing malice, the hijackers' urgently-intoned Muslim prayers and Arabic entreaties add valuable emotional and human realism, while introducing the audience to the ideological anchoring that gave them the mental strength and clarity of purpose to terminate their own lives for the purpose of destroying others'.<br/><br/>The surprisingly rapid awareness and response of the passengers and crew might seem almost artificially accelerated...until you realize that the passengers on United 93 actually DID respond with the amazing speed and flexibility that the movie depicts. The incredibly textured and human reactions of the diverse group of fliers on board could be the centerpiece of a textbook of sociology--and also forces viewers to consider whether they have the mental agility, freedom of thought and passionate moral commitment to dismiss a comforting framework of naiveté -- ""let's just do what they say..."" -- and respond instead with the same courage and speed generated by this unexpected brotherhood of strangers, as courageous and devoted as any unit of soldiers, who, one begins to feel, were led by destiny to fly and fight together. ""They're coming!"" yells one of the terrorists as the unexpected response begins. And come they did... but would we? United 93 begins as a prosaic Everyflight that transitions, with amazing speed, into a dazzling example of human bravery, shared mission and a burning devotion to the good.<br/><br/>The brilliantly-filmed conclusion of the movie leaves you with an aching, rending sense of loss and justice denied--but also with an awareness that nobody else but those passengers was able to make the critical difference that morning. United 93 may well become the sine qua non of dramatic interpretations of 9/11. It deserves to."

","Most of this atrocious film is devoted to air traffic controllers babbling on endlessly about possible hijackings. This is inter-cut with closeups of flight monitoring instrumentation. It's meant to convey urgency but it induces boredom and nausea. It's amazing that Greengrass was Oscar nominated for this as it is one of the most incompetent directorial efforts in recent memory. His shaky, hand-held camera is extremely distracting, making it difficult to focus on the film. Not only that, but he favors extreme closeups and whiplash-inducing camera movements that serve to make the action confusing. Somebody please take this hack's camera away. The 9/11 victims deserve better."

","After watching this movie once, I never want to watch it again. It is without a doubt the most boring and repetitive movie that I have ever seen in my life. I became so sincerely sick of the movie within the first 30 minutes that I could have gotten out of my seat, made a sandwich, poured myself a drink, refilled my popcorn, and written a 70 page essay about the properties of sand without missing anything.<br/><br/>Not long after getting on the plane, we run into one of the movie's first problems. It never stops repeating itself. The head extremist on the plane is asked by one of his cohorts when they should strike. The leader says soon, and the cohort returns to his seat. Repeat this another two times and the movie finally continues. The pilots are killed and their bodies are dragged about. Some flight attendant (You don't learn her name, and you won't care anyways) sees the bodies and runs to the back of the plane. The passengers then talk about what happened for seven minutes. The passenger's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is, ""Oh no, (insert event) happened.""<br/><br/>While this is occurring, some people who I assume are from the FAA (I didn't notice, as I was on the verge of taking a nap) are talking about other planes that seem to be acting strangely. We get a brief glimpse of the plane hitting the world trade center. I use the term ""plane"" very, very loosely as the effect work is terrible. It looks like something a person who couldn't even turn on a computer could make. The explosion doesn't even look good, and in a film about a national tragedy involving planes exploding, this is inexcusable. The FAA people's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is, ""Where are the terrorists? We found the terrorists! Where are the terrorists?""<br/><br/>And to round out the cast of people you won't enjoy watching, we have the military. They basically get nothing done, and out of the three, these are the people who you will care for the least. They spend the greater half of the movie trying to decipher messages that are obviously cries for help. The army's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is, ""Where is our support?""<br/><br/>You may have noticed that earlier in the review, I stated how repetitive the movie was. This is especially prevalent in the passenger scenes. Whenever an event happens, not a single one of them can shut up about it until it has been repeated 10 times. There is a point in the movie in which one of the terrorists stabs one of the passengers. The other passengers cower in fear, repeat ""HE GOT STABBED!"" 10 times, and the movie continues with its ""plot"". The terrorists ask for the man they just stabbed to be healed by a doctor on the plane. Then, once the doctor is finished, the terrorists immediately stab the man again. Why? No reason. There really isn't one. I tried for 15 minutes to figure out why they stabbed him, and I couldn't find it. The passengers were already cowering in fear, so it wasn't to intimidate the people. The man wasn't starting an uprising, because he was lying in a pool of his own blood. The only possible explanation for it was that the director got bored and decided to put a random violent image in the movie in order to stir people from their slumber. The FAA people try to prevent any further hijackings, but all they wind up doing is adding to the monotony by repeatedly switching between whether or not a plane is hijacked. The Army performs pretty much the exact same function as the FAA, except that they have some minor power.<br/><br/>The final minutes of the movie are when it actually gets somewhat interesting. The FAA and Army are, needless to say at this point, not involved very closely in the final sequence. The passengers finally fight back against the terrorists. They storm to the front of the plane, killing two of the terrorists along the way. When they reach the front of the plane, the plane finally crashes. Of course, before the 5 minutes pre-epilogue, there is another, possibly the most boring of them all, passenger repetition scene. This is actually somewhat sad, seeing as how it could have been fine if they had only done two or three. But they have five or even more (once again, almost asleep) calls made, which is just plain unnecessary considering that almost all of the calls are, ""I love you, tell my family I love them.""<br/><br/>This is a movie that is physically and emotionally painful to watch. It's awful in every respect. Only the last 5 minutes are any good, and then the epilogue of course repeats what we just saw... yet again. I'm told by some of my friends that I'll grow to like it later on in life, but I'm not enough of a masochist to sit through this intensely boring piece of garbage again."

","Having had this movie recommended from various sources describing it as objective and touching, I decided to check it out for myself. Well, all I can say is that this is one of the most flawlessly executed pure propaganda movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The subtle shifts in mood via music, pacing and harsher language makes the manipulation you're subjected to almost impossible to catch on to if you're not used to analyzing films. But it's there. It's actually a good idea to pause the movie during the most intense moments, sit and relax and then press play again. You wont necessarily have noticed the shifts and manipulations before but once you press play they'll hit you like a sledgehammer with that patented Hollywood-finesse (You know it. It's the one ranging somewhere between a rabid dog and a rapist).<br/><br/>However some flaws were left in. While it was an ingenious (well...) move to use unknown actors with the audience as passive onlookers, it did leave one majer problem for me. Well over half the time, the actors looked as if they were concentrating all their skill and knowhow on not looking into the camera (and, therefore, looking every other possible way and ending up looking kinda desperate). It's the same way with cheap made-for-TV recontructions (...) but if that's your thing...<br/><br/>Anyways, the princible question regarding U93 is ""why""? Why even make this movie? We know what happened and ""we""'ve got a pretty good idea why it did. In any case the movie doesn't offer any new twist on it. It seems it's only objective is to fan a flame that the American media have already turned into a roaring inferno with their trademark skills of communication. So why would they make this film? Anyone?<br/><br/>Ya'll know what these little fellas mean?: $$$ If you don't, look it up. They're pretty big in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I should add to anyone that agrees with me: Relax, it's just a movie and it can't harm you.<br/><br/>And to anyone that disagrees: Relax, it's just a review and it can't harm you.

This is attempted to such a degree that it becomes literally slapstick. How many of these passengers and crew narrowly miss missing the flight? Whether it be by being late, being transfered or almost choosing not to go? How many of these passengers and crew have small children, if not brand new babies? It seemed as though all of them did.<br/><br/>I do grant that the terribly unsatisfying drama above connects events, newscasts, phone messages and conversations which are accurately replicated from the information seen on the many documentaries made about the horrific events of that day, but these alone do not suffice for a film.<br/><br/>There is nothing to gain from this film (aside money for it's producers and some national pride). There is no moral to this story, No entertainment value, It's not informative.<br/><br/>This event is an important one to be remembered as it has shaped the world in which we live today.

","The makers of this film know about as much about what happened on that day as I do, which is next to nothing. We really don't even know for certain if anyone on that plane brought it down. If you really think about it, how incompetent would the military have to be to let this plane even approach Washington. Two planes had already crashed in New York. They had plenty of time to intercept this plane.<br/><br/>A jumbo jet travels substantially slower than the speed of sound. Fighter jets can travel at Mach 2. Even if they didn't shoot it down, I would think it would have been shot down before it ever reached Washington. But if you think about it for a second, what better PR stunt for Washington is there than a ""heroic"" crew taking down a plane to save Washington. People, you're watching a PR stunt gone totally out of control. Some people have too much patriotism and too little common sense.<br/><br/>As I see it there are 3 possible reasons the plane went down. Either the hijackers brought it down, the passengers took control and couldn't handle it, or it was shot down. Any way you slice it, I don't think the passengers did anything heroic per se. They tried to save their own lives but were unable to succeed. Brave, maybe. Heroic, no. The passengers took action to save their lives only when they knew it would be hopeless otherwise. Their actions were rational in their attempts at self-preservation. But it would be incredibly naive or incredibly patriotic (same thing) to view their actions as any attempt to ""save Washington."" People who think that need to get a grip.<br/><br/>For the above reasons, this movie is simply a plane hijacking flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It certainly was not a good action flick. If you want to see a movie overflowing with fear and human emotion, this is the one for you. Just don't let that emotion get the better of you. This is a work of fiction, very loosely based on the events of that day."

","I watched this movie years ago before I started to listen to conspiracy theorists and then did my own research.<br/><br/>If you take facts from a Hollywood movie and an administration that have been caught lying about WMD, scapegoat Bin Laden, the anthrax scare, illegal torturing, etc. -- then you're living in a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Notice how Bush, Cheney, and many of his supporting puppets, like Giuliani, can't keep up with their lies. Their lies are clearly on tape numerous times when they are interviewed. They will simply deny the truth just like people who don't question anything about 9/11.<br/><br/>The fact is, it's not only ""conspiracy theorists"" wanting the truth just because (according to anti-truthers) ""they just crave attention"". Many family victims and soldiers fighting in Iraq question 9/11. People that easily accept the government's story cover up are the ones who are going against all the people that died in vain.<br/><br/>What are we fighting for? For our safety? How odd that our country, considered to have the best defense in the world, and a building called the Pentagon, undeniably having one of the top securities/defense itself -- even when the whole nation is on alert and having very similar drills exactly an year before -- is still attacked by a group of ""terrorists"" said to be terrible pilots (could not even fly a single-engine plane, yet somehow pulled off impossible maneuvers at low altitudes with a 757, after supposedly knocking over poles); a ""mastermind in a cave"", are able to pull this off -- all on the same day. Yet, some people laugh more at the idea that it was a work of a CIA? Hmm. Many people know the name ""Bin Laden"" after 2001. It's become a household name. But you'd be surprised how many people, many of whom that just don't question, still don't even know that a third tower, World Trade Center 7, even collapsed; since it was not hit by a plane -- like controlled demolition. And if they don't know that much, they probably don't even know it was the headquarters of the CIA (among others, FBI, DoD...) When you really look at 9/11, there are smoking guns at every corner. Laws of physics being defied. No dead bodies at the scene. There are many questions unanswered, key witnesses mysteriously dying, evidences being hidden -- like many surveillance videos being confiscated showing no Boeing 757 -- yet it's more tragic that there are still people out there that don't question at all, and rather support towards shutting out the truth by supporting the government's story; or just simply lost interest all together because of other media distractions, such as more important things like, ""Would Paris Hilton be okay in Jail?"".<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, saying it's a ""conspiracy"" is considered taboo, so people just shut them out right away. Some people just can't handle the truth. They rather live a lie and ponder over more: ""Who would win the next American Idol?"" I thought wow, United 93 is a powerful movie, especially the last few minutes. No question. It's a well-made fictional movie. But what this is, in end, is nothing but propaganda.<br/><br/>We mostly watch movies for entertainment -- to make us feel happy, laugh, and be sad, etc. -- and if you want entertainment to simply make you feel sad or angry, then this movie can be it. However, just keep in mind this is not a documentary, and if you feel anger after the movie, in reality, the people that we should be ""mad as hell"" at are not the ""terrorists"" depicted in this movie. We have traitors in our country committing mass murder and getting away with it.<br/><br/>Todd Beamer's ""Let's Roll."" (by the way, there is no recording of that account) -- it was the perfect heroic image the government needed, just like the Jessica Lynch rescue (it is a fact that the government/media manipulated that story). The ""Bin Laden"" image for the ""terrorists"" was also the perfect scapegoat. It is also sick that Todd's wife, Lisa Beamer, is capitalizing on her husband's death and catch phrase.<br/><br/>History repeats itself. Nazi's Enabling Act 1933 and Patriot Act 2001. Reichstag fire and 9/11. Scary, isn't? Take truth as the authority, instead of authority as the truth."

","I recently rented this movie, because there was nothing else I felt like watching. Now, i'm fully aware of the controversy of this film. I'm also aware of the gravity of the events on 9/11. I get it. But this film was just not any good. It's a film, it's entertainment - And this is NOT entertaining.<br/><br/>It's a film that attempts to put the watcher on the same level as the people involved, expect the only thing it succeeds in doing is annoying the hell out of anyone watching. I mean, the first 80% of the film can be summed up with two things: The first ""There's a hijacking?"" ""Yes, there's a hijacking."" ""Oh my god, is there a hijacking?"" ""What's this about a hijacking?"" ""What can to be done to end this hijacking?"" ""There's no way there could possibly be a hijacking."" etc. It's frustrating, especially when you get to the part when the action actually takes place, you don't see any of it. The second part goes something like this. ""Yeah, back home I have a family... A Dog, a wife, 2 kids, and a nice luxury sedan"" from every damn person on the flight. No disrespect intended to those who had family involved, but they could tone down this aspect of the story because when they attempt to get it involved, it comes across being bland and corny.<br/><br/>I could continue to speak on how unrealistic is is that a 10 year old with a stanley knife doesn't get his ass kicked immediately be the what, 6 or 7 big guys on the flight? But it would be redundant, because it's what happened. Basically, 9/11 could spawn a great movie. I feel for anyone whose family was lost in the senseless tragedy, but this movie is terribly acted and there is little to no reason not to doze off until about the 90 minute mark."

","This is an unparalleled film in its tremendous emotional engagement of the viewer. From the very beginning to the gut-wrenching final moment, this is a piece of art that one must remind oneself is almost a reenactment of an actual event. Paul Greengrass & crew have outdone themselves with this detailed, powerful film.<br/><br/>The ultra-realistic depiction of mass confusion and breakdowns in communication between ordinary people trying to cope with an unprecedented situation pack so much punch because we, looking back today, of course know the outcome. Yet all we can do is sympathize for these souls who are nearing their untimely end. This is film at its finest; emotionally gripping, perfectly paced and brilliantly edited to portray the mess that September morning was for those trying to prevent further destruction.<br/><br/>The class and respect for this tragedy Paul Greengrass has shown is a no-brainer. You have to be seriously delusional to anticipate a film like this coming out in some Die Hard action-type style of nonsense. It's obvious great care was taken and needed to be, and the result is nothing short of one of the best films I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Clearly Greengrass has written the film closely following the 911 Commission's report, and the key in viewing a film like this is to detach yourself from your belief, whether you be a dedicated conspiracy theory believer or have Bush's pictures hanging on your home walls. This is a story of people dealing with an immense situation, at its heart."

We seem to have a short memory in this country. This film should remind people why we are at war.

","Director Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible. He has made a tasteful, powerful, emotional, great and above all else respectful movie on one of the events that transpired on September 11th 2001.<br/><br/>You all know what this movie is about so there is no need to explain it. The movie begins in the early morning hours of September 11th 2001 in the hotel room of the terrorists who hijack flight United 93. We follow them from there to the airport, to the plane, through the hijacking and right to the end. Everything in this movie is done respectfully and tastefully. There are no cartoonish bad guys, nor are there any Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipes type heroes. The music doesn't swell up or have violins playing in the background when the crew rebels. There are no dramatic slow motion shots either. This is a real movie plain and simple.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is surprisingly great. All the actors in this are unknowns and this helps in a big big way. If we has Nicholas Cage or Brad Pitt in this movie then that would detract from is severely. We'd look at it and know that they are acting. With the unknowns though, they feel like regular people in a terrible situation. They all give great, convincing performances and really pull you in to the movie, yes even the terrorists do. There is not one main character we follow either, rather it is symbolic of the title; they are all United as one and we care for them individually as well as a whole. We don't get to know them deeply but that doesn't deter because, essentially they are us. You get to know them gradually throughout the movie though.<br/><br/>The music is a truly spectacular aspect of this film. As I said earlier, it isn't overly dramatic nor is it all heroic and such. It is absolutely perfect for this movie; the composer couldn't have done a better job. It's especially wonderful near the end though, truly spectacular.<br/><br/>Greengrass uses a lot of hand-held camera work here; most of the movie is in hand-held format. This helps us get sucked in to the situation even more because we feel as though we are spectators and going through what the crew and passengers went through. It's very effective and it never gets annoying. Some complain that hand-held cameras give them motion sickness, but if it's in the hands of the right director it works great (Mann is a good example) and Greengrass shows he is one of the ones who make it work.<br/><br/>The visual effects are good, for the sparse amount there are in the films. Most of them are just the outlook of the plane windows but they never look hokey or out of place. They seem very natural.<br/><br/>The imagery in this movie is wonderful. It doesn't go overboard exploiting everything that happened nor does it wallow in itself by saying ""Hey, I'm a 9/11 movie, watch how I show all the horrible images we've seen over the past 4.5 years!"" It shows what it needs to. It shows a news report of the second plane hitting, it shows the WTC in the background, smoking. It does not however show the buildings collapse nor does it show the plane exploding. It reminds us of why this is such an important event in our history, why we should never forget it. Greengrass knows that we lived through this and doesn't overdue the graphic-ness (for lack of a better word) of this subject, but he also shows enough and tells enough that future generations will be able to watch this movie and grasp what their Parents and Grandparents experienced that fateful September morning in 2001.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie is absolutely perfect. It ends in a perfect way; right when it should end. It ends right where you expect it too as well. It ends with the plane crashing. The crash is a first person outlook from the cockpit and the ground is spiraling toward you and you really get a great sense of how fast they were really going. Right before it hits, the screen goes to black for about 5 or so seconds. Then text appears explaining what happened following the crash and the text changes about three times before saying that this movie is dedicated to all those who lost their lives on September 11th 2001. You really have to see it though; it's quite moving and is quite simply the perfect way to end this movie.<br/><br/>United 93 is a spectacular movie. This is truly a movie for everyone. Everybody should see it, maybe not right now cause I know some people aren't ready to relive 9/11 quite yet and some think it's too early for a movie like this, but everyone should see it one day. These passengers and the crew struck the first blow in the war against terror, they were true patriots and I commend Greengrass because he didn't make this movie for money (even if that was the studio's intention) nor did he exploit the victims of this event. He made it to tell a story, a very important story of what happened 4 and a half years ago. He showed us how heroic these people are and that America is a strong nation. Honestly, I've never been more proud to be an American."

","When people say a certain film is THE film of such and such a year, I am naturally sceptical. So many films seem to gain that title and , whilst being impressive, you will not think too much about it afterwards. I think United 93 will stay with me for a long long time to come. Paul Greengrass' visual style is entirely appropriate here. I cannot think what it is about the hand held grainy camera that director's seem to love nowadays (sometimes I think it's a fad) but Greengrass is the only director, for me, who can pull it off properly. The shots throughout the whole film were wonderfully realised; muted colours, great light and to the point. I have not seen Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' but I am not sure that I'll bother now. Much as I appreciate him as a director, I think his cinematic style is not suited to these sorts of stories (whatever ""these sorts of stories"" are. That was very shallow, wasn't it?). You only have to look at the posters to these films and you can tell the difference. 'World Trade Center' has four very good looking name actors looking off into the middle distance. Very nice; very Hollywood. 'United 93' has a lot of normal looking faces, both young and old, looking at something. These faces seem to have a purpose to look away. I think also that budget is a contributing factor. Oliver Stone had $60,000,000 to play with, whereas Greengrass had $15,000,000. A much lower budget restricts people I think and forces them to look at the little picture as opposed to a broad canvas. The shock of seeing the planes hit the towers was incredible. I have not realised the true magnitude of the whole event before. However, when those images flashed up and the people reacted, I felt a tensing of my stomach and a definite feeling of shock and horror. It is probably because they have milked the whole thing to death through whatever means possible but my senses have become numbed to the American predicament. This film really brought it home to me. These people were ordinary people, on the face of things, seemingly undeserving of such a fate. But then the film does not show us bad people or people to dislike, if you will. The terrorists are clearly believing in what they are doing and really into the whole affair. They will not stop because they believe it is the right thing to do. It was a film that made me think, how can I watch another film ever a again? All these millions of dollars of money being poured into so-called entertainment and it should be spent on other, far more important things. When I become a director, I shall certainly endeavour to make relevant films like this one. And yes! That last image will be burned into your memory forever."

","I was skeptical about seeing this film. I was afraid that it would be overly politicized, and give one side of the political spectrum lots of ammo to run their mouths off with for the next few months. I was also afraid that it would be a pity party for the victims of 9/11, and while they deserve our regards and sympathy, it would not have been appropriate to do this with a overly emotional tear jerker. I was afraid that it would be an outrageous pro-American pride film, and while I have great pride in my country, for all its strengths and weaknesses, again, it would have been inappropriate to make a film like this.<br/><br/>I was very pleased to have watched a film that was none of these things. It is clear that the filmmakers took great care to make this film serious and respectful. Not only respectful to the victims of 9/11, but respectful to the perpetrators, in the sense that they were not caricatured, not over-villainous, and not under-villainous. The terrorists were portrayed as terrorists. They were not monsters, they were not 'normal people caught up with the wrong crowd'. I cannot express how amazing it was to really see a film by someone who wanted to make a film for the sake of reflection and respect, not to please someones agenda.<br/><br/>This film did not cater towards any political agenda either. Some of my friends I was with commented that is seemed to lean to the left a bit, however upon asking them more questions, this interpretation was a compilation of their past memories and opinions. The film does portray certain things that were done wrong by certain authorities, yes, including the president. Again, however, the filmmakers do not make this film about those mistakes, nor does it place blame. In the film the president is simply ""out of contact"". Rather than using this information to put a black mark on the president, it shows how this situation did not help solve the problems that were at hand at the time. I have to say that for a very delicate subject, this film walks the line of objectivity as perfectly as could possibly be done, seeking to show the viewers how to learn from this incident, rather than point fingers.<br/><br/>Now, as a Film Studies major, I have some things to say about this film, regardless of its contextual content.<br/><br/>The editing is excellent. In the opening scene the cuts happen exactly when they should, the rhythm is right on the money. I could literally count beats in my head and feel every cut motivating me to watch the film. Throughout the film, editing is done with precision to build suspense, and I could tell that the editor was in complete control of how quickly and how intensely the action was built up. <br/><br/>The cinematography was good. There were moments where I thought that the shaky, close in, focus shifting, grainy style was a little bit overdone. This style certainly is consistent with themes of the film, and shows an excellent grasp of how to handle this type of film on the part of the DP, but, as I said, I would have taken only a very small portion, less than 5%, of the 'action' shots and replaced them with somewhat clearer shots, just at a few moments were I though that I would benefit more from a calm, clean shot than a kinetic shot. Other than that I though the aesthetic style of the film was excellent.<br/><br/>The Actors and Actresses were all rather unknown to me, I recognized a couple faces but couldn't put any names. I am curious as to whether none of the big names wanted to attach themselves to a potentially controversial film, or if it was the decision of the filmmakers to avoid having the audience attribute personalities to the characters from past films. I loved the acting. Only for a few brief shots were there signs of overacting, and then only the slightest. I appreciated the way that the costuming and mannerisms of the actors were well matched to the roles they played and the kind of characters they were. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was mostly absent. In fact, I am going to venture out and say there was no non-diagetic music until the very end, despite the fact that I know I could have very well missed it. Either way I though it was a wise choice. Music adds external emotional context to the film and by not having any music it allowed for maximum objectivity, which promoted the intellectual approach that was taken to the subject matter, which as I have said is the best thing about this film. The hectic audio mix of the control rooms and plane all aided the cinematic style, creating a unified and consistent feel for the film.<br/><br/>All said, I gave this film a 8/10, because in the end it is simply a good film, that works hard to give an intelligent and objective (as possible) view of some events that are very meaningful to most anyone who would go see it. It demonstrates a technical proficiency on the part of the filmmakers, and shows a genuine desire to make a positive, respectful, and reflective film. I don't rate it higher only because it does not display real excellence in terms of cinematic ingenuity or execution, or explore ideologies using filmic techniques, in the sense that the bona fide film masterpieces do, but its a damn good movie."

Re-enacted in the film is the remarkable bravery of the passengers aboard the Boeing 757, which was headed for San Francisco on September 11, 2001, only to crash in a Pennsylvania field as citizen soldiers stepped forward to thwart the fourth would-be missile attack in the 9/11 terror scheme."
"gregeichelberger","8","5","8","31 July 2012"," Powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work
","Originally published on April 23, 2006.<br/><br/>When the screening of ""United 93"" came to an end last week, several members of the San Diego Film Critics Society commented that this would be a very difficult film to review.<br/><br/>I concur with those sentiments, but I had no problem giving this a high recommendation. It's not an easy film to watch, but I believe people should see it, if not as a tribute to those who died, then as a remembrance that due vigilance is constantly necessary in these dark times.<br/><br/>Some may disagree and call it ""propaganda,"" but that is patently ridiculous.<br/><br/>Based on the United Airlines Flight 93, the fourth U.S. jet hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001 (and the only liner not to strike its intended target), this movie has the intentional feel of a documentary, and is thus difficult to really criticize.<br/><br/>Much of this reasoning is that the picture tells a straight enough story, with little or no dramatic embellishments (other than to speculate what exactly took place on-board the doomed craft) in real time, from take-off to its ultimate crash, approximately 90 minutes.<br/><br/>What there is, however, is a moving, powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work by director/writer Paul Greengrass (""Bourne Supremacy,"" ""Resurrected,"" ""Bloody Sunday""). Nevertheless, he will no doubt take some heat from some uninitiated film-goers who continue to contend that the U.S. government was responsible for the events on 9/11, but that could not be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Greengrass nevertheless plays it fairly even down the line, and cockpit voice recordings, as well as last phone calls from passengers and crew seem to indicate his vision of the plane's hijacking and ultimate destruction seem pretty close to factual.<br/><br/>Of course, no one is going to know 100 percent of what happened aboard flight 93, since no one survived its crash in Shanksville, Penn. at 10:05 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. <br/><br/>However, this much is true: Four terrorists, led by Saeed Al Ghamdi (Lewis Alsamari), forcibly commandeered the aircraft and most likely killed or disabled the crew, Capt. Jason Dahl (J.J. Johnson) and First Officer LeRoy Homer (Gary Commock), as well as one or more stewardesses and passengers.<br/><br/>One of the hijackers, Ahmed Al Haznawi (Omar Berdouni) has brandished a fake bomb, which keeps the passengers at bay long enough for Ghamdi to turn the San Francisco-bound craft east towards Washington, DC.<br/><br/>Stunned by the events, but believing them to be completely isolated, the passengers are shocked to discover – via cell and air phone conversations – that planes have already smashed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers and the Pentagon.<br/><br/>They now realize this is not a hostage situation, that the flight is to be used as a missile against an unknown target, and they will probably not escape with their lives.<br/><br/>It's then that the passengers, mainly Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche, ""War of the Worlds"") Joseph DeLuca (Ray Charleston, ""Out For A Kill""), Jeremy Glick (Peter Herman, ""The Treatment"") and Mark Bingham (Cheyenne Jackson, ""Curiosity""), attempt to retake the plane.<br/><br/>And while these scenes are gripping enough, the real fascination (for this scribbler, at least) comes from the segments in which the various civilian and military air traffic controllers, as well as other officials and technicians, come to the cold realization that something horrible and unprecedented is taking place in the nation's skies that autumn morning.<br/><br/>The drama that builds as controllers scramble to identify possible hijacked planes (American Airline flights 11 and 77 and United 175), and their investigation into 93's dilemma, is excruciatingly tense.<br/><br/>""United 93"" also exposes some serious miscommunication between civilian and military authorities, with no one knowing much of anything until it is way too late.<br/><br/>Another interesting touch is that Greengrass chose not to populate the picture with big names, which would have diluted the impact (in fact, several roles are actually played by real ATC personnel, including former FAA National Operation Manager Ben Sliney, recreating the positions they held in 2001 for this movie).<br/><br/>This is not an easy film to watch, but I could not look away. And while some make scoff at the conclusions made by Greengrass, this is nevertheless a moving and thought-provoking piece of work."
"HelloTexas11","9","5","8","4 June 2008"," sad, uplifting, and necessary
","'United 93' depicts the events of 9/11 from three perspectives: the passengers, the air traffic controllers, and the terrorists themselves. It is a muted film, low-key even while being almost unbearably tense at times. What it puts across most effectively is the confusion of the day, something I think most people tend to forget in retrospect. We now know of course what happened, when it happened, who did it, but on that awful day, facts were few and speculation was rampant. Everyone has a 9/11 story to tell, just as people of earlier generations could tell you where they were when JFK was shot, or when they heard about the Pearl Harbor attack. I do remember the confusion, being at work and listening to radio news reports... at one point, it was reported that a dozen planes were still in the air and it was strongly suspected that they had all been hijacked as well. This is the tack that 'United 93' takes, how slowly it seems before anyone in authority grasps what has happened and what continued to happen. There's no real sense of finger-pointing; everyone seems to have had a mental block against imagining that what took place was even possible. As one of the air traffic supervisors points out early on, it had been years since a single plane had been hijacked so even that was almost unthinkable, much less four planes being taken over at once to be used as weapons. It was quite clearly unfathomable to the politicians, the military, civilian authorities, and the general public. The passengers of 'United 93' are nameless faces, an assortment of 'types' it seems and their relative anonymity is intended by the filmmakers. They are people we see whenever we go to the airport or get on a plane, people we will only be aware of in passing and then never see again. And they are us. In keeping with the real-life, documentary feel of the film, the climactic scene doesn't feel like a climax, it feels like a group of people deciding on the spur of the moment to do something, anything rather than sit there helpless. They know from their cellphone conversations about the other planes hitting the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. They have reasoned that the hijackers are extremely unlikely to be carrying explosives or even real weapons. They know they outnumber the terrorists. One male passenger says he can probably fly the plane. So the decision is made to rush the cockpit, overpower their captors, and take control of the plane. It is a decision borne of necessity, and of elimination... it is the best option available to them. So there is a rush forward from the back of the cabin, a struggle with the two terrorists outside the cockpit which results in one being killed and the other knocked unconscious. The hijacker piloting the plane hears the passengers trying to break the door in and begins diving and swerving, trying to knock them off-balance. The final shots show the passengers breaking into the cockpit, as we see through the cockpit windows the ground rushing up. Then the screen goes black. At that point, in the theater where I was watching 'United 93,' you could have heard a pin drop."

","It must have been challenging for Paul Greengrass to direct a film whose events are embedded in the collective memory but whose details, certainly for the doomed flight 93 on September 11, 2001, must be conjecture and politically supercharged when it comes to assigning the ""hero"" label. That United 93, on its way from Newark to San Francisco, went down near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on its diversion to a target in D.C. we know; what happened during the flight is unknown except for cell phone and in- flight courtesy phones.<br/><br/>On flight 93, it appears several men tried to overpower the hijackers; they failed because the plane smashed into Pennsylvania. The ""Let's roll"" exhortation is understated in this version apparently to allow the story to tell itself entirely, not just as the mantra of a superhero. In fact, mitigating the fervid roll call of heroism among the passengers is the underlying truth that probably most of the heroic adrenaline came from the primal urge to survive rather than the altruism of saving lives on the ground.<br/><br/>But aside from the inherent problem of accurately depicting the unknowable aboard the flight, it is certain that the air controllers were heroic when they tirelessly unraveled the mystery of errant planes (four were hijacked; three hit their targets) and doggedly fought ill-prepared FAA officials and military officers. That only four jet fighters could be scrambled in time to do any kind of preventive attacks on the air ""bombs"" and that Pentagon officials didn't even tell pilots they were cleared by the president to bring down the commercial liners are facts depressing in themselves. That the passengers of flight 93 thwarted the hijackers' plan can be affirmed with joyful kudos to all aboard.<br/><br/>Perversely, 9/11 attacks gave us the wakeup call that will last for centuries. Our lack of preparedness will never again be that high.<br/><br/>Who will go to see Flight 93? Although it is a first-rate accounting of a consummate horror, I am not sure millions of people are yet ready to face the truth. I did, and I'm better for it."

","There is a lot of media commentary about this film. Much of the discussion has been over whether or not is has been too soon for a film about 9/11 to be released. After watching United 93, I feel that those doubts are irrelevant.<br/><br/>Greengrass' directorial style, the same that he displayed in the Bourne films, is to let the characters and the action tell the story, without fanfare or fluff. This style works very well in this instance, where the film could easily delve into political or patriotic territory.

Like Schindlers list, you put yourself in these peoples situation and ponder how the heck would I react to being in those peoples position. No one knows for sure of course, but gives you the feeling of what it probably was like. From seeing the terrorist blend into the normal situations at an airport to seeing people from different ways of life, taking what they thought was just another flight not realizing that there fate was doomed the second they shut the planes doors. Filmed as if you were on the plane. The acting was great all the way around. From the scenes at the different controls towers, to the people on the plane. There's the very few rogue morons out there panning this movie. What can you say, there's bound to be 1 moron for every 10 normal people in the world. Anyone who isn't moved by this movie either didn't see it, or probably could care a less about someone else's life or supports what happen.

"javaman-7","10","8","15","27 April 2008"," A significant work of cinematic art about a crucial moment in U.S. history
","Java Man Reviews ""United 93"" (rated R). Written and directed by Paul Greengrass. Starring J.J. Johnson, Ben Sliney, Gregg Henry, David Alan Basche, Christian Clemenson, Becky London, Trish Gates, Cheyenne Jackson & Chip Zien. Running Time: 91 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>This film follows the brief and fateful journey of United flight number 93 as it takes off from Newark, flies toward San Francisco, suddenly reverses direction while over Cleveland, aims itself at Washington, D.C. and finally crashes in a Pennsylvania field. Exactly what happened during these 91 minutes can never be fully known, but much has been reconstructed from flight recorders, cell phone conversations and interviews of key officials and family members. British writer-director Greengrass incorporates these facts carefully but relies on his own artistic integrity to fill in the missing pieces and provide us with a version of the ""emotional truth."" What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 transformed themselves from a group of strangers to a determined force that prevented the terrorists from hitting their intended target. According to Greengrass, ""they were the first people to inhabit the post-9/11 world."" The film also reenacts simultaneous activities taking place inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air control centers, and a military command room. Many of those who were on duty that day portray themselves, including FAA honcho Ben Sliney who ordered the shutdown of all U.S. air traffic.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>Let's get one thing out of the way...this is not a ""Hollywood"" movie. There is no exploitation or emotional manipulation of any kind. Every detail of the story is told in the present tense; the narrative only knows what we would know if we were on the plane that day or in one of the flight control centers trying to piece together what was happening. There is no political posturing, no mention of Osama bin Laden, no patriotic speeches and no larger-than-life heroes--just an exhilarating account of ordinary men and women who are suddenly propelled into history and legend. <br/><br/>Though an effective ""you are there"" account of what may have actually happened, the film is not a docudrama but an accomplished work of cinematic art. This is certainly the furthest thing from his mind, but Greengrass should be a front runner for a best director nod when the awards season rolls around. The casting is flawless; we have never seen these actors before, so we easily accept them as fellow travelers aboard the fated flight. Also, the flight center and military personnel who portray themselves are vital to the film's authentic feel. Fluid, hand-held camera-work and fast-paced, precise editing also contribute to a feeling of immediacy. <br/><br/>This may be difficult for some to watch, but it does portray a crucial moment in U.S. history, a moment we can share as we experience this film --and relive a day we will never forget. What better way to pay tribute to the heroes of United Flight 93 than to create a significant work of cinematic art in their honor?"
"allan-117","10","8","15","20 March 2007"," a harrowing cinematic experience
","I only recently saw this film on DVD as my partner refused to see it as the whole September 11 event had a big impact on him. I've never been overly sentimental about what happened. I didn't see it live on TV like many I know (including my partner), and as I am on the other side of the world I felt far enough removed for it to be little more than merely a shocking and surreal event. So I came to watch this film by myself, in a comfortable armchair, the day before I was to fly to Melbourne, and it left me devastated. As many have noted, the final 10 minutes are unbelievably tense. Yes you know the outcome, but the matter-of-fact, documentary-like way in which the events are presented allowed me access to this tragedy in a way I had previously been unable to manage. As the list of mistakes and oversights on the part of the Aviation authorities, airlines and military grows, so too does the tension, as the film marches towards it's inevitable conclusion. The helplessness of all involved and the seemingly naiive disbelief that something like this could possibly happen makes United 93 extremely unnerving. On display is some of the most remarkable sound design and editing I have ever seen. This is one of the most brilliantly constructed films I have ever seen. Greengrass should have received an Oscar for this film. And United 93 should have at least been nominated for Best Picture, if not taken out the category. I have never been emotionally affected by a film this way. And it achieves this effect without any exploitation or manipulation of events. Truly, this is cinema or the highest order and an important film to experience."

","When you think of 9/11, you immediately think of the burning twin towers. The WTC has become a sort of an almost symbolic icon for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Flight 93 and flight 77 (the plane that hit the Pentagon) are always sort of pushed to the background. ""United 93"" finally tells us the story of what happened on flight 93, the flight we perhaps know the least about and also probably were still are the most questions about. It certainly does justice to all the people who lost their lives that day and shows us an important story which we should never forget.<br/><br/>It's very tempting to turn this movie into a sort of heroic and patriotic movie or a typical over-dramatized disaster movie production. Luckily this movie choices a realistic approach. It's an almost documentary like observation of what happened in the sky and on the ground in the control centers. It makes the movie look very real and therefor we can also feel the emotions, fear and confusing, almost as if we were present there that day. The shaky cam, the almost entirely non-experienced cast, it all contributes to the realistic aspects and overall feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't only focuses on what happened on flight 93 but also on the other event of 9/11, in between. Because of this you really get the feeling your back on that faithful day again and makes your re-life the day and remember your first initial emotions.<br/><br/>Finally the persons of flight 93 now have a face and personality for the world. Not only the passengers and crew but also the hijackers as well. It makes the events of flight 93 so much more emotional, sensible and powerful. We see the people as ordinary people which we could easily identify ourselves with.<br/><br/>But not only the persons are now a lot more clear and known to me but also the rest of the events set around flight 93, such as what happened on the ground in the control centers. It absolutely surprised and stunned me that absolutely no one on the ground was prepared for terrorist attacks or even an hijack. There were no procedures, the communication was poor and basically no one knew how to handle correctly, both civilian personal as the military. It makes you wonder what would had happened if the terrorist attacks were executed on an even larger scale, or what would had happened if America was under a surprise attack by a different nation. Judging by this movie, I don't think they could had prevented anything from happening if it really occurred. I for a fact know that here in the Netherlands it's standard procedure to immediately send out one or two F-16's to intercept a plane if it doesn't make radio contact and this was already the case prior to 9/11. Why didn't the U.S. had standard plans and procedures for this? OK of course the Netherlands is much smaller and doesn't have such a busy and full airspace as the U.S. so perhaps its not entirely fair and logical to compare it but what do I know. My point is that I was amazed that no one in the U.S. had any standard procedures ready for events like this and how completely unprepared they were for any attack on their own soil.<br/><br/>Of course we will never fully know what happened on flight 93, so we will also never know how accurate this movie actually is. The movie of course takes lots of liberties and had to improvise a lot but it did this in the most realistic way possible. Paul Greengrass did a great job making this movie and he obviously did it for pure and non-commercial purposes, very much like his previous movie ""Bloody Sunday"" about the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops.<br/><br/>Not a much talked about element of the movie (and understandably so) is the musical score by John Powell. I thought that it suited the movie and its feeling very well and it was a very subtle, beautiful score. An Oscar-nod perhaps next year for Mr. Powell?<br/><br/>An important, powerful movie about an important event in recent history, which we prior to this movie knew yet so little about.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The score doesn't interrupt the story, and the story... well, it's realistic, believable and really makes you feel like you're watching in real-time as the morning's events unfold.<br/><br/>For those faint at heart, there are but a few ""rough watch spots,"" and all I can say is there's no choice but to watch them.<br/><br/>I saw this in a theater that showed no previews, and posted a silent screen simply requesting that all cell phones be turned off.<br/><br/>There are things to learn, and though some things seem to be placed for political reasons, I doubt they were. I don't think we'll see a ""truer"" film on the big screen about 9/11.<br/><br/>I found United 93 to be an educational experience, which also reminded me how important it is to live life each day, and to simply be... an American.

","United 93 is a movie of our time. Future generations will probably not relate to it the way we do. As you all know, of the 4 hijacked planes on 9/11, one of them never made it to target because the passengers attempted to retake the plane. That plane was United 93. <br/><br/>I didn't really know what to expect except the usual skepticism around such a movie- that it is American propaganda, or that it is made too soon. Or maybe it leans one way or other that people don't agree about. <br/><br/>However, I thought this is a good movie. Thematically, movies of this sort are very simple, they just have go and make it happen. Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, Bloody Sunday) did basically that. The fallibility of bureaucracy and the irony of religion was all portrayed well. <br/><br/>Do we want to relive 9/11 in the form of a movie? I wasn't sure I did, but I think awareness of it is important enough for me to watch the film. <br/><br/>In contrast with other movies of its genre, namely Snakes on a Plane or Airforce One, I found this movie a lot easier to relate to. I can't seem to take those other movies seriously while this one took that on as a theme and reflection of real life- that bureaucracy never took the situation seriously. <br/><br/>A spoiler here: the most memorable scene was the juxtaposition of prayers- as the passengers prepared to retake the plane, some of them chanted ""Our Father in Heaven"" alongside the terrorists' prayers in Arabic.

The scene where they stood and violently made their hijaking known shook me to the core. I could barely watch it.<br/><br/>This is not really a spoiler since we all know based on the phone calls that they did ralley together and try and fight back. It was heartbreaking and inspiring seeing their courage. They seemed to know this was their only shot and they went down with gusto.

","I've tried to make it a point every Sept 11 to watch this film. I've missed doing this in 2017 & 2018, but I made it a point to watch this in 2019 with my wife. I remember where I was 9/11/2001, and this film does an amazing job capturing those emotions I felt on that day when I was 13 years old. My wife never saw this movie before, and she left crying, but did say it was a very beautiful tribute and extremely well written, and I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>One thing she pointed out that I never paid attention to was that in the beginning there is no music (she is a musician, go figure lol). In the beginning you start off the movie like a regular day. Nothing out of the ordinary and it's just a normal day. The movie progresses in real time and as it moves along, the confusion, tension, and reality of what is going on slowly builds. Even though we know what will happen, we still can feel the confusion the country felt that day, and the frustration of knowing nothing can be done in the moment, even though everything was tried within their power.<br/><br/>The acting is superb! The terror in the passengers was just spot on. The hijackers were portrayed well. You could sense the utter hatred in the eyes of most of them. I know this is controversial, but I loved the portrayal of an almost sympathetic view of one of the hijackers (pilot). But during the movie, that view is pretty much shattered. No one person stole the show, the passengers that played the brave heroes of United 93 were amazing, every single one of them.<br/><br/>This movie is uncomfortable due to it's nature, but it is an amazing tribute to the brave souls that, even though they were mostly trying to save themselves, in turn potentially saved hundreds or perhaps thousands of lives. If you haven't seen this, please give it a watch and at least judge for yourself. This is an event that should never be forgotten and I hope we never forget the heroes on that day.<br/><br/>Also, I hope that someday we will remember how we were united on September 12. There were no Democrats and Republicans, Black or White, Gay or Straight, Atheist or Christian. We were American and united in peace. I pray we get to this point again as a country instead of giving the Terrorists victory in dividing our country from within."
"paul2001sw-1","9","4","6","12 September 2010"," Horrifically fresh
","Director Paul Greengrass has made the unlikely transition from making worthy Birth docu-dramas to frenetic Hollywood blockbusters; lying somewhere in between is this film about the terrorist attack on America in 2001, based on a combination of known fact and plausible interpolation. Potentially, a story of hijacked aircraft crashing faces some of the problems that affected attempts to make a movie about another iconic, era-defining human tragedy, the sinking of the Titantic 90 years earlier: for sure, it was a huge event in world history, but the basic narrative is apparently quite dull: innocent people board a transport of some description, something terrible happens and a lot of death follows. This led to James Cameron, in his film about the epic ship, creating a preposterous and melodramatic back story for his travellers, one that attempted to be large enough to actually contain the sinking of the boat within it. Greengrass thankfully does nothing of the sort here, and there are actually several good reasons why his doesn't need to. Firstly, this drama occurred during the era of modern communications; these have given us the detail that can only be speculated about in the case of the Titanic, and moreover, how this information came to be communicated is a story in itself, whose conclusion is that even the might of the United States military is curiously impotent in the face of a wholly unexpected but immediate threat. Next, there's a natural story that isn't just one of accidental death, in the efforts of passengers on United flight 93 to resist their hijackers (hence the title of this film, although much of this movie is actually set in the air traffic and military command centres, as Greengrass sets his central tale in just the right amount of context). There's also the immediacy of the events, which gives them a horrific charge in a way a story of people who would be dead by now in any case cannot; not only do we still remember the day, it took place in what is still essentially our world. Only when the passengers gather up scissors to prepare a counter attack does it briefly feel like a piece of history. Personally, I find Greengrass's 'Bourne' films somewhat overcooked; but here he gets everything just right. The sad thing is that none of the people he pays tribute here survived to be acknowledged for their bravery, which although it did not save themselves, certainly saved others."
"anthonyjlangford","8","4","6","19 April 2009"," This is no ordinary analysis
","This is the true story of the forty passengers and crew and four terrorists aboard Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. Before you dismiss it, this is no ordinary analysis. There are no stars in this film. You'd be hard pressed to remember any of the characters names; they are all ordinary people caught up in the most horrifying of circumstances, young and old, with the most diverse backgrounds as you'd expect from a group of strangers caught up together. The difference between this film and something you may expect from Hollywood is two fold; the families of the victims were in support of this predominantly British project and the reason for their support is due to Director Paul Greengrass, (Bloody Sunday, Bourne Supremacy). <br/><br/>Like those two other films, Greengrass uses a documentary type feel and he uses it brilliantly here. Hand-held cameras are employed almost exclusively, both on the plane and in air traffic control rooms where a lot of the 'story' takes places. It's as though news crews were invited in to observe the chaos. It is as much about the miscommunication between the AFF, the military and the US Administration than it is about a plane hijacking. Certainly this is something which still angers the families. One wonders if any real change has occurred since then.<br/><br/>Greengrass has gathered as much factual info as he could for his screenplay and utilizes actors who closely resemble the real victims. There's also a very emotional documentary on the DVD as actors meet the families for the first time. While is sounds exploitative, it isn't; the families want this documented, the sooner the better. <br/><br/>The film, however, is free from that emotional stamp that filmmakers usually employ to garner reactions, (read unnecessary schmaltz), and yet it is impossible not to be caught up in the tension as time runs out and we hope against reality for a different conclusion. Fortunately there are other good directors like Greengrass now working in Hollywood, (Alfonso Cuarón, Todd Field) and the sooner we can prevent the Michael Bay's from ever working again, the better. One can always dream.<br/><br/>Until then, we have United 93 as a testament that there are still significant films being made on the fringes of the mainstream. It's up to us as audiences to support them when they come along."
"mindcat","9","4","6","6 April 2008"," Powerful Drama
","Perhaps the best thing about this flick is it was difficult to find actors. The director honed the flick subjects to the point of total credibility.<br/><br/>That said, we can recall the emotions of that day and its confusion. Although this was a creation of what might have happened, I found it well done.<br/><br/>I couldn't help, wishing the flick could have the terrorists ousted and the innocent saved.<br/><br/>I could not help wondering if this flight may have been saved with an earlier alliance of the passengers and the quick ousting of the terrorist from the flight seat. <br/><br/>I sometimes think a third undisclosed emergency pilot should be on every flight. For example, what would have happened IF they ousted the terrorist and flip the plane's guidance computers back on before it was too late.<br/><br/>I'll never know and neither will anyone, and of course such speculations are entirely moot.<br/><br/>An exciting drama that should be seen."
"raymond-15","8","4","6","14 October 2006"," An imaginative portrayal of a terrifying ordeal
","Four planes taken over by terrorists on that fateful day we call 9/11 struck terror in the hearts of the Amercan people. This film is an attempt to portray what happened on Flight 93. This was the fourth plane which happened to miss its target and made heroes of its passengers.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was good. I didn't know any of the actors. They seemed like ordinary people caught up in a terrifying experience. What took place on that flight we will never know in absolute detail. We do know however that mobile phones were used by passengers to say a last farewell to wives and loved ones before the imminent crash landing.<br/><br/>I found those final conversations very moving. What do you say when you know that death seems inevitable? That maybe you only have a few minutes left? The scripting of those conversations were probably the most accurate part of the story because families will never forget those final farewells.<br/><br/>I think the scriptwriters did an excellent job in researching the events and portraying what they believed was the manner in which the drama unfolded. It seems entirely acceptable to me. Indeed as I watched the action I felt I was watching an actual record of the real event. When the terrorists lacking in experience took over the control of the aircraft the plane plunged and rolled tossing the occupants out of their seats. These scenes were well done. Considering that most of the camera work was carried out in the one set (the plane) there was never a moment of boredom. The suspense was hardly bearable.<br/><br/>I liked too the subdued musical sound effects, the percussion instruments giving the impression of impending danger. This really did heighten the drama.<br/><br/>Overall a very good production, one I will remember for a very long time"

The movie itself (I don't want to go into details about the film because we all remember that day) was... there are no words to describe this film, just plain ""it was great"" doesn't do it justice. Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy and Bloody Sunday) did just an amazing job with every detail of this movie. Any of you that have seen The Bourne Supremacy know about how Greengrass uses hand-held cameras. Giving you the feel that your right there watching what it taken place at the time. It is no different in United 93. My girlfriend commented that to her it felt like someone had a regular camera on board 93 and that is what we were watching that's how real it felt being in that theater. Right now I still cannot find the words to describe United 93. I guess to give anyone reading this somewhat of an idea... at the end of the film right before the credits started everyone was either just completely silent or crying, when we all started to get up out of our seats no one was talking, no one talked until they left the theater. Yes it is a very powerful and moving film, I'm still in awe. Hollywood got this one right."

I could not believe what was happening. But we don't remember what we felt. We have all forgotten the punch to the gut. This film brought back every emotion I had that day. They where not all good emotions. They where emotions of pain, hate, fear and love. This is why this film is important. When you see this film you will be transported back to that day and you will relive it. How is that a bad thing? Is the studio making money? Sure it is. Thats why they make movies people! But what is important is how it is handled. This film was made with the utmost care. In fact most of the actors in the film are playing themselves. The film plays in real time. There are no stars no main characters. No one is introduced there are no back stories to characters they are just there. You are there watching it all unfold. You experience the confusion of the air traffic controllers, the military and the passengers, While they try to handle on the situation never knowing what will happens next, But we do.

","In my opinion, this film is terribly boring, the most part of it the scenes are about the air controllers and their own language, which nobody understands, and the rest of the film is about how the supposed men in the airplane did make it crash in the ground instead of what terrorists wanted. <br/><br/>We already knew this story, history in fact, the film didn't give me a new point of view to me.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the only mission of women in the film is to cry and to be calmed by a strong and courageous man (of course, they are the heroes of this flight).<br/><br/>I don't recommend it at all, and so less if you are not a patriotic American."

","I feel the movie should have focused more time on the missing wreckage in that field in Shanksville. Since this was a documentary style movie, a ""real-time"" account of what happened aboard F93, then I think it should have showed how the plane crashed. Surely, the flight data recorder could specify exactly at what altitude the plane ""flipped"" upside down and started its descent, nose first. Show the non-existence of wreckage, show the footage aired worldwide within an hour of the crash, showing nothing, no remnants of thousands of gallons of jet fuel. Show the crash scene up close. Show all the fire trucks arriving, with no fire to put out. This movie only suits to solidify the lie that a plane crashed where the gov't said it did, making it some kind of blasphemy to questions these people's apparent deaths."

","Finally, a movie which doesn't load itself up with predictable melodramas and attempt to force an emotional reaction out of its audience. United 93 simply told the story as accurately as possible and let the viewers reach their own conclusions. Greengrass (writer/director) realizes that when making a movie about 9/11, it isn't necessary to evoke a reaction, instead he simply lets the events speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The movie is done so beautifully simple. We know nothing about the characters except for what we learn about them from their actions on that day. There aren't any typical heroes like you would expect to find in the latest Michael Bay trash. Greengrass simply gives us everyday people in extraordinary situations.<br/><br/>As hard as it may be for some to see this movie, I would recommend it to everyone as it is easily the most important movie made yet this year (that last sentence may lose credibility since there haven't been many other important movies this year)."

I felt that I had to watch this movie to honor those who had died by watching their story of terror, bravery and heroism.<br/><br/>The expectations I had were so off, the movie was very well made and as far as I have heard from family interviews on cable news, the passengers and flight crew was happy with the overall portrayals.<br/><br/>The anticipation level is on high from the movies first opening shoot, we know the ending but we are hoping and on edge waiting for intervention.<br/><br/>The movie has no political agenda and takes place in multiple locations (not just limited to the inside of the plane) as the events of September 11th unfold.<br/><br/>This film is strong and full of emotion, there were many sobs and sniffles as the lights came up, there were also many people who clapped in honor of the bravery and heroism of the passengers and crew on United flight 93.<br/><br/>Many theaters stated they would not show this movie due to sensitivity. This movie in my opinion was in very good taste and is showing in at least 95% of the theaters across Texas. I went to the 7:40pm showing on Friday night in San Antonio, Texas.

"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","7","13","19 September 2006"," Poignant, Realistic Mise en Scène
","""United 93"" is British director Paul Greengrass' real time account of the tragic events of United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, when some passengers tried to foil the terrorist plot. With unknown but competent actors and an honest sense of telling history (not a story), Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"") conducted this horrific account with his peculiar, dry style of film-making and made a poignant film. ""United 93"" is superior and quite different from Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"", which focused on another side of the tragedy (the fight of the firemen to save lives), but turned out to be somewhat lame and melodramatic. ""United 93"" reminds me of Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" (about the Columbine massacre): it doesn't take sides, yet it doesn't mean Greengrass was afraid to go beyond. It means there's still a lot to be known about the ones who caused this sad tragedy and everybody was harmed in a way. Perhaps the American president could've done more. The only heroes were the innocent passengers who tried but sadly couldn't save their lives. This film is both a tribute to them and a historic account that shouldn't be ignored. 9 out of 10."
"JungleDrama","9","7","13","30 April 2006"," The passengers of Flight 93 were the first Americans to fight back
","United 93 reminds us that it is essential that we remember ourselves not just as victims on 9/11  remember not just what was sad, but what was inspiring. The passengers of Flight 93 were the first Americans to fight back. United 93 wisely avoids focusing too exclusively on any of the individual passengers. Instead, they are presented as an ensemble exemplifying many of the virtues of the American character: a great improvisational intelligence, as they quickly understand and cope with the radically new, horrifying circumstances they are presented with; an extraordinary civic facility, demonstrated by their ability to formulate rapidly a plan of action among themselves; and a fierceness when provoked. In preparation for the assault on the terrorists, one passenger tells a flight attendant: ""Get every weapon you can find. We need weapons."" <br/><br/>The heroism of those passengers is now forever part of our story as a nation. It's not too soon for a major Hollywood film that portrays it brilliantly. It's about time."

","When I went to see this film the cinema was sold out. In such a case one generally expects the noise of popcorn rustling, coke supping, and sweet bag opening. None of these sounds were present, replaced instead with a deathly silence and broken intermittently from open sobbing. This sobbing was not restricted to any group as people from all around the cinema participated in a communal outpouring of emotion that maybe has not been possible since the event since it has been mediatized and politicized. Instead this film provoked raw emotions in those that saw it, me included, and when it ended, there was no chatter, we who watched it simply got up and left, not talking until we reached our cars. Put quite simply, the film is very realistic, well delivered and well acted. The director and production staff have put a lot of effort into creating the right feeling on the plane and the right atmosphere of those on the plane once the plane is taken over. The attention to detail is impeccable, and they even include a character (fictional or not I don't know) who outlines the previous history of hi-jackers thus explaining why similar events didn't happen on the other planes on the fateful morning. All in all, it is a compelling film, and one that I will certainly buy when it comes out on DVD. It makes real events that have been made feel so in-human in a very respectful way. 10 out of 10"

","September 11, 2001 is still in us. It was a calamity that directly impacted many and indirectly impacted all. After observing these repulsive terrorist acts, many of us were quietly uttering the words ""This is just like a movie"". After you see the shattering gripping film ""United 93"" , you will be quietly uttering the words ""This is just like September 11"". Director Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece of a narrative. The film is based on the hijacked 9-11 United Airlines Flight 93 which was hijacked by terrorists and supposedly was going to strike The White House. However, valiant passengers bombarded the terrorists to prevent The White House strike and instead the plane crashed in a grassy field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The passengers of United 93 woke up on September 11, 2001 as everyday living common people and died that day as forever-to-the-day living-in-our-hearts uncommon heroes. Greengrass powerful directorial execution inserts the viewers as they were actually passengers in United 93 observing the horror objectively, and as if they were air traffic controllers in the stressful trenches of the National Air Traffic Control Centers observing the horror subjectively. The shaky camera style of ""United 93"" provides an unsettling hysterical perspective to the film which coincides with the emotions all Americans were feeling on that haunting day. Greengrass' not so ""plane"" delivery of ""United 93"" was instrumental in disclosing emotions of that infamous day which many of us had stored as secondary sentiments for a couple of years. Greengrass brilliantly interchanges scenes from the turmoil of the flight to the labor of the traffic control centers. He was also wise to cast unknown actors in a film that the characters should supersede the actors portraying them. However, I should point out that the ensemble acting of ""United 93"" was remarkable and their performances should take off their thespian careers ""sky high"". ""United 93"" is a film that is not exploiting September 11. It is an educational film that pays tribute to the crew of United 93. So unite your family & friends and ""secure"" yourself to your local ""homeland"" movie theater by embroiling in the cinematic excellence of the film ""United 93"". ***** Excellent"

I Left the theater with a mixture of sadness for what had happened and also a sense of pride for those it happened to and their families. This movie will stick with me for quite a while.

And having two sons in the military; one a pilot who was scrambled, albeit not in that specific area, and the other working in The Pentagon that very day, I have a very vivid recollection of the precise sequence of events.

The film brought out a sense of futility felt by the air traffic controllers, the military, and the passengers on-board Flight 93. The ""authorities"" were caught off-guard and there were too many links in the chain of command to move the machinery in time.<br/><br/>As the action inside the plane grew to its crescendo I found myself rooting for the brave passengers who realized that no one was going to help them and that their fates were in their own hands. It was an odd feeling knowing that their actions wouldn't save them. But they are owed our gratitude for keeping the plane from its intended target, the U.S. Capitol.

Even the pre-hijacking process of boarding a plane and all the other things involved with flying is done very well. Which makes this feel even more tragic. I for the life of me can't understand some of the (very few i might say) negative reviews of this film. Reading the Yahoo movie section, there are quite a few nut-cases reviewing this. Anyone who lives in the NYC area can't possibly feel that way about this movie. The one image that still haunts me, is the scene after the flight takes off and the plane angles around Manhattan, and in the one window, you see the top of the Twin Towers. How many times i have flown from Newark and watched that same image. And know that it won't ever be seen again."

","I was shocked how the movie depict the FAA control rooms as bunch of people that have no clue and the military as bunch of guys that have no authority. In reality - as opposite to the movie - the east coast is guarded and there are all the time fighter jets in air. They not need to be scrambles, they was just routinely redirected each time a malfunction in the communication occur to intercept the plane. There is a known to pilots procedure about it. The fighter jet come up from left (where the first pilot sit) and wave by his wings. The airplane witch radio was given up, has to wave by their wings as well. Then the fighter jet lead it to nearby airport and the plane has to follow. If not, there is warning shots and then direct ones. But all that is unnecessary in Boeing 757 and 767 planes, witch can be remotely controlled by NORAD itself. They can shut off the pilot controls and even with his active resistance fly and land the plane alone. Of course that way omitted. Another problem is, that at 8:13 is the flight 11 known for not responding (flighters should be notified from NORAD to check this one out). At 8:14 the flight 11 goes off course - all red signals go on and fighters should have fly in afterburner now, because this is serious. Transponder of flight 11 stop working in 8:20. Then the plane is shown as red object - it is UFO (unidefined Flight Object) or more like a ENEMY in USA airspace - so one not need to search out all 4200 airplanes air borne to see exactly witch one is now enemy. It should be worth mentioning that no hijacked ever disabled transponder, as that for the military then mean - ENEMY airplane. And the last thing hijacker want is to mess with military armed fighters. There was another lie in the movie that scrambled F16 was unarmed. First at all, a F15 doing the job. And second - they are armed the moment they roll out of hangar. What the hell could be a military plane useful w/o arms...? But back to the time. 8:13 or 8:14 we got a hijacked plane. From 8:20 we got a ENEMY plane over the United States of America. And to the impact at 8:46 is long 26 minutes. Ever if the fighters aren't in air already, they from Otis Airbase can do it to Manhattan in just 7 minutes. Look at small the distance, and F15 can pull Mach 2,5 - do the math. And about the phone calls - mobile phones does not work in airliners. Try for yourself. The setback phones might have better chances, but why would American Airlines in 2004 make such adverts from their new cell stations? If setback or even mobile phones worked so well in 2001, why invest millions in such new technology? http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2004-07-19-aircells_x.htm<br/><br/>And someone have the balls to his the viewers with such lie - come on, that is not good.

It's not a documentary on September 11, and yet you watch some news on TV; there are terrorists, but that's not what scares you the most; there are human stories but they don't hit you singularly. I watched all the events of September 11 from around the world, and yet I felt my eyes watering, so I wouldn't recommend the movie to relatives of the victims. It made me pray against the odds for a different ending, even though I knew precisely what was going to happen.

As passengers, we knew nothing unusual was happening until we stopped at the gate. Then, as we turned on our cell phones, they were either ringing or had messages to call someone immediately. We exited the plane and observed some other passengers in the old Midway terminal staring at the TV in the lounge. The rest of my story was similar to many others in the same situation. Call wife back and assure her I was OK, grab the last rent car from the rental agent, find a motel, then car pool back to Texas several days later. <br/><br/>That was just a bump in the road of life for me.<br/><br/>Now, as I reflect on the movie and review my experience, I ask myself, ""Would I have taken the same actions as the passengers and crew on United 93."" I hope so, but I really don't know.<br/><br/>I have a lapel pin that honors the flight crews of all four aircraft on September 11. Now it will honor all the passengers on all four aircraft as well the heroes at the FAA, ATC and Military Command.<br/><br/>They are all heroes. Real heroes.

","**** (out of ****) I saw this film at a free advance screening in Atlanta tonight and it was excellent-definitely one of the best films of the year so far. The tension and suspense are almost unbearable. The film's documentary style makes it seem like you are on the plane with these people. It was a very moving tribute to those who perished that fateful day. The opening scenes inspire a sense of dread as you see the passengers boarding the plane, as well as the scenes inside the FAA and NORAD centers which illustrated the almost criminal lack of communication between the two groups. <br/><br/>Many people may choose to not see this film, and that is understandable. However, for those who are curious, be prepared for an emotionally draining but worthwhile look at what may have taken place that day."

","OK, there has been plenty of speculation and opinion and probably a lot of comments written here by folks who haven't even seen the film yet..Yes, it premiered here last night and I had to go see... I found it is a powerful re-enactment that doesn't dwell on much or on any particular character... It is faithful to the time-line and the events of 9-11-01, even if some of what takes places on board the flight in the film does so out of speculation... What else can a film-maker do? Greengrass, who has done excellent work with the Jason Bourne thriller ""The Bourne Supremacy"", is the right man for the job here. He is smart enough to know NOT to tinker too much with history; to NOT cast this film with ""big stars""; to not cause too many distractions as the film moves along.<br/><br/>What can I say? We all know what the outcome is. We all have our own ideas about what took place on board United 93. We all remember 9-11-01 like it was yesterday. This film honors those on the doomed flight for what we all have pretty much accepted as fact: The passengers, or victims themselves caused the mission to fail. The simplicity of the director's style, coupled with edgy, subtle performances throughout, will cause you to again stop and think about 9-11-01, most likely for a long time after you see this film. Maybe a lot of us don't want to keep doing that. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there's a buck to be made here, this work fulfills the idea that some of the stories of 9-11 can and need to be told on the big screen... It is powerful, painful, and prideful at the same time. Bring Kleenex."

The passengers of this doomed flight sacrificed their lives to ensure that the U.S. Capitol was safe. The scenes of the chaos in the flight centers, military, and lack of communication really showed that we were dragged into a new type of war, the War on Terrorism.

","On September, 11th 2001, four United Airlines American domestic flights are hijacked by terrorists. After the collision of two planes against the World Trade Center and one against the Pentagon, the passengers and crew of United Flight 93 unsuccessfully decide to struggle against the four terrorist to take back the control of the airplane.<br/><br/>Last month I saw ""Flight 93"", a movie made for television that reconstitutes and dramatizes the moments of despair of the passengers of flight United 93 through the testimony of their phone calls to families and friends. ""United 93"" is about the same historic fact, but gives the big picture, showing how unprepared the authorities (flight controllers, military staff etc.) were for such an unexpected tragedy. The last moments in the plane are very tense and sad. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Vôo United 93"" (""Flight United 93"")"
"Matt_Layden","8","6","11","3 January 2007"," ""A Film That Is Honest And From The Heart""
","United 93 tells the events of September 11th, 2001. It was the only hijacked plane that did not make it's final destination because of it's passengers who decided to take control of the plane. I sat and watch United 93 and Stone's ""World Trade Center"" in the same session. While both films did tug at the emotional scales, United 93 seemed to be a more heartfelt film.<br/><br/>Greengrass, who's other films include the just as serious ""Bloody Sunday"" and spy flick ""Bourne Surpremacy"", takes on the difficult task of retelling the horrific events of that day. With no mainstream actors, a relatively small budget and the controversial topic, it would seem that the film was doomed a failure before it was even finished. Alas, it got the approval from the families and people who said that it was ""too soon"" actually went to see it. There are many words one may use to describe the film: respectful, powerful, humanistic, but you can't really describe it to anyone, they must see it for themselves.<br/><br/>Why does the film work so well? It chooses to show us the story and not shove it down our throats. We know what happened, but not how it happened. We will never know how it happened, but United 93 gives us a suggestion. Greengrass chose to use a relatively unknown cast and it works. There are no big name distractions here, these people are not being paid big bucks to star in films, which is the sense I got in ""World Trade Center"". Although, you might recognize a face or two, at one moment I was saying to myself, ""Hey, it's that guy from The Mummy"". There were only a few moments in the film where the acting was pretty bad, mainly in the military scenes. That one blonde woman was horrible, but this did not ruin the film.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see the intensity of the military personal and flight control centers doing what they do. I can only imagine it was ten times more intense that day then what was depicted. You get the sense of urgency in these scenes, a sense of realism. Everything was pulled off nicely. Seeing the mentions of the other planes was a good way to broaden the drama. I was pleased the film wasn't solely concentrating on United 93, which was another problem for Stone's piece. I was surprised to see actual footage of the planes hitting the towers to be shown and applaud Greengrass for not shying away from it. The use of inexpensive hand-held cameras at to the urgency and realism that was needed. If the production was any bigger, it would have ruined the effectiveness.<br/><br/>The film doesn't show us the heroes from that day, instead it shows us how human they are. In the final chilling moments of the film when the passengers are trying to take over the plane, there is no ""hero"" shot of one man overcoming evil. Instead it is raw anger from these passengers and their need to save their own lives and the lives of others. The film ends on a perfect and chilling note of what they saw. We are not watching them crash, we are there with them. The heart pounding score increasing the tension and the intensity of the actions. There are no post-dramatic events to show, no air traffic control scenes trying to explain what happened. A beautiful ending to a powerful film.<br/><br/>Here's a film that tells us to look back at that day and remember those who died. It's not one to shy away from a serious topic, instead it confronts it head on. The film was given the go ahead by the families from the passengers on board. No one should watch United 93 as a ""film"", but more of a look back on that day. It's a respect piece to those who died. Not a tale of survival of any kind, other then the fact that we as people survived that evil and continue to live on. <br/><br/>It's safe to say that United 93 is one of the most important films of 2006 and probably of the last 5 or so years. Not only does it honour the family members of those on the plane, but the rest of the people who experience something that day; everyone experience something that day. There is no character to identify with, they are all equal, all human, all just like us. Everything that happens is in the moment, no one knows what is going on, but audience. Everyone should give this film an honest open minded viewing. It is important and will only grow to be more important with time."
"spiro_sea","10","8","16","3 June 2006"," All of Us United
","The first movie to be released at the cinema about the 9/11 attacks was bound to court controversy. Would be it be a Jerry Bruckhiemer flag waving spectacular? I for one thought that United-93 was going to be a terrible film about an event that happened too recently to make a movie about it and about an event where no one knows for sure what actually happened But after reading good reviews for it, I decided to give it a chance. Boy was I in for a surprise.<br/><br/>I'm British but I went through 9/11 too. I didn't lose friends or family, I just watched it on TV and sat shocked and horrified. I think on 9/11 everyone with a heart was an American that day.<br/><br/>Watching the movie, with its familiar images of ordinary life (people waiting to board a plane or aboard the plane itself) and the terrible (the twin towers smoking and the smoke rising from the Pentagon) It cant help but stir up the emotions of that day. Watching the movie forces you to relive that event and also puts you, once the movie hits its climatic and stomach-churning third act, in the shoes of the doomed passengers The first two acts are about the control centres and the reaction from the military. The normal rapid fire speech of aircraft controllers gradually is replaced by sheer panic as no-one knows what to do. The army struggle with Rules of Engagement and with getting enough planes in the air to protect American cities from an unknown and utterly inconceivable plane. An especially chilling moment is when the report of a plane comes in that it was hijacked, minutes after it has already crashed into the WTC The final act is aboard the hijacked United-93. The passengers are shocked and horrified by the four hijackers who take over the plane with plans to hit the capitol building. The shock and violence of this initial attack is horrifying (as it should be) and then the passengers rally and strike back.<br/><br/>The passengers are hard to pick out if you don't know the subject. Tom Burnett and Todd Beamer are there obviously but the rest are harder to be sure about. As an actual movie, United 93 lacks characterisation but I don't feel that this is something that the movie left out by accident but by design. These are real people. Their motivations are to be saved in that awful day.<br/><br/>Some heart-breaking moments exist where the passengers call home to say goodbye. Its hard not to put yourself in the same shoes as those people. What is it you say if you KNOW your about to die? There is also a nice parallel drawn with the prayers of the passengers inter cut with those of the terrorists The final ten minutes see the passengers fight back and ""roll"" the trolley down the aisles to try and break into the plane. According to the movie, they come very close to the controls but never actually retake the plane. The last gasp desperate struggle to survive is played out with rising speed and tension, the sonic battery of the noise of the terrorists praying and the desperate shouts of the passengers (If we don't do it we'll die) make the last ten minutes a total sensual assault.<br/><br/>The final shot of the movie is totally unforgettable. One of the most explicitly horrifying images I have ever seen in a movie and I'm not sure I will ever forget it.<br/><br/>And that is, I think, the point of this movie. Afterwards I sat there utterly crushed, tears coming silently and coming very close to just sobbing openly. Afterwards I turned to my friend I was with and we hugged in an attempt to recover from that movie and that event and those memories.<br/><br/>But it is important that we do not forget ""Whats past is prologue"""

","This movie was excellent. It really showed the bravery of the passengers on United Flight 93. This movie was not made like most Hollywood films, it is not fake and there are no unrealistic events in the movie. This movie touched my heart and it is your duty as an American to see it. Although it has only been but 5 years since 9/11, I don't think that America will ever be completely ready and I think that now is the best time for this movie to come out because it helps remind us of the terrible tragedy that happened on 9/11. This movie is great and honors all of the brave passengers on that flight, who helped save thousands of lives."

","I heard Roger Ebert and other TV wonks go on and on about this movie and was expecting something dramatically more realistic and interesting that the TV rendition of the flight 93 story. While it is a compelling and gut wrenching account of the incident, I found it only a little better than the TV version. It emphasized (and I expect accurately) the bumbling of NORAD and to some degree the FAA..obvious that we simply weren't prepared to deal with this sort of thing. Can only hope that in the future, when the next terrorist act comes along, we'll do a better job. I also noticed that Hollywood took their usual slap at Bush/Cheney, suggesting that they were unreachable as the incident unfolded thus delaying scrambling of jets to intercept the hijacked airplanes..at the end of the movie, in the postscript, the facts in this regard were clarified."

But they were ordinary people unknown to us before 9/11. We even know a few of their names from that terrible day  Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham  and we celebrate them, rightfully, as symbols of the very best in us<br/><br/>When I walked out of the dark theater early this week and back into the ordinariness of my own life, blinking away tears in the bright sunshine, it felt like a gift. If ""United 93"" helps us to honor what has gone and to appreciate what is still with us, then it's done more than most movies ever will."
"moviegoer06","10","11","24","28 April 2006"," Greengrass Got It Right
","If you're looking for movie stars and pyrotechnics this is not the movie for you. Paul Greengrass did an excellent job of combining fact with conjecture without making any part of the story larger-than-life. By using a relatively unknown cast, (even the real-life traffic controllers), he managed to pull off an incredibly controversial movie with grace, and more importantly, responsibility.<br/><br/>The fact is, we really don't know exactly what happened during the morning of 9/11 aboard any of the four hijacked aircrafts. What we do have are the phone conversations and cockpit voice recorders that are not only choppy, but unclear at times amid the confusion. Greengrass was tasked with combining fact with the unknowable and rather than glamorizing the story of United Flight 93, he told a story that was not only plausible, but likely as close to the raw truth as humanly possible.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for any American who can bare to re-live that fateful day. It greatly helps bring to life the events that transpired from the moment the first airplane left Boston, to the confusion and uncertainty air traffic-control faced to the courage of a group of strangers who will forever live in our hearts and minds as the silent hero's or September 11th, 2001."
"dojopelle","1","36","99","26 April 2006"," Trashcan movie
","Well, if this film wasn't based on a tragedy I wouldn't spare on my disappointment on this movie.<br/><br/>You can tell this is a low budget movie by the actors and the whole scenery. You don't get any real answers to the happening itself. At least not more than you already know from watching the news. The director is doing his best to make the movie a good drama but its really just stupid and tasteless. When you see the families of the victims in the plane talking on the phone there is always a bunch of children somewhere just to emphasize the tragedy. The movie consists of phone calls and tears and closeups on babies. This is not a ""hey Americans are the greatest"" movie and that is good but the director doesn't make you feel as upset as you would have if this movie was made by someone more skillful. You get the feeling that the director wants to make it a movie but halfway into the movie its just stalling. Nothing happens but people making phone calls. This movie shouldn't have been released or at least 30 minutes shorter. Go buy candy for your money instead of spending it on this crap!"

I could feel the fear of the people on that plane like I was living it. Very moving, Very compelling. They hide nothing from you in this movie.

","So I am required to put 10 lines for this. Let me begin with the statement that I truly regret for the lives of the innocent victims who died on 9/11, both on the two Towers and in the planes involved. I'd be human without soul if I haven't. Still I have firm opinion that this movie is shameless piece of sh*t and should have never been made. The reasons - it is completely fiction, based on no facts whatsoever, the plot is imaginary and sucked out of the fingers. Actually there unfortunately are no any clear evidence of what had happened on the board so the speculations may begin. Here we have evil Arab terrorists kidnapping plane with plastic knives (no, this is not ""Is there a pilot on the plane"" 2). For me the circumstances - that not a single body was found (they simply vaporized), as well as explosives of any kind but still the plane exploded (I remember the CNN news that day and have recorded it on tape) are enough to not trust the original version. The real problem is so many American people believes blindly to what The Government says. So blessed the fools are. Also, I noticed that despite the dullness of a movie, there will always be a bunch of vivid fans shouting ""Oh my God, this is the best movie ever!"" I am telling you this before some user feels offended of truth and report this for being abusing."

","Four planes were hijacked on 9/11. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York. Another struck the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. ""United 93"" is a heart-pounding, difficult, tight, taut and chaotic account of the fourth hijacked plane which was headed to the U.S. Capitol building, but crashed instead in an open Pennsylvania field as 40 seemingly ordinary people with nothing in common except a doomed flight banded together and sacrificed themselves to save other innocents. Brutally rough film that is to 9/11 what ""Battleground"", ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" and ""12 O'Clock High"" were to World War II combat in 1949 and what ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"" were to Vietnam when released in 1978. Writer/director Paul Greengrass (a British film-maker who is best known for the ""Bourne"" series sequels) goes basically real-time here as he focuses on the disorganization and total shock of that fateful day five years ago. Trish Gates, as one of the flight attendants, Cheyenne Jackson, David Alan Basche and Christian Clemenson are all standouts, but the real stars of ""United 93"" are the camera and the hypnotic dramatic score. Memorable, unforgettable and destined to be an important addition to the cinema, ""United 93"" is a strong production all the way. 5 stars out of 5."

","""The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake, we will show the world we will pass the test."" - George W Bush<br/><br/>Post 9/11 cinema seemed to witness an increase in at least three types of films: those that portrayed families under siege by faceless terrorists (""War of the Worlds"", ""Mist"", ""Cloverfield"" etc), those which attempted to appeal to the heroism, courage and duty that large scale national catastrophes elicit (""United 93"", ""WTC"", ""Spider Man"", ""Ladder 49"" etc) and those which openly attacked US foreign policy (""Lions for Lambs"", ""Syrianna"", ""Redacted"", ""Rendition"", ""Valley of Ellah"" etc).<br/><br/>Of these films, Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" and Oliver Stone's ""WTC"" were two of the first to directly address the events of September the 11th. Both focus on the actual disaster, both attempt to be gritty and realistic, both focus on ordinary Americans and both pretend to avoid sensationalism.<br/><br/>But what ideology do these films serve? Observe, for example, how both films seem to focus on exceptions to the norm. Of the four kidnapped planes, ""United"" focuses on the only one which failed to reach its target. Similarly, ""WTC"" tells the story of the only 2 members of the Port Authority Police Force who made it out of the WTC rubble alive. In terms of historicism, these films mimic Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Private Ryan"", two other faux-realistic films about exceptions (the Jews who survived, the son who lived etc) which turned violent carnage into personal triumph for the purpose of national regeneration.<br/><br/>In ""United 93"", we have the passengers of a hijacked plane knowing they're about to die. They thus decide to storm the pilot's cabin and bring their plane down before it hits its target. They, apparently, make a sacrifice so that others may live ""free"". This notion of national duty and personal sacrifice is mimicked in ""WTC"". The effect is that both films mythologise 9/11 as a moment of American triumph, rather than a national failing. ""United"" deals with American heroism in the skies and ""WTC"" deals with American heroism on the land. Both serve to rebuild national identity: ie, we are a nation of victims, attacked by irrational ""savages"". If we hope to prevail, it is our duty to respond with heroism, solidarity and self-sacrifice, the very ""United"" of the film's title.<br/><br/>In his writings, Jacques Ellul examines the workings of Judeo Christian myths. He says that post WW2 political propaganda will increasingly appeal to both feelings of guilt and sorrow. Soldiers, firemen and citizens will become dead Christs, their suffering mythologised and used as emotional tools to, unintentionally or not, draw the support of the public. As the end of ""Private Ryan"" proclaims - a film which rapes pre-WW2 history as expertly as this current crop of Gulf War 2 films distorts post-WW2 history - we must ""earn this"", because ""they"" went through ""hell for you"". And so we pin ribbons on our heroes and build altars to our everyman Christs, praising them for protecting us from ""evil"". But the truth is, we owe our uniformed Christs absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>By focusing their narratives on ""exceptions to the rule"", these films serve the purpose of preventing us from asking truly important questions. They avoid any context, political or otherwise, and are content to simply focus on ordinary people being affected by the sudden and violent intrusion of History. But it is a History without a Cause. It is History without Context. It is History without Meaning or Motive. That the majority of the hijackers belonged to a repressive country and puppet state armed and backed by the United States is ignored. That - as social scientists like Robert Page and others demonstrate in their analyses of all major terrorist acts over the past half century - terrorism is never religiously motivated but always designed for reasons of autonomy or national liberation, is likewise ignored.<br/><br/>The result of such things are three fold. Firstly, such art helps to bolster a virtual threat; an invisible, spectral enemy. The covert message of such mythology is that this omniscient threat of Terror legitimises our obscene measures of self-defence.<br/><br/>The second result of such art is to convey a sense of national victimhood. Such victimhood is itself a contradictory force. It provides us with the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation...and yet such a power can only be acquired once one feigns weakness. Thirdly, in the guise of apoliticism, such art engenders a very specific type of passivity and acceptance. When the monster attacks, one just does one's duty. Such a reaction is automatic, even sacrificial, because trust (and a righteous belief in one's self, one's government etc) is understood.<br/><br/>Significantly, ""United 93"" opens with images of intent-looking Arab men. They speak in whispers and ominous prayers, before we cut to over-head shots of a cityscape and then various shots of civilians going about their business. The film draws a clean line from Terrorist Other, who sweeps down from the heavens like an angel of death, to innocent civilians, everyone a possible target.<br/><br/>Mass confusion then ensues, but in the real world NATCC and NORAD had explicit procedures whenever an aircraft drifts from its flight plan. This ""incompetence"" narrative is in keeping with the official 9/11 story, though not a single person within the NATCC, the FAA or NORAD has been so much as reprimanded for poor 9/11 management. That US military planners had bizarrely decided to stage more than one dozen military simulations on 9/11, effectively removing many east coast-based U.S. air force fighter jets from the picture, is likewise ignored. This is thus a film designed to help embed the ""official version"" of the events surrounding 9/11, legitimising for a global audience the 9/11 mythology: 19 psychotic Arabs drove some planes into some big buildings because, gee, they're crazy and hate our ""freedoms"".<br/><br/>2/10 – Superficial."

The director brilliantly avoids making this a typical Hollywood production with heroes and villains, subplots, etc. There is ample drama in just depicting what really happened on Flight 93 based on what we know from passenger phone calls, ATC logs, data recorders, etc. The characterization of events of the actual hijacking,rebellion, and eventual crash of United 93 depicted in this film almost certainly match what actually occurred.<br/><br/>I respect how the film portrays the events from the terrorists' point of view without passing judgement. They were undoubtedly scared as well, but driven by their loyalty to their cause and the glorification of their god. That said, we should never forget the courage and ultimate sacrifice given by the passengers of Flight 93 who tried in vain to save the lives of others. <br/><br/>This film will forever remind us of their valor."

","In near real time and using accounts and officials records of the day, Paul Greengrass delivers an account of the events surrounding the terrorist attack on 11/9/06, focusing on the aviation authorities, the military and the passengers of the only plane that did not reach its target  United flight 93. By doing this he was one of the first to make a film (as opposed to a documentary) that recreates the day. That said though, Greengrass' approach might as well be a documentary as it is very much a recreation as opposed to being a movie in the way Oliver Stone's film was.<br/><br/>Having done Bloody Sunday, I was happy that this had been put in his hands and I hoped he could do a good job. Although it certainly cannot be described as a fun experience, it is a great film in the way it coldly and convincingly does what it sets out to do  deliver a recreation. He doesn't try to manipulate the audience with cheap sentiment and he doesn't overplay the horror of the day. He also wisely avoids any questioning of why what happened and has no interest in conspiracy theories, mainly because few of us did as the day unfolded. Some viewers will complain about his shaky camera but for me I liked the way it kept moving, catching me up in the confusion on the ground and the fear on the plane.<br/><br/>The film makes very good use of official reports on the ground and does a good job of recreating the scenes on flight 93. Only a French (or at least a French accented) passenger trying to convince the other passengers to sit tight and just do what the hijackers want was a bum note for me  I'm not sure, maybe it was factually accurate but it felt like a cheap shot and it was not up to the standard of the rest of the film. The lack of any (for me) recognisable faces in the cast was a very good move as it took away anything that would distract. The cast of unknowns all work well together and are very convincing in their various roles; there are one or two so-so performances but few of these are key performances and are covered over easily enough.<br/><br/>The events themselves are still moving and it is easy to be caught up in them  the majority of the first half of the film is fascinating as you get a sense of the response on the ground, but the second half is gutting due to the very real sense of fear and desperation in the plane. Reviewers were concerned that this was ""too soon"" and I recall the internet having a buzz of dissension about the film but in reality Greengrass has delivered a strong recreation with a strong factual basis that just allows the events to speak for themselves right down to the very matter of fact way the film ends. By turns it is interesting and moving and is well worth seeing."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","9","4 September 2006"," A noble effort from the filmmakers
","The opening of ""United 93"" reminds me immediately of ""Paradise now"", winner of this year's Best Foreign Language Film Golden Globe award. In both cases, we are presented with terrorists (at least some of them) that look deceptively disarming, particularly in the case of the bespectacled leader in ""United 93"" that can easily pass as a university academic. But then, watching ""Paradise now"" inevitably leads to moral questions to which there can be no easy answer.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is a very different experience. With minimum possible moral judgement, it simply presents the tragic events that lead to the crash of the flight on that fateful morning, drawing the audience into an emotional ride that they are unlikely ever to forget. At the end of the movie, we have a visual image from the cockpit of the plane fast approaching the ground. Then abruptly, everything ends, and the screen goes completely black, with no sound, for maybe half a minute that felt like an eternity. In the show I attended, during that half-minute, you could hear a pin drop, and the theatre was nearly full.<br/><br/>""United 93"" captures the tragic events of 911 on two planes (a very reluctant ""no pun intended"" as this is not meant to be funny). From the macro angle, we see how the undeclared war starts to unfold in front of the people both at Civil Aviation Control and at the Air Force. With the haunting images of 911 firmly branded in our minds through the last 5 years, it is now difficult to empathise with the people who first saw it as a rare and isolated hijacking incident (not of UA93, but another flight). Ironically and probably unintentionally, the most hair-raisingly exciting sequence from the macro scene occurs quite early in the movie, when two flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision. Later, after the first hijacked aircraft flies into the World Trade Centre, the situation rapidly escalates to such dumbfounding devastation that ordinary sense of excitement no longer has any meaning.<br/><br/>On the micro plane, regular air travellers (even just once or twice a year) in the audience find themselves just all too familiar with the scene of a routine boarding of a flight. But it soon becomes a nightmare as this is UA93, the only of the four hijacked flights in which the terrorist fail in their mission, which is to fly into the White House. This failure is attributable to the courage of the passengers who came to a timely realisation of the situation through telephone contacts with friends and family on the ground, and storm the armed terrorists, resulting in the plane crashing 20 minutes from reaching the White House, killing everyone on board.<br/><br/>Nobody will ever know in detail what exactly happened on UA93. However, with untiring research and unrelenting professionalism, the movie makers meticulously recreated what probably happened and dedicated the film to the passengers who died and their loved ones. We don't know if there was really one moment when there was a glimpse of a chance, when they found that the bomb one of the terrorists strapped on his body was not a real bomb and that one of the passengers might just be able to fly the aircraft. But we are certainly saddened at the thought that they just might have had that chance of survival."
"lochnessbubba","6","5","9","5 June 2006"," Nauseated by the shaky camera work...
","I give this movie a 6 based on the fact that despite what was otherwise good solid work by the producers and actors involved, I found it ultimately unwatchable because of motion sickness brought on by the camera style. <br/><br/>The story itself seemed true to all the reports I had heard over the years concerning the incident, and the dialogue and acting seemed very solid. I was watching with interest up to about the halfway point when I got nauseated thanks to the shaky camera work. <br/><br/>Being a movie enthusiast, I know this style of cinematography has been popular for about 15 years. I first noticed it used on the NYPD Blue TV series. I believe that this ""shaky"" style has its place- it can be effective to create a frantic mood when filming action scenes such as those found in one of my favorite movie series, 'The Bourne Identity/Supremacy'. (Although a couple of scenes in 'Supremacy' left me a little queasy, they were quickly over with and that particular film settled down again where I could watch it). <br/><br/>However, I see no good reason to use this style when you are filming a group of people in a flight control center where nobody is getting body-slammed or shot or punched in the nose. It actually loses its effect when over-employed and creates another effect: nausea. <br/><br/>I never remember getting sick watching NYPD Blue, but my TV is not 60 feet wide, either. The girl I took to the movie was also made sick by this, and while she and I were out in the lobby recovering we could hear from the ladies restroom the sounds of another moviegoer losing her groceries. <br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen the last half of the movie but the constant shaking of the camera made it impossible. I may be one of the few that it affected so badly but I know I was not the only one."
"come2whereimfrom","7","5","9","2 June 2006"," United they stand.
","There isn't a lot you can say about the story that you don't already know. Four planes all high jacked by terrorists each with specific targets. The first three hit the twin towers and the pentagon and the fourth, due to the bravery of the passengers was brought down in a field, this then is their story. Shot at times in an almost dogma/documentary style it looks rough and with close in shots giving a claustrophobic feel and amplifying the cramped conditions of the plane it adds to the tension well. It is a slow builder as we get everyone on the plane and get it off the ground, but once the 1st of the towers is smoking and no one knows why, the film really kicks in. There has been criticism that this film comes too soon, only five years, after the actual events of that horrific day. But whether it is made now or in twenty years time is irrelevant, to me the scar will still be raw. That day is etched in my brain forever and cannot be erased so I don't think it matters when it is made, just that it has. There are films made all the time about serial killers and true-life heroic deeds, this just happens to be both. This is one of those rare films that capture a moment in history for generations to learn from in years to come. Although not a pleasurable watch in an entertainment sense (unlike Fahrenheit 911 it does use footage of the attacks that made me hair stand on end still) it is something that everyone should see. One of the most interesting things about the film was how un-American it was there were no Rambo's or Schwarzenegger's here, but grown men scared and driven to desperation. Maybe it was because it was a British director? Or in telling tales of true life people are just more honest. Either way it shows us a group of people who did what they had to in the face of adversity. As it says in the film Gladiator 'whatever you do in this life echoes in eternity'. This is a poignant and moving tribute to anyone that was involved in that fateful sunny day on September 11th."

","That this was by the British Working Title films is a mark of authenticity and one that is deserved.<br/><br/>Unoted 93 is the embarrassingly frank and honest witness. It lays bare questions like why were there only 4 planes available to Major Fox? Why Sliney at the FAA couldn't get help from the Pentagon? And just why would not Chaney give the rules of engagement? At best it show the US Administration pf not having the competence to run a bath and at worst of collusive conspiracy. Furthermore, the film shows no aftermath with no comment on wreckage evidence.<br/><br/>Whether 9/11 was a put-up job or the result of a co-ordinated terrorist attack is not the centre of the film. It is the heroism of both those in the air - the banding together of the passengers to attempt a feat never done before that could never have been predicted by whoever plans such tragedies. Likewise, decisive action by the FAA's Sliney (on his first day on the job) and the military's Major Fox and the professionalism of their Air Traffic Controllers is a true testimony of how Government OUGHT TO WORK.<br/><br/>Its 7 hours since I left the Press Preview and I'm still fighting back the tears - a remarkable feat to do to a newspaper editor. It's like open heart surgery - a painful and unpleasant experience, but one we all need to put the trivia in our lives in perspective and value that that is true and precious. GO!"

","This camera technique caused us to leave before the movie was half way through. I was motion sick like never before. I'm not sure what the artistic point is to the films the that use this technique -- looks and feels like it was done with a home, personal video camera -- but it ruined this movie for us.<br/><br/>I noticed two ladies down the row from us having the same problem, closing their eyes and getting up and walking out for periods of time, so I know it did not just affect us.<br/><br/>Let me interject here that before last night I really, really wanted to see this movie. That I had read many a review and felt that it was an honor to 93's victims. I felt like I wanted to go and honor them at the same time.<br/><br/>And the part of the movie I did see, seemed to be done tastefully and honorably. There were some unbelievable parts such as the over-friendliness of the flight attendants. I fly a whole lot and I have never seen a flight attendant so animated and bright, much less a whole plane full of them.<br/><br/>I also must say that it was a little confusing as the switched back between the different control centers and towers. It seems to me a film maker could be a little more creative in giving his audience a obvious difference that showed which command was the FAA, New York, Boston, etc.<br/><br/>But for me, I am so upset that it was ruined by the motion sickness. I am not one who gets car sick, plane sick, boat sick, etc. So I am surprised. I have felt queasy in two other movies, the Blair Witch Project, and The Bourne Supremacy, but both of those I watched from beginning to end. This one I could not stay a minute longer, I was going to lose it.<br/><br/>I don't know how to find out about this before going to a movie, but I will do some research. I don't ever want to go to a movie done this way again."
"laker083234","10","8","17","28 April 2006"," The best movie so far this year and the most devastating movie this decade.
","This movie is not easy to sit through first and foremost. The same felling that overcame people who saw the Passion of the Christ could be felt here. The only thing different is that in the Passion of the Christ you felt manipulated into the feelings because of the blood and horror. This movie tells it like it was and you make your own feelings from the intense emotions on screen and in your self. <br/><br/>The movie is made with great respect towards all those connected to that day. There is absolutely no exploitation going on and the movie has the respect not to offer any personal commentary on politics into it. United 93 chronicles the time that the flight was boarded to the tragic end. The movie cuts from the United flight to different Air Traffic Control centers and to the military control. Some of the high officials where kind enough to play them selves in the movie. There is no real star power which really helps make the movie feel even more realistic. You can tell while watching the film that the creators really took there time to fact-check many details to present it with much fascination info from behind the scenes. As I watched the film I could hear the sniffles, sobs, and other sad noises from the audience. The thing that amazed me is that no one in the theater left, nor did they make much noise in what I feel was much respect for the film and subject.<br/><br/>If this film were released last year I would make the argument that it could have walked off with the Best Picture Oscar. While the events in the film were not that long ago and some might say that it is to soon, to that I say this film pays great honor to all those involved with that horrifying day and will inform more upon the tragic flight and the people behind the scenes trying to figure out what was going on. The movie is a heart breaking docudrama that with the up most responsibility accomplished a great feat in the history of film.<br/><br/>(This movie covers September 11th through the air, look for Oliver Stones ""World Trade Center"" movie in August that will tell the story of two police men from inside the World Trade Center ruble.)"

","Trying not to give out spoilers for this is hard, seeing that if there isn't one person in America that doesn't know at least 60% of the events that happened that day you must have been either drunk or stoned.<br/><br/>You know the inevitable fate of the people on flight 93.<br/><br/>They crash and die.<br/><br/>But the story must be told. There is no time right or wrong because it is timeless.<br/><br/>Have you ever sat down and listened to Ravels symphony Bolero? It starts out with only a whisper of a snare tapping and some cello's laying the foundation by giving you a structured baseline and a key we would call major. At first, there is nothing but base and snare. Then a flute floats through the air with the beginning of the melody. It modulates and takes you into a minor key. Slowly Bolero builds, adding other instruments as it goes along. Each instrument then joins the background as others take the melody. They become harmonies. Then they get loud. By the end, you don't remember so much how it starts, but you are startled when the final crescendo is played and all is quiet again.<br/><br/>At that point you are allowed to breath. Slowly your emotions become your own. Most of us know how everything ended, but how this thing built up inside the few hours that it did makes you stop breathing; stop thinking; stop responding until the crescendo is over.<br/><br/>The theater was void of sound. Not even the people sitting next to me were breathing. Just enough time goes by to remind you that you need to breathe. Some comments are displayed on the screen. I didn't hear the person next to me breath, but I heard the first tear well up in his eye and a brief rustling of cotton from a sleeve in motion. The person on my left slowly expelled a breath, then choked back a sob. The lights came up, and people started moving. Quietly: As if in a wake.<br/><br/>If this film set out to honor the dead, it did so in one of the most deftly defined presentation I have yet to re-experience. I felt no political agenda. I felt numb. A numbness that continued till I was half way home, then I too fell apart."

This film opens up old wounds and creates new ones. How could this possibly happen? Why didn't people move faster? Where in God's name was Bush? Why them? Why us? You are put on the doomed plane with forty extraordinary ladies and gentleman. You are so proud when this film is over and not to be an American but to be a part of the human race. At mankind's peek of expiration the spirit becomes alive and is evident in actions and words. I try not to look at this subjectively. Living so close to New York City and witnessing the attacks happen right in front of your eyes does make this experience that much harder. I will agree with a lot of people and say this might have been too soon to start giving the different perspectives on the attacks but it's been made and we have to deal with it. This is a film that you really don't want to see that you should see. Paul Greengrass took a huge risk on making this film and he does the passengers, the families, and the rest of mankind justice.<br/><br/>The most hurtful thing of this process wasn't the actual things in the film taking place but the mystery that is left afterwards. We will never know in this world and lifetime what happened on that plane, we will never know what it felt like to be on that plane or to be the loved one of a person being called by someone on that plane, but we do know that if you are reading this review right now than you are alive and that is a blessing in its own.<br/><br/>There are no performances that stick out unless you give it to all the passengers as an ensemble. (hint: Screen Actors Guild) I'm not sure if this could make it to the ceremony. I on one hand loved the film for its brutal honesty and hate it because it's a constant reminder of evil. I will probably never see this film again, I'll own it on DVD just because I'm a freak like that but living through that day over and over again is just something I don't want to do. Possible nominations for Picture, Director, Screenplay, and the technical categories. If our Academy is touched as I am by this film they will want to reward it with at least a nomination otherwise it will play as another ""Passion of the Christ."" Touches the hearts of people yet will stir up the controversy.<br/><br/>Your eyes will dry out, you'll feel the sense of redemption, you'll pray to everything higher than you that Paul Greengrass will make a different ending even though we all know how it ends. You want these people to live, you want peace, you want happiness, you want the love of the father to come down and prevent the tragedy from occurring but that doesn't happen. What we are left with is a tortured heart and pain stricken soul that will always wonder why the beauty of mankind is shown in the unknown?

","I went into this movie not knowing much about it except that it was about the plane that didn't hit a target. I hadn't seen any trailers or anything. I was expecting that it would be more of a blockbuster type film. I was quite wrong. United 93 was a truly amazing and scary experience.<br/><br/>I had always found it awful of course watching documentaries on 9/11, but never really scared. Probably because I live in New Zealand. But watching this as if you are actually in the plane was frightening. I was not scared in the build up of the event, even though you see the terrorists looking nervous etc, but as soon as they started shouting and stabbing innocent people I became quite frightened. <br/><br/>The cast did an excellent job. It was awful to see the look of fear on the people's faces when they knew they were going to die, or how nervous they were at fighting back at the hijackers. The actors who played the terrorists were amazing as well. You hate them even more since they have a face, but are of course extremely scared of them too.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass did a terrific job on this movie. Amazing and scary, United 93 reinforces how awful the 9/11 attacks were."
"james_norman1981","9","4","7","29 June 2006"," At times almost too horrifying to watch but definitely worth seeing
","As far as I understand it, this is the first 'proper' movie about September the 11th 2001, and boy is it emotive. British director Paul Greengrass, who is no stranger to controversial, intensely real films (such as Bloody Sunday), has fashioned an incredible cinematic experience that is almost more powerful because of our knowledge of how events on the day unfolded.<br/><br/>As I'm sure I need remind no one, 11/09/01 (UK date) was when four flights within the US were hijacked almost simultaneously. As air traffic controllers, military representatives, politicians and the public looked on helplessly, three of those planes flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre of New York and one wing of the Pentagon. A fourth plane, United 93, crashed in Pennsylvania. This film is about that fourth aircraft.<br/><br/>What this movie shows so horrifyingly well is the complete chaos the hijackings caused. As soon as the first aircraft stopped responding to hails from ground control after a garbled message about 'We have the planes,' hijacking was instantly suspected and the powers that be informed. But no one knew what protocol to implement, no one was sure who was responsible for what and, most definitely, no one in the loop suspected that the planes might be used as weapons in their own right...<br/><br/>This oversight, an oversight as the possibility of hijacked commercial aircraft being used as missiles had been considered by US military strategists, meant that it wasn't even possible to deploy fighter jets to defend America from this new, horrendous threat. Even if the fighters had been in place the President was out of contact and only he was regarded as sufficiently senior to give the order to shoot down civilian aircraft. As the film goes on to tell us, in a text epilogue, by the time any orders on the rules of engagement had been set the four planes were already crashed.<br/><br/>However, it is unfair to blame Bush for this disaster, not least because it would have taken an astronomical degree of recklessness to OK a shoot-to-kill policy on all potentially hijacked aircraft. The President cannot be faulted for being unaware of the impending crisis and, from the perspective of this film, it seems that the blame (other than for the terrorists and their masters) such as it is, lies with the intelligence services, but they don't warrant a single mention throughout. No one else had considered the possibility of hijacking with any seriousness because, in fairness, the last hijack on US soil had been ages beforehand (most hijackers wanting to get into the country, rather than out of it) and, with several thousand planes in the air at any one moment (the sheer volume of traffic mentioned is staggering) the people responsible for air traffic control had to concentrate on other aspects rather than potential terrorism. <br/><br/>Instead we follow the ordinary men and women on the ground and in the air... determining that multiple hijackings may be underway, trying to find out what to do in the situation, only to lose sight of the planes when, to the utter shock of all concerned, it turns out they've flown into the twin towers. Perhaps the most harrowing moment is when the second plane, picked up visually by the New York air traffic controllers, is seen to fly straight into the second tower. All the emotions and memories of September 11th itself are brought bubbling back to the surface, though not because of insincere sensationalism.<br/><br/>Instead this film eschews cheap theatrics. The ground staffs are not instantly capable of dealing with the crisis, the plane crew do not battle the hijackers like true American heroes (even though they were forewarned of the potential for hijackings), nor do the passengers stand up as one to fight the terrorists... instead we get a far more harrowing perspective: reality. It is only when the passengers realise the terrorists are flying the plane, the pilots are dead and, with surreptitious calls to their loved ones on the ground, that the hijackers are most likely intending to crash the aircraft into an American city, that they take action. There is no 'Let's roll!' moment of patriotic heart thumping, instead it's much more of a 'If we don't move now we won't move at all so let's roll...' In this the film is intensely real and intensely good, with the few moments of heroism being reduced to the likes of a woman giving her phone to another passenger after making a final call to loved ones (this touched me almost to the point of tears), or the people risking incurring the terrorists' wrath (and the potential detonation of what looks like a bomb around one of the hijacker's neck) so that they can meet in the rear and form a strategy to be diffused to the other passengers via a horribly fallible version of Chinese whispers.<br/><br/>The acting, by unknowns or the people who were there on the ground playing themselves, is universally fitting and good. Even the terrorists are three dimensional characters, not inhuman monsters. Similarly there are no attempts to glorify or degrade anyone, not even the easy target of the President or the CIA. Instead we get a simple film about an appallingly simple story: how four sets of men bluffed their way into control of four different planes and martyred themselves to a cause that most likely has already forgotten their names, if not their actions. Whether this is 'good' in terms of film making or morality (the 'should this movie have been made?' debate) is now a moot points. It has been made and should now be watched by everyone who thinks they know everything about Islam, martyrdom and September the 11th. United 93 is not glamorous or exploitative. It is merely a horrifying and objective look at one of the worst days in mankind's recent history."
"Littlewing2084","9","4","7","14 June 2006"," A unique experience
","This is only the second review I have written on this site and for good reason, I haven't felt strongly enough about the majority of films in recent months (strong enough one way or the other). It was only after watching An American Haunting that I registered with IMDb as i felt it my duty to tell the world how breath takingly awful it was! In fact, it was so bad it almost knocked D-Tox of the top of my list of worse films ever made. Thankfully, I find myself returning to the key board... and IMDb to tell you that YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should watch this film to be entertained because that certainly isn't the feeling i had when watching it. To be honest I was nervous and anxious throughout the film, my palms were sweating, an occasional tear would swell in my eye and found it hard to watch in places. I was going through a whole spectrum of emotions that I haven't experienced through film since my first viewing of E.T when I was six years old, but this time there was no orchestra guiding me through the scenes, no patriotic cigar chomping heroes saluting the star spangled banner, no slow motion action and thank god not an a-list celeb in sight.<br/><br/>I believe this is as close to real film has ever come. You get a true sense of 'this is how things were'. It's obvious to point out that it has been shot in a documentary style to put you in the centre of the story and involve the audience in the 'action' but never before has it worked with such a degree of success. I felt emotional because for that 90 minutes I was in the plane and just like the passengers I felt there was a chance we'd make it right up to the point the plane crashes (which of course is ridiculous but never the less true).<br/><br/>The film triumphs in avoiding all the usual Hollywood b****cks. No Political agendas or meaning are attached to the film, just objective viewing (true fly-on-the-wall style).<br/><br/>A lot of people are going to hate the film because they feel studios are capitalising on such a terrible tragedy but I can't see that in this film. It hasn't been made to turn a huge profit but to show the world what happened without bias and it does this very well.<br/><br/>I said in the summary that this is a unique experience, by this I mean that never before have I been so compelled to watch something I didn't feel comfortable watching or wasn't entertained by. It is so hard to describe exactly what the feeling is you get from the film so I think it is important that you see for yourself. Don't be put off seeing it because you don't want to contribute to the studios money pot, this has to be viewed in a cinema. I challenge anyone not to be totally gripped. <br/><br/>9/11 is fresh in everyones minds and maybe thats why there's such an up roar but personally I think it has been timed perfectly. Yes it is going to open the flood gates to countless, tasteless copies but I urge you not to bundle this one into that category. You're going to be hard pushed to ever find a film so tastefully done on this subject."

","Make no mistake about it this film is hard to watch, bringing out many painful, heart wrenching emotions, sadness, anger, discomfort but it is a film that had to be made and I am glad that the film makers had the courage to go ahead with this project. This is something we should never forget. This is history and a defining moment in the history of humanity on this planet. Neither the event or our sense of fear and outrage should be forgotten or brushed under the carpet.<br/><br/>This film tells it as it happened in real time. Outlining what the main points that are known about the day in as much as can possibly known. So many ""true Stories"" take artistic license to make the film more entertaining but this film does not try to be entertaining or exciting it tries to show us what happened and to make it as real as possible for the viewer. I really felt like I was there and that is partly because this was a really well made movie and because most of us that watch this movie where there in a sense back sept 11 2001. We all watched CNN and saw with horror and disbelief the plane crashes and the devastation they caused and we still deep inside ourselves feel the pain and hurt."
"ElizabethCoral","10","4","7","4 June 2006"," Sad but Inspiring...
","I saw United 93 yesterday, and it affected me so deeply that I was awake most of the night thinking about it. It is a long, long time since I have been so moved by a film.<br/><br/>United 93 is the sad but inspiring account of the actions of a group of passengers on a hijacked jet on September 11, 2001. The director, Paul Greengrass, uses shaky, hand-held cameras which make us feel as if we are at the centre of the action. The cinematography is outstanding. As one might expect, the film is terribly sad...one scene in particular got to me...as United 93 is taking off from Newark Airport, the Captain remarks what a beautiful day it is...we then see the plane fly past the World Trade Centre, against a backdrop of a cloudless blue sky. And it was a beautiful day, before tragedy struck...<br/><br/>The acting by the completely unknown cast is superb. Many of the air traffic control staff play themselves and I was particularly impressed by Ben Sliney. Yes, there are violent scenes and it is upsetting to see that plane hit the WTC's South Tower. But this is a story that should be told. The heroism of the passengers and crew of United 93 should not be forgotten.<br/><br/>Although there is no happy ending here, I left the cinema feeling that those 40 people did not die in vain...their actions quite possibly saved the lives of hundreds of people in Washington. The film leaves you in no doubt that these people were heroes.<br/><br/>I really hope that United 93 wins Best Picture at next year's Oscars. It deserves to. It is a fitting tribute to all those who died on that terrible day."
"moutonbear25","9","4","7","31 May 2006"," A Difficult Flight
","UNITED 93 Written and Directed by Paul Greengrass<br/><br/>It was a morning that started like every other but ended unlike any other. While some made their way to work, others made their way to their couch, both with coffee in hand. Others still scurried about the Newark airport, carrying the same coffees and carrying on about everything and nothing on their cell phones. Everyone was so busy pretending their lives were so important, that their problems were so serious, that it mattered whether or not you got CC'd on that memo, that they didn't see it coming. Amidst the windstorm of excess, greed and selfishness, a hatred had been brewing and was about to boil over. Paul Greengrass' UNITED 93 tries to pinpoint exactly when that happened by taking the fateful morning of September 11, 2001, and placing it under a microscope. The experiment's results are intense, emotional and life affirming. And with a few years worth of distance between that morning and now, we can look back and begin to ask why instead of just how.<br/><br/>It must have been a daunting task to write this film and then find the bravery to make it. Greengrass must have known how hesitant people would be to see this film and how disturbing it would be for those who did. He must have also known the risks he could run by sensationalizing the hijackings or trivializing the last moments of the real lives his actors were reenacting. Why else would he choose to cast no household name actors? Why would he choose to keep the actors cast to portray the four terrorists, who violently took over United Airlines Flight 93 with the goal of flying it directly into the White House, separate from the actors portraying the passengers or flight crew throughout shooting? Why else would he have spoken extensively with the victims families to perfect details like what they were wearing that day or what they may have been listening to on their Walkman? He must have wanted to be as true to reality as possible, to respect and Honor the hardship and tragedy the passengers on Flight 93 endured as well as the devastating impact the combined day's events had on the country as a whole. By not casting easily recognizable actors, the average viewer has an easier time connecting with the average looking face on the screen. By keeping his actors separate during the shoot and it's off hours, Greengrass set out to reinforce the distance between the groups and make the alienation of the terrorists palpable. And finally, by paying attention to character details, he exhibits a strong respect for the dead and deep sympathy for the bereaved. And though we may learn very little about the people on board, the little we do learn is hard enough to deal with as they accept their fates. <br/><br/>UNITED 93 is a tribute to the pain and sorrow that engulfed that particular Tuesday. Greengrass has crafted a unique interaction that transports the viewer back to that day, to that head space and proceeds to offer a healing of the mind and soul that can only come by facing the darkness you've ran from. He does not presume what might have been going through the terrorists minds while they executed their attack, choosing instead to simply show them as determined but scared, like any human being would be. He does not claim to know why they attacked the United States but merely shows them as lost amidst an inundation of consumerism and meaninglessness, allowing for the viewers to speculate and ultimately decide for themselves. He does not insinuate that the American government took too long to acknowledge what was happening and react appropriately. Instead he shows the men and women of the army and traffic control as always one step behind, yet with an air of forgiveness because who wouldn't be in that situation? And perhaps most importantly, when it comes time to take back the control of Flight 93, Greengrass does not have the passengers fight back in the name of the U.S.A.; they fight back because they want to live, because they value life. <br/><br/>Understanding the events of September 11, 2001, took some people contextualizing them as scenes in a movie because only a good screenwriter could have devised such a sinister and horrifying plot. Thinking of it in terms of a movie, in terms we can perhaps more easily understand, also highlights the anticipation that the credits would soon role, the lights would rise and we could walk out and move on with our normal lives. It has been nearly five years and normalcy has prevailed for the most part. Still, walking out of UNITED 93, I left behind more than just the rolling credits and the rising lights; I left behind some leftover heaviness in my heart I didn't know I was still carrying."
"MichaelMargetis","9","4","7","8 May 2006"," Shockingly Powerful, The Most Important Film of the Year
","You could ask almost any American living in the United States in 2001 where they were when that first plane hit the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001. Sadly, I was sleeping at the time, but many of my family members endured the hardship and shock of seeing that second plane smash into the other tower of the World Trade Center, and the tower itself fall to the ground. It was an absolutely harrowing period in time that pretty much everyone sadly remembers. The planes that got the most coverage were the ones that crashed into the World Trade Center, but the plane that didn't get as much coverage was Flight United Airlines 93, which harbored a few outstanding Americans who over-threw terrorist plans to crash the 747 into the White House. 'United 93' the spectacular emotionally-charged drama chronicles an estimation a about what really went on-board.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, the Irish writer/director of the film who was behind such films as Bloody Sunday and the Bourne Supremacy, does a magnificent job crafting this heart-wrenching tale. The graininess of the film and the shaky motions of the camera does a perfect job slowly building the tension of the film. 'United 93' is Paul Greengrass' masterpiece, and if there is any justice in the film industry Greengrass will be rewarded with the coveted 'Best Director' Oscar nomination when the Academy Award Nominations for 2006 are announced next January. The acting of 'United 93' is as solid as it can be, with unknown actors turning in accomplished performances that are just as good as what the big-name Hollywood actors would normally offer. I actually admire the fact the production company didn't cast any known actors in this film or have a well known filmmaker direct it, so it could avoid senseless labels of 'the Harrison Ford movie' or 'the Steven Spielberg movie', and be known as 'The 9/11 Flight 93 movie'. <br/><br/>'United 93' succeeds on so many different levels other than acting, writing and directing. I highly commend the film on being so unbiased in everything, the film doesn't discredit the U.S. on this situation and they also don't show the terrorists as senseless monsters who eat little children, so to speak. The people on the flight are shown as real human beings that are flawed, frightened and confused, and the terrorists are shown as frightened and truly believing what they are doing is righteous. 'United 93' resists the Hollywood temptation to point the finger of blame at someone or some group, and just shows an almost documentary-like illustration of the tragic and catastrophic events that took place on that cold September day. Although 'United 93' is flawed in some areas, like starting out a little slow and running on a little long, it has a tremendous amount of heart and provokes such strong emotion from the viewer. We as an audience feel every single bit of pain, fear and hysteria not only the passengers feel, but the terrorists feel as well. Any film that can do that is without question pure genius. <br/><br/>There has been a lot of debate and talk about this film, some people saying it has come out too soon and it's inappropriate. I personally believe it's not. It's a wake-up call to America, to those who just want to forget about how many Americans lost their lives this day. The biggest way to get the attention of the American public is through film, and I think this might have been one of the reasons why 'United 93' was made. Like a rusty fishing knife covered in salt thrusted through your gut, 'United 93' screams 'don't you dare forget what happened on this day, and don't you dare forget why we are in this war."" This message might not come across to everyone, but it does to me. Whether you are more conservative or liberal, I think this film is required viewing for any red-blooded American. It's a film of extraordinary power and passion. It's the best film of the year so far, and you can expect it to be on my top 10 film list of 2006 come December. Do not pass up the chance to see 'United 93' which may prove to be one of the most pre-eminent motion pictures of our generation. Grade: A- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 4/23/06)"
"druss44121-1","8","4","7","2 May 2006"," This is a hard film to review.
","Before seeing United 93, I had many doubts. Natural questions arise when discussing the first Hollywood recreation of 9/11.<br/><br/>Should this have been made? What can be taken from it? Will it just be an offensive or heartless manipulation of a real tragedy? There is little doubt that simply as a film, United 93 is well made. It is expertly paced, it is involving and it captures the chaos of that Tuesday morning.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass uses mainly hand-held cameras, giving a similar ""you are there"" feel as his last film, the hit sequel The Bourne Supremacy. Random bouncing around is toned down a bit, though, so if you got sea-sick during Bourne you can rest a little easier here.<br/><br/>Most of the running time is spent either on flight 93, which was the fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, or around various air control or military rooms. Nothing is shown from Ground Zero.<br/><br/>Greengrass walks a very tight rope, managing not to become exploitive while also not falling into extreme political correctness.<br/><br/>His film is brutal at points, but never gratuitous. The way the reactions of everyone in the film are portrayed helps to humanize them, since we all had similar responses on September 11th.<br/><br/>Even if a vivid back-story is not presented for each person, little distance is felt. Sometimes it is possible to relate through circumstance, and the fact that there are no marquee name stars helps the actors become their characters. Some of the officials in the control rooms actually play themselves, too.<br/><br/>This gives an authenticity to the film that is needed, especially since it comes so soon after the attacks.<br/><br/>Of course, following Fahrenheit 9/11 anything that remotely touches on controversial or political ideas is considered one-sided propaganda. Conspiracy theory nuts especially have used this to bring down United 93 and the people behind it.<br/><br/>However, any film or art form cannot truly be neutral, and this is a good thing. It is why  as filmgoers  we should use our own intelligence and rationality, never only taking what we see on screen as gospel. Art should make us question rather than blindly accept.<br/><br/>With this said, here is a film that is constructed with passion and care, attempting to recreate an experience rather than further an agenda.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the terrorists is perhaps the hardest challenge. Their evil is not overemphasized. The film opens with them praying, and it gives a glimpse into their fanatical religious beliefs that lead them to believe murdering thousands of Americans is a solution for anything.<br/><br/>This makes the tragedy all the more palatable, since we are not watching inhuman monstrosities rampaging, but rather people doing horrible things to other people.<br/><br/>This inherent tragedy helps to make the heroism at the end seem true, rather than forced and sentimental. United 93 shows, without preaching, the way people can bind together to kill each other, and also bind together to do the opposite.<br/><br/>Still, not everything about United 93 works.<br/><br/>One scene involving a passenger who wants to acquiesce to all the terrorists' commands is overdone, and it feels like a fake Hollywood invention.<br/><br/>The amount of text after the harrowing end  which eerily reveals death as well as cinema can  is somewhat distancing. It would have been better and more effective if there wasn't an immediate bombardment of historical facts we already know.<br/><br/>In the end, United 93's greatest strength is its greatest weakness. The fact that it has no political ambitions or fiery declarations lets the emotion of what it shows seem fresh, real, and genuine.<br/><br/>The confusion, fear, and unification that came from these attacks are perfectly captured, although little is said that is groundbreaking or philosophically revolutionary.<br/><br/>""Why"" is not as important as ""what."" United 93 is ultimately a reminder.<br/><br/>While remembering an event that happened less than five years ago might seem superfluous, this is not so much a reminder of the physical, actual event which is impossible to forget, but of the emotions that arose that day and what was created from these emotions.<br/><br/>9/11 has become a punch line for politicians, the memories we all carry abused and torn apart by vehement partisan anger.<br/><br/>The title might seem cheesy but it signifies the central theme that runs throughout this tragic but heroic tale.<br/><br/>For all that was destroyed in the attacks, something was gained. America found a new connection, a connection that went beyond conspiracy theories or liberal/conservative politics.<br/><br/>The fact that United 93 captures this connection at all is proof that, despite any flaws, it is not too soon for this film, and that its greatest message is not delivered in a long-winded monologue but discovered in the emotions simmering right until the end.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Not necessarily an easy film to sit through, United 93 comes at the right time. Unlikely to find a large audience now, those willing to give it a chance might be surprised at the emotions it carefully exposes."

","UNITED 93 (2006) **** Filmmaker Paul Greengrass' respectful and sharply observed look at the doomed flight United 93 on 9/11 that fought back to their tragic hijacking by Islamic terrorists is the first major motion picture depicting that terrible historical event that forever changed the world. Wisely employing his docudrama vision (Greengrass got his start as a documentary filmmaker) and casting real-life representative witnesses to the terror unfolding (including FAA honcho Ben Sliney playing himself) depicts the chain-of-events in near real-time from the moment of on boarding at Newark International Airport to the realization that a plot of evil was slowly coming to fruition to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and ultimately to the hour of fate at hand. Assuredly non-exploitative and arguably professionally handled (with the blessings of the victims' families) the film stands as a true testament to the heroic actions by innocent ordinary people in truly dire extraordinary circumstances. One of the year's best and a must see."

","Paul Greengrass has taken the all-too-familiar events of 9/11 and has created an emotionally charged human drama that will virtually wring you out with emotion and yet not stoop to sensational melodramatics.<br/><br/>He made the decision to use unknown actors, many of whom were actual workers in their profession to tell a documentary-like, non judgmental story of how that fateful day went down. The amazing thing is how he is able to use these people to pull you into the story even though you know the eventual outcome. You truly feel as if you are on the plane yourself and watching through your own eyes and not the lens of a camera.<br/><br/>For those that feel that this film is being done too soon after 9/11, I hope you see it before you make up your mind on that.

","There was no applause when the film ended, there was almost no sound at all except for a few audible sniffles. The power of the film, especially the last 8 minutes, kept most of the people rooted in their seats through most of the credits. I think the only reason I wasn't crying at the end is because I was with a friend and no way am I'm going to lose it in front of a guy friend unless he loses it first. He felt the same which kept us both just barely on this side of sobbing. The movie takes its time, setting the day up, the bulk of the 9/11 hijackings are seen through the screens of the ATC, except of course for the United 93 hijacking. Seeing the news footage of the planes hitting the tower did not have much of an effect on me, I saw them 4.5 years ago and many times since then, so while they were well used here, that was not the part that really affects you. It is when the passengers learn that the planes have hit, and that their plane will not be landing at any airport that the film truly grabs hold of you with a vice grip. They know they have to retake the plane, they call their families to say goodbye, and those of us watching cannot look away from Greengrass' powerful film. People say that it is too soon, but I felt that it wasn't soon enough. We forget about the people who died, the heroes, the innocents who did not have a chance to be heroes. 9/11 has grown distant to so many of us, it has just become something for us to be angry about, be it angry at the terrorists who did this, or at the administration who so readily used it to justify their own agendas. This is not a political film, it does not judge or comment on policy before or after that day. This is a human film, and an intensely moving one."

","The tale of events that occurred on that fateful September day in 2001, where 4 planes were hijacked and crashed, is a date that changed many and scarred many others. ""United 93"" is a gripping recollection of United Airlines Flight 93 - the sole plane out of the 4 hijacked that did not reach its target.<br/><br/>The film is very authentic; the camera never rests, the people on the ground at air traffic control are mostly those who actually were working at ATC on 9/11, and the use of lesser-known actors to depict the passengers really serves well to show that the people aboard Flight 93 were ordinary people leading regular lives, and not Navy SEALS or action movie stars. The film also takes place in real time, which adds to the realism.<br/><br/>The film is so accurate and realistic it plays almost like a documentary, going through each of the events of 9/11 very well. It also plays like a thriller, because of how intense the film is. It is also brutally violent, with realistic-looking wounds and attacks that would clearly resemble the way passengers would revolt in such a situation, using anything they could get their hands on.<br/><br/>Such a unique film has not been seen yet, and its down-to-earthliness and realism add to the experience. Being so realistic, the viewer definitely feels for the passengers, as they all start to realize just what kind of a situation they are in.

Essentially it is any one of those airborne disaster films with the exception being it was a real and not imagined disaster. The no-name cast is pretty unremarkable and the shoe string production values really show on the screen. The hand held camera work creates the proper sense of claustrophobia, but it is overused. We all know what the outcome was so its no use repeating it again . The producers of this dull and exploitative film claimed it was done to honor the memories of the 3,000 people who died on that day. The real fact was that they thought they were onto something good by being the first ones to exploit this tragedy for personal gain. Mercifully, it died at the box office, but it did go on to spawn Oliver Stone's equally abortive ""World Trade Center"" a few months later. Have we become so desentisized to the violence of the real world that we need to make movies to exploit them for profit? Like WTC, this is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either died or survived 911. I guess that anybody will do anything in the name of the almighty dollar, but when it comes down to an exploitation film like this, it is just plain despicable. Adding to the overall tedium are the pointless conversations from the control tower and the passengers on the doomed flight chattering away on their cell phones.- God forbid that somebody should be without one. The overall quality of this film resembles a hastily contrived ""tv movie"". Poor propaganda does not an engrossing film make. Absolute rubbish, this is not worth your time. So ""let's roll"" straight out of this movie.To say liberties were taken with the story is an understatement. How did the terrorists smuggle that bomb making equipment on board after the baggage search? Also, to call this film boring is to praise it to high heaven. It defines dull. It is about as exciting as watching paint dry or grass grow. Unfortunately, I had to endure it again as a class project. This time out the jerky motion of the hand held camera gave me a headache.I also tried to stay awake for it, but I did doze off. They were still in the control room when I awoke. I really don't want to get off on a tangent here, but, dear reader, I think you get the picture.Zero Stars."

","Never have I seen a movie like this. I was expecting it to be some Hollywood film...just to get profit... Every time I heard about it, I thought it to be insensitive, and a little too soon to put a movie like this out there.<br/><br/>I happen to work at a movie theater, so I cleaned the theater for this movie when it first came out, and I hadn't seen the movie yet. I walked in there just as the movie was ending to open the doors...it almost seemed like an empty theater. Never, have I walked into a movie theater so still and quiet. It was almost breathless. It startled me. I couldn't even imagine what the movie was like, and how brutal it was. All throughout the credits while I was cleaning the theater...there was one woman who remained in her seat..with her chin in her hands just staring at the screen. That moment alone changed my view on everything--and how real these events were. When they actually happened, I was too young to even understand what was going on....I just had upset teachers and parents......and I was confused.<br/><br/>So, eventually...I got up the courage to see the movie...I knew what was coming--but i wasn't ready. ...when you see the people calling they're family...just to say 'I love you' One last time--It hits you like a knife in the heart....to know that there were tons affected by this..... The fact that you couldn't recognize a single actor in the movie makes it even more real... I saw the movie with two of my close friends...I know a lot of people that refuse to see it... I'm glad I saw it, but I don't know if I want to see it again...<br/><br/>The movie just ends with a bang...and those subtitles came on.. 'No one survived'......... The room was completely and utterly silent---like no person even dare to move until the lights came back on... It was brutal, intense...and the scariest part, is that it's real.<br/><br/>A lot of my coworkers at the theater have talked to me about it.....Most of us cried like crazy during the movie.. When we usher theaters---we carry a box of Kleenex to the theater for anyone who needs it. The movie helped show me..that though it was a few years ago, people are still hurting and healing...and that this will always leave a mark, despite how much people try to avoid the topic....."

","United 93 is an excellent film about the crash of United Airlines flight 93.The unique thing about this film is that through its making the subtle lines between reality and fiction appear to have blurred. A viewer experiences the sensation of seeing the tragedy happen right before his/her eyes.United 93 is not a documentary film and cannot even be termed as a feature film.This is the reason why the narrative approach chosen by Paul Greengrass does not contain any components of these two genres of cinema.What we are able to see in this film is an accurate recollection in real time of the events that took place on that fateful day.By involving the relatives of the victims,this film's director Paul Greengrass has made a good attempt to be as close as possible to the reality.It can be surmised that they must have provided vital information about the mental state of their loved ones when they were stuck in that unlucky airplane.This is a film to watch as the inevitable tension has firm grip on viewers from the start right until the end of the film."
"sddavis63","10","5","10","10 June 2008"," A Fitting Tribute To The Passengers Of United 93
","I can remember sitting transfixed in front of the TV on September 11, 2001. It wasn't a morbid sort of fascination with the events of that day that was keeping me glued to the screen; it was more a sense of numbed paralysis and disbelief; a sort of ""how could this possibly be happening?"" type of experience. I found myself (as did most people I suspect) with a lot of questions coming to my mind. Watching this movie (as I first did shortly after it was released) was a way of dealing with two of those questions: how would the passengers on those planes have felt as they approached what they must have eventually realized was their end, and, second, when the inevitable movies are made, are they going to be respectful or exploitative. This movie helped with both of those questions.<br/><br/>This is - as the title says - essentially the story of United Airlines Flight 93, one of the hijacked planes on 9/11. I was pleased that the movie was made with the co-operation of the families of the passengers; pleased even that the DVD doesn't have previews of other movies, as so many do. There's no attempt to shill anything else here. The DVD just goes right into the story. It offers a powerful, emotional and completely respectful account of what might have happened on board that plane on that terrible day. United 93, of course, was the plane that didn't get to Washington. It took off late, which meant that the passengers knew through their cell phones what was happening to the hijacked planes. Knowing that they were probably going to die anyway, these passengers decided to fight back - and, along with New York City emergency workers, ended up as the great (and tragic) heroes of the day, managing to thwart the hijackers and crash the plane into an empty field in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Aside from the passengers, there were three other groups looked at. The first was the hijackers themselves. I thought their portrayal was interesting. The leader of the group seemed to be portrayed as having some moral qualms about this. They came across to me as fanatical, but not evil - which is probably an accurate depiction of their mindset. Then there were the air traffic control officers. Many of them (most importantly Ben Sliney, head of the National Air Traffic Control Centre) played themselves, and considering that they weren't actors, they did a magnificent job of recreating the tension and chaos of that day. Finally, there was the military, largely centred around a NORAD base in New York State. They were frustrated - they didn't have enough fighters to properly respond, some of the fighters they had weren't armed, and even if they were armed they didn't have authority to engage the hijacked planes - that order could only be given by the President, and they couldn't reach him.<br/><br/>This is a marvellous and touching way to honour the brave passengers of Flight 93, as well as all of those who lost their lives on a day that no one will ever forget. 10/10"
"Piafredux","10","5","10","7 September 2006"," Excellent
","First, my prayers go up for the passengers and the crew and their families who survived them - and for their hijackers. It's the hijackers for whom I feel the sorriest because people who are so twisted by hate need the sorrow more than do the innocents they mass-murdered. The hijackers came from their world of so little love and kindness to mass-murder innocents who came from their worlds of genuine love and kindness. The telling difference between the hate-twisted, nihilist hijackers and the heroic passengers and crew is that in their attempt to save themselves the passengers and crew succeeded in sparing the lives of God knows how many more innocents whom the hijackers, had they flown into their target, would have also mass-murdered.<br/><br/>'United 93' is the most harrowing film I've seen. Its makers relied as far as they possibly could on the documentary record of the event it depicts - on the facts, not on the paranoid, twisted, cynical, bigoted prejudices and predilections - and not on the cheap thrills and frisson of phony righteousness - of conspiracy theorists. Those facts include all that the makers could draw and glean from the tapes of the passengers' and crewmembers' in-flight telephone conversations and the background sounds they included.<br/><br/>Cinematically this is a seamlessly tight, masterly treatment of real-time docu-drama. Top notch in my book.<br/><br/>'United 93' ought to be shown, it ought to be required to be shown, in every American senior high school class. Now and forever."
"jeghaderperkersvin66","10","5","10","13 June 2006"," VERY important film
","As said this is an important film. It can help to finally debunk and destroy the dumb conspiracy-theories that have been circulating among the uneducated people. The most common conspiracy theory is that it was a missile that destroyed a part of the pentagon. The conspiracy theorists bases this on three claim: 1) That you could not see any part of the plane from the distance. 2) That the Air-defense of the pentagon. 3) That the jet must have been shot down by f-16's, but wasn't because Bush stopped it.<br/><br/>1) Conspiracy-theorists does not know physics: A plane that flew with such speed and velocity, would have been ripped to pieces and pressed into a small cylinder by the immense kinetic energy when it hit. People should study pictures of plane-crashes, but the conspiracy-theorists don't - because the want to believe in their fantasy-story about black-magic and missiles.<br/><br/>2) Well, this is a direct lie from the conspiracy-theorists: there have never been a air-defense at the pentagon, since the cold war was at its height. Plus it would be dumb to have it on alert or even there, when hundreds of helicopters fly to and from the pentagon every week. The Air-defense/SAM-sites where never there.<br/><br/>3) There are hundreds of jets in the air all the time, it is not possible to track them all. The conspiracy-theorists said that 67 jets where intercepted a few years ago: that is a lie, there was 67 scrambles, 1 was intercepted (not shot down, i mean). So they exaggerate all the time. There are only a few F-16's in the air all the time, they are over the sea, because the shall not come in the way of commercial jets. The conspiracy-theorists says that Norad deliberately did not do its job: that is dumb - NORAD was built to combat soviet bombers over Alaska, nothing more. Plus Norad was about to Close, because the cold war was over. <br/><br/>Plus: the Pentagon released pictures where you can see that it is a plane that hits the pentagon. The Magazine ""popular mechanics"" have debunked most of the lies posted by conspiracy-theorists such as Alex Jones. <br/><br/>So this movie is good: it shows the truth. Plus the director is a very good director. It is not too soon. I love this film."
"sarah_mclellan","10","5","10","11 June 2006"," A fascinating reconstruction of the day our world changed
","I have never been affected so much by a movie before this, Paul Greengrass has excelled himself in this powerful gut-wrenching reconstruction of the events of that fateful September day. I have read a letter to The Times (of London) from a Californian lady that it is in poor taste, I wonder if she has actually seen this yet, as I believe it has been made in the best possible taste. It is important to see the events in real time and to understand that nobody knew the full story of what was actually happening. Greengrass shows us the chaos on the ground, as one by one the four planes headed down their fated routes. Showing us a military, crippled by overcrowded skies, a lack of defined Rules of Engagement, fighter jets with no means of engaging the planes, and an inability to get hold of the President to get the order to shoot down any more hijacked flights. However the picture reminds us that we must remember that this was an entirely unforeseen situation to all on that day. The most harrowing scenes were on the plane itself, as the passengers realised that they were on a doomed flight, the valiant fight back is presented as it should have been, as the passengers battling to survive, to be able to see and hold loved ones again. All through the film (and especially in the last scenes) I found myself rooting for a different outcome (as many other subscribers to this site have done). The use of relative unknowns to portray the passengers and the casting of many of the actual ground staff is inspired, as it compels the viewer to concentrate on the events themselves. Finally, as someone who was in the air myself at the moment the attacks happened (I was on a Zurich to Douala (in Cameroon) flight at the time) I constantly referred back to what I was doing when this happened, watching the passengers board the planes, order food, relax with a book, just as I had done; except I was lucky to land safely. Seeing this movie makes me realise how fortunate I am."
"agmoldham","9","5","10","9 June 2006"," What would you have done
","I'm sure most people at least considered what they would have done had they have been on one of the planes on 9/11. This was especially the case with Flight 93, since due to a flight delay, they were aware of what their fate was going to be. Unlike the traditional MO of hijackers they weren't about to enter into negotiations. They were being used as a bomb to cause destruction on the ground.<br/><br/>I seem to remember at the time that the actions of the passengers on Flight 93 was considered as a selfless act to stop the destruction on the ground. The film portrays this very much as an attempt for survival and I suspect this is probably very close to what really happened. If you've got a 1 in thousand chance of surviving by storming the cockpit it's better than a certain death if you do nothing.<br/><br/>The film is tense and gripping and really tugs at the emotions. Surely one of the best films of this year, but be prepared for a depressing experience. If you like feel good movies steer well clear of this."
"dbborroughs","5","5","10","7 May 2006"," Its well made, but it left me feeling empty
","The story, as best as we can tell, of what happened on Flight 93 which crashed on September 11 2001 when the passengers attempted to fight back against the hijackers of the plane.<br/><br/>This is an extremely well made and well acted film. Its a film that pretty much puts you into the plane on 911. Its emotional and heart breaking. As a docudrama of what may have happened its a great film.<br/><br/>The problem for me was that I walked out of the film feeling extremely empty. Why have the film makers chosen to retell and re-speculate as to what exactly happened on the plane yet again? There have been the how many documentaries and at least one TV movie that covered the same ground. The film makers here have added nothing new except a big screen and big sound. The film essentially covers the moments before the flight and the flight itself and only puts the events in the confines of that narrow time period on that day, which for me added nothing new about anyone or anything. I stopped caring about twenty minutes in and simply braced myself for the body blows that were going to be coming.<br/><br/>I don't see the point of telling this story yet again. Actually the only reason for me is purely exploitive, its like those nasty made for TV movies about horrible tragedies that seem to be made just to make you watch and be upset. This isn't to say its a bad movie, its not, its just a completely unnecessary one since it doesn't add anything to what we know or have learned from the other versions of the story. What bothers me is that there have been so many re-tellings now that the effect or ""shock and awe"" is beginning to wear off. How many more will there be before we simply shrug and go ""oh thats nice"" dismissively? <br/><br/>I don't think I can really recommend this film to anyone other than those who don't know the story of what happened on 911. Granted that recommendation comes with a warning about the emotional pain this movie will probably cause you. If you've seen anything on this flight you may want to skip it, it will add nothing to what you already know, and it will only end up making you feel bad, something you can do on your own by thinking back to that fateful day."
"gregsrants","9","5","10","3 May 2006"," Heroes all
","Is it too soon? Are we ready? Am I ready? These three questions have been asked in just about every media outlet on the crest of the new 9/11 film release, United 93. Whether, you, I, or the world is ready to relive in graphic detail the events that unfolded on September 11th is up each individual, but whether you find yourself standing in line at a movie theatre, renting the DVD this fall or avoiding it altogether, nothing will take away from the fact that United 93 is a fantastic film that leaves you breathless and shows the world more heroes than just those that were onboard the fateful flight.<br/><br/>United 93 is directed by Paul Greengrass, who is no stranger to fact based-documentary type shot films. In 2002, Greengrass filmed Bloody Sunday which was a dramatization of the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops on January 30, 1972. Bloody Sunday was one of the best reviewed films of the year and ended up on many (including yours truly), Best Of lists when the year was recapped.<br/><br/>Based on this previous outing of success, Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct United 93 (note that the studio did not 'choose' him but rather, he pitched it to the executives).<br/><br/>United 93 tells the story of the fourth airplane to be used in the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The story of that plane came to us slowly while we were still digesting the horrors of the attacks on New York. As it was recounted through phone recordings and conversations between the passengers in the air and their loved ones of the ground, the plane was taken over by terrorists with the expected goal of using the flying tube as a weapon, quite possibly flying the plane into the Nation's Capital.<br/><br/>As family and friends spoke to those on United 93, the passengers began to hear of the stories of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and they knew that the intention of the terrorists was to martyr themselves, taking the passengers and crew with them.<br/><br/>The passengers fought back. And their mark in history was recorded.<br/><br/>United 93 does a spectacular job of keeping us on the edge of our seats even as we know how the film will eventually unfold. Greengrass does this by spending much of the time with the stories that we weren't completely aware about. The stories about the ground controllers, the FAA staff and the army all grappling with the unfolding events and determining the next course of action. We relive the events as they lived them  on the front line of events that changed forever the world to which we live.<br/><br/>We learn amongst the chaos that the army had difficulty getting authorization to scramble fighter jets and that those that did eventually make it airborne were unarmed and headed in the wrong direction. We learn that those on the ground in command centres were ill prepared for the events and had problems with communication both internally (trying to determine if there were other flights hijacked at the time) and externally (trying to get an open communication channel to the army). We learn that one man  on his first day on the job  made the executive decision to ground all planes in lieu of any government intervention.<br/><br/>United 93 tells these stories while jumping back and forth to the passengers aboard the plane and we watch as they learn and accept their fate and then react in a manner that would thwart the hijackers intentions as the plane flew into an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>United 93 is an emotional punch to the stomach and a jaw dropper to boot. I sat amazed as these people figured things out based on limited intelligence and made decisions of universal impact. All this occurring while I stood dumbfounded in front of an office computer watching streamlined video of the event almost five years ago. I was reacting when then were acting. Heroes all.<br/><br/>You will leave United 93 exhausted, and during water cooler discussions that follow you will not be able to remember a characters name or backstory. That is because their isn't any. Greengrass doesn't follow the typical rules of an event film and keeps to the real time facts - not singling out any one person or institution, but telling the story of how the group of heroes both on the ground and in the air forever etched a mark in our long term memory.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"melv3845","10","5","10","1 May 2006"," Well done. A justice to the victims and their families.
","Greengrass spent much time with the families of the victims of Flight 93. They wanted this story to be available to the public and expressed their approval of the film. It is a fitting memorial to those who had to die that others might live. I loved that it was completely devoid of politics--no snide asides. It merely showed the horror of that day in the history of our beloved country. Because there were no Hollywood stars, I was not distracted from the story. That was the reason for the film: to simply and in real time tell the painful story. I felt I was on that plane, deciding what I would do when I realized it was headed for a target. Whether or not I acted would not change my fate. The film showed how quickly many things I value become trivia. It showed that life is so precious and I must spend it well with those I care about."

","Where was I on September 11, 2001? Where was I as America was under attack? I was sleeping. I got a frantic call from my big sister, and when I turned on the TV to see what happened all I got was static. I lived eight miles away from ground zero and I felt cut off from the world. As I finally found a channel on the TV that worked I saw the Twin Towers fall on live. I didn't hear any explosions, I just saw a picture of two giant buildings falling. I saw smoke rise as I drove to work later that afternoon. The world had forever changed, but except for the pictures of anguish and shots of buildings falling down I heard no explosive sounds from my vantage point. Do you remember a sound? Except if you were in lower Manhattan probably not.<br/><br/>UNITED 93 is a film about an isolated moment in the middle of extreme chaos. It's about mundane people living their mundane lives thrust into the most horrifying event in modern history. It's a film about what a true hero is. It's about evil men whose true cowardice united ordinary people. But on a deeper level it's a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound.<br/><br/>On September 11th 2001, four planes were hijacked. Two hit the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon. The last plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. That plane was UNITED 93, to some it could have looked like a footnote to that horrible day. But it became a symbol, because ordinary men and women took back the plane and gave their lives to save lives on the ground. Greenglass puts us right in the middle of this life and death drama. We meet the hijackers, we meet the flight crew, and we meet the passengers. We don't get to know them, but in real life do you really know who's sitting next to you? The film watches as people get ready for takeoff, as tower officials look at the skies on computer monitors. We check in with the FAA, the military, and we see that on September 11th life was pretty normal. Then we watch helplessly as every one of these people is thrown into a tailspin when a plane disappears off a computer monitor. We watch as a tiny green blip just disappears. That flight hit the North Tower and it had just begun.<br/><br/>What Greenglass wisely does is not focus on the carnage. We don't even see the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and when the second one finally does there is not a big explosion. We see it on a TV, with the CNN ticker tape moving slowly by. We see smoke, but we see no carnage. Only Silence. In a more conventional film we would probably see every explosion, but even as United 93 hits the ground we hear nothing, only silence. Because for the most part things only blow up in the movies.<br/><br/>This device works well. It makes UNITED 93 feel real. The people feel real. The action feels real. I liken it to watching a home movie. United 93 is so simple and effective I almost looked for the time and date stamps in the corner of the screen. It's natural and raw. That's why it is so effective and that's why it needed to be made now.<br/><br/>September 11th's history is still being written. As we get further and further from it a romantic version of these events will begin to unfold. You want proof check out a World War II film made in the 40's and compare it to PEARL HARBOR. UNITED 93 is a film that's effectiveness will be felt 50 years from now when that generations Michael Bay decides to make a silly film about a girl and a guy who find love on the 65 floor of the trade center as they fall. But in the here and now UNITED 93 will stand as a record of Hero's who saved the day, of the confusion that overtook us all, and of the raw power of real life."

","I am a United States Naval Sailor. So the views that I am about to portray might be one sided, but I will honestly give you a view from my perspective. I have been to Iraq twice now since the events of 9/11 and this movie really made me think.<br/><br/>My first emotion when i was through viewing this film was rage. I was upset at everyone. I was mad of course at the terrorist and the length they would go to strike fear into us. But i was also enraged with the readiness of the USAF. They somehow were not able to send an effective strike group at these planes until it was all too late. I was upset at the timely matter it took for them to get clearance from the President. I'm not as mad at the president as i am with our system. Somehow, in this most timely hour, they were unable to get hold of him. You would think that the chain of command in our US of A would be strong enough and trained enough to be able to get the info to and from where they needed it. But somehow, this could not be accomplished.<br/><br/>The movie itself kept me quiet the whole time. I really began to think they were gonna be able to overcome the obstacles, even knowing the final outcome. And the people calling their love ones actually brought a tear to my eyes.<br/><br/>Was America ready for a 9/11 movie? I don't know. But I can fully tell you, that this movie was not Hollywood. There's no love scene, or special character that makes you focus on there situation. Its almost a dramatization of a documentary.<br/><br/>The actors who are not big name, did a fabulous job of making me believe they were just ordinary people, and nothing special.<br/><br/>Bravo Zula to United 93"
"gala0008","10","5","10","29 April 2006"," Reliving the terror... Remembering those lost...
","I just got back from seeing this movie and I have to say it was much better than I expected it to be (and I entered with high hopes to begin with). Despite being made up of unknown and some first-time actors, the emotion and depth of the fear and desperation is captured perfectly. Be it in the airplane, control room, or military headquarters, every minute of the film is believable.<br/><br/>It begins as just a normal Tuesday, no different from the day week or month before. Passengers arrive to their plane and board, the only fears in their minds being of possible engine trouble. We then see the chaos on the ground as both twin towers are hit and two more suspected high-jacked planes are discovered. As the passengers slowly realize their fate, they begin that last fight for survival. Even though the conclusion of the movie is obvious, there were times when I found myself believing they could make it out of the plane alive (such as when they discovered a pilot amongst the passengers). The movie ends when the flight ends, followed by a few facts about delayed orders and intelligence.<br/><br/>A strange thing about the movie is that you begin to feel sympathy for everyone on the plane. It was heartbreaking watching the passengers call their loved ones for the last time, and one has to think what making a call like that to their own family would be like. The viewer even finds them self sympathizing with the terrorists at times. One of them seems to want to abort the mission at the beginning due to the loved one he is leaving behind. Most of the time, however the viewer finds them self wishing the most gruesome death imaginable upon them.<br/><br/>I have read the some of the bad reviews people posted on this site, as well as other websites/newspapers and I feel their concerns are unfounded. Some feel this movie is being made ""too soon"". I could not possibly agree any less with this opinion. It is not their place to decide when a movie like this should be made. Yes this is a delicate subject but there's only one group of people that have the right to determine when it's ""okay"" to make a movie such as this, and that role belongs to the family and loved ones of those lost. The families helped collaborate with the director and gave him the thumbs up to make the movie, and if that's the case no one can say that United 93 came out too soon. This movie was made to honor the lives lost, not exploit money from people who feel they have to watch this in order to feel patriotic.<br/><br/>Another issue I'd like to address is those that condemn this movie because of its inaccuracies. Sure we have no perfect way of knowing exactly what went on, but the director and writers did their best. Remember, this is NOT a documentary. It is a docudrama that relives the events as accurately as it can yet fills up the holes with what may be fiction.<br/><br/>This movie is very moving. At the end, an awed silence overtook the audience followed by applause. This reminds of us the patriotism we gained through 9/11 and lost through the recent years of pointless fighting with Iraq. Some may say I'm only giving this a movie a 10 because I don't wanna seem unpatriotic. They couldn't be further from the truth. I'm giving this movie a perfect score because it described the true story of heroism and the actions of ordinary who managed to prevent the loss of even more lives on that dark September day."

","United 93 was nothing like I expected. It wasn't a slick Hollwood movie and it wasn't a sappy movie-of-the-week kind of thing. It was raw and intense and gripping. What the director seems to give us is as close to a real-time accurate account as possible. I didn't get the sense there was much embellishment and there are no unbelievable heroics. Instead, we see confusion and fear that lead to desperation, courage and incredible determination. <br/><br/>The film spends as much time on the ground, in air traffic control towers and NORAD, as it does in the plane. But you really feel the drama, shock and utter chaos of that day from perspectives that you probably wouldn't expect. The really interesting thing is how much of the tension is created, not by the film, but by the viewer. You know what's going to happen, so every moment that it's not happening, reality is playing as this contrasting backdrop in your mind. <br/><br/>It was a truly powerful film."

The emotion of all of passengers on the plane, as well as the terrorists was displayed brilliantly by the actors. The goodbye messages from the passenegers to their famalies were very touching and very realistically portrayed. The rest of the movie, however, was not nearly as well put together. The actors playing the rest of the roles tried vainly hard to act realistic. This aside, the movie as a whole was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone with the stomach to see it."

","Pretty good crowd for a matinée. There were around 50 people there.<br/><br/>I'll just say right off the bat that no one was crying or freaking out, or anything else that some who are against this film were ""concerned"" about. And, there were adults of all ages from early 20's up to 60+.<br/><br/>This movie is rated R, but with the exception of language, I have seen worse violence in a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>I saw the A&E movie about Flight 93, and this one is much more believable. The A&E movie was very well organized, and focused on the passengers and their families on the ground. And, the passengers in the A&E movie were far too calm, and their conversations seemed scripted. In this new movie, it seemed more real. Everyone talking at once with a major sense of urgency. Same with the terrorists. It blended the agencies on the ground, and showed the result of different agencies not being able to share information. There is also no ""star and co-star"" There weren't any single stars on 9/11 either. In fact, I don't recall hearing ANY names of the characters, other than one woman who identified herself to the person she was calling on the phone.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say how the World Trade Center and Pentagon were done, but I will say that it is done tastefully. The whole movie is tasteful, and there are no over glorified Rambo type fight scenes. It is all done realistically.<br/><br/>Some scenes are very intense in the fact that it is based on a true story, and in some scenes, I wanted to jump up and help. It does remind you that we are at war, and shows you that our enemies are brutal, and do not care about who they kill.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone. I simply do not buy the notion that it is too soon for a movie like this, and I think that people who are against this film should simply be honest, and say that they don't want to see it. Proceeds from the film are being donated to a memorial at the site of the crash, and if my matinée viewing is any indication of how the movie will do, I'd bet that there will be a VERY nice memorial."
"redizdead","2","11","28","17 September 2006"," what is the effect of this film on young Muslims?
","Well, this is my opinion, one amongst thousands. First, nobody knows what exactly happened on this plane. Some people here say it's a realistic movie... How the hell does anybody know???? And as it was proved with the black box, the story in this this movie is not true, we're not even even sure that passengers entered the cockpit. Secondly, there is a major risk in this movie: I saw this movie in the US. And during the scene where passengers kill the young terrorist, some people shouted and applauded. It scared me. And I'm sure if I had been among a Muslim audience, this wouldn't have happened. What would have? I don't know. But my problem is this one: in this movie, everyone is right and brave. The Muslims follow their path, praying, smiling, scared, like normal people. Moreover, one of the terrorists, the pilot, hesitates. The director tries to make us believe that this guy actually had regrets... Bullshit. Nobody knows. And the problem is that this movie shows a Muslim/Christian war, especially in the scene where everyone is praying. As if the terrorist where only following their religion's path. OK, this movie is not about religion, it's about a story that happened. But nobody knows HOW it happened, and everybody knows what were the consequences. How is this movie helping? This is supposed to be"" dedicated to those who died""... Please... Stop this bullshit, this is dedicated to no one except the producer's bank account. And try to imagine what effect this movie could have on young Muslim's minds."

","This movie really disappointed me. I've never been a fan of made for TV movies, but A&E made a movie, titled flight 93 (and I'm fairly sure the A&E version was released first), which I saw prior to seeing this theatrical version, which I would give a ten compared to the 4 I gave this version. The theatrical version severely downplays any heroism you could attribute to the individuals on the flight and focuses more on the insubstantial banter of people in air traffic control rather than most of the true issues. Overall, when you consider the money and time invested in this movie, it is fairly worthless when you compare it to the most likely low budget, but far superior A&E version."
"fertilecelluloid","8","6","13","11 May 2006"," Exceptional film-making
","One of the few films where knowing what is going to happen beforehand gives every scene a tragic resonance. ""United 93"" is a powerful and exceptional documentary-style recreation of the September 11, 2001, tragedy in which brave passengers forced a hijacked airliner to crash into a field before it could strike its intended target. Director Paul Greengrass fills his cast with both no-name actors and some real people (air traffic controllers, for example) who worked on the periphery of the drama. His strategy pays off because it stops us from focusing on any one character. The film has a real time feel and smartly layers in other aspects of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The film's final fifteen minutes are extremely harrowing and ultra-realistic. A very worthwhile, unsentimental achievement."
"BernMaya","10","6","13","1 May 2006"," Raw, honest and superbly presented! A must see!
","The story of flight 93 is an inspiring and heart wrenching story that needed to be told. All those of us who witnessed the events of 9/11 unfold on this fateful September morning remember clearly what we were doing and where we were. I was personally on my way to work when I heard that AA 11 hit Tower 1. 90 minutes later, I watched the Pentagon on fire from my office window. From that moment, my view of the world had changed for ever. I was quite relieved to see that this movie did not try to politicize the issue and just narrated the events faithfully, without any agenda. The footage was raw and poignant. Greengrass did not try to tone down the barbarism of the highjackers who cheered when they learned that ""their brothers had hit their targets"". We also get a glimpse of the terror that the passengers had to live through and overcome. The movie gives due credit to Thom Burnett's composure, heroism and leadership. A bunch of every day Americans who have been put together on this doomed flight and decided they would not go down without a fight. The movie was very well done, with very little background music and some real footage of the events. I was so shaken when it ended that I sat throughout the end credits, unable to move. I was very surprised to see a number of people from NORAAD and the FAA play themselves. How more realistic can it get? The bottom line is that this is a great movie and tribute to the first front line casualties of the war on terror and must be seen with the respect these heroes deserve."

","As I am writing from Greensboro,NC this plane had a special place on the local scene. One of the stewardesses, Ms Bradshaw was from here. After I watched this movie, the local TV news had interviews with both her Mother, as well as her Sister. Also interviewed were patrons at the theater that first showed this re-enactment. I will not go into details of how the tragedy unfolded; it was widely covered by the media at the time. The thing that impressed me was to watch it unfold made the viewer feel like they were a part of the scene, feeling the feelings that the passengers felt. It was as if you were there, hoping to change the known outcome. The accuracy and facts were carefully researched. Waiting 4 1/2 years after this incident was like a new wake-up call, that it could happen again. A must-see film."
"krsno","8","6","13","29 April 2006"," Gripping, frustrating, intense portrayal of heroism on 911
","This is a gripping portrayal of what occurred aboard United Flight 93, the last plane to be hijacked on 911. The film runs pretty much in real time, splitting between the doomed passengers and the air traffic controllers who gradually become aware of, on the ground, what is happening in the air. The film plays as near-documentary, avoiding the temptation to idealize the people involved, or even elaborate much on who they were as individual personalities. Instead, it allows the horrific events to unfold as they apparently actually did at the time, without revisionist history or political commentary pointing us in a specific editorial direction. It makes no stars of its heroes, who are shown as just ordinary people who found themselves in a terrible situation.<br/><br/>This approach seems almost dispassionate at first. But through a careful, minute-by-minute reconstruction of the known events on board Flight 93 (and perhaps some reasonable, but limited speculation,) the tension and anxiety gradually builds to a harrowing conclusion. What we get is a flashback of sorts to the morning of Sept.11, when, at first, no one knew what was happening, or what would happen in the hours, months, and years to come. We experience the attacks only through the eyes of the people caught on board one plane and those watching from the ground, as the gravity of the day's events slowly becomes clear. The frustration of the controllers watching helplessly as they are unable to stop the numerous hijackings taking place across the country becomes our frustration as well.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Paul Greengrass takes great care in avoiding exploitation of the drama inherent in the terrible day's events, never letting us feel like we're watching an airport disaster movie. And although there is bloodletting aboard the plane as the terrorists carry out their evil plan, it never feels like the gratuitous, stylized violence of a gangster movie or mindless action flick. Rather, the brutal nature of all the 911 attacks manifests itself in the very personal hand-to-hand murders committed by the terrorists. The eventual heroic reaction by the passengers who turn from trapped victims with few options, into an improvised army desperately trying to save themselves and perhaps hundreds of other victims, needs no further justification: they realized what was going to happen to them, and they took action.<br/><br/>Initially, both the hijackers and the innocent passengers seem as ordinary as any group on an average flight would be. Their call to action is entirely believable because we see them go through the realization that the flight they're on is not a hijack, but a suicide mission. By refusing to over dramatize the now iconic moments like Todd Beamer's famous ""Let's Roll"" remark, Greengrass doesn't seem to be directing the film as much as simply allowing the story to unfold naturally before us as it did for the passengers. We're drawn into their story as their emotions become ours, thus making us feel as if we too are trapped on a plane heading for disaster. The only letdown of the film is the somewhat anonymous nature of the passengers. They're not identified as readily as we know them by now, or at least the main figures who posthumously found fame for their heroism; Beamer, Thomas Burnett, Mark Bingham and Jeremy Glick. This seems to be a conscious effort to make all those who were on the flight as important as any other, not just to lionize the already familiar names in the story, because no one but those who were there know exactly what happened, and what role they actually played.<br/><br/>The extraordinary actions of the ordinary people on board the flight are all the more chilling because we are forced to realize how easily it could have been any one of us stuck with the same fate on that day. But what will most deeply affect you after watching this film is the unavoidable question posed by its intense, involving, anxiety-inducing portrayal. Would you have the courage to do what the passengers did that day?"

","I am loathe to say I enjoyed this film as I do not think it is a film to be enjoyed, but it was well done, succinct, to the point, and did not milk the audience for tears. Many of the characters were played by themselves, i.e. ATC and military personnel. I do not feel it is too soon for this film to be released, and I do feel that America has already slid back into a place of comfort and semi-apathy. I think the film is an excellent reminder of necessary vigilance on our part. It did not leave me with a negative feeling towards Muslim people. I was slightly amused that the European gentlemen on the flight was portrayed as wanting only to try and negotiate with the terrorists. But, mostly I was left with a sense of pride for being an American, a sadness at the senseless loss of lives, and wondering what it would have been like if the passengers would have succeeded. I hurried to see this film this weekend as proceeds will be donated towards the memorial for Flight 93 for sales only collected this weekend. (4/28/2006)"
"DeltaNu","2","8","19","6 May 2006"," Impersonal, unemotional.
","It's hard to say anything bad about a movie that deals with this topic, but it is equally hard for me to say anything good about it. So let's just see it as what it is, a movie.<br/><br/>The director emphasized on the fact that the people on the plane were normal people, no heroes. They were like me and you and the story is about those normal people acting like heroes. Usually movies have some kind of filter, so watching it really makes you aware that it is only a movie and not real. This one though could have been made with a usual digital camcorder that many people have at home. The idea was a good one, it reminded everybody again that all this really happened. Sitting in a movie theater though, only gave the impression of bad quality. They had great, unknown actors, but they didn't take advantage of them. The first part of the movie shows the procedures of getting onto a plane. Everybody knows that this is not very exciting. Then you see a lot of people sitting in a room controlling the planes etc. on their monitors. They are talking in their headsets, giving orders, telling others what they heard. Each shot throughout the movie is about 2 seconds long, maybe even shorter. Sometimes there is a conversation that lasts longer, then you see those people talking in a fast change of perspectives, from the front, back and the sides. Most of the times you only see a lot of different people every 2 seconds giving orders, in the background there is constant talking. Yes, it showed how unprepared the US was for such an attack and that those people were in a shock and everything was stressful. But after one hour I could hardly stand those voices anymore. Just imagine a hundred people constantly talking at you. That's how it felt. It doesn't only look like some inexperienced private person used his camera to shoot the movie because of the filter, but also because of the camera work. Let's just say it makes you dizzy after a while. Again, the intentions were good, but it doesn't work. As I mentioned before, they had good actors. The ones on the plane especially. The problem is, you hardly see them. After two hours you have no connection to them, you know almost nothing about them. They are still strangers, so thinking about it as only a movie, I didn't care about them. The last 20minutes of the movie were touching, but not because of the great movie. It was, because I knew that all this truly happened and it touched me on the day that it really happened. The movie just reminded me of the feelings that I had that day. All those media they used to make it look real, stressful and hectic also draw the attention away from the victims and their family and friends. It makes the story less emotional. I only felt like crying when I saw those people on the plane calling their relatives. Why not showing the relatives? Why not letting the viewers get to know those people in private? That's what it should have been about, getting to know the people that did something heroic. Instead, you see 1.5 hours of strangers getting onto a plane and strangers giving orders into their headsets."
"Sparx77","10","7","16","1 May 2006"," 'United 93' soars as haunting cinematic triumph
","Like so much of this heart-breaking, beautifully handled film, you sit transfixed, knowing the tragic fate of the men and women hijacked by the four terrorists on United Flight 93, but not necessarily knowing what they went through during the final moments of their lives.<br/><br/>That's still true - we won't ever know. But by stitching together the telephone calls made by those passengers to their loved ones as the events unfolded - as well as the documented accounts of those in the military and air traffic control towers - the movie gives us a believable, realistic idea that is never sensationalized.<br/><br/>This sense of realism is heightened by a few factors.<br/><br/>First, the film is shot as if it were a documentary, with hand-held cameras giving it the claustrophobic immediacy and off-center sense of confusion cinema verite provides.<br/><br/>It was exactly the right choice, removing any sense of Hollywood gloss from a production that would have been bastardized by it.<br/><br/>Second, the film employs no known actors - the distraction of a Tom Cruise, for instance, thankfully has no place in this particular war of worlds - with Greengrass going a step farther by using several civilians who were actually there when the planes struck the World Trade Center Towers, then the Pentagon, and then when Flight 93 crashed into that stretch of Pennsylvania field.<br/><br/>Chief among those playing themselves is Ben Sliney, whose job it was as FAA operations manager to get a handle on the hijackings. His amazing ""performance"" - or reenactment, as it were - is a gift to history.<br/><br/>While the movie only ever wants to observe and never to pass judgment, which is its shrewdest move as it allows the viewer to remain firmly rooted in the moment and not in the murky waters of political commentary, it's in its observations that it creates its gut-wrenching run of suspense.<br/><br/>Going into it, we all know how this movie will end, yet watching the terrorists enter the airport and take their seats among those they plan to kill nevertheless forms a knot in your stomach that becomes an anchor.<br/><br/>This is particularly true when the door to the plane is sealed shut. With the passengers still reasonably safe on the tarmac, just above them in the flight towers is chaos - frantic men and women aware of hijacked planes. The idea that none of this was shared with the passengers or with the crew allowed them to exist in a cocoon of false security. The world was learning fast that the world was on the brink of change, but for those in the planes, it was just another flight, a link to another destination.<br/><br/>Later, in the air, with the chaos unfolding inside Flight 93, the passengers and crew realized they had no choice but to unify and to charge into the face of madness. It's a scene that makes the film the most difficult to endure since Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" or Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist."" ""United 93"" presses hard on raw nerves and then, in its final frame, it literally crushes them. What Greengrass has created is haunting and unshakable, the medium at its full potential."

After finding out a bit more I shed my ignorance.<br/><br/>My girlfriend and I decided to watch this film tonight, which I just finished about an hour ago. Throughout the whole movie I felt as if I was just seconds away from tears. I felt like crying from sadness, anger, and fear.....all together.

This is a film that I suggest every American see. Whether or not you had the same feelings as I did at first. What happened on September 11 is a part of all of us, whether we accept it or not.

I can tell you now that this movie is better than both World Trade Center and Flight 93. The scene where Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the World Trade Center is very shocking because the movie uses the original CNN footage of the attack. The ending scene is violent but at the same time will make people cheer as Mark Bingham crushes Ahmed Al-Haznawi's skull with a fire extinguisher and Jeremy Glick snaps Ahmed Al-Nami's neck. Overall a very emotional and awesome movie!!! Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in one of the most horrific events in world history..."

Several family members of the passengers aboard the flight attended the film's premiere to show their support.<br/><br/>United 93 is an astonishing documentary-style drama that tracks in scrupulous detail the known events on the ground and acts of bravery inside the doomed plane. Understandably, it is often painful to watch, but is never exploitative, and does justice to those who died on board. Director Paul Greengrass's decision to cast lesser-known actors, so as not to distract audiences with star sightings, proves impeccably correct."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","3","5","18 February 2010"," A fitting tribute
","If the date September 11, 2001 means anything to you then you probably already know the story of United Flight 93. Of the four planes hijacked by terrorists on that day this was the only one that didn't reach its target.<br/><br/>I was sceptical about this film since the mere thought of a Hollywood dramatization of the horrific events of 9/11 seemed almost disrespectful. For an example of the type of thing I half-expected, see (or, better yet, don't see) the Michael Bay debacle ""Pearl Harbor"". Thankfully, Paul Greengrass keeps the film from becoming a victim of Hollywood hokum.<br/><br/>The cast is made up of unknowns, which I feel was the right choice since the absence of familiar faces adds a touch of realism. Despite being without any 'stars' the acting is in no way below par, though. In fact, if you look at the closing credits you'll note that a lot of the ground personnel were portrayed by the real people.<br/><br/>I don't know how close the events in the film match what really happened but I must say that Greengrass's script is mostly (mostly, mind you) devoid of the typical 'improvements' to fact that screenwriters are so fond of. At its best, the film is effective enough to evoke some of the horror felt at watching the events as they unfolded nearly a decade ago.<br/><br/>I'm not usually a big fan of Greengrass's directorial style but I'd have to say that he did an excellent job here. The direction & editing (the sources of the film's only two Oscar nominations) enforce a cinéma vérité approach that was really the only 'right' way to do this movie. The score is unobtrusive as well while still contributing to the mood of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, ""United 93"" is an impressive film and a fitting testament to the heroism of those who risked, and ultimately gave, their lives with the end result that who knows how many other lives were spared."
"jboothmillard","8","3","5","8 September 2009"," United 93
","From Oscar nominated director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy + Ultimatum), this was the first major film, after five years, to show the devastating events of September 11th 2001. Basically passengers went about their normal lives as they boarded for flight 93 from United Airlines, and without their knowledge the North Twin Tower of New York caught fire, supposedly from a plane hitting it. Not long afterwards, a second hijacked plane hit the other tower, as well as part of the Pentagon, and the 93 passengers still had no knowledge of it. Eventually, the flight is overtaken by terrorists, aiming to crash the flight into another target, and the passengers are stricken with fear. The terrorists however did not stop passengers using the on board phone services, to call the police, and of course loved ones, as they slowly planned to stop the terrorists and regain control. Their plan is put in motion, and they attack the terrorists, causing the plane to lose control, and it hurtles towards the ground, crashing into a field. Starring many unknowns, and even some of the real people involved at the airport, including Lewis Alsamari as Saeed Al Ghamdi, J.J. Johnson as Captain Jason Dahl, Gary Commock as First Officer LeRoy Homer, Trish Gates as Sandra Bradshaw, Polly Adams as Deborah Welsh, Cheyenne Jackson as Mark Bingham, Opal Alladin as CeeCee Lyles, Starla Benford as Wanda Anita Green, Nancy McDoniel as Lorraine G. Bay and David Alan Basche as Todd Beamer. The real events inside the plane will never be known, but the authentic feeling ones in the film, from the phone calls made by the doomed passengers, is convincing, gripping, moving and dignified, a magnificent drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and the David Lean Award for Direction for Greengrass, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Cinematography, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound.

"colagreen3","9","3","5","31 March 2009"," More than an average ""Movie""
","This film portrays the deplorable events that occurred on 9/11, ""United 93"" was one of the four planes hijacked that day and was the only plane that did not reach its target. This is definitely not for the faint- hearted as it is a very moving portrayal. <br/><br/>The film is in honour to the 40 passengers and crew who stood out their bravery in opposition to the four suicide terrorists who hijacked the plane but did not reach their intentions of a premeditated attack. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass wrote and directed the film, which he knew would be considered as very controversial. Many argued that it was too soon to be re-enacted, but Paul felt it seemed the right time to be made with a release 5 years after the event. Paul managed to get in contact with all the families on board of United 93 which wasn't an easy task. The families were all thoroughly supportive towards a film being made as long as it looked and felt realistic to what did supposedly occur. I was very impressed how this film created a believable truth, and the film certainly didn't suffer with its improvisation. United 93 unquestionably looks authentic and doesn't belong into a clichéd movie world where you anticipate extraordinary things to happen. There is a lot of visual effects used in this production and they are very well handled and aren't the centre of awareness. For instance, during the filming the plane was on the ground and not in the air but this was not apparent. I also really thought the music felt appropriate as it had a sense of misfortune and told the story of a broken nation, which was important because the film explored one of the most significant events in a lifetime.<br/><br/>The cast assembles reasonably unknown actors that were a close representation to those on board on the day. The actors were given studies to each individual's life and they met the families to give them a broad insight to whom they were playing. I have to say the acting in this film is very close to perfection and it felt truthful to use unknown actors who were just like any average Joe stuck in an everyday life. I felt this was a really good idea because I often get distracted when I see certain actors and it reminds me that the film is fictional. I believe what also made it appear authentic were the scenes shot in the air traffic command centre. The people portraying these roles are factual people and not actors, most of who were there on the day of 9/11  portraying themselves. The pilots and stewardess on board of the plane are also non professional actors and depicting what they do in everyday life.<br/><br/>After watching this film I felt extremely speechless and proud of the passengers and crew that were on board - they took the chance of sacrificing their life. The film didn't make them look like victims, if anything they are the heroes! It is such a credible film and I cant think of anything negative to say about it. I felt very emotional after watching this and I envisage numerous others will too."

I guess I knew that it would put me through the wringer again and probably tick me off mightily again. But in the end I realized that avoiding the reality of 9-11 and its results was, in some ways, being like the people who don't want to even think about or be reminded about what happened that day.<br/><br/>My second concern was that it might be hyped-up or Hollywood-ized too much. I can emphatically state that that is NOT the case.<br/><br/>I remember all the news coverage from 9-11 and how much it all focused on what the people on the ground went through. I always used to think about the airline passengers more, and what THEY had to go through. This movie shows just that.<br/><br/>But - why, in every age category, do women rate this movie lower than men? I am curious what others think about this. I believe avoiding acknowledging what happened is a very poor way to deal with it. Do women tend to want to ignore the realities of 9-11? Is that it? <br/><br/>This movie is by no means fun to watch, but it is very powerful - and, I believe, necessary."
"stephen-chalmers","8","3","5","1 December 2007"," better than expected
","Somehow I expected, due the emotive subject matter, a somewhat sickeningly patriotic propagandist movie - but it was none of that! Though we shall never know the exact words said and the actions taken on board that airliner, we can believe it must have been something of the sort.<br/><br/>Of course we knew the outcome, but I found myself nonetheless willing the passenger uprising to succeed and in the final minutes the intensity was enormous.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera movement (as in the Bourne movies) was irritating, especially for the scenes on the ground. Also I felt the lack of visual reference points on the plane, for example the lack of scenery out of the windows to give a greater sense of height was missing - at some points you felt the cabin was a studio set as all shots showing windows were ""white"".<br/><br/>It was a haunting and realistic movie, sensitively portraying the events as they must have unfolded on that fateful day from the perspective of flight United 93."
"mattfg","10","3","5","28 January 2007"," Exceptional and cathartic
","I hesitated watching this great movie. But now I'm glad I got up the nerve to sit through this exceptional piece of art.<br/><br/>Greengrass walked through a minefield and created a masterpiece with this movie. His nomination for Best Director at the Oscars is so well deserved.<br/><br/>I find myself viewing this movie again and again, I can't get it out of my mind. You've probably heard the many descriptions about how Greengrass's touch is pseudo-documentary in tone and style, a fly on the wall approach. We literally can't tell which players in this movie are actors and which ones are the real thing (with the exception of Ben Sliney and others).<br/><br/>The depiction of the plane's passengers is heartfelt and subtle. Even the terrorists are fleshed out in such a way to provide greater insight into the evil things they did that day. Jamie Harding is excellent as the youngest terrorist who is so obviously filled with such self-righteous fanaticism that he, along with the others, could see the evil they were doing as somehow justified and an act of Allah/God. <br/><br/>The looks on the faces of the players on the ground remind me of my own reaction - stunned disbelief and shock. Can this really be happening? It is enormously emotionally satisfying to see the passengers fight back as they do, as I hope I would do if I were there on the plane with them. The final moments of this movie are absolutely gripping and unforgettable. <br/><br/>I can't imagine a more accomplished, more fitting treatment of the September 11th tragedy than this one."
"futures-1","Null","3","5","28 October 2006"," If you're afraid, you've been ill-advised
","Let's get one thing out of the way: I take seriously the attacks on New York, Washington D.C., and the skies over America - and I have not forgotten or mellowed over the last five years. Nor do I have patience for any one, Oliver Stone included, ""dramatizing"" or ""fictionalizing"" the facts of a historic moment. For this reason first, but not solely, I support ""United 93"" and Paul Greengrass' super-effort to make the facts and emotions of that day as true as possible within the confines of film.<br/><br/>Does this mean his film is without Art? Not at all, but it DOES mean the only artistic devices he used were to assist the sense of reality that existed for those people during that time. I've heard ""complaints"" about the use of a shaking camera, but that is ONLY done as the tension and violence occur. It was the RIGHT thing to do for the film at that time, and a viewer's inner ear problems are of no concern to me. I want an artist to take me places I haven't been. If it's uncomfortable, so be it.<br/><br/>I VERY MUCH appreciated the total lack of recognizable actors. It was a brave decision on the director's part. ""Selling"" the film would be much more difficult, if not the Kiss of Death, in our market. Greengrass was willing to stick by his artistic and story telling intentions. And, because he did, we are gifted with a powerful, accurate, straight ahead, non-gimmicky, emotional recreation of a terrible moment. This is a highly SPECIFIC film, not one loaded with parallels and symbols. If you are AVOIDING it because you've heard it's VERY bloody, etc., it's not. You've been ill-advised. It IS very tense. THAT it is. It is also very sad, and the unknown actors need to be given credit for that. If I remember correctly, Greengrass also used original participants, such as in the control towers, for the added accuracy and feel of time and place. It must've been difficult for those people.<br/><br/>I doubt ""United 93"" was easy for anyone, and it remains a challenge for us. Thankfully. I'd hate to think someone DID find it easy."

My life has never been the same.<br/><br/>I watched this film, enraptured by it's third party view of the events (even though, of course, these people in the plane tower, like us, were captivated by the real-life events unfolding in front of them).

"gainestillinger","10","4","8","12 September 2009"," An exercise in endurance.
","The fourth plane to be hijacked on September 11th 2001 did not hit its target because of the immense bravery of a determined few: its passengers â€“ ordinary people who were not ready to die without a fight. Not heroes in white vests or cool leather jackets, but real people. Thankfully, 'United 93' keeps it that way. The characters seem as real as you and I, fretting and stressing that to stop the four terrorists from blowing up the plane or crashing it they are going to have to murder them with their bare hands.<br/><br/>The camera work in this film is so claustrophobic that we feel as if we are in the thick of the decision making. We are forced to sit in the air-conditioned near silence and consider if we would have what it takes to survive this or whether we would sit and wait for the end, cursing our own inaction. We peek around chairs and listen as our fellow passengers make phone calls to loved ones, knowing all of our goodbyes may be the last we ever share with a child or a wife or husband. We are trapped in this film and its inevitable end. It is utterly excruciating.<br/><br/>Interestingly, not only are forced to endure the aforementioned process of accepting death or fighting it off tooth and nail, but we are also, at the conclusion, stuck up against the fanatics who are crashing the plane, watching closely as they waver not a millimetre in their determinism. They cry 'Allah' as if someone had given them a script from God; they say it as if it was always going to be said with no chance of escaping this nose diving fate. This makes us more determined to stop them; an affectation that pays the highest testimony to the brilliant direction of Paul Greengrass.<br/><br/>See this film, but don't expect to ever want to endure it again."

","Over it was a good movie, but i just think it was awful that some one decided to make an entertainment piece out the whole ordeal, movies like this make me sick (pearl harbor). the acting was decent and well thought out. no necessary special effects were needed so thats a place i cant comment on. I found it honorable that they donated a percentage to the flight 93 fund, which was only for the opening weekend though. other than the fact that the making of the movie was too soon i cant say much of anything else. Who knew those heartless, shameless, money grubbing bastards in Hollywood could make such a sensitive and fabulous moving film? United 93 is a very straightforward, stripped down retailing of the events on that fateful day. How much of it is true or fabricated, I don't know, but I don't think that's as important as the love and care that went into creating this. It's almost never too soon to see such an excellent and stunning piece of film-making as this. This is clearly the first great movie of 2006."

","Everything about United 93 is heart breaking to watch. From the Arabs praying with their Koran, to the smiling faces of the personnel facing what must have seemed like just another day; the person who boarded at the last minute. Paul Greengrass's docudrama is a superb piece of film making. We have the benefit of hind sight and fore knowledge, and yet, as information filtered to the people involved, it seemed surreal, unbelievable, tragic, and baffling. If this film is viewed by film goers who have also watched WHY WE FIGHT, the astonishing, brilliant documentary by Eugene Jarecki, it adds profoundly to our understanding of the human condition. And then there is everybody's favorite whipping boy, Michael Moore, who always tells the truth in his own, sardonic, passionate way. Regardless of how you may feel about him, his perspective is helpful and he doesn't lie. It's difficult for me to comment much further, since United 93 is a film wrought with emotion. Regardless of our personal beliefs, our own convictions, our own sense of the world, people died that day. It show cased the best and the worst in us. Many people die every day all over this complex world and for many of the same reasons. It was hard to speak during, and after viewing this film..... We will never know exactly what happened that day, and Greengrass's meticulous research is a testament to him. It is a film about human beings facing an extraordinary day and how they responded to it, and yes, in an extraordinary way. There was no finger pointing, no demonetization, no focus on the body politic, no jingoistic call for war nor anger. But the themes of love, love for family, love for friends, courage, desperation, cooperation, fear, acceptance. rebellion... I watched his other docudrama, BLOODY Sunday, and this film has the same type of style. But this film flew by, and it felt like it was only a few minutes in length. It left me breathless by the end, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for most people. A remarkable film about an infamous day. It is a great monument to the people who died that day. A portion of the monies generated from United 93 went to their monument. In RAN, Kurosawa reminds us that when we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it, to walk the same path over and over. My hope is that we move forward as a species....United 93 is a painful yet important film. many people were praying in this film, from beginning to end. i wonder; were they all praying to the same God? screenplay A direction A editing A+"

I wanted to be in the room with the air traffic controllers and tell them what was going on. It compelled me to want to do those things. This was a great movie and, even though we all know what's coming at the end of the movie, you will still feel stunned.

"bondgirl6781","10","4","8","21 June 2006"," An Important Film To See
","About a month ago I saw Tom Hanks on Inside The Actor's Studio and he said that this was the most film to see and he was right. I saw the film last night with my mother and neither one of us were prepared for what were about to see. I have seen documentaries about 9/11 and the people on Flight 93 and I have read the 9/11 Commission report. But this film takes inside of what happened on United flight 93 on that day that no one will ever forget. The film opens with the hijackers praying and meditating before they leave their hotel room and head for the airport. We see a regular and beautiful morning in which everyone is going to work: the pilots, the stewardess', the people in FAA and in Air Traffic control. We see the passengers including the hijackers wait before boarding the plane. It was a regular and beautiful day until American Airline flight 11 disappears from the radars and on the news we see the horrific images of the World Trade Centers on fire. Within minutes of that morning more attacks took place: the second tower of the WTC, the Pentagon, and then the airplane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania that was suppose to have targeted Capital building or the White House. While the passengers are on the plane and in the air everything is pleasant like most flights usually are: breakfast is being served, conversations, and friendly and courteous smiles exchanged. Everyone on the flight is oblivious of the news of the attacks on the ground and then the hijackers unleash terror 70,000 feet above the ground. Gradually, the passengers slowly realized that these hijackers were on a suicide mission and the news of the attacks are reached to them via telephone from their loved ones. No one in Air Traffic Control or in military sectors knew until after the plane had crashed that United Flight 93 was hijacked. My mother and I saw the film and we both left the theatre shaking and in tears. I have seen films that have made me cry and have impacted me, but there are no words to describe the feeling of fear and yet there was a sense of admiration for the passengers as they banded together and took the risk of taking control of the plane. The final moment is so powerful it leaves you shaking and begging them to win. The phone calls made from the passengers to their loved ones and the prayers of both the passengers and the hijackers resonate louder than the airplane engines. There is no one today who could even be prepared to experience on the events that took place on United 93. There are political statements or even any mentioning of partisanship. You don't even hate the hijackers, or at least I didn't. Quite the contrary. They were human beings driven by fanaticism and madness to commit the acts they were trained to believe were honorable to the name of Islam. The one hijacker, Ziad Jarrah, who was trained to fly the plane seemed to be the only one who was willing to back out, but didn't. This was certainly not film made to bring in box office winnings or title. This was a film that commemorates the heroes and the lives taken on September 11, 2001. Warning: the film is very graphic and no one will ever be prepared for a film of this magnitude."
"Grant_Ritchie_superfan","9","4","8","21 June 2006"," Uncomfortable Viewing
","I was worried this film would be full of American 'Rah Rah' cheese. Instead it was done tastefully and is hard to watch at times. Never have I sat so tense in my chair while watching a film. At times I felt physically sick and left the cinema stunned.<br/><br/>This film has no happy ending, no funny one liners or romance. It simply captures the confusion that engulfed everyone that day. It recreates the horror the passengers went through on the plane. It brings back memories for the rest of us.<br/><br/>If you want to know if you should go see this film, then my answer would be yes. It is incredibly well made and will be remembered long into the future as one of the best films of the day. But I can honestly say I would be happy if I never saw this film again."
"the-ticklebug","10","4","8","12 June 2006"," United 93 Makes me Proud
","When I saw the ads and a documentary about this movie on TV, I thought that I would not be able to handle watching this.<br/><br/>Just two weeks later, I was on the internet looking for a movie in the theater to see. I watched the trailer, and for some reason, I felt the need to watch it. I was a bit nervous going into the theater, but I watched it until the end. I am happy that I saw this movie. In fact, I may even go see it again.<br/><br/>""United 93"" made me proud because due to the heroism not only performed by the passengers on the plane, but also due the the heroic decision of the The Command Center's national operations manager, Ben Sliney, who ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport. My husband and I were, in fact, on one of those planes that very day that was re-routed back to the point of orgin (Atlanta). Our final destination was La Guardia Airport in NYC.<br/><br/>Some reviews make note of the jittery-ness of the camera in the movie. I did not feel uneasy about that; nor did I even notice it.<br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that the director did his best in sticking with the facts as reported by the 9-11 Commission Report. It's in a PDF form, and I recommend reading it.<br/><br/>Were there some differences? Probably so, but there were no political spins or major twists to the original story that some may speak of.<br/><br/>Aside from Bush and that infamous ""7 minute wait"" for authorization to ""shoot down"", I really and truly believe that our ATC, FAA, all the command centers, and our military did the best with what they had. People need to keep in mind that the decision to halt air traffic on that day was not only ""unprecedented"", but it was a result of ""thinking outside the box"". When was the last time a national disaster as unique as this occurred in U.S history? This film reconfirmed for me the mass confusion, the shock, and the sadness of 9-11. And the difference between having seen it all on the news and having seen it in the movies was important for me: In the movies, I felt as if I were right there experiencing it for myself. I was the confused Air Traffic Controller, the terrified passenger, and part of the shocked and disbelieving personnel at the command centers.<br/><br/>Some people are ""sick and tired"" of the ""Never Forget 9-11"" mantra that people say and write. While this phrase could be overstated and occasionally disingenuous, I really do think people forget about this tragedy. They forget about it because some still continue to think that America is invincible (especially our government) and don't do enough to ensure that there isn't another 9-11 (i.e borders? TSA improvement and more funding?). But it just may take another 9-11 to OPEN OUR EYES. Some think that by going to Iraq that we have already secured our homeland. Many foreigners that live in the U.S not only have forgotten 9-11, but never really paid attention to it on the news thinking it wasn't a big deal and that ""we had it coming to us"". And some are just too squeamish to face the reality of the time we live in. These people need to see ""United 93"" and ""remember"". Last but not least there are the conspiracy theorists that claim 9-11 was an ""inside job"". I respect their opinion and believe that this movie is NOT for them to see because no amount of information on 9-11 will aid them in seeing it for what it was.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind, this movie wasn't made for ""jaw dropping cinematography"". This movie wasn't made for ""impressive special/visual affects"". This movie was not made to flaunt and tout the beauties and cam-queens of Hollywood. This movie isn't about ""acting"". This is not ""Spiderman"", not ""Lord of the Rings"", not ""Star Wars"", and not ""The Matrix"". For goodness sake, this is about normal everyday people who not only suffered these brutal attacks, but took a bite out of courage and ate it keeping our White House protected! I must admit that I am more than impressed that the director of ""United 93"" went to each and everyone of the victims families to get permission on making this film possible. As an FYI, each and every family member of the victims not only agreed, but cooperated with Mr.Paul Greengrass as they felt that this movie would aid them in their grievances. A HUGE Kudos to them! Somebody mentioned they were shocked that ATC didn't know the planes had hit the towers at the moment they hit? Are you kidding me? If you know anything about ATC, those monitors they look at do **not** show visuals of hijacked commercial airlines plowing into buildings. Each and every individual could only go on what they knew. Some people, no matter how hard we try, they will never understand or appreciate and always ""expect more"". It takes a lot of understanding about how airlines work, aviation, the FAA, and Air Traffic Control before you can be grateful and respecting of their jobs and also appreciate the fact that WE DID DO OUR BEST.<br/><br/>Rather than ""blood money"" or ""morbid fascination"" as some people call it, those responsible for making this movie happen deserve to make profit for their hard work. But as another FYI, proceeds are going to the ""Flight 93"" National Memorial. For those that don't want to watch the movie can always donate. Just visit their website.<br/><br/>In any event, though, I highly recommend this movie and my condolences to those whom were affected by this tragedy. I would give my condolences to victims and their families regarding any tragedy, but right now, we are talking about 9-11."
"RolyUK","10","4","8","6 June 2006"," Believe the hype - this is an amazing, gut-wrenching film
","Saw this film tonight and wow, it's a breathtaking roller-coaster of emotions. Greengrass makes you experience it all, anger, confusion, fear, pity, nausea, sympathy, hope, pride... I could go on. This is unbiased but gut-wrenching film-making at it's finest, and deserves Best Picture awards worldwide.<br/><br/>Obviously it's impossible to give a 100% accurate depiction of events - because everyone has a different perspective on the simplest thing. But we have the airplane tapes from the Moussaoui trial, with the record of the altitude and speed changes and even hearing the commotion of passengers storming the cockpit, plus the phone conversations and messages (my God can you even imagine leaving your loved ones a final voicemail in a situation like that) and years of knowledge of what happens in air-hijack situations.<br/><br/>You know what's coming, and have seen every bit of footage, but it doesn't stop you re-living the shock of that day, wishing on the passengers to recover the plane, welling up with emotion when they're speaking with those safe on the ground, saying goodbyes and hanging up in dignity. Even the footage of the 2nd plane hitting the WTC is given a new, and stomach-wrenching immediacy. Everyone was caught flat-footed, with two planes sent to guard the capital of the most powerful country in history - and they turned out to have gone in the wrong direction, unarmed... In years to come it may seem like this attack could have been a whole lot worse.<br/><br/>This is a drama in a long tradition of depicting real events in as 'truthful' a way as possible, and like a Shakespearean history play, or a novel like In Cold Blood, that means some artistic decisions / licences need to be taken and the results will not be to the taste of everyone. Of those decisions, I feel more positive about some than others: the terrorists are realistic, not from a comic book or Hollywood movie, and the repeated use of 'I love you' e.g. by one of the terrorists before boarding, by the passengers before fighting back, is unbearably powerful.<br/><br/>On the other hand I'm not sure why Greengrass made out the German passenger, an identifiable real victim, as an appeaser/coward. Couldn't this have been an anonymous member of the cast, or would that not play to American audiences / backers?<br/><br/>Ultimately though that's nit-picking, because this is as visceral a film as anyone could bear. Some will see in the film the indomitable spirit of the US, others their unpreparedness and naivety; some I think will come out in despair and others with hope, but I feel sure this is a film that will be talked about for years to come.<br/><br/>PS Isn't it scary the numbers of bug-eyed monomaniac loons posting on this site that are convinced this film either perpetuates a right-wing conspiracy or is riddled with socialist, terrorist-loving, 'European' anti-American ideology. Have they even seen this film??!!??"

","I really wasn't sure about this. When the trailers started to appear, I wasn't sure I wanted to see this. I'm not American, so although the 9/11 tragedy did have an affect on my country, obviously it didn't have the same effect as in the US. However, it was still a shocking day that will live on for years to come.<br/><br/>As a movie, I think Paul Greengrass deserves immense credit. He could probably have made it more Hollywood, with big name actors, and such. However, by simply telling the facts as best he can, as no-one knows what actually happened on that plane, he comes up with a powerful, gripping tragedy. By getting people in the movie playing themselves, and by involving the families of the the people killed, it shows that he wanted it get it right. And I think he has.<br/><br/>He makes no political statements in the movie, he simply lays out the events of 9/11. No doubt political movies about this will appear, but this is not one of them.<br/><br/>All the real people involved deserve immense credit for appearing, as it couldn't have been an easy thing for them to relive the events of that day. And I think the actors are brilliant, in their performances as the passengers who come to realise what's happening and then trying to do something about it.<br/><br/>This film is not entertainment. I don't think you can tell a 9/11 story as entertainment. Like any tragedy all you can do is simply tell the story of the events as best and as realistic as possible. Greengrass has done that.<br/><br/>And, if as reported, the families of the victims are OK with the movie, and the portrayal of their loved ones, then to me that says everything.<br/><br/>This movie demands to be seen."

","I went to see this movie with open expectations based on what I had heard through others who had already seen this movie. The movie takes on a real life account of the day that we would come to know as simply 9-11. I was across the river from the Pentagon when it was struck, and watched with my own eyes as the events unfolded in DC. I knew two of the people who were killed on that morning in the Pentagon. It is a hard pill to swallow to bring back those memories that we as Americans have tried to put behind us.... But should we really try and forget those brave people who lost their lives on Flight 93, or any other flight that went down that morning. Absolutely Not!!! It is my belief that if this film was supported by the families of those who lost their lives, then who are we as Monday morning quarterbacks to say a word about whether we think this film is appropriate or not. I think every American, Man, Woman and child should go and watch this movie out of respect for those people who have lost their lives due to the events of terrorism.

","The average movie-goer probably does not appreciate the amount of research and attention to detail that went into the making of this film. As a flight attendant myself I was so quickly taken in by the routine conversations of the flight crew as the preflight inspections take place as they do every day and on every trip. I soon forgot that I was in a movie theater and felt as part of the crew. That is quite impressive in it's own right. All the sights, sounds and even the United flight crew uniforms were so authentic. As the movie progressed, I felt the same panic and anger I felt on that day. And asked the same unanswered question of Why? I think this film even though it was questioned by some to be made too soon, is a very fitting tribute to those who lost their lives. I have always wondered what it would have been like to be on board that flight, what would I have done. I found myself yelling out to the passengers to grab things like fire extinguishers and seat cushions. Then I looked around and remembered I was in a movie theater. I find my self no longer trying to get over and forget about that September day. Now I am mad again, but mad and vigilant. Vigilant to not let this happen again. Not on my airplane."

Shot more as a documentary, the film doesn't try to create false sentiment or make one group out as victim or hero. It just tries to set the course of events, as best we know them.<br/><br/>Using no big name actors and using a large portion of persons who worked that day, the film stays grounded.<br/><br/>All the naysayers and detractors of this film can claim conspiracies and the like.

I relived all the same dreadful, sad, mournful, angry, etc. feelings just as I did that morning watching it all unfold on TV.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why, but it seems there has been an ongoing campaign to make us forget that day. Personally, I've chosen to remember it, as often and as faithfully as I can--even before seeing this film. Actually, I was truly concerned that this film would turn out to be part of the aforementioned campaign. It is not.<br/><br/>If you were alive and aware of the world on 9.11.2001, I urge you to see this film."

","I completely agree with the comment above mine - this movie portrayed the events without making it more dramatic than it really was. I felt like I was a passenger in the plane, and everything was so realistically done it could have been a recording of the real events. It was so powerful, from start to finish. Besides a few gasps from the audience or the occasional sniff, it was silent. And at the end, you could hear a pin drop. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie only if you think you are ready to see it. I knew that I was ready, but throughout the whole film, especially the last hour or so, my stomach was in knots and my muscles were so tense I was shaking. Yet it was an amazing experience. I now can begin to understand what it was like for those passengers. And most importantly, I can appreciate everything that they did, and admire their bravery and strength despite the horrific situation they were thrust into. This movie honors their memory and I truly believe that it is important to never forget what happened that day, and understand exactly what those passengers did for us and our country."
"johnericketts","3","6","14","30 August 2006"," Obviously made by a TV director
","Still another in a long line of ""noble"" movies that people are afraid not to like. It used to be that all those awful old sword and sandal epics had to win awards. Now it's the docudramas that escape the TV screens for wide release. I suspected from the pulled-punches style that this just HAD to be made by a former TV director. Sure enough...check his credits! The action by the passengers is relatively bloodless, there is no shocking plane crash, and there is no aftermath of the carnage. You want to show horror? Show the horror, the massacre, don't try to be ""tasteful."" The names of the people who acted are known. Why not identify these heroes? The man who said ""Let's go"" was known to be on the phone or we wouldn't know he said it. Tell us who this honored hero was rather than make everyone anonymous.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to admit this is lame."
"Doylenf","7","5","11","4 May 2006"," Finale weakened by use of Cinema Verite style...
","UNITED 93 would have been a much more powerful film if all of the airborne scenes aboard the doomed plane matched the clarity and intensity of the ground control scenes which are the most intense and best edited sections of the whole film. Instead, the director has opted for shaky hand-held camera movement and blurry fast-cut moments to obscure what happens when the passengers decide to revolt. This considerably weakens and defeats what otherwise would have been a brilliant film.<br/><br/>After all the build-up to that final moment when the passengers decide to do something about their fate in the hands of hi-jacking terrorists, there is a distinct letdown in the way these moments are portrayed, in ""cinema verite"" style with intentionally shaky camera movement, blurry action hiding the possibility of viewing anything clearly. It's as though the camera is on fast forward for the whole uprising event without anyone able to make out what is actually going on.<br/><br/>This, and the fact that we learn nothing whatsoever about any of the passengers--making them complete non-entities--is what ruins the film for me. Seeing them in a huddle whispering things like ""Two planes went into the World Trade Center"" is not sufficient dramatic device to make these events tangible to the average audience. Only those who were close to this event or had personal connection to it through relatives, will find this sufficiently chilling.<br/><br/>A big disappointment to me as a film. I don't think the Academy will be voting this into the winner's circle at Oscar time.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the music is dramatically appropriate and does add to the intense quality of many scenes. All of the control tower sequences are better staged and directed than the passenger moments when they decide ""to roll"". That is the film's weakest link. It ends with a whimper instead of a bang, defeated by the director's choice to use cinema verite style for the most explosive scenes."
"Quinoa1984","10","5","11","2 May 2006"," Greengrass's masterpiece
","Watching United 93, I was suddenly reminded of a paper I had been writing about the director Roberto Rossellini and his post-war 'trilogy' of Italian neo-realist films. Not necessarily because United 93 is about the struggles of the poor in a post-war environment. But because of the qualities of the neo-realist filmmaker's attempts to capture reality as honestly as possible. Like Rossellini, writer/director Paul Greengrass uses real locations, and while not non-professional actors all unknowns in the cast, and does what critic Andre Bazin once wrote, ""directs the facts."" The film captures the most harrowing aspects of that morning that shook everyone in America (and the world) without pretense or melodrama. There's not a trace of director Greengrass exploiting those who died in the line of a terrorist takeover. And, like Rossellini's films, there is genuine emotion achieved for the audience by just putting up human beings up on the screen, without full-on characterization or over-whelming Hollywood sentimentality. Basically, what Greengrass gives the audience is this ""what it is is what it is."" This is a power that few filmmakers can pull off, yet he is able to achieve it with what will very likely be the best film of the year released by a major studio.<br/><br/>One of the ways Greengrass is successful is in the style that he uses. In a way, he chooses to abandon all noticeable technique. His cinema verite camera, led with a tenseness that is rather shocking in its non-stop approach by Barry Akyroyd, lets the audience in as if you don't notice what is exactly going on at any given moment. The story is less that than it is just the eventual unfolding of the events. And he cuts between two very specific sets- the air traffic controllers and Norad, and the plane itself. It's important to point out that just in the sheer film-making and pacing, aside from the significance behind the subject matter, shows the filmmaker able to create true taut suspense. One wonders when the hijackers will finally get up from the seats. One wonders if the air traffic controllers will know if the plane is THE plane, among the many others scrambled at the moment, amid the chaos of the twin towers. And one wonders what will happen to the passengers, as they call with every ounce of fear and horror to their loved ones on the ground. And throughout, the tension just keeps on building like a brutal, bleak-as-Bergman vice.<br/><br/>The film has been drawn criticism for being ""too soon"" in depicting a dramatization of the events of 9/11, and even for being too disturbing for some. To put it mildly, it's not an easy film. The way that Greengrass ends the film alone marks it as enough to make some in the audience just ball their eyes out with tears. But, again like Rossellini and other filmmakers assured with their intent in the depiction, it's not the kind of film that tries to cheat its audience like too many Hollywoodized bio-pics do. The film starts off mundanely, and then pits into a kind of tunnel of consciousness of the situation at hand. It's truly the kind of work that isn't afraid to provoke a response out of its viewers, which (as an American) was all the more rewarding for me. Like many great films, it asks underlying questions while still working as a piece of storytelling and action, and even through the shaky camera one never wants to look away. In short, I recommend the film to, well, just about anybody, even to those who think of the subject matter as being too taboo, which it is not at all. Stripped from the usual abstractions association in the years following 9/11, it's a peak that Greengrass may never be able to reach again. And so far as of fall 2006, the best film I've seen this year."

I'm not saying that it wasn't a good movie. It was definitely a really great film; but I'm not sure it should have been released just yet. I think it did a good job showing what went on behind the scenes. It helped to fully explain what was happening with the military and with the F.A.A. It also showed, what I consider to be, the ineptitude of our national security."

","People that say the facts are incorrect need to go back and research the immediate phone calls made from the civilians and staff on flight. They have actual recordings of people from United 93, and it's chilling. They are not calm, they are in distress and clearly shaken. This film recalls unfortunate events from a tragic time in American history. I don't view this film as entertaining/means of entertainment. It's important to take this film as an unfortunate means of education. To remember what happened that terrible day in history. All the people that lost their life on that terrible day. This movie is specified to flight 93. They overtook and crashed the plane into a field in a plan to insure nobody else would lose their life that day. They knew whatever they did, they were going to lose their life, so they sacrificed their life. Who knows what would've happened if they didn't act on the decision they made. Thousands of others could have passed away. They made a sacrificial choice, to save others, many others. My thoughts are with anyone and everyone that had to deal with a loss from that day. But please, don't be a negative critic on such a important/realistic part of history. They did everything they could to make this as realistic as possible. As terrifying as it is, it's reality. Don't go into this movie as entertainment. Go into it as reality."

","Knowing the outcome does not help ease the tension one experiences while watching this movie. I've waited a long time before seeing this film since one's senses were inundated on that infamous day, with ubiquitous follow-ups and documentaries to capture the horror of 9/11. Besides confirming the heroic actions of a handful of airline passengers who decided to take fate into their own hands, one will come away with an appreciation for the tough job air traffic controllers have in maintaining order in the skies. I don't know if it still holds, but at one time, air traffic controllers held an unenviable first place for suicide rates among all occupations. The unbelievable stress these folks must have experienced that day was palpable on the screen. I particularly appreciated the way the principal aviation officer took control and made decisions that were correctly concerned with saving lives rather than worry about the business aspect of shutting down flights as a result of the chaos resulting from the Twin Towers being struck. What's personally troubling to me is how some of the reviews on this board disparage the real heroes of that day and how so many are quick to accept a government conspiracy behind the downing of the Twin Towers by our own government. Yeah, I've heard them too and they reek of unbridled nonsense. Aside from the 12/7/1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, there's no personification of evil greater than the cowardly act of those terrorists on 9/11/2001, a day of infamy that Americans should never forget."
"cleary-joshua","9","2","3","26 January 2014"," I feel like this is the only 9/11 movie I need to see...
","There are some events which are clearly ingrained into our minds, and especially into the American psyche (or so I would guess, being British myself). Events such as the Apollo 13 mission or JFK conspiracies have both been portrayed on film extremely successfully, and both of these films (""Apollo 13"" and ""JFK"") seem like the only representations of those events that need to exist. Even if not completely accurate, they are the only films of these events that we need. 9/11 is an event which is still stuck in our memories, and has been portrayed in a countless number of movies. However, having seen ""United 93″, I feel like this is the only one that I need to see.<br/><br/>The film does not focus on the two planes that flew into the World Trade Centre, or the one that flew into the Pentagon. It focuses on a lesser known story – the fourth plane. I think this was exactly the right decision. I've certainly grown up with the very familiar images of smoke coming from both towers, and it's a story which I feel I know very well. The fourth plane is much less well known, but it's a story which should be told more: one of heroism in the face of a horrible fate, and people who gave their own lives to save so many others.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is exactly the right director to have made this film. The documentary-like style which he has shown off in ""Captain Phillips"" and the ""Bourne"" movies fits this perfectly, throwing you into the action not only on the plane, but also into the control rooms. He makes you a part of the event, giving you a very real and harrowing sense of the fear felt by the passengers and the chaos of those on the ground. The actors are all newcomers, and many of those on the ground play themselves. There's no sense of celebrity, but that these are real people, making things all the more realistic.<br/><br/>It's a tricky film to watch in many places, somewhat inevitably because of the nature of the event, but ultimately worth it in trying to understand what people must have felt being on that plane. The one place where the film could suffer is in its ending. Because the event is recent and familiar, we all know how it's going to end. The final few minutes are nothing less than brilliant and emotionally charged as you know what's coming. Greengrass takes an enormous risk in ending the film where he does, but it pays off, and you leave the film feeling that he was right to do so. He in no way glamourises the event, and it's the harsh realism which he brings to the film that makes it such a worthwhile watch."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","27 October 2011"," Powerful, masterful filmmaking.
","United 93 is rarely mentioned when great cinema of the last few years is talked about. It isn't hard to see why. Films of this nature that are based on incredibly large disasters can always be criticized for different aspects. This is a very vulnerable subject, and a film like this can very easily step into melodramatic or overwrought fare. Which is why United 93 works so well. It doesn't.<br/><br/>Technically, the film's cinematography captures the tension and sadness of such a day perfectly because it allows for a more realistic connection. There is where trouble could brew. If a film like this was shot in a very stylized manner, or even in a way that people would say resembles a regular film, well of course it will get complaints. It is very difficult for the audience to separate a film from the event it is based on, especially the event that is he single worst day the United States ever had. United 93 never wants to make it a regular film though. It isn't emotionally-manipulative either. It carefully captures the events and reactions to that day. Not only are the sections inside the plane gripping, but the ones outside as well. Not once did I question any shot or scene. But then again, we have to remember the tragic event it is based on, and memories come flooding by. <br/><br/>I am giving the only perfect score of 2006 to United 93. It definitely is hard to watch and to grasp, but it isn't a completely melodramatic affair (uhm, Titanic... although to be fair that one is merely fiction in its central plot) and it definitely is engaging and completely gripping. Also to note the music score, which is only used softly at times and for the most part the lack of it allows us to be absorbed into the reality better. As a stand-alone film it is fantastic as well, even with perhaps imagined events."
"spiden","Null","2","3","5 December 2009"," This is not art, this is storytelling.
","As six billion people in the world conduct their daily duties, a handful of Muslim extremists are carrying out their last prayers before they cause one of the most infamous cataclysmic events in recent world history.<br/><br/>Regardless of your views toward the subject matter, Mr. Greengrass chronicles the stories of United Airlines' Flight 93 with undeniable skill in his craftsmanship. The product of his efforts (and those of the brilliant cast and crew) is United 93, a gritty and blatantly created film that attempts solely to tell its story, rather than rely on the rules and tricks of Hollywood to draw massive sums of cash into the studio's coffers. The director has definitely surpassed his Bourne installments (terrific popcorn flicks notwithstanding) and showed the utmost respect for the victims of the United 93 crash--including the Muslim hijackers, drawn into the horrific business through extensive manipulation.<br/><br/>As I noted before, the cast is superb, as various emotions display on their faces with perfect precision. It isn't long before the viewer is sucked into the reality of the story, and cares for each passenger. Stereotypes are not used, in contrast to entertainment pieces like Air Force One in which there are distinct heroes, villains, cowards, damsels in distress, etcetera.<br/><br/>Though you know the depressing outcome of the fateful hijacking, you still root for the passengers to stop their oppressors. Visual junkies will be respectfully denied your doses of TNT and green screen, the only explosions here are through news footage of the tower's collapses.<br/><br/>And, as I comfort myself with a viewing of Men in Black after seeing this, I warn you that United 93 is not an easy sitting. Some less resilient moviegoers will be sobbing in your respective fetal positions by the film's climactic final seconds, and most of you will feel compelled to keep the DVD in your player until the credits stop rolling.<br/><br/>I can't see a purpose to rate this film. It was not created for the sake of artistic creativity, but to tell the story of United 93 with accurate juxtaposition to the actual predicament."
"johcafra","9","2","3","20 November 2008"," The Fact Is
","NO ONE knows what happened on board the subject flight. We can only infer. We know only the outcome. If you keep THIS fact in view you need not worry over how good a documentary this film appears or pretends to be.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass did not set out to make a documentary. He said so from the outset. He says so in his DVD commentary. If others call into question his detachment, perspective, integrity or sense of timing I commend him for his skill, tact and honesty. Was he opportunistic? If you make a film it had better be about something you care very much about. No matter what he had aimed for he had to know the end result would be viewed through the lenses of many others who knew what they thought had happened. Faced with this challenge his direction, writing and editing earned their professional recognition.<br/><br/>It's hard enough to move within a Boeing 757 when it's powered down on the tarmac. And try sitting through a transcontinental flight on a clear day with your eyes volitionally closed from takeoff to landing. For these reasons Barry Ackroyd's photography deserves special praise. It strives to emulate what you would see and the way you would see it if you were on board.<br/><br/>The sound and sound editing are spot on. John Powell's minimalist musical score is sobering and complements the film perfectly, for without the stream of images I find the score unlistenable.<br/><br/>Before James Cameron's film, when I'd heard a Broadway stage musical version of the Titanic disaster was in production, I'd thought the effort at best supremely callous. That view changed when I later learned the cast members, without prompting or compensation, visited the families and descendants of the victims each was cast to portray as well as the very few remaining survivors and their families. The results showed on the stage. It appears a very similar approach was taken here.<br/><br/>Should the film have been released first-run as a commercial feature let alone made so soon? It's been seven years as of this writing. We are at times blessed with short memories and faulty recollections. The events were thrust upon us. The film is not, for one either views it or doesn't. That should always be a choice resorted to and exercised with gratitude."

In his unique documentary-style way, Paul leads us on a journey that we all know the outcome to, yet manages to completely submerge us in the story. I found myself at times rooting for the passengers and hoping they'd prevail even though I knew better. That's how compelling this film was for me. As a jaded film professional, I have to say that this really doesn't happen all that often.<br/><br/>Additionally, I have to make mention of the outstanding work by my colleague (in arms) Barry Ackroyd who photographed this picture. It takes a lot of discipline and focus to create an artificial sense of reactive camera work as he did in this film. I know Paul Greengrass is known for barring camera crews from blocking and rehearsals, then bringing them in to shoot off the cuff in order to preserve a certain honesty in the camera work, and this really translates an earnestness into the camera work. As a trained professional, I have to comment on how exceedingly difficult it is to discipline yourself to allow your guys to break all the rules. Absolutely flawless, Barry. My deepest respect (I really enjoyed ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" also).

","Like many, I was skeptical about how the first movie regarding 9-11 would be treated. I expected a typical Hollywood rant with information either distorted or exaggerated looking to ""Cash In"" on America's biggest terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>This film does none of those things. It is a caring, sensitive, piece of real-life horror that depicts that essence of human suffering and sacrifice. Many scenes are so powerful even when you KNOW what is coming, like a terrible accident that you can do nothing about. But still, the viewer's eyes are transfixed to the screen the whole time.<br/><br/>Regardless of your political affiliation, and how you may feel about the war now, the film never takes any political sides, or preaches to the viewer any kind of political agenda. United 93 is a story about how the entire world changed on that horrible day. The film shows the chaos and madness that seems to demonstrate that horrifyingly, the terrorists on that day were more organized than the military, airports, traffic controllers, or security personal, who were supposed to prevent such a tragedy in the first place.<br/><br/>You will be on the edge of your seat most of the time. While no one knows for sure the exact events of what transpired on United 93, the filmmakers and screenwriters did an excellent research job. It will probably be the closest to ""a true account"" of what really happened that day. Some things remain unknown. For instance, based on flight data and phone calls from passengers before the crash, they had planned to overwhelm the hijackers by storming the cockpit. (The film takes this approach in a scene that will LEAVE you cheering!) But the Federal Aviation Administration Commission's report says that they think that the terrorists overheard the passengers planning to storm the cockpit, so they decided to crash the plan themselves. I think the former if it happened makes for a better movie.<br/><br/>There are no bells and whistles or large accolades at the end. United 93 hits the ground and the credits role with subtle music. (A poignant and somber ending.) This is a film about trying to understand and come to grips with one of the world's largest tragedies that affected both the United States, and the rest of the world, in ways that are to this day beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>I give United 93 a 9/10 because there are some issues that will never be known and it's impossible to have perfect accuracy when much of what was said on the plane (if not all the planes) is speculation. However, the filmmakers did an incredible job with this speculation. Many people who were actually involved in 9-11 participated in the making of this film, from flight crew who played the role of passengers who worked for United Airlines, to air traffic controllers, who were on duty that day Using real people gives the film even greater depth and meaning, making United 93 more of a documentary than a film. THIS IS A MUST SEE!"

The whole event seems to be played out in real-time, and also include the actual traffic control chief who was working that day.

","...has yet to stand the test of time, but so long as the sting of 9/11 still tingles beneath the skins of many Americans (and no doubt many non-Americans as well), ""United 93"" will remain a potent, though perhaps increasingly dated, piece of film-making. Writer/director Paul ""Bourne"" Greengrass has put together a riveting recreation of the fate of the one hijacked airliner that didn't reach its target on September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>Utilizing a cast of virtually unknown actors along with scores of actual participants in the events of that watershed day, Greengrass lays out a progression toward inevitable tragedy that begins with the terrorists' early morning preparations and ends, as we know it will, with the crash of flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Along the way, he details the breakdown of human systems when confronted with the utterly unexpected, reflecting the breakdown of systems that led to the 9/11 attack in the first place. It makes for fascinating viewing.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat surprised to see that ""United 93"" has such a high rating here on the IMDb. As of this writing, it places #237 in the Top 250, with a 34.7% ""10"" rating and 81.5% ""7"" or better. It's also garnered an unusual 7.8% ""1"" rating, which I attribute to the highly political nature of the subject matter. Sensitive teenage girls to the side (180 of them gave it a mere aggregate of ""5.9""), it would seem that a significant portion of the ""United 93"" audience was not yet ready for its portrayal of real-life sacrifice, despite the well-publicized approval and support of the families of the dead. Either that or a fair number of aggrieved Muslims slammed it.<br/><br/>Personally, although I don't feel ""United 93"" has much in the way of repeat viewability (and, yes, Greengrass' DVD commentary is fairly boring), the film still does what it does with great craft and respect for the dead. No one really knows, of course, what happened on board the ill-fated aircraft in those final minutes before it tore itself to pieces across the Pennsylvania countryside, but Greengrass' version rings true, leaving his audience inspired by the strength of human determination in the face of certain death. We never really get to know individuals in the story all that well, but we are nevertheless drawn into their predicament inexorably, ending up rooting for them to transcend history and survive the day. I was also glad to see that Greengrass avoided demonizing the terrorists, who were, after all, little more than willing, though horribly deluded, pawns in a high stakes game of realpolitik.<br/><br/>It should be noted (if it hasn't been somewhere on this board already) that the documentary included on the DVD release, ""United 93: The Families and the Film,"" is very worthy viewing in its own right. It is, in fact, more emotionally engaging than the film itself. Make no mistake, though; ""United 93"" packs a powerful punch, but more so by pulling us back to that surreal day with its you-are-there storytelling rather than invitation to empathetic sorrow.<br/><br/>At any rate, it remains to be seen if ""United 93"" will maintain its position in the IMDb Top 250 as new viewers rate it from a greater and greater temporal distance from the events it depicts. Ultimately, it's a fine piece of film-making, fully deserving of all the awards it has won and will win. Unless you're one of those ""it's too soon"" folks, ""United 93"" is requisite viewing, if only to understand how the human spirit can remain triumphant in the face of its own inevitable destruction."

","United 93 is a disturbing and hard to watch film about the attacks in America on September 11, 2001. Everyone knows what happened on that fateful day, but this film brings it to life remarkably.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you know, four planes were hijacked on September 11 2001 and three of them reached their targets. However, this film is about the fourth plane; United Airlines 93. That plane never made its target because of the strong will of the innocent passengers on board who caused the plane to crash in a field near Pennsylvania instead of its intended target, the White House.<br/><br/>I believe everyone should see this film. It is a strong account of 9/11 and deserves a lot of credit.<br/><br/>You might find this film very hard to watch, especially if you have some kind of connection to the people who lost their lives on 9/11.<br/><br/>I came out of this film feeling very sad. I didn't say much. I was thinking about these poor innocent people. The saddest thing about this film is that it is all true. At least most of it is. Director Paul Greengrass based this film upon the last recordings from the cockpit cabin and the telephone calls made by the passengers to their loved ones.<br/><br/>The cast of mainly unknown actors was each given studies of the people on Flight 93 that they were playing. Families of the passengers and crew members killed on United Flight 93 cooperated in the production of the film.<br/><br/>They offered Greengrass detailed background information about their loved ones. They even told them what clothes they wore and what they read, listened to, or even might have eaten on the plane.<br/><br/>The film is not only about what happens aboard the plane. It also shows what happened in the air traffic control rooms and the reactions by people who witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Centre.<br/><br/>I liked the acting by the unknown ensemble cast. I think it was better to not cast known actors in this film."

","I went to see ""United 93"" having heard excellent reviews. My expectations were, therefore, very high. I can only say that as high as they were, they were totally exceeded. This is a GREAT film.<br/><br/>This movie (which is done in a documentary style, which is totally effective) grabbed me by the throat, and held me in its grasp until the very end. Indeed, I (and the other audience members) sat stunned in our seats as the credits began to roll. I wasn't aware of tears on anyone's part; the reaction was one of utter shock, of having been almost pulverized emotionally by the experience--an experience beyond tears.<br/><br/>The thing about United 93 is its utter believability. I had the sense that THIS IS THE WAY IT HAPPENED. Naturally, no one can know what each person said, or did, during that unspeakable time. But there is no doubt in my mind...remembering, of course, that every witness to the actual events on United 93 is dead...that this is as close as one can possibly come to knowing what these tragic/heroic individuals experienced.<br/><br/>I shall never forget this film."
"ppandkv","10","2","3","5 June 2006"," United 93 is a stellar film-making achievement
","Director Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"" is a magnificent film, both in it's artistic accomplishment, and it's success in creating an emotional experience that should quell critics who believe the story's telling is coming ""too soon"". It takes a filmmaker of brazen courage and extraordinary skill to tell the story of the passengers, terrorists and air-traffic and military personnel that held us transfixed on September 11, 2001, given how socially relevant the events of that day still are in our daily lives. Greengrass has crafted a film that honors the real-life people of 9/11 without an ounce of exploitation. I am a huge fan of an earlier film of Greengrass's called ""Bloody Sunday"", which depicted the civil rights march massacre in Ireland that bolstered the IRA's political presence. It was called ""documentary-style"" film-making by many critics, with a roving camera, presumably never weighed down by a tripod, wonderfully realistic acting, and a script with overlapping dialogue that never once rang false. All of these aspects are used to eerie effect in ""United 93"", as the film never condescends to present you with pedestrian movie gimmicks to force a feeling on you. Greengrass is much smarter, as his cinema verite style percolates in the extreme ordinariness of the first few hours of that fateful day. Pilots arrive at the terminal, chatting unimportant banter, passengers check phone messages, the FAA operations manager trudges into his first day on the job. The inevitability of our knowledge of the fate of these people simmers underneath it all. Greengrass' fly-on-the-wall style doesn't announce ""Great moment of the film coming!"" or pander to labeling the passengers from Standard Disaster Film Catalogue #1, enabling unbelievability with witty dialogue. The material demanded more. ""United 93"" achieves much more by immersing you in the chaos and confusion in the flight towers and military bases of the east coast, and strapping you in as a passenger of the doomed flight. Much has been made of the fact that the film boasts no stars. This is a great asset, as no baggage marred my ability to get to know the characters just as they got to know each other. In fact, many of the roles in the film are played by the people who experienced 9/11 firsthand, the boldest performance coming from Ben Sliney, who plays himself as the FAA operations manager, whose day slips into turmoil as he's constantly fed misinformation about hijacked planes, and underserved by a military presence. Sliney also served as a consultant to the film to help Greengrass re-create the order of the day most accurately. And as I watched hundreds and hundreds of shocked and frantic FAA controllers and military personnel scramble to prevent further harm to the country and await chain of command orders from the highest levels of government, I once again hope George W. Bush really enjoyed ""My Pet Goat"". Military response orders arrived from the Executive branch well after the fourth and final plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The film-making is so good, I almost expected a different outcome, I was so emotionally invested. After viewing the film, I was visibly shaking. It prompted a 90 minute conversation with my friend Kevin about religion and politics and reawakened in me an immediacy to be involved in the world view. Normally, when I write a review, I just say whether I liked a movie or not, but with ""United 93"", I am highly, highly recommending you SEE IT. This is easily the year's best film and one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's an important reminder of what happened that day, so when you see a ""We Will Never Forget"" sign, you can further understand. This film is a noble reminder that the greatest, most honest and most successful retaliation against terrorism since 9/11, happened immediately."

","This movie was so epic I just had to write a review at 2:17 AM after midnight, I just had to. <br/><br/>I've read prior to watching the film the true events of the United Flight Airlines 93 and really didn't knew there was a 4th plane in 9/11. Cause when we always talk about 9/11 between people, our minds always goes straight to the World Trade Center and casually mention that Pentagon was attacked too. But wait, there was a 4th planned attacking the United States Capitol that didn't go through. And the reason to find out why? The passengers on the United 93 Flight FOUGHT BACK. Oh I was so proud of humanity and the spirit of those people fighting the good fight, and saddened that they didn't make it. <br/><br/>So when I watched the film, was the just as the same as reading the transcripts and the events that occurred. True caption of the feelings between the passengers and the terrorists also, that intensity, pressure, feelings going through their bodies fighting one side to live, the other to end life. <br/><br/>I mean what can I say other than ... IT'S AUTHENTIC. It's like I was there, right there with them in that room and I'm just watching their next move, their fear, overcoming that fear, fighting, that last second when everything is over. Ahhh I was horrified and satisfied from this experience. As I read a review about this earlier it said in a title: Horrifying to watch but worthy for generations to come. <br/><br/>Everything is explained right down to the last detail, and you're not bored even a little bit, especially the last part... will truly move you and touch deep down that place we all know it's a human being there. 9/11 WE NEVER FORGET! <br/><br/>True heroes, salute to United 93 <3"

","United 93 takes us back to the dark hours of the September 11th attacks bringing back anger, sadness, and fear but with thought a sense of hope, I say this due to United 93 showing us the events within the hijacked aircraft. Call sign United 93 with us already knowing the outcome of the first three hijacked planes this is the story of the forth, as the tagline reads Director Paul Greengrass was able to write and direct a movie that needed no explanation. But did require him to show us what by the end of the movie I had realised, was just how evil and inhumane members of humanity can be but still giving us the positive aspect. Being that when faced with destruction those with courage became the embodiment of the definition of humanity, defending others despite realising the eventuality of their lives being lost to protect and defend others. The darkest aspects of humanity were shown on that day but also the valiant aspects had emerged to, this is what I had taken away from United 93 this is what we can all realise after 1 hour and 51 minutes. Not the quality of the movie that was made, but the message that is being displayed, historical events depicting in film are like finding a four-leafed clover so finding the message within the movie is the objective set for the viewer."

"ajs-10","Null","1","1","11 September 2011"," Thought provoking and quite emotional...
","If the events depicted in this film were entirely fiction then nobody would believe it was possible that such monstrous acts could be committed. I remember the events of September 11th 2001 very well and I recall being totally shocked as I watched it unfold on various TV news channels. I saw this film soon after release and it provoked quite an emotional response; ten years after those terrible events it still has the same effect on me. I'll tell you a little about the film before I give you my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>United Airlines flight 93 is due to take off from Newark and fly to San Francisco. We are shown the crew boarding the plane and making preparations for the flight, at this stage it's almost like a 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary with idle chat about the weather and everyday things. The passengers then board with more of the same, it's just another ordinary day on an airline. Except for the four terrorists that plan to take over the plane and crash it into an unspecified target. Attention is split between these events and the goings on at the various air traffic control centres along the eastern seaboard of the United States. As two plane crash into the World Trade Centre and one into the Pentagon we see how they deal with the situation and how the military get involved. This takes up a good two thirds of the film. The final third concentrates on events aboard United 93 as the terrorists take charge and the passengers, finding out about the other events of the day, decide to fight back.<br/><br/>As I've already said, I found this quite an emotional experience, particularly when various passengers are saying goodbye to their loved ones over the phone. It's also very thought provoking, the opening scene is of some of the terrorists praying in their hotel room before setting off in the morning. Something I found quite peculiar given the act they were about to carry out. Isn't religion supposed to be all about getting along with your fellow man? OK, I'm going off topic here.<br/><br/>The film does appear slightly uneven, but then again, trying to fit all the events of that day into 111 minutes can't have been easy. It's very well made with, as I've already said, almost a documentary feel to it for much of the screen time. In fact, many of the Air Traffic Controllers are played by the actual guys that were doing the job that day. As the film gets to events on the plane we get a more dramatic feel to the narrative and this is the most powerful part, I feel. Either way, if you witnessed, or heard the events of ""9/11"", as it's known in America, and even if you didn't, I very highly recommend you watch this film.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.8/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 51,244 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 200 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>FAVOURITE QUOTES:<br/><br/>Honor Elizabeth Wainio: Hi mom, it's me... this really kind woman handed me the phone and told me to call you.<br/><br/>(last title cards). <br/><br/>Title card: Of the four aircraft hijacked that day, United 93 was the only one that did not reach its target. It crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03am. No one survived. <br/><br/>Title card: Military commanders were not notified that United 93 had been hijacked until four minutes after it had crashed.

","One of the most discussed things, when this movie was made, was the question, if this movie was made too early. How could someone try to capitalize on the grieve of others and so forth. But the families knew about this movie and as far as I know most of them wanted the story of their lost ones to be told. So why should we argue about this movie then? <br/><br/>It's quite impossible that you don't know what happened on ""9/11"" at this point, but in a few years there will be teenagers and then adults who weren't born when that tragedy occurred or were too young to remember/realize what was happening. This movie will give them as near a picture of that as it is possible. The aim here is to keep it as real as possible! And that's why there is no political statement that is made here (neither for or against a view) nor are characters (= real people) glorified or being made fun of. It's almost a documentary. And that's why although this movie is good, it might be too hard for some people to watch/bare ..."
"MarshallStax","5","7","18","29 April 2006"," Just the facts; no drama
","Writer/director Paul Grengrass chose to go with a straightforward, home-video style with this film. There is no attempt at finding stories or meaning, no plot to speak of. Things simply happen and then it's over.<br/><br/>By going with a barely-compressed time frame which denies the audience a chance to see into the lives of the people involved before the events play out, we are denied involvement with the emotions of the characters from anything but a superficial, fly-on-the-wall standpoint.<br/><br/>Greengrass chose to focus narrowly in this movie on air traffic controllers and the passengers on United 93, none of whom we ever really get to know.<br/><br/>Frankly, while the finished product is probably exactly what Greengrass was after, a far more remarkable film could have easily been made of this event. But is it still too soon? For a ""real"" movie, yes. But this thing is respectful to a fault, except perhaps in the implicit condemnation of the US's leadership in a time of crisis. That very carefulness, that presentation of everything in as neutral a light as possible, ultimately leaves an empty hole that will probably bring very few viewers the catharsis they bought a ticket to seek.<br/><br/>If this were a work of fiction, it would be a very minor release. If it had ever been made at all.<br/><br/>A final comment: I for one am sick to death of watching camcorder-style photography in big-buck movies. Focus, steady shots, action that's not rendered an incoherent blur, smooth zooms instead of quick, jerky, ""my first video with this new camera"" pulls and pushes: is it really too much to ask for?"

It is documented that this flight landed and did not crash. Why is no one speaking on it and why are all the posts that mention it deleted????? This is not cool whomever is behind it.

","Much controversy has been with United 93 since it's inception sometime last year. The ""too soon"" mentality of those who see that films exploiting or depicting those horrible events of September 11, 2001 is here. The second film about 9/11, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, will be in theaters later on this year. There's no need to go over the plot points of the film. The world already knows it. From the opening scene of the four hijackers reading from the Koran to the descending plane which ultimately crashes, United 93, is a mesmerizing, unforgettable, and heart-wrenching masterpiece. This docudrama was directed by Paul Greengrass, a director who got to know the families of the victims that perished from the plane. He tells us the story with sensitivity, and does the enormous feat of honoring those who fought back realizing that the plane was not going to be ""turned around"" but was being used as a missile for an American landmark (one of the terrorists taped a picture of the Capitol in the cockpit). <br/><br/>There are no back stories to be told. Everything is told from the morning of September 11th forward. There is no mention of Osama, Iraq or even terrorism. We do know of a few key characters but we know nothing of them. They are all portrayed in the moment, going about their business, waiting at the airport terminal, getting on the plane, making friendly conversations, flight attendants making sure everyone is buckled, pilots having their morning orange juice. Scenes on-board the plane are inter cut with traffic control centers and military command rooms. Amazingly, some of the people actually play themselves. The third act of the film harbors over some of the passengers realizing what's happening as they figure out that the pilots, a flight attendant and a 1st class passenger have been brutally killed. Pieced together from taped recordings from passengers calling their loved ones and one flight attendant getting a hold of a United mechanic, the devastating scenes of the passengers attacking the hijackers are some of the most intense of any film I've ever seen. Some of the passengers, as they call their loved ones will pull at your heart strings. As one woman tearfully ends a conversation with a loved one, she hands her cell phone over to a young woman and says, ""Here, call your people"". It is all quite emotional. <br/><br/>I must admit, I was an emotional wreck after viewing United 93. Greengrass has created a powerful, gut-wrenching, and courageous movie experience. Like that of The Passion of the Christ and Schindler's List, everyone must see this film at least once. It is a draining experience and extremely difficult to watch. But it's as important as any movie theater experience you'll ever have."

","This is an outstanding movie, certainly one of the very best I have ever seen! Although we know the eventual outcome, the movie is an edge-of-your-seat nail-biting thriller. The important message is that this is not simply a tale of sacrifice. Enough time had elapsed that the passengers were able to learn what was in store for them if they did not act. Those Americans processed the information they had available to them, formulated a plan, and carried it out with amazing courage and bravery. The intention of the passengers and crew was to take back the plane and to save their lives. That they were not ultimately successful in this endeavor makes the act no less courageous or admirable. What amazing people, those ""Ordinary"" Americans!"

","United 93 is a tribute to the men and women who died that day. It is easily the most powerful film in years and it is also deeply moving. Never in all my years have I seen a movie that literally made me feel the way I felt during this movie. I found myself praying that they would make it but I knew the end and I knew there was no stopping it. It was hard to watch the final 20 minutes of the movie. Seeing the passengers call their loved ones and wish them goodbye had everyone in the theatre in tears and some people had to leave the theatre for a few minutes to compose themselves because it was simply to much. The attack on the terrorists is excellently shown and done. The last shot will probably keep you in your seat for a few minutes because your just shocked.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie most people stayed in the theatre for a few minutes longer to compose themselves. I was one of them. Then we all just stood up and gave the movie a standing ovation. Something I have never seen happen before at the movies. People left the theatre feeling the same way they did on that day. I sure did. I also felt this way during the movie. I wanted revenge, I wanted to avenge these people and yet I knew there was nothing in my power I could do to save them.<br/><br/>All in all Greengrass has done an outstanding job. I believe all Americans need to see this movie out of respect. These people gave their lives and possibly saved thousands more. To not see this movie is in my opinion saying their sacrifice was not worth it. The least we can do is see a movie honoring that sacrifice. God Bless America!"

His shaky camera operations truly put the audience into the movie, so to speak.<br/><br/>The film starts off with the last prayer of the hijackers of United Airlines flight 93, and then one of its accomplice's saying that ""It's time."" The passengers file onto the plane without any expectations that they would later die that day. Greengrass and his editors take the audience for a ride that alternates between the situation in the plane and the air traffic control centers dealing with other hijackings at the exact same time.<br/><br/>Director Greengrass has commented that he feels it is time that a film can and should be made surrounding the events that occurred on that day, and I for one believe that he is right. The first step toward peace, in my opinion, is to make sure that this will always be remembered, and that such ghastly things should never even be conceived again.<br/><br/>As for the technicalities of the film, I believe that this film, of those made this year, has an enormous chance at being nominated for Best Director, Best Sound, Best Sound Mixing, Best Picture, and Best Editing at the 2007 Oscars.<br/><br/>Overall, this film combines an incredibly strong sense of realism and emotion as best as can be, and to truly understand how incredible it is, one should experience it for oneself."
"Pinkkate123","Null","5","12","30 April 2006"," I'm still shaking
","This was an absolutely intense, emotional, and beautifully made movie. It was incredibly well acted and wonderfully shot. It was, of course, extremely difficult to sit through. In fact I found myself shaking for most of the movie. I saw a few people get up and leave, I guess it was too much for them to stomach. And no wonder. We (of course) all know how it ends, but that doesn't stop us from wanting a different ending and hoping that somehow, the plane wouldn't have crashed. The movie starts off like any normal movie, except for one thing: we are not introduced to one single ""main character"", as you say. Instead, we get a feel for each of the people that comes up on screen (including the ones on the ground trying to make sense of this horrible situation). You are drawn into each and every one of their worlds without ever really having any kind of back story on them. Even though we have all seen the news footage of what happened on that day, it still hits you like a low-blow when it comes up on screen again. When I saw the second plane hit the world trade center, I had the same feelings that I had experienced that actual day of 9/11. It was gut wrenching and my heart sank. United 93 tells the story of the one plane that did not hit its target on 9/11 in the USA. And the movie makes you appreciate life and all of its glory. I don't think there was a single person in that theater with me that was not affected. Normally in a crowded theater, there are people talking amongst themselves and you can hear folks munching popcorn. But not for this movie. It was quiet to begin with, but near the end of the movie, when the credits started to roll, you could hear a pin drop. It just goes to show you the reality of this movie. How it was shot, the way the people on screen came together, and the wishful hoping of a different ending or outcome. All I have to say is: Bravo. And God Bless those souls on that plane."

","I could not get comfortable in my seat. I sat in the rear of the theater, a few fidgety like myself. The film did not make me cry,( as I had initially anticipated. I just became angry. It was sad, but more than that it showed how unorganized and chaotic that day was. The most interesting aspect was that names were not used, as far as when each passenger, gov. employee, etc... addressed each other, just delivering lines, I guess like that day, making perfect sense and less script like. I think in that sense, it felt very real and put the observer within action. It was loud towards the end, I cannot even fathom what they went through, but incredible that passengers had the information that they did and made the decisions to fight back. I found myself wishing I had been part of that team that charged the door. One of the better films I have seen recently."

","Very good movie, but don't go see it with out preparing yourself. I don't remember a more intense time at a movie theater. The way it was shot brings you right into the film. I think the movie actually takes place in real time. The story takes place in the 111 minutes that the movie runs. I was also impressed by the number of people that play themselves in the film. The actors are all unknowns and take a backseat to the story. The film is more than just a memorial to a group of folks who decided to do something in the face of terror. It can serve as a way to bring us together and ask questions, again. I am still a bit conflicted about recommending this movie, however. Perhaps it is too soon for some folks. Perhaps the wounds are still too fresh for some."
"britfilm2005","10","4","9","13 June 2006"," The single most important film of a generation
","Having only watched this film yesterday evening, I can confess to still feeling both numb and emotionally drained by the experience. September 11, as what is now become something of a cliché, started out as a normal day. The pilots, cabin crew and passengers of the four aircraft, their families and friends; all woke that morning without any sense of how dramatically and cruelly their lives would either end or be completely destroyed in a single morning. (Spoiler ahead) Paul Greengrass has captured, in the film's 111 minutes, a brutal and overwhelmingly moving account of September 11 and in particular, the despicable violence inflicted, on United 93 and the fear of the aircraft's passengers and surviving cabin crew. <br/><br/>I found myself, on a number of occasions, breaking down in tears; as the film draws you in to the fear, confusion and desperation of everyone involved. <br/><br/>September 11, 2001 was the day that the world changed and it is important that a film, such as United 93, despite its controversial nature and violence; is viewed by everyone as it is important that the events of that day do not just become a snapshot of CNN images, lodged in one's memory."
"MovieManMenzel","7","4","9","5 May 2006"," ""United 93"" is a powerful and emotional film that stays loyal to the events and people involved in the September 11th terrorist attacks.
","""United 93"" is the first big screen movie version of September 11, 2001. The film focuses on the entire terrorist attack however its main focus is flight 93 which was the last plane that the terrorists took over. This film shows what happened on that unforgettable day and how one flight of incredibly brave people stood up for themselves in an attempt to save their lives. A respectful and powerful film ensues<br/><br/>This is probably going to be one of my shortest reviews ever because everyone in the world knows of September 11, 2001 and this film just basically tells the story of one flight and the people on board who stood up against the terrorists in an attempt to save their lives. With that being said, I will admit this movie was a lot more powerful than I believed it could be. The image of the two planes crashing into the Twin Towers is a powerful image, but at the same time it is overused and I liked that this film didn't make the Twin Towers its main focus.<br/><br/>What I did like is that the film focuses on all the events of 9/11 however the main focus is on this United 93 flight. What this film did was it took you inside this flight and showed all the events that went on. From the four terrorists involved to the all 40 people who were on the flight. The story is very powerful and dramatic yet very respectable for those who lost their lives in this flight.<br/><br/>The thing that made this film work the best is probably the no name cast because it made the film feel more authentic and believable. This is why I am having a problem with the second 9/11 film because it's being directed by Oliver Stone and starring Nicolas Cage. This film worked for a number of reasons but one of the main reasons it worked was because of the no name cast and a director who very few people know about. This really did make an impact. I bet you watch this same movie with Hollywood celebrities in place of the no name cast and you will feel like you're watching a totally different movie. That's why I predict the Oliver Stone project will fail.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about this film was that the director and writer Paul Greengrass took the time to ask the family members about whether or not he should do the film. And after he got permission from the family members, he did his research on the subject. The problem with many films that are based on true events and that Hollywood creates are very far-fetched and not like the actual event however with ""United 93"" I felt it was very realistic and very loyal to actual events. I am not saying that some of it wasn't probably thrown in for a dramatic effect but for the most part since the director did his homework and asked family members, I feel it's a generally a fact based film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really can't say anything bad about ""United 93"" because it was a powerful, respectable, and emotional film based off of the tragic events. I think this is a film that everyone should see and it will probably be a film that will be shown in history classes for many years to come. I can't say that I loved this film because it's not that type of movie. I can't picture having someone say wow I loved that movie, lets watch it again soon. It's a great movie based on a dramatic piece of History that has changed the world forever. It's a must see for everyone.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""United 93"" is a 9/10."
"jc19822000","10","4","9","1 May 2006"," The Most Important film of my Generation
","This was the most moving film I think I will ever see. I liked this film because it did not sugarcoat 09/11/01. It brought back some familiar feelings I had that day fear, confusion, anger, and hope. I thought it was very accurate. I think this is the right time to see this movie while 09/11 is still fresh in our memories. It changed our lives and the world we live in. It made us see what evil and hate can do and how it can change our everyday lives. Those who oppose are entitled to their own opinions, but I think its important for people to face reality and not forget what happened. The acting was realistic, the build up was tense, and the climax was so unforgettable it made it hard to sleep that night after i seen it. Definitely worth at least one viewing to every single human being."
"thatjimguy","8","4","9","1 May 2006"," A truly emotional experience
","I don't think I've had such a profound movie experience since I saw the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan. This film does not tell a story, but rather transports the viewer into the events of that that day. I left the theater with a sense of loss for the passengers of that flight. Like D-Day in SPR I intellectually knew what was going to happen, but seeing it so skillfully brought to the screen I could feel it on a visceral level. I could not help but remember where I was and what I was doing on 9/11. There has been some controversy regarding this film in that some people consider it exploitive. I got no such impression from this film. It deals with the subject matter with the utmost respect. These are real people in a harrowing situation. There are no Hollywood heroics in this movie. I am thankful that I have never found myself in any situation remotely similar to this, but if I ever do, I sincerely hope that I can comport myself a fraction as well.<br/><br/>If you thought the days of meaningful art had left the cinema, or want a truly emotional experience I urge you to see this"
"sadipepe","10","4","9","29 April 2006"," Interesting way of presenting the story
","It took me a long time to process this film. It has almost a flat affect, and it is so unlike anything I've seen before. Even in documentary form. And it was quite strange to see a film about something so serious, so galling and absolutely devastating, presented so clinically.<br/><br/>But now that I've had a day to think about it, I've decided that I really appreciate the way Mr. Greengrass made the film. His method treats the film viewers with much more respect, acknowledging that when given only the facts (without emotional manipulation and/or any particular slant) we are more than capable of coming up with our own ideas of what went on."
"cparkdj","10","4","9","29 April 2006"," So glad I decided to go.
","Last night, my husband and I did something i was pretty sure we weren't going to do - we went to see ""United 93."" I have to admit, I went a little reluctantly - when i first found out that the film was being made I was outraged. Thought it couldn't possibly be anything but exploitative. Thought it would needlessly open emotional floodgates. Thought it would be fraught with propaganda and skewed viewpoints that would only anger me. Thought that after watching the film, I'd be too frightened to ever get on a plane again.<br/><br/>I was wrong on all counts - and I was so stunned by that, I wanted to share my impressions with others who may have the same reservations.<br/><br/>It occurred to me as I left the theater that I had never before been to a movie that hadn't attempted to manipulate me emotionally. And considering the subject matter here, the fact that this one emphatically did not was, I felt, amazing.<br/><br/>This is, simply put, the story of what happened to and on Flight 93 on September 11th. There is not a trace of Hollywood to be found. No dramatic score, no gratuitous violence or emotional tweaking. It's simple, direct, and realistic. And much of what you see in the film is what happened in places other than on that plane - in the air controllers' tower that was tracking the flight, and at Norad... in fact, some of the actual personnel who were there on that day chose to recreate its events for this film themselves. (If you read the credits at the end, you'll see many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel listed as being portrayed ""as him/her self."" ) This only added to the film's directness.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I'm not going as far as recommending that everyone see it - each of you knows your own sensitivity level, and will have to decide based on that. But if you had some of the same reservations I had, i wanted to assure you that this isn't 9/11 done as an after-school special. It was, I thought, handled and presented masterfully. It's not a redneck call-to-arms, or a sympathy treatise for the terrorists. Neither is it a scathing indictment of our government. The way Paul Greengrass managed to tell this story without a hint of bias or finger-pointing is truly worthy of respect. We plan on buying the movie when it is available on DVD, and asking our children, when it's appropriate for them, to watch it. Because it's a piece of our history that we need never to forget."

It has been nearly 5 years since 9/11 and this film causes you to remember the events as if they just happened. I can understand why some aren't ready for this type of movie yet, but it brings back into focus the mission our country has been on since that fateful day. I highly encourage you to see this film!<br/><br/>The fact that the cast is composed of people who are virtually unknown allows you to focus on the characters portrayed instead of the actors and their individual performances.<br/><br/>All aspects of the film are excellent.

","United 93 brings a gripping intensity to the telling of the story of the September 11 hijackings and a day that changed the world forever. This film is not for the faint of heart - while everyone knows the final outcome of this epic story the telling is so powerful it evokes intense emotion regardless of your political ideology.<br/><br/>All Americans need to see this movie. On 9/11 the first battle in the war on terrorism was fought aboard United 93 by ordinary people who took extraordinary measures to prevent further destruction to our nation. This movie does an amazing job of portraying their heroism with respect and honor.<br/><br/>By my observation, there was not a dry eye in the theater and the feelings of shock and sorrow were palpable. This film brings back the memories of that day and reminds us of the fact that our nation faces a great challenge. The heroes of United 93 faced that challenge with unparalleled courage and I for one am thankful for their sacrifice."

","United 93 is a powerful and a much needed film. It has only been a few years since the events of September 11 but it often feels like many people have forgotten the terrible events of that day.<br/><br/>The passengers of flight 93 were just like us except for the terrorists onboard who wanted to crash the plan into the White House or the Capital building. We should remember that. It can happen again on a plane or maybe the terrorists will be on your train, your bus, your ferry as you go to work and live your life as your normally do each day.<br/><br/>United 93 is a tasteful film and in no way does it exploit the tragedy of 9/11. It is honest and it probably an accurate description we'll ever see the events that took place on that plane. They were heroes and they fought back against the terrorists that day. Tri to see this film. Do not forget them."
"August1991","7","4","9","28 April 2006"," Powerful - Works like a gripping documentary
","If there were no political context to the story, this movie would still be a riveting suspense. From start to finish, it works like a well-made documentary, carefully focused on what happened and when. Throughout, the camera puts the viewer into the scene. The realism is complete.<br/><br/>""United 93"" presents in fact two stories, unfolding simultaneously. The first concerns the events aboard the flight itself. The second concerns the reactions of flight controllers and military authorities on the ground. Many of these latter characters were played in the movie by the actual people. In both stories, the film carefully shows how all these people came to the realization of what was happening that morning. This is the film's leitmotif.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of political viewpoint. Without editorials, the movie simply tells the story. If it has any angle, it is the confusion and slow reaction of government employees on the ground. I don't think it is ""too early"" to make such a movie and I didn't find this movie exploitative. (""From Here to Eternity"" was made in less time, and no one claimed it was exploitative.) If art has a purpose, it surely is to engage a public conversation of events around us. This movie will certainly inspire discussion. As I walked out of the cinema in Montreal, people were already talking."

They also deserve the respect of my not making further unnecessary comments for the sake of it (other than to comply with IMDb's minimum number of lines requirement), so I will say simply that the film is excellent, if harrowing, and should be compulsory viewing."
"ronaldsf","10","3","6","25 March 2010"," Greengrass conducts a masterful study on humanity
","Director Paul Greengrass does a masterful job making viewers feel like they are there. It is more than just the shaky cameras which many newspaper reviewers referred to - it is his sensitivity and portrayal of human emotions, and the choices he makes in what to show on the screen.<br/><br/>It is jarring at first to see that the beginning of the movie is from the standpoint of the hijackers, but this seems to be the only logical choice. After all, we, as viewers watching this after the events portrayed in the film, know what is coming, and it is only the hijackers who know what's going to happen. One of the hijackers is sitting at a chair waiting at the gate waiting for the boarding call, and looks nervously to the man sitting next to him casually conducting everyday business affairs on his cellphone. A flight attendant asks one of the hijackers what he would like for breakfast... Seeing these men and women on the plane, including even the hijackers, portrayed as real people who we can somehow see ourselves being, makes the entire film almost unbearable and impossible to watch.<br/><br/>The scenes from the flight control centers are necessary to bring us back to that day, because most of us were as these people were - horrified observers. The film cuts back and forth between Flight 93 and the flight control centers, until the final part of the movie when we are on Flight 93 entirely.<br/><br/>What is gripping about this film is that it puts us in the minds of the people who died that day. Greengrass paid much attention to details, such as early on in the movie when a passenger looks behind her as she adjusts her seat backward to get more comfortable. The flight attendants put on their heels after having sat during the takeoff, to take food orders from the passengers.<br/><br/>In conventional Hollywood terms, the first half of the movie is ""not very exciting,"" and there is in reality a scant amount of violence when compared to commercial action films. But the film places you so completely and psychologically on the plane that day, that when the first horrors are committed -- in the same real, gritty documentary style the rest of the film is made in -- the violence is stomach-churning and horrifying.<br/><br/>The triumph of the movie is that, as we approach the final minutes and the passengers are aware this a suicide mission, we are still right there with them. One of the hijackers might trigger a bomb strapped to his waist at any second, and no one knows if they'll live to see the next moment. We feel their terror and their struggle to build up their courage. In the final minutes, as the passengers (we) face fate, the film becomes a universal experience. The passengers' terror, determination, and courage are now recreated through film, in possibly the best way it could have been done. Though the heroes on the plane are no longer with us, they live through our thoughts and our memories. A respectful and heartfelt dedication to the passengers of Flight 93."
"martin-edhouse-1","10","3","6","6 September 2009"," Stunning but not sensationalist
","It would be hard to overstate the impact on ones senses and mind of the final minutes of the film United 93. A cacophony of sounds and images fill the screen and our ears. Screaming, cries of desperation, panic and anguish accompany the desperate attack the passengers launch against hijackers who are intent on killing all aboard. Imagine trying to reach and the wrest the controls of an aircraft from a man who can send the plane towards the ground in an instant, but delay the attack for a moment and you will die anyway. That terrible reality faced the passengers and left them no option but to try, even though they must have known they stood little chance of surviving the incident. The film was shown on the BBC tonight and I can imagine living rooms around the country being full of people sitting stunned in their arm chairs at its conclusion. Other comments on this site confirm that my reaction to the ending in particular is a common one. And yet the film does not sensationalise or give the events of that day the Hollywood treatment. Instead in many ways it is understated but always incredibly realistic. The acting was almost too good to be called such. Filmed like a fly on the wall documentary, it felt like we were being presented with snippets of real life action as it occurred. People spoke as real people do in such circumstances. At one point the passengers learn fragments of truth about the other terrorist attacks taking place at the time. But the information is incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and being filtered in from many sources via mobile phones being used by the passengers to talk to loved ones. As rumours spread and word passes round, the same phrases, such as ""The World Trade Centre has been hit"" are repeated over and over again. If one was to read the script one might think the sheer number of repetitions would be ridiculous and yet it accurately conveys how people in such desperate circumstances would seek to inform others around them of what they had learned themselves and accurately portrays how it is natural in such circumstances to repeat something in order to comprehend the magnitude of it ourselves and as a way of comprehending the implications such news has for our own predicament. The film also did an excellent job of representing all the grey areas of human nature rather than resorting to caricature."
"blackburnj-1","10","3","6","8 July 2009"," Staggering and sensitive piece of work
","Paul Greengrass's bold dramatisation of the horrific events of September 11th 2001 was one of the biggest risks taken in cinema in the first few years of 21st century. The importance of the event was undeniable, but the emotions which it had naturally aroused in those personally involved in the story and the vast majority of the world's public made this subject incredibly delicate. However, with this film, Greengrass met the many challenges that came with it and established himself as one of the most talented and important filmmakers of the day.<br/><br/>The power of this film comes almost entirely from the genius of Greengrass and his script, his style and his execution of a brilliant and sensitive piece of film-making. The film is not a simple docudrama (it is so much more than that). It is a true to the events but takes the licence necessary to turn it in to a story with intelligent perception of what happened but an emotional heart which makes this very difficult subject as gripping and moving as it deserves and needs to be. Bravely, however, this film takes on the subject of the hijackers without reducing them to inhuman psychopaths but portrays them as misguided human beings. Before one of them gets on the doomed flight to carry out their terrible plan, he gets on the phone and simply says ""I love you"" – a touch of genuine class from Greengrass.<br/><br/>For Greengrass's sensitive handling of the story he is to be praised (he only proceeded with the film once he had gained the consent of all the families of United 93, who co-operated with his research), but his realisation of the story on screen is the real triumph. His (now much-imitated) hand-held style, which is exhilarating in the ""Bourne"" films, is brilliant here at bringing across the terror and chaos in the air – a style he contrasts with the scenes on the ground were the chaos is viewed through a far more stable and controlled eye. The sheer lack of order and control that occurred on the ground that day with the air-traffic controllers and the federal government is brought home brilliantly, with some of the crucial real life figures re-enacting what happened that day.<br/><br/>All of this would still have been rather pointless had it not been for the power of the story being told. The courage of the passengers is incredibly powerful and a testament to the human spirit which seemed so absent that day. The final part of the film in which the fight back happens is a stupendous bit of cinema. Moving and haunting it is an absolutely perfect ending to an absolutely brilliant bit of film which left me (and still leaves me) speechless, with chills running up and down my spine."
"nturner","10","3","6","9 November 2008"," Sobering Look at Real Heros
","I added this film to my video service queue with trepidation because I tend to shy away from films that exploit real-life tragedies, but it got such good reviews during the time it was in the theaters that I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did because it is truly a rewarding experience.<br/><br/>To me, the events of 9/11 continue to be somewhat surreal in my mind. I sometimes have to remind myself that I, indeed, did see those two towers collapsing on television and think that just a few miles from my home, the Pentagon was laid waste by another attack. But the event of that day that has always been paramount in my mind was what took place in that airplane somewhere above Pennsylvania. That horrible day was surely not lacking in heroes, but those few ordinary people on that plane became, probably, the most extraordinary heroes of the day.<br/><br/>The film is extremely well done in that it does not contain any of those standard Hollywood elements normally associated with films of this sort. Instead, the viewer is given a close-up view of the events in the plane, at aviation tracking stations, and at military headquarters. As a viewer, you feel you are actually there observing the events as they happen.<br/><br/>The depiction of the hijackers reminded me of Paradise Now in that they are not evil devils but simply young men who have been brainwashed in order to carry out a mission of evil and destruction.<br/><br/>For those who rent or by the DVD there is a worthwhile documentary on the disc. It is an hour long and shows some of the actors in the film meeting the family members of the people they portrayed. What the family members have to say, and their lives since the time of the event are engrossing.<br/><br/>This film is very worthwhile viewing that gives further insight into an historical event that will be discussed and debated for many years to come."
"mr_popcorn","10","3","6","21 June 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""United 93""
","Such a powerful film. Director Paul Greengrass recreates the events that happened in the tragic day of 9/11 and he got it spot on. It is so accurate sometimes I'm having a feeling that I'm watching a documentary. Everything in it looked so real, from the air tower controllers to the shaky cam approach, all these techniques were used by Paul Greengrass to his advantage.<br/><br/>The actors did quite well also. I heard somewhere that before production started, Paul Greengrass separated the protagonists from the antagonists, from the hotel rooms to the acting workshops, he isolated one from another to get that strange feeling from the actors. To be honest, it worked quite well. The result is outstanding.<br/><br/>The ending will leave you speechless. The struggle that happened is just too hard to take as a whole. You need to take it one at a time but the director shoved it right down our throats, we didn't even have time to talk nor breathe. It just happened and then fade to black. No questions asked. The film's ending will go down as one of my favorite and this film will go down as one of 2006's best film. A must-see."
"earlygrad06","10","3","6","22 March 2008"," An amazing film honoring the brave passengers and crew on flight 93
","United 93, written and directed by Paul Greengrass, tells the story of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001 when four planes were hijacked, one of which was United Airlines flight 93. Aboard flight 93 were forty passengers and crew members along with four male hijackers. Those four men had the intentions of crashing the aircraft in the nation's capital Washington, D.C. The United Airlines aircraft did not hit its intended target, instead it crashed in Pennsylvania. United 93 shows that in the face of danger people from different backgrounds, cultures, religions and social status can unite for the common good.<br/><br/>While no one truly knows what happened on flight 93, the film does a magnificent job depicting what may have occurred on that tragic day. Although the people on board the flight and those working on the ground were all important to the entirety of the film; I found three characters that were vital to the story. Major James Fox (playing himself), Ben Sliney (also playing himself) and Trish Gates (as Sandra Bradshaw) played their roles very well and made them realistic. While everyone was confused about the number of hijacked planes and where the planes were headed, Major Fox, Sliney and Bradshaw remained as calm as to be expected in such a difficult situation. Another aspect that made the film all the more worth watching was the actors and actresses in it. None of them were famous or even remotely known, which allows viewers to be drawn into the story.<br/><br/>Although there is more diversity among the passengers in United 93, the theme of the film reminds me of the movie 10,000 Black Men Named George. In that film thousands of African-American men were uniting in order to improve the civil and economic rights of black people. The fight may have been very different, however it was very important that everyone come together as one and ""fight"" for what was right or what they believed in. The individuals in 10,000 Black Men Named George united and changed the course of history. The passengers on United flight 93 also worked together as one and prevented certain events from happening.<br/><br/>Music and lighting were key techniques used throughout United 93. Low key lighting was used during key moments and especially in the cock pit of the aircraft. High key lighting showed the importance of the passengers, the unity among them, and possibly to show the heightened awareness that the terrorist had towards the passengers. The music in United 93, which was directed by John Powell, also contributed to the film. The music enhanced the mood and the theme of the film.<br/><br/>United 93 is an overwhelming film that shows the devastation that was witnessed by many on September 11, 2001, and is important because it shows how people can be brought together. The movie is not necessarily about what the government and certain agencies did wrong on that fateful day, but what forty people did that was right. United 93 gave a new meaning to ""United We Stand Divided We Fall."""

This was not an action film, but it was not intended to be one. The scenes in the atc rooms seemed real enough for me. As for the conspiracy theorists, get a life!!"
"mcsheehey","10","3","6","6 June 2007"," Deeply Inspiring Tragic Tale
","We all know the story. We all remember where we were when we heard the news about the terrible tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001. For that reason, this is one of the most important films ever made in the history of American cinema. ""United 93"" tells the gut-wrenching true story of the brave passengers on United Flight 93, and their desperate and selfless act to stop the terrorists on-board from crashing the plane into the capital building.<br/><br/>The beauty of the film is that it does not make any controversial statements about the vent. Nor does it try to spin the story for its own purposes. It simply tells a true story of bravery against all odds. There is no exploitation in the film, nor is there any action simply for the sake of entertainment. Paul Greengrass simply puts forth the story as if we were there on-board or there on the ground. There's no mention of Osama Bin Laden or Iran and Afghanistan. Greengrass doesn't manipulate the characters for his own purposes. He simply shows them for who they truly were: people. Though sad, the film is truly inspiring and I am extremely proud of the passengers aboard that flight, especially after seeing the film. It ends at just the right moment and is almost poetic in a tragic way. This is what a four-star film truly is."
"mOVIemAN56","9","3","6","28 May 2007"," Emotional, powerful will leave you frozen in your seat
","When United 93 started to be advertised in theaters there was one thing I heard over and over again: ""Too soon."" Many could make the argument for the film being to soon but I do not see it this way. I found the film to be very much needed and a very important film in general. This film shows us that though how terrible the events of 9/11 were for the United States, it also shows how there was heroism occurring during these terrible events from ordinary people who were simply on a flight to San Francisco.<br/><br/>The film just follows the events of September 11, 2001 centered around United 93 and its passengers. It also shows in depth the work from air traffic controllers and the military to prevent the attacks though they are virtually unaware of what is happening on United 93. About how the film shows us the passengers and the terrorists on board the plane and what may very well have been happening in ill-fated flight. No one knows for sure what exactly happened, all that is known is that the passengers saved hundreds by attacking the terrorists. I get goosebumps just thinking of the film.<br/><br/>The actors are virtually all unknowns. I did not recognize one face in the film but that does not mean it was not amazing acting. The actors bring out the characteristics and realism needed for the film. The actors are practically ordinary people and the people they portray (all real people, no fictional) are ordinary people. No one is made out to be an overarching hero. They simply decided to stand up for themselves which makes the film even better. No fictional heroes makes a better film in any case.<br/><br/>There are no sappy scenes. Yes we do see the passengers saying their goodbyes to family members, wives, children, etc but this is all true. There are records of this happening and the film simply tells the story how it was, no matter how sad it is. Trust me you will tear up during this film. I'm 25 years old and my girlfriend is 26 and both of us were still not able to hold back tears. The last scene is one of the most emotional sequences I've ever seen. Just powerful and emotional in every way imaginable. I sat stunned after seeing the film.<br/><br/>I only have one complaint with the film. There is a character put on the plane who happens to be German. Well he is made out to be the only man to show appeasement to the situation. He wishes to negotiate with the terrorists whether then attack them. He wants to let them do what they want so they don't get hurt. I believe this was taking the story a bit too far. Details are still unclear about what exactly happened on United 93 and to make a passenger out to be giving into the terrorists I think does not fit when it is clear that the passengers weren't giving into the terrorists and were ready to attack. It doesn't matter if that is what he really felt. They shouldn't have made him out to be this way. They should have just made him to be normal. <br/><br/>Other than that one complaint I have no problems with the film. It is exceptionally powerful. I teared up more then once and was haunted by some of the images, including real footage of the towers burning and being hit by the other planes. The portrayal of the terrorists is done right. Obviously they had been corrupted by Osama bin Laden and no jabs are taken at the Islamic faith by the film which is very important. The film shows heroism can occur even in the worst of times. It also shows that when we work together we can accomplish anything. Islam is not portrayed in a bad way and the events seem to be pin point accurate from the knowledge we have.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Stars"
"jaydub331","10","3","6","26 May 2007"," Gruesome, thought-provoking, and most importantly, evokes admiration for true American heroes
","I can't help but feel ashamed that for quite a while, I wouldn't see this movie. Not because it's horrific, mind you, but because of the fact that I once foolishly assumed that this was exploitative film-making, that not only would it fail to honor the heroes in United 93, but also that it would cheapen the significance of one out of four awful incidents of that tragic day. I absolutely loved the way ""25th Hour"" from Spike Lee handled the 9/11 subject matter: as a background and parallel to the characters' lives. I couldn't imagine watching something that directly dealt with it. I can't say how deeply upset ""United 93"" made me, and yet how proud I am that someone sitting next to me on the subway potentially could have that kind of courage to deal with unimaginable circumstances, I certainly am unsure as to how I would handle something like that. Despite that I knew what the outcome would be, I never stopped rooting for the terrific ensemble cast, and even within the last few minutes, the film provoked a feeling that somehow and some way, the passengers would survive. I remember that when it happened, I was in a college dorm watching the WTC footage live on the television. As gut- wrenching as I felt back then, the scenes that took place at the various control centers made me realize how lucky I was to have the comfort of friends around me as opposed to having to directly deal with the situation. The light small talk that the passengers were having before and after lift-off is very human and very scary: that something very ordinary as talking about your grandchildren with someone sitting next to you could happen within the same few minutes that a hijack would occur. On a side note, I'm still very wary of watching ""World Trade Center"" from Oliver Stone, as I find that his style is ""more is more"", and that he has all the moving parts of a Hollywood Blockbuster that overall lacks humanity. However, I was wrong about this exceptional film, and so it's possible that I may be jumping the gun again. Now though, I at least feel I owe it a viewing to make up my mind."
"nath_j_h","8","3","6","17 January 2007"," Emotional
","United 93 is one of the most emotional - eye opener of a film I have personally seen. United 93 gives you a good perspective on the 911 bombings, detailed with how horrifying the event was. This is a gut churner of a film, which makes you put yourself in the passengers shoes and to think what it must have been like for the hostages on board. The film leaves you speechless and makes you feel lucky for who you are. The film will get a good response from the public (especially the Americans) for the event that it covers as it was a sudden and horrible event that broke many hearts.<br/><br/>A great eye opener, simple but effective - 8/10"
"gary-444","6","3","6","13 January 2007"," Respectful, tense, safe homage
","I approached this film with some trepidation. The US is notoriously flawed, simplistic and introspective in it's international perspective. So I was prepared for a flag waving, navel gazing,sentimental tale safely geared for the home market. I was wrong to do so.<br/><br/>Greengrass tells the story straight in real time, and produces a powerful, restrained tale.Several of the performances are by the real people on the ground, giving it an authenticity which is the hallmark of the production.<br/><br/>The temptation to demonise the hi jackers is avoided, as is the temptation to flesh out the plane victims characters, and backgrounds, for dramatic effect. Balance wins here, dramatic effect however is reduced.<br/><br/>The overall feel is one of a well produced documentary .As such it is a fitting tribute to the people who were unwilling, but heroic, participants in one of the most extraordinary days in modern history. The lack of sensationalism and judgement loses some dramatic power opportunities, but wins in terms of credibility. As an historic document of that day - it is a triumph."

","Just got done watching this film. I was definitely skeptical of it when it came out as I thought 9/11 wasn't that long ago. But my fears were put to rest and this film is quite appropriately right for the time. It is a very strong and moving film and does an excellent job portraying the confusion that filled the day. It doesn't glamorize anything and sticks to all the facts that are known about 9/11. I highly recommend rented this film and watching it by yourself on a night of no distractions. You need to really fully dedicate yourself to the film as it commands your attention. Not only so you can get the full dose of the film but also out of respect for what you are watching and learning."
"snark-16","10","3","6","5 January 2007"," If you're ready
","If you're ready or close to ready to see a movie about September 11, I will strongly recommend United 93.<br/><br/>I have not seen Flight 93, which was made for TV and I have read is much more sentimentalized. This one has not an ounce of sap. It is more nearly a documentary than a feature (of course it is a re-enactment and not a documentary, but it has some of that feel). The DVD extras include 45 minutes of interviews with several of the families of the passengers and crew (they resent the word ""victims""), all of whom gave permission for the movie, and I think all of whom met the actors who played the parts of their loved ones. They got to see it before it was released to the public, and the movie gave some of them a bit more peace.<br/><br/>I saw World Trade Center, which was not bad but was Hollywoodized. This movie has actors we are not familiar with, so we will not be distracted by them, and many of them look eerily like the folks they play. The flight crew and air traffic controllers are played by people who do those jobs in real life, not by actors.<br/><br/>A Oscar nomination for Best Picture is not out of line. Even though we know the plot, we are mesmerized, both by the heroes and the villains. We get a lot of time in the air traffic control centers in Boston, Newark, and a military command center. The scene where the Newark controllers are trying to locate a missing plane and then they see it hit the second tower is indescribable.<br/><br/>I don't say it is a must-see, because reliving that morning is not something everyone is ready to do. But when you reach that place, start with this movie. <br/><br/>It is rated R for violence and ""intense sequences of terror and violence,"" though the distributors will appeal or have appealed. I believe many teenagers are ready to see this. There is maybe one word of profanity. There are some scenes with blood but it is not gory or overdone. The issue is whether a child can handle the fear. Watching the movie, your heartbeat goes up several times (I think I noticed a heartbeat sound effect a few times, but I did not resent it as manipulative like I often do some musical choices). I was gripping the arms of my chair when the pilot tilted the plane to throw off the passengers' attack. I am trying to remember at what age I could have seen this, and been able to separate the fear from the events. Maybe 12 but certainly no younger. Most kids it would be more like 14 or 15. I do not know that they need to change the rating, as it would be a good idea for kids to have parents available to talk to about this movie. I guess since it's seen at home now it doesn't matter so much, but I wanted to describe some of this for folks who might want to see it with their kids."

","****, the first of two major motion pictures depicting 9/11 and the horrific events that would follow. The other being Stone's ""World Trade Center"" and the best of the two ""United 93"" does a top notch job. You would figure it would take on so many aspects, with characters and more plots, and the President. But it doesn't, it settles on people, it's real. These people are strangers to us but we get emotionally involved, that is what makes Greengrass a great writer/director here. He takes real people and makes it work to a well formulated story of heroism. <br/><br/>The story of course about the few passengers about flight 93 who took the courage to defy the terrorist who have hijacked it. Most of the characters played by no name actors, which I love. I am glad I didn't see Tom Cruise in there screaming or over acting on the plane. Another reason why ""United"" works, it has every essence of an ordinary film, almost low budget with a big heart.<br/><br/>This movie does not make fun of the people who lost their lives that day, it salutes them. This movie is beautiful, inspirational and one of the years must see films. I loved this movie and the last 15 minutes will leave you breathless and amazed.

","Tonight as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival I attended a screening of ""United 93"". I was moved by this film in a way no other film has ever moved me. Having had only a scant knowledge of the events surrounding the fourth hijacked plane on that fateful September 11th, the film portrayed so graphically the horrors faced by those poor souls who died on this flight, that I felt almost as if I was there with them - right the way to the tragic end. I do not recall ever leaving a cinema and observing so many other theatre goers who were wiping away tears, and looking as stunned and emotionally ""wrung out"" as I felt myself tonight. To see theatre ushers comforting one another as they sobbed (male and female) openly, and partners locked in supportive embrace while also crying unashamably in public, is a sight I have never encountered following the screening of a film. The impact was so great I am still reeling an hour later, my thoughts, a mixture of sadness and sorrow. For me the ""alarm bells"" are ringing, and the question I have been asking myself for the past hour is this .... If organised religion means acts such as this can be justified, then isn't it time to rid ourselves of such institutions, and to seek faith on a personal and private level? No god could sanction such acts against humanity. I defy anyone with an ounce of compassion not to be effected in some way by ""United 93""."

Didn't the collapse of the towers look sooooo like a controlled demolition? 6)Why has Rumsbvelt got 3 different versions of what he did immediately after the attack? 7)Was United 93 actually shot down? 8)Why did all the normal protocols for incepting planes that communication is lost with not kick in that day. Were they turned off? 9)Who benefited from giving the Bush administration reason to go into the middle east?

","I'm not certain exactly what I expected from this film, but the high quality of the production certainly beat my expectations. United 93 has a very strong feel of reality. It does not feel preachy nor is it forcing a ""tug at the heartstrings"" feeling. It does not even actually take a side. It simply says ""this is what we believe happened"". It portrays real people in a very shocking and terrible scenario as they attempt to identify what exactly is happening and what they can do to correct the problem and save lives.<br/><br/>This was a terribly difficult film to watch because we all know the story and the ending. But, I admire the film makers in the direction they took to simply let the story tell itself. And, they did it with great respect and with tremendous attention to detail. No over-acting, no over-used musical crescendos, but a tremendous amount of action and fine acting. A great script, as well. It may be too early for many Americans to watch, but it is a film I feel comfortable recommending to those who feel ready.

","This nonjudgmental portrayal of the events abroad United flight 93 probably didn't set out to send any sort of a political message. In fact the director went to extraordinary lengths to avoid appearing to have a political point of view. The message came through nonetheless. The message is simple: There are many, many, Islamic Fundamentalists out there who want only one thing out of life -- they want you dead. And they think nothing of killing you for no other reason than being American, or Jewish, or Christian... or anything other than a Radical Muslim. These people are not bearded, turban-wearing, wild-eyed screaming lunatics. They are far too sophisticated and savvy for that. No, they masquerade as students, computer specialists, engineers, clean cut young men you would probably not even notice in a crowd. They are the kind that could call their wife on the phone and say sweetly to her ""I love you,"" then get on a plane and kill thousands of innocent civilian strangers, in the name of God. They could be anybody, living anywhere, doing anything... and that's what makes this movie truly frightening.<br/><br/>The fact that the story is told without and typical Hollywood hype, corny dramatic devices, or other distractions only serves to point out how terrifying the modern world really is. It is made so as a result of this fanatical terrorist ideology. Regardless of your political position, you are forced by this movie to see the fruits of radical Islam. You are forced to see raw evil. You have no choice. There is no way to sugar coat it. These people are evil and must be eliminated, by what ever means are necessary. As the movie makes clear, it comes down to one thing -- it really is them or us. It really is just that simple. You're either for them or you're against them. Our country's very survival depends on it. <br/><br/>I urge everybody to see this fine movie. If you have seen it once, I urge you to see it again. In seeing this movie you will see the truth, and the truth will make you mad."

Instead, I saw a devastatingly real portrayal of the tragic events as they unfolded.<br/><br/>After the first half hour- 45 min. of the film I was by no means convinced of it's quality. I disliked how fast-moving it was. The dialogue was hard to hear and follow. I though some of the ""Actors"" seemed very fake and stupid. Then I realized that we were ALL ""stupid"" the morning of Sept. 11th. Until the action began to get a grip on what had actually happened, which DID NOT OCCUR until the late afternoon/evening of Sept. 11th, all of us, including the air traffic controllers and military, were more shocked and confused than angry and revengeful. <br/><br/>Then the film really got started. Once the endless back and forth confusion of the air traffic controllers and military ended, the film focused solely on the passengers and terrorists aboard flight 93. <br/><br/>I don't know if I can recommend this film to others for one reason- It scared me.<br/><br/>When the plane started going down, I couldn't help but gasping for breath through my tears because I felt like I was aboard.

We don't get to see Todd Beamer kiss his wife goodbye before driving to the airport, we don't get to see Mark Bingham racing with his friend through the streets of Manhattan trying to catch the plane, we don't get to see Jeremy Glick holding his newborn baby in his arms before leaving. Instead we see the terrorists praying and preparing for their mission. If this is a memorial, we should get to know the passengers as more than just names on a picture, we should love them as their loved ones did. They should feel like our family, because in a way, they are. We don't even get to know their names, and we should all know their names. Instead we get a group of strangers on a plane, who died.

We see them praying and preparing. Giving each other comfort. This movie tries to make the terrorists sympathetic characters, and that is a horrible thing to do. In fact, the leader of the terrorists, Ziad Jarrah seems to be reluctant to take over the plane. He is forced to act by his underlings. Hear this Mr. Greengrass: The criminal sociopaths who hijacked that plane do not deserve our understanding or sympathy. They deserve our anger and resentment. They are evil. And evil does not deserve sympathy. Should we sympathize with Hitler, or Pol Pot, or Jeffrey Dahmer? No. We should see them for what they are, evil and repugnant. And any movie that does not portray them as such is a lie. This movie is a lie. There is absolutely no evidence that Ziad Jarrah hesitated in killing people, in fact, he most likely cut the throats of the pilot and co- pilot himself, and later he flew the plane into the ground killing everyone else. In fact, Jarrah took hand to hand combat lessons to learn to be a more effective killer. He was at least as cold blooded as the other terrorists, and to portray him an anything else is not only dishonest, but an insult to the memory of his victims. <br/><br/>#3. The director of the movie does not take the side of the passengers. At the very least he does not make them out to be heroes. At worst, he seems to humanize the vile people who murdered the innocent passengers. At the end, when the prayers of the passengers are inter-cut with the prayers of the killers, that sends a subtle message that they are all the same. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. Killers are worse than their victims, period. How dare they equate the two, however skillfully. <br/><br/>There is much that we don't know about about the events of that day, so it is understandable that the writer and director must fill in the blanks. He could have added words and actions that make the passengers noble and heroic, but he did not. I would suggest that he perhaps re-read the transcript of Mr. Burnett's conversations to his wife, or maybe even watch ""Bravehart"" again. Clearly he has no idea what the term ""noble sacrifice"" means. Or at least, how to portray that in a movie.<br/><br/>This brings me to the question of the hour. Is this movie so bad because the filmmakers were incompetent or is it instead because their hearts were in the wrong place? In my opinion, it is their hearts that were at fault, not their technical skills.<br/><br/>Now is the time to remember, but this film is not worthy. United 93 spits on the graves of my heroes, and I cannot forgive that.<br/><br/>Please join me in this boycott of a movie that does nothing but dishonor the valiant actions of some truly fine Americans."

","This movie portrays the fact that something could have been done to save the original planes when actually they were caught with their pants down with the 1st 2 planes, the story of the united 93 however was quite well predicted.

"HiddenVoice","8","5","13","28 April 2006"," Leaves you shaken.You are likely not to forget this one.Truly remarkable film-making.
","What happened on that plane can never be known.No film could possibly depict the exact situation on that flight.But United 93 uses that event as a back-story and dramatizes it.Paul Greengrass knows that he can't accurately depict the incidents that has taken place on the plane.So,he uses the limited information and gives a dramatic approach to that event with as much realism as he can.So that all that in the film could look real.<br/><br/>I was unsatisfied the way he approached the incident.The sudden rise of the passengers to halt the plane,and the continuous praying of the Muslims.He doesn't know that.He couldn't possibly know if those terrorists really were praying in their last minutes,or the passengers really did join forces and came together to stop the plane so that they could get back to their loved ones.But what he does is that he uses all that and gives us a devastating drama.A drama that will hurt Americans.But it's also a drama that is to be seen by both Americans and the non-Americans.We see how far we have reached from that point to this.We are reacting to the situation with violence.America has come a long way now to eliminate terrorism.And they've failed,just as they failed when the President was informed about the situation and the government didn't take action until it was too late.<br/><br/>Greengrass really is the man who gives a powerful,shocking and painfully disturbing story,regardless if it's true.It hits you.And in the end,you choose to accept all that happens on screen.These men and women just wanted to get back home.They fought back before they died.What did those men and women do to the Terrorists?But then again,what did all those men and women in Iraq and Afganistan and all those Muslim countries that America is fighting war with do.<br/><br/>The reason also to watch this harrowing unsettling film ,in the way MUNICH was , is that the stark realism that is put on the film.It is impossible not to believe the events that were occurring on the plane ,even if they weren't precisely accurate.It's a startling achievement for Greengrass,and I don't care if he did to honor them or just thought of getting an Oscar.He gives you a towering achievement.This is grand and perfect film-making.He takes us deep into the Airline headquarters,and shows us all the operations in detail.How a normal ,regular day begins to unfold into a chaotic ,shocking day.The men both in the Airline traffic control and in the plane,are left totally shaken by the events and so will be the audience.The sheer intensity of the situations scares you at times.It started like any other day,and slowly it descends into a nightmare.The Airline officials couldn't do anything,they were hopeless.They couldn't get approval from their Government,resulting in further tragedies.It just grips you.<br/><br/>It will be a nightmare for those families who watch this film.Especially the final 10 minutes.Which will never be forgotten.It's like a horror movie before you.And makes it even more scarier,because you know what the conclusion is going to be for these men and women.<br/><br/>A look is definitely worth."
"kkkkoooollll","3","29","123","24 April 2006"," Not entertaining
","The movie is made too soon after the tragedy. The movie exploits the tragedy, but not in an entertaining way. There are several episodes in the movie, which are not credible at all, like the episode with telephones, and the bathroom, and the co-pilot stuff. The passenger's behavior is very strange, they act like Hollywood make-out war heroes, although they are supposed to behave just like ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The camera work and the prompts are good, but the directing is flawed. I could not wait for the movie to end, and I regret wasting my time on it. Apart from being absolutely not credible, the movie does not grip you, does not make you feel for the characters, and as everyone knows how it ends, does leave much room for anticipation. I would definitely recommend skipping this one."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","4","4","10","23 September 2006"," A good ending does not equate a good movie
","... which is bad news for The Usual Suspects, but even worse news for 9/11-take United 93 because it is a film that solely relies on its last 10 minutes to be poignant, engrossing and unfortunately even watchable. The rest is a dizzying and visually exhausting fare that besides its shaky camera-work has no even remotely interesting approaches to save it. Even this cinematic device is tiresome as it fails in bestowing its product with that ""intimate"" and Claustophobic feel, and it instead leaves you thinking that a monkey could have shot it  same lack of any clear sense of direction, and the same listless wandering.<br/><br/>This monkey (Paul Greengrass) opens his film with a scene of one of the hijackers  the one with the unibrow  sitting on his hotel bed and reading from the Koran. The next morning, he boards United 93, unites with his fellow hijackers and takes over the plane. Dizziyingly, the story shifts to command centers, traffic control towers and the National Guard who all struggle to work out the situation, shouting numbers at their screens and talking on their mobile phones. Most of the action takes place at the aforementioned stations and not the actual plane (like it should have). <br/><br/>So now we regrettably have 1 hour and a half long hectic, shaky journey of air traffic controllers navigating a pool of numbers, coordinates, transmissions and codewords. Relegating 9/11 to numbers on a screen of course makes this experience detached, listless and cerebral. I'm not saying there needs to be melodrama, but there needs to be some emotion  a subtle scene or two to elicit a psychological response from the audience besides boredom and exhaustion over all the shouted flight numbers.<br/><br/>What is disturbing is not the tragic fate of the passengers on-board United 93, but that IN SPITE of an emotionally-charged premise, controversial circumstances (very early to make a film like this) and intimate camera-work, it actually leaves you cold until the last ten minutes. In these last minutes, Greengrass finally abandons the lofty command centres and zooms in on the passengers on-board the flight  and the result is thankfully a poignant last journey.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"
"slickman120","10","4","10","1 May 2006"," Please, see this film. You'll cry like a baby.
","Last Sunday, two days ago, my mother asked me if I wanted to see a movie. The only thing I wanted to watch was United 93, or I have choices such as RV and Stick It, heh, you get the point. So I went in thinking, yeah I might cry a bit, but given the critical acclaim, I knew I'd at least enjoy the film for what it was. 30 Min. into the film I noticed the superb acting, very impressed by people I've never seen on the silver screen acting better than almost all the 20 mil. actors out there. That point within itself should bring realism and this further more immersed my attention to become lost in its greatness. Yes, greatness. When the footage of the plane hitting the towers flashed before my eyes, I couldn't hold my tears in for the life of me. Greengrass' flow and suspense really pulls in the audience, grabbing them by the neck with emotion and immersion, never letting go. The acting, the camera work, the writing, everything was done with no flaw what-so-ever. By the end of the film, I couldn't take it; I was bawling like a baby, I've never cried like this before to a film, much less even in my entire life. I felt as if I was on board that very plain. No exaggeration at all. If a 20 year old man (me) who stereotypically would never show his weak side, considering I barely cry, cried so hard the entire theatre heard me. I had to go through the back exit so people wouldn't stare. I continued to cry until half way home. My mom had to drive my own car cuz I was so cut up. Now, with that said, I learned something. In the past I THOUGHT I felt for the passengers and families, but after experiencing this film, I KNOW, KNOW what the meaning of Don't ever forget 9/11 was truly about. OK, I admit the very first time I saw the trailer, like everyone else, felt it was too soon. But that's the point, nobody felt this way for Pearl Harbor, even the people who lived through it, given it was a weak film; I was still something people could emotionally relate to. Please people, the only reason you shouldn't see this film in the theatre is because of a soft heart. This film was made with dignity, made with care and attention to detail, with out the goal of making a profit. That is definitely something 99.9% of Hollywood filmmakers can't say. Greengrass can. One last point, I'm an avid film maker and I've seen a great amount of films in my life, lots, and this is by far on of the greatest film experiences I have ever had in my entire life. Please go see this film before it's too late..."

","This was a well-done look back at a day we will all remember. I was especially amazed how the writers/directors took some scenes that, by necessity, were chaotic, and made them make sense.<br/><br/>Now, to be sure, this movie was not, nor was it made to be ""entertaining"", but it seemed to convey the urgency of the day's events and did a good job of changing the victims from sheer numbers to understandable characters.<br/><br/>The ""beauty"" of this movie, if you want to call it that, is that it was a movie that will stick with you (my hands were sore after the movie from gripping my armrest through most of the picture).<br/><br/>This one should be around come Oscar time for Best Picture. Due to the nature of the film, I'm sure none of the cast members will earn any awards; but that simply means that they were doing their job. This movie was about the events and the people. It was not made to call attention to any of the actors.<br/><br/>I would heartily recommend this one for adults. Of course, I wouldn't want any child (or adolescent, for that matter) to relive this day unless they are really up to it.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Paul Greengrass for having the courage to do the movie; and thanks to the families of the victims for sharing their stories with us."
"lanelson1","10","4","10","30 April 2006"," Well done movie
","Well, I went and saw it. There are no spoilers; we all know how the story ended. <br/><br/>The movie itself was well made. The progression of events and the individuals' respective responses, while speculation, was reasonable and believable. The brutality of the terrorists was GRAPHIC. The behind the scenes events in the Air Traffic Control Centers and Military Command Posts were well done. This is the most realistic movie I have seen out of Hollywood on an actual event I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>There was some license taken, A passenger with a northern European accent (either Scandanavian or German) urged the other passengers to behave and be quiet. He even stood and attempted to warn the terrorists, but was dragged down and silenced by other passengers not in the assault team. What the ""assault team"" did to the terrorists outside the cockpit was at least as gory as what was done to the flight crew, a flight attendant and a passenger by the terrorists.It showed the door to the cockpit being breached, but never showed the passengers reaching the controls although that was implied. <br/><br/>The movie suddenly went to black. There were two slides of epilogue and the last slide before the credits was a dedication to all who were killed on 11 Septermber. <br/><br/>The theater was silent, with the exception of some people crying. Leaving the theater was like leaving a funeral.<br/><br/>I am glad I saw it. You may not want to; that is your privilege, or you might wait until it comes out on DVD.

"isaacsmike","6","5","14","29 April 2006"," Devastating, but to what end?
","I'm a fan of ""Bloody Sunday"" and a high admirer of director Paul Greengrass even though I see this film as far removed from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's excruciatingly painful, at times very effective. Greengrass has a gift for enveloping an audience and providing it with a visceral movie-going experience. His hand-held camera is not the gimmicky trick of so many other directors, but a tool to drop viewers into the middle of confusing, horrific chaos.<br/><br/>But is this enough to make the case for a great film or even an important one? Some professional reviewers have based their overwhelming praise only on how the film made them feel -- devastated, glum, fearful, pained. It made me feel those ways, too. But the impact of the film is in the name of what? There has not been a terribly persuasive review to seriously contemplate that question or at least make a convincing case for the answer.<br/><br/>Greengrass has received a lot of points for what he didn't do in this film. It's not a cheap overtly exploitative film; it doesn't use big stars; it strives for the feeling of authenticity using many non-actors, some of whom were even part of September 11. That's an achievement and points to some real artistic and personal integrity on his part, but it still doesn't make a case for a significantly worthwhile film.<br/><br/>""United 93"" should not be considered a masterpiece simply because Denzel Washington hasn't been cast as the leader of the passengers and the music doesn't swell up when they fight back.<br/><br/>The film is deliberately stripped of all political and historical context to provide one director/writer's perspective of what could have occurred on United 93 that terrible day. The film's only relief from the claustrophobic plane interior is crosscutting to aviation authorities who are baffled over what is taking place.<br/><br/>Everything about the film is ""experiential""; it's about what it might have felt like during those horrific hours. And nothing more.<br/><br/>It succeeds in providing a feeling of naturalism by avoiding traditional sentimentality, played-up dialogue and familiar character background, but it would be wrong to buy into the idea that Greengrass doesn't have his own agenda.<br/><br/>Yes, he goes to great lengths to recreate many physical details and moments: He has talked to the families and other key 9/11 players and reviewed 9/11 documents. But there are large gaps that he fills with scenes meant to prop up the ordinary passengers of United 93 as collective hero.<br/><br/>Maybe they were, but all that happened on that flight and why it happened are not known. What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 realized that they would most certainly die had they not fought back. What we do know is that their dangerous effort was their only chance to survive.<br/><br/>Did they fight back strictly out of self survival or to spare so many other deaths on the ground or both? Since the passengers' collective heroism is at the center of the film, there is plenty of speculation; we get scenes where the passengers kill terrorists and the group boldly breaks into the cockpit.<br/><br/>When the entire justification for a movie is that we must never forget, the reasons for providing details that are not verifiable must be seriously considered. United 93 has taken on mythological proportions since September 11. I maintain that Greengrass does not mean to truly debunk that mythology but to give it more gravity.<br/><br/>The movie's first half hour or so stirs up unimaginable dread in the audience. Greengrass does a masterful job in showing ordinary people preparing to take an ordinary flight. Since we know how it will turn out, the palpable horror builds slowly but surely. And since we do not identify with these passengers, we're simply waiting for a hell we know is certain to take place. It's unbearable, but is it justified? Is it enlightening or edifying in any significant way or does it simply fill us with visceral fear?<br/><br/>Greengrass makes these moments even harder to take by the little pieces of conversation we overhear among passengers and crew. Many of them talk about children or trips they are going to take. The conversations have a non-movieish ring of ""ordinary,"" but they also become a piercing reminder of what these people unknowingly are about to leave behind or will never be able to experience. Isn't it possible that one of them also talked about the Yankees or the traffic or something that wouldn't blatantly remind us of a shockingly shortened life?<br/><br/>Like ""United 93,"" other movies have focused on minutiae, but the best of them have built to something larger and monumental. ""Shoah,"" the marathon documentary about the Holocaust, is the best example. Director Claude Lanzmann asks detailed, mundane questions that build in mind and feeling of experience over the course of many hours. The enormity of the Holocaust slowly accumulates so that the movie becomes much ""larger"" than the questions that are asked.<br/><br/>But ""United 93"" does the opposite. It doesn't build to something larger by focusing on mundane details. It removes political and historical context from a dark historic day and shrinks 9/11 down to making its audience live out a hellish last plane ride with ordinary people.<br/><br/>With all context missing in this film, what then does it really say about 9/11, and is there any reason to take this trip with them? Greengrass is such a good filmmaker and has us so devastated that we can't stop shaking long enough to realize the answer to these two important questions are not that much and no."

","I went into this film with high expectations. I had heard that this was going to be a great film. I was terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, this film had some of the worst camera work I have ever seen. At one point, about 40 minutes into the film, I had to walk out for a while because I was getting motion sick. The cinematographer was unable to stay on a single object for longer than 2 seconds while continuously zooming in and out, moving in and out of focus. It would be one thing if you saw it on a TV, but on a big screen its hard not to get sick.<br/><br/>Second, the acting was terrible. Some of the actors on the plane were good and convincing, and I have no real issues with them. But the ground control and the military characters were absolutely terrible. They were quite possibly some of the worst actors I have ever seen. They even at times forgot some of their lines, and the director decided to leave those moments in.<br/><br/>Overall, it was some of the worst production I seen on a film in a long time. I am disappointed because this is a film that needs to be well done so that the people of the world can see how we felt when this happened. I think the world thinks that it wasn't that big of a deal. And when they see a film that is poorly made about an event that is important to us, it lacks credibility."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","3","7","17 July 2006"," United 93 is unbelievably real, not to mention inexplicably and heart wrenchingly powerful. It's a film not just for a nation, but for the entire world
","Stunned. That describes two days in my life. One: September 11, 2001. Two: the day I saw this film, based on the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' is not only the most powerful and real film I've ever seen, it's one that will stick with me for an eternity. I think it should be a requirement that every person should watch this film, because it will change your outlook on life, much like Schindler's List should have done. The main sticking point here is that the film is indescribably real. The actors are complete unknowns. The only actor you MAY have seen is Peter Hermann, the frequent guest star of 'Law & Order: SVU' and husband to Mariska Hargitay. What adds to the realism as well is that no passenger is the star of the film. Actually, the passengers don't say anything until they plan a revolt on the terrorists. The first half of the film is mainly from the point of view of the terrorists and air traffic controllers in Boston, New York, and Newark. Every character, including the terrorists are played brilliantly, and I believe it was the realism getting under the actors' skin. The climactic showdown between the passengers and terrorists doesn't take place until the end. But back to the realism. As the viewer, you will feel so in tune with the story, that when the culminating scene rolls around, you'll actually want to jump into the screen and join the fight against the terrorists yourself. You know what happens before you watch the film, but you will speak aloud at the end, just hoping the passengers can hold on for one more second, one more minute, one more breath. I absolutely am entranced by the direction here. It is so perfect and well-done that Greengrass should be honored with some awards this year, if not a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. But, knowing how respectful this film is, Greengrass probably wouldn't accept an award for this film. The entire world will be moved by this, not just Americans. There is no stupid patriotic garbage clichés in the film. I am prepared to bet that the words United States are not said in the film. The only time American is said is referring to American Airlines. That's it. Anyone with a heart will be moved to tears in this film, and it is the only film since Schindler's List that I've seen with a group of people to get a standing ovation. Not Crash. Not Mystic River. Not Shakespeare in Love. Not Lord of the Rings. United 93. United's story of heroism, realism, and unwavering power and depth is an indescribable experience that must be seen to understand the magnitude of this film. Easily 2006's best film. Never before have I been moved like this.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"
"Jay_Exiomo","10","3","7","5 July 2006"," Taut drama that's as brilliant as it is disturbing
","There could hardly be a film more distressing to watch than Paul Greengrass' ""United 93,"" the writer-director's cinematic cogitation on the grim events that unfolded in perhaps the bleakest day in America's history. It certainly isn't an easy subject for Greengrass to tackle, or for any filmmaker for that matter, especially considering the post-9/11 sensibilities of the audience. But the director of such films as ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" delivers the story of that day in a no-nonsense manner giving the film its brilliance, yet ironically also making it hard to bear.<br/><br/>On September 11, 2001, four American commercial planes were hijacked as part of a coordinated terrorist attacks upon the United States. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York, and one hit the Pentagon. The fourth one, the United 93, crashed in southwest Pennsylvania, over a hundred miles off the target - Washington, D.C. - as passengers and members of the flight crew tried to fight the hijackers and regain control of the plane. Of course, in the end no one survived and it's what makes the film all the more harrowing.<br/><br/>Greengrass' direction is virtually flawless. He paces the film in a way where amidst the constancy and familiarity prior to the events is a building of trepidation when the horrific events start to progress as soon as the cards are laid and all bets are off. It's heartbreaking as it develops, yet still holds our attention even if we already know the tragic fate that awaits. The director's trademark hand-held camera-work underlines the confusion and chaos that reverberates throughout the film, which is shot in a pseudo-documentary style. As he stages each act, he not only lets us see what happens; he brings us there and then. The scant use of music and the fluidity in presenting scenes from FAA headquarters, air traffic control in various cities, and from United 93 itself, contribute to the atmosphere enveloped in paranoia.<br/><br/>The script has also taken the right approach in presenting its characters, for in matters such as this, ambiguity is more effective than providing absolutism. Greengrass generates sympathy for the doomed airplane passengers without a mawkishly sentimental effect. We know just enough of these people for them to remain ordinary in spite of the circumstance. Of course the decision to cast mostly unknown actors help in creating the tension. The cast members' subtle performance are genuinely gripping and as we delve into their characters' despondency, we sympathize with them. We feel their fears. By the time the end abruptly comes, so do we realize how fleeting life was for these people.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is an excellent film. It is more of the director's somber rumination of the events rather than a solid popcorn entertainment because this is definitely not an escapist fare. Neither will it be easy for a lot of viewers to warm up to the movie. It presents brutal facts only a willing mind can take but ultimately rewards those who see it with a provocative and rewarding experience."

","first off there are not enough words in this world possible to describe 'united 93' i went into the theatre with mixed feelings about this movie because i had a negative felling about this film, that everyone is trying to get rich of what happened on September 11th 2001? but after seeing this movie tonight all the negative feelings and thoughts had just gone and what i was left with was depression, sadness and felling helpless. what i found different was when me and my mate leave the theatre after seeing a movie we have a laugh and joke about and reflect on the movie, but with this movie i left the theatre felling very empty and moved with what had been shown to us, the story is amazing and drags you in straight away and has no intention off letting you go, the acting is mind blowing and raw, at certain points i forgot this was a movie it felt like i was on that plain and felling the fear off death. i would recommend this to everyone because it will make you think twice about human nature and how lucky we are to still be alive, this movie is very emontional and at times difficult to watch but its raw viewing i would beg everyone to go and watch united 93 so that everyone can see what happened on flight united 93 and witness the vulnerability of everyone aboard flight united 93?"
"sullibrandon","10","3","7","23 May 2006"," A heart-wrenching tribute to those heroic passengers
","How does one review a movie like this? It's not your typical terrorist action movie. It's not meant to do a lot of things that are expected of good movies, and its subject matter is so close to the hearts of Americans that many people dismiss it without even having seen it, saying it's inappropriate that people are making money off of this tragedy, that it's too soon after what happened to make this kind of movie, and so on. Though these accusations may have some substance to them, I found United 93 to be a satisfyingly reverent tribute to the heroism of those passengers on that fateful day the morning of September 11.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the terrorists in motel rooms, praying and getting ready for the deed they are about to perform. Then we are taken to a national air traffic control center, then to the airport, where we see many of the passengers getting ready to board. Throughout the movie, we are taken in a sort of loop through four different set pieces: United 93, NORAD control center, an Air Traffic control center, and the FAA.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, the director, shows us very well the immense confusion there was over all the hijacking of the planes. Through different cuts, all around the set pieces, we see the realization and the, at first, innocent worry over the ""hijacking"" of various planes. They pretty much know that the planes are hijacked, but they don't know what for. Eventually they see the smoke pouring out of the world trade center. And then, the dreadful sight of another plane barreling toward the second tower. We live, once more, through the dread that occurred on that day in history.<br/><br/>Greengrass shows nothing but reverence for the material. He knows there are many people out there to whom this is still a very tender matter, and that if he made the wrong film, many people would almost literally go up in arms against him. Never once does he try to glamorize anything that occurred. It is all presented, directly at us, in a straight-forward, no nonsense manner. The score for the film is very muted, only appearing when it needs to, always taking a backseat to the story. It builds dread when it needs to, heightens sadness, and then just fades away to let the story tell itself. Camera-work is mostly, if not completely, hand-held, adding to the chaotic feel of that day. Though the story may also get a little confusing at times, it works for the material, and is purposefully portrayed that way.<br/><br/>Also notable is how there is no attempt to give a back story to any of the characters on United 93. In a normal film like this, you would maybe show brief flashbacks of each person's family as they boarded the plane, but not here. Greengrass knows there is no reason for this. This film is about the heroism that occurred that day, and any attempt to give character to these people would be superfluous. We've all heard their stories.<br/><br/>Once the passengers start planning the attack on the terrorists, the tension builds exponentially. Here is someplace where the story could have easily gone wrong, yet still, showing immense sensitivity for the subject matter, Greengrass directs it perfectly. The passengers start talking, knowing they have to do what they have to do. These aren't superhuman action heroes - these people could be you, me, the person you sit next to on the bus, the person you see walking down the street. We see glimpses of people calling their loved ones - weeping into the phone, knowing this may be the last time they ever speak to them. When the moment comes and they make their move on the terrorists, with the now famous: ""let's roll"" there are heart-stopping moments and heart-soaring moments. What makes it all the more tragic is that you know they will be successful in overtaking the plane, but you also know that they won't have time to avoid the crash. There is a heart-wrenching moment when it flashes back and forth between the terrorists praying and the people in the back of the plane praying. This movie is the closest that I've come to crying in a long while.<br/><br/>United 93, I believe, is the most effective and poignant movie that could be made about that fateful flight. No energy is wasted on anything superfluous. There is no character development, but there doesn't need to be - these people are who they are. They do not seem like Hollywood actors either - a wise choice by Greengrass to choose a cast of unknowns to play them. They seem completely real - never once did I stop and think, ""hey, you know what, those aren't actually them!"" In fact, in the scenes outside of the plane, many of the people play themselves. The entire film just sweeps you up in its simple, yet visceral, reality. I am giving this movie a 10/10, not because I believe it is perfect, but because I believe it is the best possible tribute film that could be made to those heroic passengers on that airplane. There is no attempt to paint a larger picture either - we see nothing going on outside of the immediate situation concerning this plane - no talk of Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, the President....it is just simply these passengers. The film just wrenches at your heart with the tragedy, and never once seems glamorized, cheesy, or insulting to these people's memory. It is not a film meant for us to enjoy, but it is a film meant for us to see, and I highly recommend it."
"asc85","7","3","7","13 May 2006"," But is it entertaining?
","This was definitely a film worth seeing, and very intense. However, it is a double-edged sword when you make the movie so ""documentary-like."" On the one hand, it treats the subjects with an enormous amount of respect, stays as objective as it can, and appears to be an accurate portrayal of what happened on that incredibly sad day in America. On the other hand, it's a little slow and dry, as there are no other ""dramatic"" sub-plots, etc. This film actually reminded me a bit of ""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) which came out last year and showed Hitler's last days. In the sense that it's extremely meticulous and informative. But is it entertaining? Not very much so. Someone could successfully argue that a film like this should NOT be entertaining, and I would probably agree with them. But if we're gauging our like/dislike rating on a ""satisfying film experience,"" I'm not sure United 93 deserves all the acclaim that it's getting."
"Kryzak","10","3","7","10 May 2006"," Powerful beyond belief...
","After teetering between a 9 and 10, I have decided to give this movie a 10 for the impact it had on me. A couple weeks after seeing the movie, I still can't get the images of the brave passengers of United 93 out of my head; I still tear up every time I think about how they sacrificed their lives so that the terrorists could not destroy one more building (and probably kill more people in the process); and I still get angry every time I think of what happened on 9/11/2001. This movie brought back painful memories of that day that need to be brought back, just because we live in a country that often forgets too easily.<br/><br/>Don't worry, I won't go into any political statements here, as this space is reserved for movie reviews. As a movie, ""United 93"" is meticulously done, with no hint of exploitation at all. Like everyone else, I was afraid of the ""Tom Cruise Action Hero"" syndrome where some of the passengers are played by top name action stars and do some unrealistic heroics (those were saved for M:I3, thank goodness! =P), and we get cheesy background stories of each and every passengers so we can ""sympathize"" with them more. I doubt we need to know much about the passengers of the flight to sympathize (or empathize) with them. The situation itself, the fear and terror of having a bomb on a plane, the knowledge that 3 planes already crashed into 3 landmark buildings in the US, and the final realization that they must do something that will guarantee death to stop this plane from doing the same, is powerful enough that no other traditional movie plot devices are necessary to add to feelings that we as the audience have. I am VERY glad that Paul Greengrass, the director realized that and did the movie a la ""documentary"" style. What turned out is a movie that way more powerful in its simplicity than any other movies with a lot more ""fluff"" around them.<br/><br/>The choice to pick actual people to play themselves (the FAA director, the military commander, etc) was brilliant, as well as picking no-name actors who can still act really well. This way the audience really sees what the people felt on that fateful day, and are not distracted by famous actors and realizing they're just acting a part. All the actors did a great job in portraying the emotions of that day, and the editing is tight and well paced. The only complaint I have is the shakiness of the camera. I know it was on purpose to show the chaos and spontaneity of the event, but for people like me who get motion sickness from that type of movement (see my Constant Gardner review) it was really difficult for me to sit through the movie (for various other reasons too).<br/><br/>As for the terrorists, I really felt that they were portrayed in a very neutral light, and I applaud the director for this decision. It is all too easy to demonize them as mass murderers with no humanity in them, but there is always a flip side of the coin, a story behind every action. They believe as strongly about what they're doing is right as the passengers on the plane believing that fighting back is the right thing. It is an unfortunately clash of beliefs and cultures that had tragic results, and the movie clearly and unflinchingly showed this.<br/><br/>All in all, a brilliant film that captures the confusion, the fear, the terror, and the shock of 9/11 without an ounce of fluff, exploitation, or unnecessary material. I STRONGLY recommend people to go watch this, even if it will be very difficult and painful, because the victims and heroes of that day deserve to be remembered and honored, and this is a great film made to honor them."

You will be shaking with anger, overcome with emotion, and filled with pride.

"Craig_McPherson","10","3","7","30 April 2006"," Powerful, moving, and all too real
","The adjective ""painful"" is one that often gets bandied about in movie reviews, particularly when the film is a turkey. Paul Greengrass' United 93, which tells the story of the Sept. 11 flight which crashed into a farmer's field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, is the furthest thing from a turkey, and yet it's painful to watch.<br/><br/>Greengrass brings a cinema verite approach toward the subject, eschewing name actors in favor of unknowns  using a real flight crew and electing to have key individuals from the FAA play themselves. There are no individual heroes in this film, just ordinary folk. There's no Harrison Ford scaling through the underbelly of the plane looking to kick terrorist butt. Just average folks who, via cell and cabin phone links to loved ones on the ground, discover the fate of the three flights that preceded them and, concluding their fate, decided to act collectively to seize back the plane.<br/><br/>Played out in real time, it's a testimony to Greengrass' skilled film-making that the audience ends up finding welcome breaks from the mounting tension aboard United 93 when the director intersperses the events unfolding on the plane with scenes of carnage from the twin towers.<br/><br/>From the first frame, as we see the terrorists preparing themselves for their fate in their hotel room, to scenes of mundane, family-oriented preflight conversation from the flight crew, to the ubiquitous chatter of the passengers clearing security and stowing their luggage aboard the plane, a mounting sense of doom begins to grow as we watch everyone involved on their journey to certain death. And with it, mounting sadness over how the passengers almost pulled it off.<br/><br/>Some will argue that it's too soon for a film like this. The incident too fresh in people's minds. And they would be right, which is why United 93 is not a film for everyone. Each individual must make their own call as to whether or not they want to see this film. For me, the film was a cinematic parallel to John McCrae's famous poem written in the heat of battle during World War I:<br/><br/>""We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie, In Flanders fields.""<br/><br/>Whether you choose to see United 93 or not, the greater tragedy would be to pretend it never happened."

If you don't feel sad I suspect you are not human.<br/><br/>It is film making at a much higher level than we are used to getting. The passengers on the plane deserve at least this for what they did rises above what we are used to getting in the mundane trite formula movies of today. <br/><br/>When I left the theater I felt that I had left a requiem that left me sad, and also a celebration of life for the people on the airplane.<br/><br/>I predict that this movie will become a classic and much more appreciated after time has passed.

","Watching the film brought me back to the exact state of mind, and emotional state, that I felt on September 11. Some may not want to do that, and I would understand why. But for me, I believe that it is very important to do so, and the best way to honor the victims of 9/11. The film was stunning in it's realism. There were so many things that could have been done, in the making of this film, that would have made me very angry. I was actually pretty skeptical when I went to see it. But, the film is an absolute testament to the heroism that took place that day, as a small group of strangers chose to band together, and become the first line of defense in the war on terror. The film DOES NOT play politics. No matter what your political persuasion, you can appreciate this film. I think this movie is a great way to ensure we do not forget. I, like most people, did not think that I had forgotten. But, when this movie starts churning something inside your stomach, as you see how shocking that day's events were, and two feelings start rising to levels never you had never felt before- anger and sadness- you realize that you have, in a way, begun to forget 9/11. The movie is on your mind long after you leave the theater."

"fuzzykatie","10","3","7","29 April 2006"," Almost TOO Real...
","I went to see this movie feeling that it was an important piece of cinema to see, as a means for people to make sense out of the September 11th tragedies and to understand that day from various perspectives. Personally, the core of the tragedy to me has always been the World Trade Center and while Flight 93 was certainly an enormous tragedy as well, I think more often than not of the twin towers as emblematic of Sept. 11th; Flight 93 somehow takes a back-burner in my mind. This movie certainly gives the lives lost on United 93 their due. Coming out five years after the fact, this movie is an important reminder of what happened that day, in spite of the wars and propaganda and emotional callousness built up over time. I say that this movie is almost TOO real because when watching it I was struck by the everydayness of the people on board the plane and the incredulity of the air traffic controllers when first confronted with the hijackings. Some of the actors in this movie aren't even actors; I read in one review that some of the actual air traffic controllers play themselves, and the lack of ""name"" actors is an effective means of realism. This movie is shot shakily, as though with a hand-held camera, which gives it an even more authentic feel. While it plays out a bit like a Hollywood thriller, I had to keep reminding myself, ""This HAPPENED..this is real,"" and at times that thought was overwhelming to me. I had to look away from the screen more than once and at one point leave the theater for a few minutes. It is different from some fictional thriller in that going in, you know the ending; there are no light moments in this movie and nor should there be. The film refrains from political commentary or subjectivity. I don't feel there was any sentimentalism portrayed whatsoever, as with some made-for-TV movies on the subject. While some might say any September 11th film capitalizes on a horrible tragedy, I think this movie treats the subject with utmost sensitivity and respect; my thought coming out of the theater held true with what I felt going in: this is an important piece of cinema. While difficult to watch at times, I am glad that I saw it. I don't want to give away any spoilers but one scene in particular affected me very much, as a reminder that regardless of race or religion we are all human, and there are certain commonalities we all share in that."
"safford99","10","3","7","29 April 2006"," A Powerful Film About True Heros
","Much criticism has been lodged against the makers of ""United 93"" saying the film is too recent to document the horrors of 9/11 and that it is exploitive of the passengers aboard that doomed flight. Having seen the movie, I can say nothing could be further from the truth. In less than an hour those passengers had to overcome confusion, fear and shock in order to attempt to take back control of their plane. This film is a tribute to those passengers, and an important testament to human courage and the will to survive.<br/><br/>Filmed in a cinema verities style, the first two thirds of the movie concentrates on the air traffic controllers and the military as they struggle to come to terms with what is occurring aboard several aircraft, and what they might do to avoid further casualties as the events unfold. One of the main strengths of ""United 93"" is that it makes these events more human, and avoids laying blame in regards to what was an unprecedented and chaotic situation.<br/><br/>Interspersed throughout these scenes are the happenings aboard flight 93. The movie doesn't provide us with back stories about the passengers and yet we come to understand and identify with them as we witness the horrific incidents that occur. The movie shows the struggle in the cockpit, and the murders of some of the crew, but it doesn't exploit them close ups, rather it simply films what is believed to have happened.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes of the movie is devoted entirely to the passengers and their fight to take back control. It is during this last half where the movie takes a brilliant turn with direction, acting, editing and music all merging together to make for powerful and gut wrenching conclusion. It is also during this half that we see the passengers making phone calls to their love ones in an intense montage as they express their love, their emotions, and their resolve to stand up for themselves. It is raw, it is hard to watch, and yet it is beautiful to see.<br/><br/>The criticisms that I have are that I think there was too much hand held camera work in the control room scenes. I did feel a little nauseous at points as my eyes tried to focus. I also am not sure how true some of the events are that movie documents towards the end (there seems to be a little artistic license), but these are very minor criticisms. Overall, I think this movie is one of the best directed films I've seen since ""Requiem for a Dream"".<br/><br/>I can understand people not wanting to see this movie. It's not easy to sit through, but for those who can, I do believe they will come away feeling moved, and oddly a little more optimistic about life and the events of 9/11."

You will relive 9/11 without being shown how to think. To me the attempt was successfully made to reveal much of what was actually happening that day, particularly at the level of those officials on duty at the time, as well as from the vantage point of the passengers themselves. I deeply appreciate that United 93 is dedicated to our friends, neighbors and relatives who lost their lives that day; and therefore to the decided passengers of United 93 who quickly arrived at their tough yet logical decision. As one who uses human personality in my daily work, the characters are real; seemingly accurate to several of the actual folks on board United 93 on September 11, 2001."

I used to be among them. Seeing it though leaves me feeling that it's a timely refresher on what we are up against, and a tremendous memorial to the bravery of the those who gave their lives on that day.<br/><br/>When I first heard Hollywood was making this film I feared a typical PC exercise showing ""both sides"" of the story. Some attempt to hint at the ""understandable reason"" behind the madness. To my surprise (and relief) we just get an accurate recital of events as we know them, including the terrorists and what we know of them. This film is history. Not history 2.0.<br/><br/>My only negative comment concerns the few paragraphs of text that appear at the end. They seem to indict those in authority for inappropriate or untimely reaction. For example, there is one paragraph about military commanders not giving interceptor pilots firing orders after permission to do so had been granted because the commanders were concerned about an accidental shootdown. A very wise precaution if you ask me, but the scroll seems to suggest there was something suspect about it even though the interceptors were never in a position to stop any of the planes. It's a minor gripe given the rest of the film, but it bugs me a lot. It's as if the filmmakers wanted the audience to shake their heads at something and decided ""lets point a finger over here"". Ditch or change the closing words and you have a near perfect film. 9 stars."
"sarz13","2","6","19","23 May 2006"," A soldier's review of a disgrace to those lost.
","First off let me tell you a bit about who I am. I was the film critic and entertainment editor for my school's paper, a soldier who has been in the Army for almost nine years now, and I carry two degrees including a B.A. degree in Communications from Penn State University. On September 11th 2001 I had just started my contract with The PA Army National Guard and within a half an hour of the second plane crashing I called both my new unit and my old unit and asked to be put back on active duty immediately. Due to contract obligations, on an Army Guard contract you must fulfill at least the first year, I was unable to go back active. Needless to say 9/11 means a lot to me. The people who died are personal heroes along with those who serve/served our country in all ways.<br/><br/>That being said this movie is utter garbage. In no way shape or form does it honor the memories of those who died that day. So why do people feel so heartfelt about this film then? CNN! The film relies heavily on replaying, over and over, the actual footage from CNN from that day. You would think the film makers could have come up with a better approach than to draw emotion from something that people are already scarred from. I cried, but I knew why I was crying, watching the footage again brought back so many painful memories. The film overreaches for a documentary style that it misses completely by making sure each and every shot is completely hand-held. This adds up to motion sickness and a film trying to be overly stylized. Although it was not an action film, the camera movement suggested otherwise. I'd like to personally smack the idiot that entrusted the director of The Bourne Supremacy with something of this nature. The acting, if you can call it that, is sub-par, and in no way was handled the way it should have been for a film of such importance. The script also neglects some key points from that day, one example is no mention of where our president was. Do your homework on this, you'll be offended as to what our leader found more important. This is nothing more than a snuff film. You will become emotional, but only because they overuse all of the footage of the actual events over and over. Avoid this film at all costs and take a trip to where the towers once stood instead. It is a much better way to remember those that we have lost."

However, I am a bit sceptical about the conformity of the events shown, even it is thought to be based on true facts.

They relayed their stories of the contacts they made with those on board. We also know of the last minute transitions made aboard the plane indicating that those aboard did fight back... with that in mind, the events displayed in this film are as close to factual as we will ever come.<br/><br/>With that put of the way, the execution, pacing, and pure intensity of the film brings true honor to those aboard this flight. Even though it's been 18 years since the events in of 9/11, and well over a decade since this film came out, it still hold incredible power. In fact, rarely have I seen a film which grows in its quality like United 93 does. As we grow more and more separate from the horrible events of that day, this film's quality grows, too. Though not entirely accurate, as we will never truly know of the events which took place aboard the plane from minute to minute, this film will grow in importance as time wears on. In 100 years, I truly hope this film deserves the accolades of deserves. It tastefully brings honor to those aboard flight 93 while also bringing is right into the flight control centers. It shows the best of humanity in the worst of circumstances. And it does so in a tasteful, respectful, and honorable way. Everyone needs to see this film once. Even if they dont like it, everyone needs to see this film."

"knucklebreather","9","2","4","21 April 2012"," A different kind of movie
","""United 93"" is the largely factual story of the September 11th attacks as seen by air traffic controllers and especially by the passengers and crew of United flight 93, which crashed over Pennsylvania after being hijacked. The movie is free of the trappings of most mainstream movies, especially disaster movies, almost entirely lacking a soundtrack or any attempts to jazz up the story with memorable, contrived characters and snappy dialogue.<br/><br/>This is about as realistic as a movie is likely to get, and you're not going to see too many movies like it. It's not a fun movie to watch - everybody knows the bad guys ""win"", and it's rather crushing to see all of this in disaster movie format. In any other disaster movie, the capable grace-under-fire guys on the ground would be on top of everything and get those fighter jets in the air, and the everyday people on the plane would become heroes and kick some terrorist ass when it counted most.<br/><br/>Instead, this is painfully realistic, and you watch as the sympathetic characters are totally powerless and ineffective... and you pretty much see why. It was hard to figure out what was going on in the few minutes people had to work with. When it became clear what was happening, it's pretty impossible to climb up a commercial airliner and right it after the suicidal terrorist pilot has sent it into a nosedive.<br/><br/>It's depressing stuff to watch but that's kind of the point. This stuff, more or less, really happened. Even those of us who were adults when it happened find it easy to forget the drama and horror of that day. This is the kind of movie everyone should see."

","This film is based on the actual events that took place on that harrowing day of September 11, 2001. The film begins in a hotel room, where the 4 proposed terrorists are ready for what would be their mission before God. This film works very fast, as if you were actually there, on the plane, just going about your business and ready to reach your destination. When the eventual moments of terror and agony begin, not only can you feel everyone's pain, suffering, fear and desperation, you feel the same. Paul Greengrass is one of today's best directors at all of this. The fact that the families of those who perished had a lot of input into the film really helped and made it as real as possible. Afterwards, you walk out with really nothing to say."

","This is the single best movie i have ever seen. It's so harrowing and suspenseful and realistic. The fear and confusion those people went through must have been terrifying but they managed to overcome their fear and unite to try and retake their plane against a faceless enemy. On a day we suffered unthinkable disaster and devastating defeat, Flight 93 brought consolation to many people as it shows that even against all odds we can stand together in the face of danger. This film should be preserved as a reminder that we are all capable of self sacrifice and heroism when we are at our most vulnerable. Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time as a stirring tribute to all those who died on 9/11.<br/><br/>RIP Flight 93 passengers and crew."
"tnrcooper","10","2","4","25 April 2011"," Heartbreaking film-making
","This is a powerful film. The absence of big names and the minimal use of music to suggest how we should feel ensures that this film portrays the events of that horrible day in the respectful manner which they deserve. I kept on trying not to think of the passengers as characters but as real people. However, there is some degree to which the characters have become larger than life and their story so familiar that there is catharsis in watching them unite to fight against fate. Director Paul Greengrass was the right man for the job. He got approval for his picture from many families of the victims of flight 93 and I think rightfully so.<br/><br/>It was heartbreaking to watch the segment tracking the characters before the hijacking. As viewers, we know what happens and one hopes against hope that somehow the inevitable will be avoided. This obviously does not happen and it's heartbreaking. We watch the passengers preparing in the relatively unperturbed way in which we all approached flying before 9/11. One wants to yell at the screen for the characters to leave, to fight, to avoid what we know will happen. I felt a great deal of sympathy for the air traffic controllers who didn't know that they were working on the day of the worst terrorist attack in US history. I also felt a lot of sympathy for the military personnel who were trying to secure approval for scrambled planes to mobilize in order to head off a hijacking.<br/><br/>The film is based on documented information detailing what happened on that fateful flight. I found the section of the film in which family members made final phone calls to their families extraordinarily moving. Again, the hindsight which allows us to know that indeed these passengers would not leave the plane alive is what makes this section so moving. Greengrass never plays up the emotional gravity of anything, even at points at which a lesser film-maker might have succumbed to the temptation to secure a greater emotional pay-off from a directing decision, such as when Todd Beamer said ""let's roll"". This is to his credit. Greengrass offers no comment on the actions of the authorities, the passengers, or the terrorists. I don't think any movie could pay tribute to the events which transpired on United flight 93 than this film.<br/><br/>One final note. If you have the DVD release of this film, watching the 45 minute featurette Greengrass made discussing with United 93 family members the making of this movie, including the cathartic meetings between family members and the actors who would portray their lost loved ones, is must-see viewing as we see family members several years after the tragedy, dealing with grief which never goes away."
"jzappa","9","2","4","30 November 2008"," To Watch This Movie Is to Be Met Head-On BY the Miserable Anarchic Actuality of September 11, 2001.
","The reason Paul Greengrass's intensely unsettling docudrama is so potent and effective is because it does not play as if to know that any time has gone by since any given second of the unspeakable events of 9/11. The entire film, every facet, exists on screen in the most immediately present tense. The dialogue, which is generally improvised based on rehearsals Greengrass held with the cast, is anchored in interviews in the flesh between actors and families of those they play. Hardly of the passengers in the film are alluded to in any manner by their names, a touch gives light to the alliance rather than any distinct gallantry.<br/><br/>This momentous cultural, artistic and historical achievement makes a measured endeavor to steer clear of not only name actors, but actors with whom we are really even very facially familiar. In a sense, the film takes more chances as a narrative than it does as a dramatization of 9/11, because it makes no effort to depict the passengers or terrorists with exposition or backstory. In most movies about ill-fated journeys, we meet a handful significant characters like the selfish businessman, the quiet, surprisingly heroic man with a skeleton in the closet. What we discern about the passengers on United 93 is just what we would know if we had been on the plane and sitting near them: Nil save for one or two fine points of physical appearance.<br/><br/>Screen time aboard the plane interchange with time spent inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, air traffic stations, and a military room. Here, too, there are no histories, but experts thinking and communicating in the immediate. Numerous of them played by the actual people involved, they have an unprecedented expertise of jargon and courses of action. When the controllers see the second plane crash into the World Trade Center, they flinch with disbelief and terror, and that instant in the film feels as real as it felt to me on that universally eery day, no matter how normal it was in terms of my own routine and everyone else's in spite of all the cataclysmic new chapter of history building in the background of the day.<br/><br/>This gut-wrenching masterpiece of tension is supremely overpowering because it gives a picture of all of its characters as just anyone shut into an inevitable advance toward the end. Oscar-nominated British director Greengrass's disturbing docudrama includes no politics. No speculation. No private dialogue between anyone on screen, and so of course there aren't any jingoistic pro-America monologues. The film pathologically avoids the big picture.<br/><br/>We watch United 93 as the passengers and crew get on the plane and it gets ready to depart. Very soon, the first plane is engulfed by the ominous flames in the World Trade Center. Living in that flash, we share the bewilderment of the air traffic controllers. There is a thin silhouette of assorted procedures that come into focus, deliberately without expansion or analysis. I am one of the many who see this film and recall the now infamous scene in Fahrenheit 9/11 in which George W. Bush sat inert in a kindergarten classroom in Florida for seven minutes after being informed of the attack. We see the reality that he's informed, so what was he waiting for? This, a taut, spare dissolution of its events' primordial cognizance does not reach for that understanding, because the people on the screen do not have the vista of retrospection.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is some of the most harrowing cinema I've experienced since the first time I saw Requiem For a Dream years ago, as the last twenty minutes concentrates on the despair aboard United 93, when the hijackers have taken over, hack flight attendants, slay the pilots and ostensibly have a bomb one click away, the passengers erratically overcome their fear and attack of mortality and bind to rush their victimizers, all having been reconstructed from the 33 telephone calls from the plane and from the cockpit voice recorder. Greengrass is bursting to be as truthful and precise as possible. There is no fabricated showboating, no dramatized arguments among the passengers, no specific champions. The passengers are a horrified assembly of strangers. Even while these courageous passengers spend their last minutes fighting tooth and nail, we know nothing about them, none of the information about them which we can of course look up now. It could be us on the plane, petrified and alarmed."

","Everybody remembers what they did on that dreadful day on September the 11th, 2001. People woke up to go to work, teachers and students woke up to go to school; robbery, murder, lynchings and any other things both good and bad until four planes were hijacked and heading for four targets: The Pentagon, The Twin Towers and The White House. Three of the four hijacked planes reached their target destinations (Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C.) in which everybody talks more about the Twin Towers as if they were history majors and forget about the rest.<br/><br/>This movie tells about flight United 93 that didn't reach it's destination thanks to a group of people who stopped the terrorists before reaching their doom.<br/><br/>""United 93"" doesn't have any big top actors like Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Samuel L. Jackson or anybody we read in the magazines to influence in watching movies. The actors here look exactly like ordinary people we wouldn't even bother checking their acting credits; everybody plays the real life heroes in this movie.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series) directs this movie where it's so realistic, it makes us feel as if we were there. The editing is realistic where it feels like an episode of ""24"" with different cameras showing points of view from the passengers in the doom flight to the traffic control towers to the military.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film where you don't have to have an opinion (or express that you could've been there to be a hero) but to shut up and just honor those who at least did something with their lives."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","29 February 2008"," Masterpiece
","United 93 (2006) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>It's really hard to judge this ""movie"" because I'm really not sure it was made for ""entertainment"" reasons. As technically brilliant as the film was, I think the power of the story is in the fact that it's all true and the viewer it overly familiar with the events. There was a lot of debate on whether people were ready for a story on 9/11 and I thought they were. After seeing the film I somewhat wished I hadn't watched it. The 9/11 events are a bit too sensitive for me and this film was pretty much too well made and there were several moments where I turned my head to the side not wanting to watch anymore. The theater had around 100 people there and I've never heard such a quiet crowd. Before the movie, during the movie and then after the movie. Dead silence. Since the film wasn't made for entertainment and it's hard to view it that way, I'm not sure what the reasoning is. I know it's very doubtful I'll ever watch this again but I guess the film does serve a purpose in the fact that we shouldn't forget what the passengers did. I don't think seeing this movie will make me remember any better so in the end I'm really not sure if it was worth sitting through because of the emotional level it brought me to."

","This movie was well done but wouldn't say it was great. The filmmaker did a pretty good job but one big thing he forgot to include were the subtitles for the hijackers once they had taken over the plane's cockpit. It doesn't have as powerful affect for viewers who don't understand Saudi or Iraqi language.<br/><br/>The one thing I really liked was that director Paul Greengrass really got things going in a hurry without much delay. I thought it was good to have the movie begin in the terrorists' hotel room at 05:35 and show pretty much their every move.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine what actually took place on Sept.11 on that aircraft, but it's crazy to imagine the hijacker with the bomb standing in front of the entire cabin for half an hour waiting for something to happen. If the hijackers took over the plane at roughly the same time the WTC planes were hijacked, that means the passengers aboard Flight 93 would have had that much more time to organize their revolt. I would think that even a skilled hijacker would have been able to get the job done even if he had less time to work with than they may have planned for. I guess my thought is that if the other 3 planes hit their target, and this one didn't, could it be possible that Flight 93's hijackers weren't as efficient as the others were?<br/><br/>In turn, what if the other 3 planes involved in the attacks were delayed by 20-30 minutes, would they have been thwarted too?<br/><br/>The thing I didn't like was that some parts were unrealistic. Even though it was clear that it was fake, how did the one hijacker get onto the plane with a bomb? Doesn't that say something about America's security at the airport? Even though it was fake, it's hard to believe the guy still got on without question. I also would have thought that the hijackers would have started killing anyone who did anything suspicious, such as placing a call on a cell phone. According to this movie, when the plane hit the ground, many passengers were still alive. It makes me wonder if the 3 other groups of hijackers actually killed the passengers before they crashed into the WTC and the Pentagon? If the Flight 93 hijackers had started killing passengers, they may have been able to stay on their mission. it kind of tells me that the Flight 93 hijackers were probably quite nervous and as the movie went on, it looked like it was obvious they were losing control.<br/><br/>Other than the lack of subtitles for the hijackers, the film was well done and I liked how the camera was focused on the ground in the last seconds of the flight. <br/><br/>Because of the plane's long delay in takeoff, it's been brought up that if the flight actually took off on time, the terrorists may have been able to take control earlier than they did, and thus, crash the plane on target. I thought that was kind of interesting because after they took control of the cockpit, one hijacker asked the leader why they waited so long? The reply was that he was waiting for the right time. If the flight hadn't been delayed, things may have gone accordingly for them, as they took over the plane's controls after the WTC had already been hit, meaning that Flight 93 fell behind because of the delay in takeoff. If they departed on time, they likely would have crashed in Washington, DC instead. If director Greengrass was able to find a way to highlight that scene a little more, it may have made for an even more powerful ending.<br/><br/>Everything in the film seemed pretty realistic so it was easy to relate to the feeling onboard once the hijackers took over. It also made me wonder if there are any other movies, besides World Trade Centre, that tell the story from the victims' point of view."
"rmirabelle","10","2","4","5 February 2008"," Literally a revelation
","This movie is a stunning achievement. I sat down half way through the movie and began to watch with only moderate interest at first. What I realize only now is how brilliant the portrayal of these events is. The story of 9/11 speaks for itself and Paul Greengrass honors it in the deepest sense possible by adding...NOTHING. A cast of unknown and relatively unknown actors delivers a collection of some of the most compelling and honest performances I have ever seen. I cannot speak enough about how realistic the portrayals looked, sounded and felt throughout the film. When the movie suddenly ended after the most intense crescendo, I sat blank for a moment. And then I literally burst into tears. 9/11 has placed an indelible mark on the consciousness of the World and this movie represents the ultimate retelling of one facet of that story."

"Hunky Stud","9","2","4","20 December 2007"," It made me cry so many times.
","wow, this is a serious tear-jerking film. When I write comments, I usually don't like to admit that I cried while watching. I just watched the movie called ""Joyeux Noel"" last night, it made cry. This one made me cry several times. I cried so hard when one woman talked to someone on the phone that she loved them.<br/><br/>The story seems very authentic. They didn't waste any time on any unnecessary minor things. Even though this film is 111 minutes long, I don't think that it is long at all. At the last part, it only focused on what happened on that flight. Instead, they could have added a few more scenes from those control centers during or after the crash. I was afraid that this film might have too many brutal, violent scenes, such as blood flying everywhere, etc. It was not too bloody.<br/><br/>While watching, I wondered if they would show the US president. If they use an actor, it could certainly ruin the moment, because he is not the real one. It didn't happen.<br/><br/>One big problem for this film is its cinematography. That is the reason why I gave it to a 9 instead of a 10. Sometimes, it was obvious that the cameraperson was holding the camera by hand, so the scenes were shaking, or they focused on the subject too closely, or the camera was moving too fast as if someone was running from one place to another to give us the view. It made me feel dizzy. After all, this is a big screen film, not a home-made video. They want to give the audiences the feeling of being right there, they did not have to sacrifice the big screen images.<br/><br/>It would be nice if they list all the names and occupations of all the people aboard on that plane, maybe even those important real people's names when they first appeared. After all, this is not a fiction, it really happened. They can do that in the next release. I was surprised that Ben Sliney was the actual FAA Director of Operations. He did a really good job, very real.<br/><br/>I don't know anything about those four actors who portrayed the ""terrorists"" on the plane, hopefully they didn't get any threatens from anyone after this film. They were as real as they can be.<br/><br/>In the bonus feature, they only interviewed a few family members which are all Caucasian looking. I don't know if most of the family members had opportunities to meet with the person who acted as their beloved ones. Even though it was also touching, but it seemed to lack of diversity. It is a pity that neither of the pilot's family members were shown, one of the pilot was a black guy who just had a baby not so long ago. There were many other family members who were not included in it. Maybe those family members declined. Probably most of them have already been interviewed by various news medias which I just didn't have a chance to see them all.<br/><br/>One interesting note, this film won ""Best British Film"" by the Empire Awards, UK in 2007."

","I was very leery about seeing this film, as the prospect of reliving the events of 9/11 did not particularly appeal to me. Thus I waited nearly two years, and it was only the very positive reviews I kept seeing that finally convinced me to view the film.<br/><br/>Like most Americans, I clearly remember the events of that day...and the way it affected me for years afterwards. It was the plight of the planes themselves that had the biggest impact on me, probably due to the fact that I traveled all the time for work and had taken some of those very flights. In the months that followed, as I tried to process the tragedy of what had occurred, I often pictured myself in the same situation and wonder how I would have reacted. I remember flying just a week after 9/11, and not being particularly nervous, but with a heightened awareness and suspicion of all that was around me--scrutinizing passengers, looking for emergency exits, watching the bathroom.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie unfold, I was struck by the ""realness"" of the scenes and the acting. United 93 so accurately captures the experience of airline travel that it could be a documentary. In a sense it allowed me to see the events I had imagined in my head so many times before played out in front of me on the screen.<br/><br/>All the action takes place in ""real time,"" and there are no back-stories, or judgments, or manufactured drama. You know nothing more about the people on the plane than you would know about your fellow passengers traveling on a flight today. This choice allows you to experience the events from a first hand perspective (at least it did for me).<br/><br/>We all know what happens to the flight, so there is no suspense about the outcome. I did not find myself ""routing for the good guys"" or feeling that sense of pumped-up macho bravado that I often experience with action films. Though I did experience a slew of different emotions, I think for most of the movie I was in shock--just as I was on that very day six years ago.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I cried, when the epilogue began to roll. Not because of what I read on the screen (I already knew the information), but because I think I finally could allow myself to let go and start to feel what I just seen and relived. I will need more time to fully process the impact the movie had on me, but I will agree with others that thus far it has been an extremely cathartic experience.<br/><br/>It is hard to judge this film on strictly technical merit because of the power of its content. I will say that the acting, direction, camera work, and editing are excellent. They absolutely get it right. You could say that the story development could have been more complex and compelling, but I think if you are trying to judge this movie on that level you are totally missing the point. The narrative is what it is: how things unfolded on September 11th (or our understanding of them).<br/><br/>This in not a film about politics, patriotism, or national pride. It is just a story of what happened on one particular day in September of 2001 and the people involved and some of the lives it touched. The biggest impact of the movie is dependent upon you; and that depends on how 9/11 affected you, and how you've dealt with it since. For me this movie was a very positive experience, and one that I believe has helped me heal just a little bit more from the wounds of the tragedy on that day."
"JamesD2","9","2","4","13 September 2007"," Surprisingly understated. Surpassed expectations
","I have to tell you that I really did not intend to see this movie. I have to confess to being numb on the subject of 911 due to the overdose of it in the media over the last 6 years. I was really expecting this to be in the line of ""win one for the red and blue"" and all that but it surprisingly was not at all. It was the most realistic movie I may have seen. Of course one can roll their eyes at such a statement considering the subject matter, but the acting was really understated which is almost unheard of in these types of flicks. In fact, due to the subject matter, this would have given them a license to go over the top with the melodrama, but they did not.<br/><br/>The director really showed both sides of the story here to an extent with respect to the fact that the terrorists were nervous as well and both sides were praying to their various Gods. You really got the chilling feeling the moment the passengers heard that two planes hit the towers as it probably took them a few minutes to process that information and what exactly it meant. It also really captured the confusion in the air traffic control towers as basically it took time for people to realize what was going on and nobody really knew what to do. What could they have done really? Not much in retrospect.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really can't stand melodramatic movies. What a shock it was that this was the LEAST melodramatic disaster film I have ever seen when it could very, very easily have been the most.<br/><br/>I am burnt out on the media overkill of 911, yet this movie still managed to be perhaps the most intense movie I have ever seen."

If you are someone like me, who lost loved ones in tragedy, and live in constant fear of that happening again, I don't recommend it. It just was very painful. For general viewing public, I think this story was much more real and worth your time than movies like World Trace Centre. I also liked how they didn't try to make the terrorists look like evil people. It just showed what happened in very dry manner.

","The events of 9-11 unfold in this film about one of the 4 hijacked planes that fateful day. While the other three aircraft hit their intended targets, the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane did not. It did not because the passengers took matters into their own hands and prevented it. The hijackers apparently didn't make any attempt to stop the passengers from talking on the ""air phones"" and cell phones, and they learned from loved ones that America was under attack by hijacked planes. They (the passengers), of course, knew that yet another American target would be hit if they didn't act. They made the decision to attempt the wrest the plane back from the hijackers. Ultimately, the plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, but it didn't attack an American target. The acting in this film is really good, and the story well-written for the screen. Of course, the screenplay really works on the emotions of the viewer and it succeeds. I found it to be a very well-produced and directed drama."
"antonvan","9","2","4","1 March 2007"," ""If I get out of this I'm quitting tomorrow.""
","When the first previews of ""United 93"" hit the theaters earlier this year, the feedback from the audience was pretty mixed. A common phrase used when taking about the upcoming disaster film was ""too soon"".<br/><br/>But in order to achieve the dramatical power the film pursues, it was crucial to release the film precisely now: almost five years have passed, but the unfortunate date still remains in our memories and therefore helps the film accomplish it's emotional drive.<br/><br/>The film's helmer, Paul Greengrass, has been making a name for himself for some time now, but he didn't exactly pop up until 2002 when his political drama/thriller about the Irish strike-turned-to-massacre, ""Bloody Sunday"", was released. In 2004 he directed a great sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"", called ""The Bourne Supremacy"". These two films give the viewer a good sense of his style of directing: very realistic, raw and not too dramatized. He really let's the images speak for themselves.<br/><br/>And now he has made quite possibly one of this year's most emotionally challenging films. It begins with a scene from a hotel room: a man that you will immediately see as one of the terrorists, praying. This is a key element when thinking about the terrorists and their motives: religion is definitely displayed as the soul motive for their acts.<br/><br/>After this we are witnessing the soon-to-be-hijackers arrive to the airport, go through security and finally board the plane. At the same time we see the other passengers getting ready for the flight, talking with each other and on the phone. You really feel like you're just witnessing actual events in a very documentary way instead of the usual Hollywood-style. The biggest factor in achieving this is the fact that all of the actors are relatively unknown especially outside TV. They really come out as just ordinary people on the edge of an enormous tragedy: and they all do a fantastic job.<br/><br/>The film goes through all the key moments of that day, from the first hijack speculations to the World Trade Center and Pentagon being hit. It is basically divided into two parts: there's the plane and its own atmosphere that is eventually being disturbed by violence, and there are the air traffic control towers throughout the east coast. The totally closed environment of the plane offers a great contrast to the control towers, where all the information and chaos is almost overwhelming, as opposed to the plane, where no one has any idea what's happening around them. The camera doesn't wander off these two sets for one second, so all the events are being witnessed through these two environments, especially the air-traffic towers. And this is just one more thing that strengthens the documentary style of the film.<br/><br/>The story that Paul Greengrass has created is naturally fictional since no one really knows what happened on the ""fourth plane"". However he has managed to gather a story that, created from the bits and pieces that are known about the flight, seems just about right and believable. Greengrass doesn't rush with the story, but let's it slowly evolve to the final climax that literally leaves the audience's mouths wide open. The ending scene is displayed with such beautiful minimalism and realism, that there hasn't been anything quite like it in cinema before. It crushes the viewer with it's total hopelessness, even though the course of the events has been clear to the viewer from the start. The only downside of the story is that some might find the air traffic control Â–sequences (that the film has quite a lot of) a bit dull as opposed to the plane-sequences. However this is highly individual and perhaps depends mainly on simply how strongly you feel about this whole event.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has truly created a masterpiece: a film that will have it's place in history for it's unbelievably realistic approach on a tragedy, that shocked an entire nation. True, the film owes much of it's emotional power to the fact that the events are still clear in our minds, but I don't see how it couldn't also work as an independent film, separated from the WTC-tragedy.<br/><br/>ps. This was originally written for school, and therefore has some pretty obvious stuff mentioned that I wouldn't normally point out."
"gradyharp","10","2","4","30 January 2007"," Paul Greengrass Creates the Impossible: Capturing the Horror of 9/11
","Though it has been over five years since the devastation of 9/11 the memory lives on, a day no one will ever forget - nor should we. This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.<br/><br/>In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane. Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board. Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.<br/><br/>The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp"
"MovieDude1893","10","2","4","27 January 2007"," 'An affecting and fitting tribute to the unlikely heroes who lost their lives'
","Are we as Americans ready to see the events of 9/11 re-enacted up on the screens of our local theaters? It's a touchy subject and the makers of 'United 93' are aware of this fact. They walk a delicate tightrope between offending or paying homage to those who lost their lives that fateful day.<br/><br/>With Paul Greengrass at the helm, United 93 manages to become the best film it can be despite, as I said, touchy subject matter. With the guide of Greengrass' steady hand we are thrusted into the date: September 11, 2001. The film proceeds in real time.<br/><br/>The first half is set in different air traffic control towers across the U.S. They frantically try to stabilize the situation at hand(the hijacking of multiple planes). We know nothing about the people talking except the few details that are mentioned the very day of the hijackings. Greengrass' screenplay never resorts to 'Airport' stereotypes. I am extremely happy to report that no one in this film is slapped and ordered to get a hold of themselves.<br/><br/>The second is just as affecting and sustains the same narrative and technical structure of the first half. Now, we are moved on to United Flight 93. Again, we know very little about the passengers. We hear bits of conversations. It feels as if we are waiting in the airport terminal with these people who are essentially complete strangers. Luckily, Greengrass makes sure no passenger on the plane is pilot who no longer flies yet somehow must face his fears and (dramatic pause) FLY THE PLANE!!! The franticness with which the passengers band together has a rather vivid feel to it.<br/><br/>The conclusion is fairly obvious from the word ""go"". However, Greengrass presents such a compelling portrait we are lost and are near the edge of our seats to view the climax. <br/><br/>That brings us to the climax, which is an oddity. It is simultaneously uplifting and sobering.<br/><br/>Uplifting and Sobering.<br/><br/>Much like the film.<br/><br/>The #3 film of 2006."

One thought I had before seeing this film is that this will be an airplane movie like Red Eye, Flightplan, or Snakes on a Plane. I was wrong. Instead, it shows the point of view on different characters, some who are not on the plane and the rest that are on the flight.<br/><br/>This film also shows human spirit and how we work together. There wasn't any main characters but for no-named actors, they were good. This film is thrilling and suspenseful, while some may never see the film because it's ""too soon"".<br/><br/>It's not soon. It's a perfect time to see the film and all of you who thinks this film should never be created. It ever reaches the political side. Everyone knows the story and know how it ends but it's still thrilling.<br/><br/>The last 30 to 15 minutes are the best. It'll leave you speechless.

"MaxBorg89","10","2","4","23 January 2007"," A shocking, heartbreaking tribute to the victims of 9/11
","2006 was a memorable year for movies, for many reasons. One such reason is the fact that for the first time Hollywood had the guts to tackle a painful subject like 9/11, only five years after that terrible day. While Oliver Stone's World Trade Center was a decent film, it suffered from the occasional ""inspired"" auteur touches, which were meant to add emotional power but actually made the movie more pretentious. United 93, on the other hand, stands out as the better of the two achievements because of its straightforward approach to the events: no contrivances, no hidden messages, no attempt to glamorize the tragedy. Just good old honest storytelling.<br/><br/>The film deals with the hijacking of the titular aircraft, the only one, of the four that were taken on September 11, that didn't hit its target. The reason? The passengers and crew, knowing they would probably die anyway, decided to try and stop the terrorists nonetheless, so that they could have at least one chance to see their loved ones again. This part of the story doesn't actually take place until one hour into the movie, as the director Paul Greengrass builds up the suspense by cutting between the plane calmly flying on its designed route, airports suddenly realizing some aircrafts are missing, and the military wondering what's going on. Then the WTC is attacked, panic breaks loose on the ground and in the air and all everyone can do is stand and watch the images of the Twin Towers falling apart, asking in horror how this can be possible. From this point on, the outcome of the events is painfully obvious.<br/><br/>United 93 is a gripping, staggering picture. Much of its impact is due to Greengrass's documentary-style direction: the film is shot entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it a more realistic tone; the characters are all portrayed by unknown actors, allowing the audience to connect with all of them, not just one or two ""team leaders""; and, most crucially, the events occur in real time, adding to the nerve-wrecking tension. All these elements contribute in making the movie an almost unbearably intense experience. Such is the power of the film some might even not be able to watch the last five minutes, where the pain and suspense reach their emotionally exhausting climax. We feel for these people because they were the kind we would run into every day. Unlike the firefighters in Oliver Stone's 9/11 film, the plane's passengers didn't deal with potentially lethal situations on a regular basis, and their sacrifice had nothing to do with patriotism: they did it to save their own lives, perfectly aware of the risks and the slim chances to succeed. And while it's sometimes hard to watch, United 93 is a remarkable tribute to their courage."
"moviescore-1","10","2","4","9 January 2007"," Incredibly tense
","Without any doubt one of the best films of 2006, possibly *the* best American film, ""United 93"" really demonstrates the true power of the film medium. It grabs your attention immediately and it's impossible not to emerge yourself in the true story about the passengers on United Airlines' flight 93 on September 11, 2001 - despite the fact that you know how the story is going to end. It's quasi-documentary style fits the story like a glove, and remarkably, director Greengrass avoids every single opportunity to get into Hollywood-isms (single male heroics, presidential bullshit, 101 strings) - this is a terribly frightening film but it's also a very respectful depiction of the people who was on board that plane. Keeping everything in balance (another important example is the low-key but very effective score by John Powell), throwing in some strong critique towards the US authorities (who admittedly were in a state of shock and utter confusion during the 9/11 events), Greengrass succeeds in telling a story you already know in a way that really absorbs you."

Much of the film depicts the increasingly frantic efforts of civilian air traffic controllers and air force emergency response personnel to first comprehend and then take preventive action on that horrid morning, as the saga of four hijackings, and the destruction that followed, unfolded.<br/><br/>These scenes are intercut with others inside the cabin, aboard United flight 93, as terrified passengers and crew try to survive and retake control of the plane.

"angusmac54","10","2","4","30 December 2006"," An unobtrusive and genuinely moving account of the events of 9/11
","Where to begin. Well maybe i should start by saying that this is one of the best films i've seen recently- the type where you feel paralysed in your seat for a few minutes afterwards.<br/><br/>What makes the entire film such a masterpiece is its continual understatement from start to finish, and its belief that the audience will notice its subtleties and nuances without being fed them on a plate. Why? I can only conclude that it is down to British writer/director Paul Greengrass. There is no Hollywood finesse, misplaced patriotism, or need for a dollar generating superstar to play the the lead role.<br/><br/>The film is no more than a snapshot of time, and viewers aren't ever manipulated into an opinion. Those that call this film a piece of 'propaganda' are quite simply wrong. 'http://www.dictionary.com' defines propaganda as 'information, ideas, or rumours deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc'. I'm unable to see how this manages to apply to United 93. The film never passes judgement on Islam, America, the characters in the film or anybody else for that matter. As far as i can see, those on this website who have written negative reviews of this film are unable to face up to the fact that America did make a few blunders on 9/11. The film does justice to the good that the nation did do, but it is unashamed of presenting the facts.<br/><br/>For those desperately searching for a reason as to why this film was made, it is not supposed to show us a new version of events. It is supposed to be a story that can be applied to all aspects of life. It is supposed to reiterate morals, and, to an extent, try to explain to many the reasons that the attacks happened in the first place.<br/><br/>There are some truly beautiful moments in the film. When the plane first takes off, and we just catch a glimse of the very tops of the twin towers, or when both the hijackers and the passengers are praying, both to God but in two different languages, for example. These moments leave you thinking afterwards, and give the film depth and longevity.<br/><br/>From a theatrical point of view- the film could be described as Brectian in style. The audience are always watching from a distance, and do not become emotionally connected to the characters. By doing this, they are left with the facts, and forced to make their own conclusions.<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about this film- the informal but atmospheric style, or the excellent writing that makes the film feel like a piece of live action. But there is only so much that one can say, and i can only firmly encourage you to see this unobtrusive, understated, but truly remarkable piece of film."

It is filmed very much in a documentary style that totally engrosses from the beginning. You know what is going to happen but you want something to change it, a proper search by airport security, the plane to be grounded in lieu of the other attacks etc.<br/><br/>The film is genius in that it builds tension from the opening frames and never lets you go. The acting was superb all round and it really humanised the tragedy and the confusion of the day. You are transported to the back of that plane as a passenger and find yourself searching for a solution to the mayhem around you.<br/><br/>Amazingly, the film is uplifting in the final frames and finishes just a the right moment.

","The tragic events of 9/11, in particular, the huge loss of life that occurred at the Twin Towers could easily provide enough material for several feature films, so it comes as some surprise the first major film release inspired from 9/11 would be the lesser known story of those who lost their lives on United 93, the only plane not to reach its target. Also surprising is the even-handedness with which British director Paul Greengrass has brought to U93 as this film could very easily have succumbed to blatant flag waving, a 'tribute' to the American spirit (a la Ladder 49). Hell, if Jerry Bruckheimer had gotten hold of it he'd have had Arnie on the plane, and I'm sure Arnie would found a way to stop the film from crashing. Cynicism aside though, Greengrass's devotion to verisimilitude gives U93 a huge edge over anything that 'Hollywood' could have done with this film. Greengrass's use of the hand-held camera, nauseating in Bourne Supremacy and serviceable in Sunday Bloody Sunday, works a treat in United 93, conveying so well the fear and desperation of the plane's passengers, but also the anxiety of the terrorists themselves, especially before the actual hijacking. The tension is un-paramount, as is the confusion Greengrass captures in the FAA and Air-Defence headquarters, as people struggle to comprehend and control the situation. Greengrass's decision to move the film around in between places other than the actual plane works extremely well, with one particularly harrowing scene taking place inside the New York Airport control tower as they see they second plane coming in low (at this stage the first plane was considered a possible accident) before cutting to CNN footage of the impact as FAA workers watch stunned. U93 is a great example of how such dramatic material can still be done with subtlety. There is no constant and dramatic score, but somehow Greengrass creates incredible tension right until the last moment. This film is ultimately about the heroism of the plane's passengers, their efforts to not simply 'lay down' is compelling. The fact that we know the end result of the film does not detract one iota. As of yet I haven't seen Oliver Stone's World Trade Centre, and though Stone can critique America has well as he can celebrate it, I cannot imagine it being half as good as United 93."

","Typically, I have steered clear of 9/11 films, though I have viewed a couple of related feature-length productions. ""United 93"" is actually one of the best films I have seen all this year (2006). This is not a dramatization of 9/11 as much as it is a factual recount. The writing, the performances and the cinematography all place you in the hot seat of NY ATC Command; in chief positions of FAA; in command at NORAD; and in the tense passenger seat of United Flight 93. The experience becomes personal as the events of that day are realistically installed into the looming fate of the last flight to go down on 9/11. There are no frivolous set-ups; no character-building is placed into the story and no personal backgrounds are highlighted.

","Unflinching in it's realism, United 93 comes as close as possible to recreating the real time drama that unfolded on 9/11, using the one failed terrorist plot as a focal point. While we may never know the particulars of that mysterious day, and can quite reasonably argue that perhaps the events unfolded in an entirely different way then what was portrayed, one can certainly not fault the humble and passionate filming of Paul Greengrass, as he relentlessly parlays all of the ""facts"" as we have come to know them into an amazing piece of pseudo documenting. Painstaking detail is given to the inept bureaucratic formalities that kept the good guys from pursuing the quickest course of just action, starting with the brilliantly plotted introduction of the 1st plane crash via air traffic control. From then on out, the chaos that continued to multiply on that frightful day is offered amazing counterpoint with the quiet, intuitive struggles that went on over Pennsylvania on United 93. While the action is certainly intense, the majority of time on board is spent simply being with these individual characters, but due to the quick edits and frantic nature, not long enough to gain any real connection with. However, the focus on environment rather then individual characters does tend to immerse the viewer into this unprecedented experience that much more effectively. Certain ""patriots"" who immediately play the exploitation card as a reason to boycott anything creatively done in the name of September 11th, should first at least check out the DVD extra's, which elegantly details the entire flight's families considering, accepting, and eventually embracing the idea of what this particular movie was to be all about. In the climactic throngs of unity, emotional truths massively outweigh whatever grudges anyone could seemingly muster for this must see, as the year's most powerful final scene reminds us in all that is good with humanity, and it's offspring, the arts."

I am thankful to have seen a movie that portrays the heroes and evildoers as they truly were, instead of some politically correct film that tries to create sympathy for the terrorists and/or vilify the heroes. The flight passengers who fought back were truly the heroes, and the terrorists were truly the villains.

","A rather suspenseful film, United 93 does a rather admirable job of dramatizing (note the word 'dramatize' here) the events surrounding the terrorist attacks of September 11, especially that of United Airlines Flight 93, the aircraft which crashed just outside of Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>From the very early scenes, the film seems to have a suspenseful, haughty atmosphere to it. It's as if the director acknowledges that nothing can be done about the fate of the aircraft, as the audience already knows what's going to happen. As the film moves along, the trepidation increases to a new high as the aircraft taxis to it's designated runway and prepares for take-off. It's like that feeling of dread, an ""Oh no!"" moment where you wish you could go back and stop a certain past event from recurring, even though you know that there's nothing you can do about it.<br/><br/>The scenes from NORAD, the FAA and the Air Traffic Controllers tracking the hijacked planes are shot and acted admirably, heightening the suspense and feeling of helplessness and frustration that many people on the ground must have been feeling that day. The nameless actors also adds to a feeling of anonymity amongst the passengers, they're people you don't recognize, faces amongst the crowd. It this sense of ambiguity that raises the audiences pity and despair toward United 93's passengers, and your admiration for their sheer determination and resolve despite the circumstances and despite the fate that we all know awaits them.<br/><br/>There are a number of technical and factual flaws that this film seems to either distort or simply ignore, a possible result of dramatization, heightening of suspense or a move to 'lessen the blow' of the film's's unresolved climax. To call this film a 'documentary' would be a rather presumptuous gesture. Even 'docudrama' would be an exaggerated claim, as the film does not fit either of these categories.<br/><br/>Whatever the reasons behind the factual errors, United 93 remains what it intends to be - a harrowing, suspenseful and ultimately moving dramatization of the events which unfolded on that fateful day."

United 93 should set the standards for all 9/11 films to follow (Oliver Stone - with your big name cast - take note) With his docu-drama style and refusal to sensationalise Paul Greengrass just tells it like it is, or at least how we think it probably was. Mix this with great script writing which builds the tension almost unbearably (this is a story of events after all NOT a documentary) and consultation with the relatives of those killed and the air traffic officials actually involved and this is an unconventional and brave film. I admire him for using and unknown cast, and I admire the balance of viewpoints taken from the passengers and the terrorists. And most of all I admire the many people who played themselves in the film and were obviously keen for this story to be told."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","23 July 2006"," Both sensitive and stunning
","Although there have already been a couple of television programmes on the seismic events of 11 September 2001, this is the first feature film. There will, of course, be many more, but it is difficult to imagine a more stunning and impactful one. In a sense, therefore, it is ironic that the writer and director Paul Greengrass is British and that most of the filming was done at the Pinewood studio just outside London, using the inside of a salvaged Boeing 757.<br/><br/>The style adopted by Greengrass so effectively is an utterly sparse one. The hand-held camera work and rapid cutting give the whole thing the feel of a documentary. There is no preamble or scene-setting, no flash-backs, no explanations, no star actors. Instead the narrative is simply linear and the confusion self-evident. The research as to events and dialogue is meticulous, members of the aircrew are played by actual stewardesses and pilots, and many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves.<br/><br/>There may be no analysis or commentary but many of the messages are stark. The nearest F-16 was 100 miles away and the military knew nothing of the airliner's fate until four minutes after it struck the ground. Neither the President nor the Vice-President was in contact. They and we were totally unprepared for an event of this nature.<br/><br/>Since United Airlines flight 93 took off from Newark airport 40 minutes later than scheduled, the passengers were able to learn of the suicide missions carried out by the three other sets of hijackers. Since the time to elapse from the first jet slamming into the World Trade Center to the crashing of United 93 was around an hour, this film is able to adopt a real-time narrative.<br/><br/>The tension, as the 40 passengers gradually understand more about their dilemma and plan a last-ditch effort to gain control of the plane, is almost unbearable. The mobile calls to relatives and friends makes one's eyes well with tears. The timing and nature of the final shot - the actual crash and a totally black scene - is stunning.<br/><br/>This impressive and compelling work was produced in full co-operation with the relatives of the passengers and it is a fitting tribute to them, their bravery and their sacrifice."

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>This is a reconstruction of the events, which happened on 9/11 focusing on what happened on Untied Airlines 93 flight. The film enjoy the fact that director & writer Paul Greengrass has decided to approach this film in a style that is combined of documentary and feature film. This approach is support with the fact he has used some of the real people playing themselves in the film. This lend the film some of its strongest point. One can only imagine how difficult it was for these people to re-live the events of 9/11. Anther point of strength is the use of unfamiliar faces to play the passengers and crew of United 93. This decision has kept the story in focus and you are not distract by the actors. The story is faithful to the facts(as much as possible) and there is no trying in making it end differently than it has been, while in the course of the film you wish it has been different(in real, not in the film). The film give you a punch in the stomach and leave you breathless and do this effectively in only 91 minutes.<br/><br/>In one line: A film to see."

","Paul Greengrass has created a stunner. Dramatizing the events of 9/11 was an obvious challenge. First he had to justify the making of the movie against widespread opinions that it was uncomfortably soon to let film makers dramatize the story. Add to that the fact that the audience had presumably seen, heard, talked about and read every conceivable angle of 9/11. Greengrass avoids the slight impediments deftly. United 93 tells an almost real-time account of the story, from individual points of view, bringing each experience out so vividly and intimately that we relive it along with the characters. It does not attempt to glorify the heroes of the fateful flight, neither does it load the story with Hollywood-style colors and dramatics. It just tells the story in a real and grounded manner, and sets it in a palpable world where bad things happen to good people, and man stands up to protect himself and fight oppression. And that's what makes it all work out so well."
"SisterSarah007","Null","2","4","15 June 2006"," Is it wrong to watch/create this kind of film?
","I watched this film last night and thought it was a very deep and emotive film.<br/><br/>However, as I watched it I realised that although the film can be touching a very raw nerve, are my fellow viewers sick for watching almost 'car crash' television whilst eating their popcorn and sweets?<br/><br/>Naturally I feel that this is perhaps a very tunnel visioned view but this 'issue' has been at the centre of a very controversial debate. In my eyes, this is how I feel:-<br/><br/>1) When choosing to watch the film, I wanted to see what happened on that fateful day - there was so much in the film that I didn't realise/contemplate or even consider. <br/><br/>2) I completely understand that some people really have no desire to watch that film at all but at the same time the same principle can then be applied to other films such as Jar Head during the Gulf War, War Films, Munich etc etc. So what makes this film so different apart from the lapse of time between 9/11 and day of release? But is that such a bad thing? <br/><br/>3) Thanks to IMDb, before watching I read on the website that the filmmakers had used a proportion of the proceeds from the film (perhaps the cinema tickets) to put towards the memorial for the United 93 victims. This figure turned out to be 1.95million. OK - that may be relatively small in proportion to how much money is generated from a film - but then again - there has still been a contribution so I can only feel drop of satisfaction<br/><br/>PS - As for the rating of the film - i don't know - i didn't know how to rate it. it's not something that was rateable. for me i gave it a 9 because quite simply it was something that made me think - opened my mind and my eyes! is that an over clichÃ©d thing to say?<br/><br/>Sorry has been on my mind all day - so thought I would put to you guys!"
"dunmore_ego","10","2","4","25 May 2006"," United They Fall
","Oh, stop whining! <br/><br/>*United 93* was bound to bring out the bitch in politically-gutless 2006 America: any issue that invokes the oh-so-hip splash-appellation ""9-11"" is like a hog call to every uninformed swine with two cents worth of a knee-jerk opinion.<br/><br/>But beyond the whines of ""too soon"" and ""disrespect"" and ""exploitation"" is the sheer raw power of this breath-defying film experience. *United 93*, unlike its detractors or those too disturbed to enter a theater without first checking Terrorist Alert colors to concede more usurpation of their civil liberties, displays no histrionics, no flag-waving and no political stance.<br/><br/>Here's a suggestion: shut up and watch.<br/><br/>Writer-director Paul Greengrass delivers a film like nothing you will ever see regarding that fateful day of 2001 - there is no structural arc, no foreshadowing of events, no statements made that in hindsight will hammer home portent; no character studies, no stereotypes and no movie stars. We feel as alienated on the plane  amongst those vaguely familiar aspirin ad faces - as both passengers and terrorists.<br/><br/>Like any Titanic or Jesus movie, everyone in the world knows the ending. Yet every minute, every second is compelling. Greengrass somehow still convinces us that we are boarding a plane on a routine flight from Newark to San Francisco on September 11, 2001. When it is hijacked, we are almost as surprised as the passengers.<br/><br/>Four Muslim hijackers dispatch the pilots and aim the plane on a suicide course at (it is presumed) the White House. Through clandestine cell-phoning, the hostages become aware of the WTC Tower attacks, and deduce that they too are on a fuel-laden suicide missile. From innumerable accounts (from family of the deceased, military bases and air traffic facilities) Greengrass has pieced together this tale of what might have transpired after the hijacking. Though the passengers (we again presume) fought valiantly to regain control of the aircraft, it crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania field, 150 miles northwest of the Capitol. No one survived.<br/><br/>What is *United 93* trying to achieve? Is it an entertaining piece of fiction? A docu-drama? A tribute? A eulogy? As with all art, the answer seems to be different in the eye of each beholder. There are as many views terming it all these things, as there are those who misconstrue its purpose and then criticize it for not achieving what *they* wish it to achieve. For example, those considering it a ""tribute"" castigate Greengrass for intercutting scenes of the Muslims praying to their god with scenes of the Christians praying to *their* god, thus tarnishing the ""tribute."" But Greengrass has crafted an altogether neutral account, an objective document of that dazed and confused day of infamy.<br/><br/>Greengrass effects aloofness with non-intrusive hand-held cameras, flitting about the action and crash-cutting over reams of small talk and daily routine  from airport control towers, to the Muslim hijackers, to passengers, to military control bases. Considering many of the air traffic controllers play themselves (most notably, Ben Sliney, FAA National Operations Manager), there is no slouching in the acting department, each performance evoking an on screen sincerity long forgotten by politicians and movie stars.<br/><br/>John Powell's understated score bleeds intermittently through the tension, and at one point, is heart-wrenching: in a long shot showing the North Tower billowing smoke, there is a single orchestra stab as Flight 175 slams into the South Tower. And then there is silence. That one stunning second is the only archive footage used in this film. It will wring the breath from your body. Whilst watching the awestruck participants on screen, in their unmitigated shock, that day-mare becomes real all over again.<br/><br/>There are those that maintain the passengers ""gave their lives in the name of freedom""; that they were ""heroes."" No. They gave their lives in the name of trying to save their lives. And a ""hero"" is a person who has OPTIONS and yet chooses the hard road. These people were brave (maybe), courageous (maybe), but heroes? No. Yet there is nothing less noble in what they achieved - appending a falsity to their motivation is to make those left behind feel better about themselves.<br/><br/>Even at the most obvious juncture to create Hollywood Heroes  Flight 93's eventual crash  Greengrass avoids the temptation judiciously, also wisely eschewing gratuitous explosions (even the shots of the WTC Towers afire are almost incidental). Tastefully and powerfully, instead of a Michael Bay yellow-vermilion fireball cut from four angles and tweaked to Hiroshima level, the aircraft's final impact scene is viewed from the inside of the cockpit, as passengers madly grapple with the Muslim pilot, as the plane tilts earthward, turbines and people screaming, and amidst arms and bodies frantically entangled, the ground swells up sickeningly fast with a gut-wrenching cut to black.<br/><br/>By dambusting past the occlusions thrown up by the government with this simple and direct film, *United 93* jarringly opens the nation's eyes, bringing the unresolved Taliban holy war to the forefront of our consciousness once more.<br/><br/>Remember Osama Bin Laden? The original Bad Guy in this conflict (who actually *took the blame for the WTC attacks*)? Initially exploited as an excuse to manufacture fear and pillage civil liberties, Bin Laden was quietly reshuffled to the bottom of the deck by the Republican administration in order to keep their pockets padded and their consciences black as the insides of rectums. Like AIDS and The Environment and Gay Marriage, an unresolved platform garners so much more political leverage. And it's just plain rude to arrest your business partners while you're still doing business with them...<br/><br/>Yet there are no causes explored in this film, no reasons explained and  most refreshingly - no moralism attached. *United 93* may be nothing more than an unstructured fiction based loosely on fact, but it may achieve nothing less than a nationwide catharsis.<br/><br/>(Read this unabridged article at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/United93.html)"
"MrJigsaw","Null","2","4","7 May 2006"," Nice polite doomed people.....
","In a recent interview writer/director Paul Greengrass seemed sincere about wanting to present a meticulously researched ""docu-drama"" about the biggest mass murder in American history, paying full deference to the wishes and sensitivities of surviving family members; he was also careful to include the obligatory reference to Islam being a great religion hijacked by fanatics etc. (more on that in a moment). I haven't seen his other work but I'm sure it never would've occurred to him that he'd be making a kind of ""snuff film."" But essentially that's what we have here. We're forced to share a plane ride with a set of nice polite (mostly) white people, all of whom (known by us but not by them) are going to die that morning. Would anyone else out there care to admit having indulged since 09/11/01 in some guilty speculation about what it must've been like being in that plane? Well, here's your chance to find out. Except for a few liberties that we know Greengrass took based on the findings of the 09/11 Commission, I absolutely ""buy into"" this depiction of events on United 93. How do I feel afterward? Pretty damn glad to be alive, frankly.<br/><br/>Notice how slowly and mundanely it all goes at first: have you ever contemplated all the little things you do that would seem precious and amazing if you knew they were for the last time? Reading a newspaper, looking at clouds, drinking or eating or urinating, hugging or kissing (etc.) someone, watching TV, filling up your gas tank (if you can afford that nowadays) ----imagine never doing any of those things again, knowing everyone else'll go on doing them without you. That's where ""United 93"" really ""got me"" ---the part before all the action---having to sit with and listen to all these pleasant ordinary future corpses, the kind of people most of us know. We don't need to be ""introduced to"" them personally, in fact it's more poignant without that; each of us can better ""identify with"" each passenger, projecting our own personal details or those of people we know. (Some have asked ""Why didn't the passengers 'do more,' or do it sooner?"" Well, they'd been brought up to ""behave themselves"" and be co-operative. This wasn't Israel where terrorism's a quotidian reality. Nobody knew what to do.) The tension (not suspense) would be unbearable if Greengrass didn't often cut away to the air traffic controllers and others trying to function amidst mounting chaos and uncertainty. I would've believed every minute of that even if some of the real people hadn't been playing themselves. The single most effective moment comes not on the plane but as we stand with the controllers watching the second plane hit the other tower, leaving them (and us  again) in stunned silence....<br/><br/>I haven't delved into any political (or other) ramifications because the movie doesn't. George Bush is not seen, nor do I remember his name being mentioned. We hear the soldiers frantically trying to establish the ""rules of engagement"" from on high, and that's enough, point made. (I liked the one hijacker speaking German on the phone, reminding us that the failure to prevent 09/11 was an international one.) I do wish that Greengrass had had a character lament the absence of armed air marshals on the planes---that was my first question as news unfolded on 09/11---""Don't they still have guys with guns on those planes?"" (One more reason I'm glad I haven't flown since 1985.) A few other points: Greengrass takes such pains to present the hijackers as devout Muslims that ironically he leaves at least some of us presuming the Koran must really say it's okay to kill civilians or they wouldn't be constantly quoting it. (Most of the hijackers that day were middle-class Saudis whose motivation was political not religious; many of them indulged in western ""decadence"" when they were living here.) Some have questioned the scene showing the passengers stomping a couple of the hijackers before reaching the cockpit, but that also seemed plausible to me. These people were scared and desperate and enraged, hearts racing and adrenaline pumping, spontaneously clawing for any chance to survive; too bad for the ""holy warriors"" if they got a few bruises en route to their ""72 virgins"" or whatever.<br/><br/>There can't really be a ""spoiler"" for a movie like this, but here's a warning for those who get dizzy easily: if you saw ""Blair Witch Project,"" remember that queasy feeling you got from all that jittery hand-held camera work? Well, ""United 93"" magnifies that ""big time."" Mercifully, Greengrass doesn't let the camera dive all the way to the ground with the plane, or I'm sure I would've been racing for the red EXIT sign on which I had my eye. I've never actually vomited at a movie but this was touch and go. (It was hours before I felt ""normal"" again.) Had I not been distracted by feeling ill, I'm sure I would've found the whole thing as emotionally moving as Greengrass intended. But it's a masterful if brutal piece of work and should be seen by every American who can (literally) stomach it. Especially now with this endless bloody morass in Vietnam---er, sorry, Iraq---it's crucial for us to be reminded that violent death is real and horrible and permanent. (I don't care if you believe in an afterlife, it won't be this one that you've always known. If you believe in reincarnation, it won't be the same ""you."") There's nothing ""ennobling"" about being a victim. None of those passengers would have chosen to be a dead ""hero."" If you leave the cinema enjoying each additional breath just a little more (I sure needed some air) and if that even just minutely influences how you continue to live and interact with other people (e.g. telling someone ""I love you"" daily, not just in extremis), then ""United 93"" really will be a ""memorial"" to so many lives stupidly wiped out.."

","""United 93"" is not so much a film as it is a mirror. It reflects back to the viewer the feelings and emotions of September 11, 2001 without any attempt at amplification or modulation. In that respect it is perhaps the most unemotional film I have ever seen. There are no dramatic effects used to create the artistic bridge to empathy. That bridge is already present in those who experienced the events.<br/><br/>The experience of the film is powerful because it taps into our own powerful real-life memories. However I wonder how it will play to children born today when they are old enough to see it. Will their reaction be as detached as the film, or will the film still draw in emotion that it does not exhale? Obviously I am unable to make a useful conclusion about that, but my guess is that it will still remain a powerful experience."
"ArizWldcat","10","2","4","1 May 2006"," Overwhelming
","Paul Greengrass and company took a unique approach to this film. The viewer feels as if she or he was right there in the room as the action progressed. As the roomful of air traffic controllers realize that one of the WTC towers has been hit, there is a stunned disbelief, followed by the logical statement that that gaping hole couldn't have been made by a Cessna (as was first reported...a small private plane has hit the WTC). Then, when the second plane hit, stunned silence, followed by yelling to keep moving...there is work to be done. What would have helped me would have been a small clock in the bottom of the screen...it was difficult to keep focused on where in time we were, and I was a bit confused at the end (minor spoiler) because it says that the military was not notified that 93 had been hijacked until 4 min. after it crashed, but the air traffic controllers were talking about it well before it crashed in the film. That said, this felt so real! There was no melodrama. Many of the air traffic controllers portrayed themselves; the actors portraying the passengers (and hijackers) were unknowns. The passengers look like real people...they were all sizes and ages (except, thank the Lord, no children!!) and some were without makeup, just as in real life. What a stunning movie. I wept several times as the enormity of how much our lives changed that day hit me over and over again. I recommend it. It's not easy to watch, but worth seeing."

","United 93 directed by Paul Greengrass in 2006 is about a plane that was hijacked on 9/11 the day the twin towers were destroyed. United 93, however, did not reach its destination and would end up crashing in an empty field in Pennsylvania. I would give this film a 7/10 because of the good editing and acting the film had.<br/><br/>To start off, I will be examining the editing in the film. A good part of editing in the film was when it would go back and forth while the passengers and the hijackers were both praying. In this scene, the director was trying to show sort of a connection between the two since they both were praying for a god they believe in. They also relate since they were both praying because they were scared. The passengers were fearing for their safety, while the hijackers were fearing that something would go wrong or the people would interfere with their plan.<br/><br/>To add on, I will be examining the acting and dialogue in the film. A good part of acting in the film was when all the people in the control center were going crazy after they saw the attack on the World Trade Center. The people in the control center were trying to figure out what happened in New York while there were two more planes being hijacked. This would cause the control center to go into chaos since there are people asking questions and trying to contact the pilots of the planes that were hijacked. This scene shows the acting and dialogue they would have to have in order to talk over each other and make the main dialogue stand out from the people in the background.<br/><br/>My opinion on this film is really good. It starts off slow but as the movie progresses it gets better and more interesting. You should see this film if you are in a pretty action-packed movie and if you like learning about things that happened earlier in US history."

","In United 93 it gives us a personal viewpoint on flight 93 and what happened in the personally happen to everyone in this tragic story. I give this film a 9/10 because of the great Acting and dialogue and the Editing. It Just missed motifs but it had some like all the religious actions and acts that took place in the move can be considered on and it makes sense but the lack of motifs made it not a 10/10 movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, I will be examining Acting/Dialogue about the film and it was showed really great. The fact that you feel you are a part of the movie shows that the movie had good Acting and Dialogue. The parts when the people in the main control system's reactions and dialogue shows what it was truly like there. It shows how professional the acting and how the dialogue plays a great part in the movie. Not only that when the hijackers did the plan the plane shows is how it really happen. That happened because the actors had amazing acting and played well with all the other elements the movie offered. Not only that the Dialogue when the family called there parents made me feel sad and upset that this event happen. That was because the dialogue was genuine and it was performed in a professional level. The Acting and the Dialogue were one of the best aspects of the movie. I like how historically accurate it was and how the everything went together as it should.<br/><br/>Then, I will be examining Editing about the film. The Editing worked so well in the movie because when the part when the hijackers were flying the plane recklessly to make the passengers go all over the place kept editing to get both of the reaction and the actions that happen. It shows what happen and why they did it and it just paints a great story. Not only that the editing of the cuts were you see the outside of the plane makes you feel and see that the actors were actual on the plane. It shows us a detailed summary that happen in flight 93. It shows the editing was professnail because all the cuts and edits worked perfectly with each other and it works good with the Acting/Dialogue. I just wish that there was more character development in the movie so it can be a perfect movie.<br/><br/>I gave the Movie flight 93 a 9/10 because it was a great historical film. It captures all of the key detail that happen that tragic day into a great movie to know what happen. Personal it was good because it started off great with the camera and the main character as the arabic people. Then it shows the decisions that make cause the outcome that happen. It shows how good the movie was and how well it was produce.It went a little boring when they were at the people were monitoring the planes but it helps build up the suspense. It just need more motifs to be a 10/10 but overall i would recommend people to watch this historical movie."

","The film United 93 was a 2006 movie that was directed by Paul Greengrass. This film recalls the events of September 11th, 2001 and focuses on the flight United 93 which was hijacked but never reached its destination thanks to the passengers who revolted against the hijackers. Unfortunately, all the passengers lost their life after the hijackers crashed the plane into a field in Pennsylvania. Of the 4 planes hijacked on that day, United 93 was the only plane to never reach its destination. I give this fim a 8/10 because the acting and dialogue were great as well as the cinematography.<br/><br/>Firstly, I will be examining the acting and dialogue of this film. In my opinion, the acting and dialogue really made this film much more interesting and really made it seem as if I was there that day. The actors did a great job of playing their roles and showing emotion. For example, when the phone calls were being made, the dialogue was great and the actors did a great job of showing real emotion.<br/><br/>Last, I will be examining the cinematography of the film. I feel like the cinematography was good overall, but it could have been better. The director did a good job of making sure he captured the best shots to make the movie more intense. He also did a great job of making sure to switch the shots from place to place to make sure every detail was included. The cinematography could have been better though towards the end when the passengers were revolting because I felt like it was too zoomed in and it didn't really capture all of the action.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was overall good. I feel like it was boring at some points but towards the end it became more interesting. I would recommend this movie if you are interested in films about historic events."

","30 April 2006. The best 2006 movie yet, United 93 is gritty, raw, and real in the acting and particularly the sound effects. This powerful and emotionally enveloping movie provides a front row seat without the big budget, big studio performances. The acting feels authentic, the dialogue true to life (though of course much is fabricated in detail) based on the true outline of what is known. There isn't any sentimentality. But there are a few likely revelations regarding the United States aviation and military response that the general public wasn't aware that are likely true, particularly regards to other hijacked planes and the military and Federal Aviation Administration disconnect. The terrorists and the violence are handled respectfully. The apparent weaknesses in the movie come towards the end where the nice balance between the hostages on the plane, the FAA, and military scenes are exclusively taken over by the plane scene and the translation of the terrorists seems to stop at the end. The decision to focus on the third person observer position and hearing only one-sided dialogue over cell phones is a question that may never be answered. Overall, this is a powerful movie without answers, but allows the American people a greater appreciation of what likely happened at many levels of our country involved in United 93.

While over half of the film wants to have this really repetitive and slow back-and-forth between the different airlines, I was just waiting for the really heart-pumping and emotional scenes aboard Flight 93.<br/><br/>Flight 93 and the story of all those within in it have the most impact on me, and despite the fact that September 11, 2001 as a whole is important for this film, I wish less was spent focused on the dialogue about the other attacks and more about what went on within this plane. All of the people in charge of the airplane frequencies and who conversed about the planes was kind of boring to me, and I wish some of it was cut out,<br/><br/>As for everything involving Flight 93, it was perfect. The final twenty minutes of this film are some of the most emotional moments I have ever seen put to film. It was emotional, heart-breaking, and lifted my spirit , despite how depressing it was. I just wish over half of the film didn't get so consumed with really boring acronyms and airplane terms that the average person isn't aware of."

","The first thing I noticed was how realistic the film is - mostly thanks to clever photography and a relatively unknown cast. I found this very sad, fascinating and incredibly well done. It is one of those films that causes a lump in one's throat since we know the fate of the passengers from the very first moment."

","This is a simple, powerful, and uncomfortably in-your-face docudrama about what it might have been like to be aboard United Airlines flight 93. The only one of the four hijacked jets to fail to hit its intended target, UA 93 crashed in a field in Shanksville PA because of the actions of a group of passengers and crew who attempted, unfortunately without success, to take back the plane from the hijackers.<br/><br/>Their heroism caused the plane to crash nose first into the ground. They sacrificed themselves because there was nothing else to be done.<br/><br/>I was chilled to the bone by this film. It is stark, uncompromising, and to its credit, it does not try to portray the hijackers as subhuman or the passengers as mere victims. Every member of the cast comes across as a complete and fully fleshed out human being.<br/><br/>Not for the squeamish, but it is of great historical importance."

"jimbo-53-186511","6","0","0","30 January 2018"," Would have benefitted from better focus and a tighter running time, but the last 20 minutes or so make it worth the effort
","United 93 tells the true story of a plane that was hijacked on September 11th 2001 and the passengers on-board the plane fighting back against the terrorists in order to foil their plans...<br/><br/>Given that the majority of the media focus at the time was on the planes that actually crashed into the Twin Towers, this harrowing true story is one that people may have forgotten about or overlooked. Having watched the film, it's not an experience that I'm likely to forget and I'm more than willing to commend the bravery of the passengers for their actions on that fateful morning. However, as a piece of cinema I didn't find United 93 to be entirely satisfying...<br/><br/>The film is apparently shot in real-time and presumably Greengrass has done this to make the film feel more realistic and to perhaps draw the audience into the events as they happen. I think part of the problem with this film is that Greengrass has gone a little overboard with finer details - there is about a 30 minute build-up showing people waiting at the airport, waiting to board the plane etc and it's probably past the half hour mark before the plane even takes off. I'm sure in his mind that Greengrass did this perhaps as a way of building suspense, but I just found it a little tedious and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Also as the film is called United 93 I did expect the film to focus pretty much all of its attention on that flight. However, on various occasions the film cuts back to various air-traffic control centres with varying threats or actual hijackings taking place. There's nothing wrong with any of this per se, but it does make the film feel a little cluttered and unfocused at times - it's like Greengrass couldn't decide whether to make a documentary about the events of 9/11 or a film about the bravery of the passengers on-board flight UA 93. By trying to do both, the film. feels padded and far longer than it needs to be.
 
However, once you get past the hour mark, Greengrass does crank up the tension and in the last 20 minutes or so I literally could not take my eyes off the screen. I would still recommend watching this film, but do feel that with a shorter running time and slightly better focus that I may have enjoyed it more than I did."
"Screen_Blitz","10","0","0","4 July 2017"," Paul Greengrass's portrayal of the 9/11 attacks is a harrowing experience, but one that is impossible to forget
","September 11, 2001 marks one of the darkest days in American history. Helming a cinematic project inspired by the horrifying day is never an easy task. As thousands of lives along the Twin Towers were lost that day, it's no surprise that many people are simply not ready to relive such a tragic event; some may never be ready. Families were broken and our nation was left shaken to the core. How long will it be before a Hollywood retelling would be appropriate for the big screen. Nonetheless, it is an important story that needs to be told, and it is all done at the hands of director Paul Greengrass. While this doesn't mark the first time Greengrass as brought a tragic real-life event to the silver screen, as one of his past projects 'Bloody Sunday' centered on 1972 Irish Civil Rights protests, is a difficult to believe that the man behind the 'Bourne' films to be he right choice for showcasing the 9/11 attacks. To a stunning surprise, Greengrass establishes an unflinchingly realistic documentary-style retelling of the harrowing events both inside and outside Flight 93, slapping you with the sense that will make you constantly remind yourself that you are not trapped inside the plane in the midst of the chaos. It is a picture destined to leave you haunted long after the end credits roll. Told in real- time, this film centers on the events following the hijacking inside the Flight 93 by the hands of terrorists of Al-Queda, and the passengers that were taking hostage in the heat of the moment. The film alternates back-and-forth between the grisly chaos inside the plane, to the response of the FAA headquarters, to the crew of various air control centers fighting to acquire a signal of everything that is going on as the Twin Towers and the Pentagon are imminently destroyed by three other planes joining in the devastating attack. <br/><br/>It is impossible to accurately confirm an actual representation of what happened on Flight 93. After all, nobody survived to tell the story. But Paul Greengrass's portrayal of the tragic events are about as accurate as a Hollywood director can get. Regardless, everyone who remembers or is even familiar with the event can predict the outcome, and it is far from a happy one. Told in real- time accounts, the first thirty minutes are very procedural, exhibiting the passengers who we never get know board the plane including four other passengers who later reveal to be the terrorists, and the day-to-day life of the air control crew and the members of the FAA headquarters preparing of what was supposed to be a day like every other. Greengrass puts no effort into character development nor does he dispense politics into the mix. But the question is, is it necessary? No, because these were people no one outside of their family got to know. Instead, Greengrass establish each individual as an average person going on with his or her life, and Greengrass avoid distractions by not casting widely known actors in the roles. This method does nothing to stop our heart aching for the anticipated events. When the first hijacking, which takes offscreen in another airplane, starts, that is when all comfort is gone. The film showcases the shock and stress of the FAA headquarters and the air control crew as they must cope with the hopeless events including the destruction of the Twin Towers which are momentarily shown on television images with millions watching. If there is even a single moment of levity, that is when the head of the FAA calls to shut down international air travel. When focusing on the terror attacks inside Flight 93 marks the most harrowing segments. With tear-stricken passengers held hostage and tortured heartlessly, Greengrass decently avoids slipping into exploitation territory or drenching the events with sentimental manipulation. Using his signature documentary-style cinematography, he authenticity captures not only the stress and confusion of the passengers, but the claustrophobia of the confined space. His methodology results in tension that effectively builds up to a punishingly devastating finale. The second that credits start rolling, there is no doubt many will be left emotionally drained.<br/><br/>United 93 is an emotionally devastating experience that no only respectfully honors the victims of the tragic day, but offers audiences are an unforgettable understanding of what happened that day and heroes who sacrificed their lives to foil a plot that threatened the very existence of our nation's capitol. It is definitely not an easy film to sit through, but it is an important one to say the least."

","What exactly transpired on United Flight 93 -- the fourth hijacked aircraft that did not meet its target on September 11, 2001 -- is something we may never know, but using information from dozens of interviews, this speculative drama portrays what may have occurred. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, the film is a riveting experience with the deliberately unsteady camera-work and lack of big name stars making the film feel like a documentary at times. Whether it benefits from flipping back and forth between the title flight and the frantic ground crew is debatable; tension dissipates every time the film cuts away from the plane, but the exposition revealed in the cutaway scenes certainly adds to the sullen mood. The film's more hotly debated issue though is its choice to paint the terrorists as flawed, questioning and equally as scared and nervous as the passengers. It is a curiously objective move, and yet without any of the passengers or flight crew fleshed out in any depth, an odd dynamic develops as we get to know the terrorists better than their victims. The intense final 20 or so minutes of the film do need deep characterisation though as the passengers and surviving crew members band together in a surefire testament to the power of the human spirit. While the denouement is hard to watch here without a lump developing in the throat, there is something uplifting about the film as it showcases just how much a bunch of strangers can achieve together; history today would no doubt be different had they acted differently that day."

","This real-life thriller chronicles the events inside United 93 on September 11th, 2001 – a day that has gone down in history as one of the biggest tragedies to hit America. Basically, it's a palm-sweating tale of terrorism and hijacking, as innocent passengers get caught up in events that will have devastating consequences. And devastating is the word to describe this movie. For nearly two hours we're subjected to a slow, horrifying build-up telling a story we all know and are aware of, before director Paul Greengrass lets rip with a pulse-pounding, utterly terrifying and at the same time awe-inspiring climax that is the most powerful bit of film I've ever watched – I couldn't breathe, I was openly crying, and I was utterly entranced by this superb bit of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Nothing more can be said really, other than that this film acts as a memorial to those on the flight, and that everyone should see it. Acting, technical qualities, and cinematography are all absolutely great, and nothing falls flat anywhere in the movie. Spellbinding, awesome, utterly disturbing, downbeat, and yet uplifting – the cocktail of emotions you'll experience as this film closes is unlike anything you'll have ever felt before. A real trip."

","A dramatised account of United 93, one of the four flights hijacked on 9/11. We see the events of that fateful day unfold from several perspectives - the passengers, crew and hijackers of United 93, several air traffic controllers in a few major control centres and from the perspective of the military, in particular US air defence at NORAD.<br/><br/>Intense, realistic and utterly compelling. Mixing dramatisations of actual events, eg the air traffic control scenes, with best guess estimates of what happened in United 93 we have a movie that is part-docu-drama, part-fiction (though probably quite close to the truth). This gives the movie a great grittiness.<br/><br/>Very well set up too. The scenes of passengers and crew getting on the plane are like any flight. This makes the movie even more engaging, as it shows it the characters were just everyday people going about their everyday lives, until fate changed that.<br/><br/>Even when action is called for, there's no gung ho, Bruce Willis-like heroics. It's all pretty realistic and engaging.<br/><br/>The sense of realism and real people is helped by having a cast of largely unknowns. Many of the air traffic controllers and some of the USAF personnel are played by themselves. No Hollywood pretentiousness and glamour.<br/><br/>And then there's the tension. Director Paul Greengrass builds the intensity well, and ends the movie at the height of it, i.e. perfectly.<br/><br/>Even though you know how it is going to end, you can't look away for a second, it is that compelling.<br/><br/>Superb movie."

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","15 September 2016"," Are you guys, ready? Then, let's roll! United 93 is a heart-breaking powerful look at the unsung heroes of Sept. 11. A haunting brutal movie masterpiece.
","On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijack by racial militant Sunni Islamist terrorists, whom intent to use the aircraft as a weapon against the United States. Forty-four people were aboard the plane: 37 passengers, two pilots and five flight attendants. As terrified passengers phoned loved ones, they learned the horrifying outcome of the other hijacks planes and realized they would have to take control of the airplane from their assaulters if they hoped to avoid a similar fate. This is the story of their courage. Directed by Paul Greengrass, and released into theaters five years after the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. The movie tries really hard to dramatically reenacts what happened on the doomed flight that Tuesday morning—as well as depicting the confused air-traffic controllers, military personnel and government officials desperately trying to save the passengers and stop the terrorists. Not only that, but Greengrass and crew, casted a number of largely then-unknown actors and real professionals, then filmed the movie in a Faux Documentary style using separate isolated stages. The final product plays out in Real Time across its nearly two-hour running time. Using the facts that are known, quick cuts and hand-held cameras to create a sense of real-time verisimilitude. United 93 delivers, what might be, said, one of the most historical accuracy film, ever made. Yet, don't be foolish to accept this movie as historical document. Movies are fiction - even documentaries give a particular view of events, and editing can be used to distort the relative truthfulness portrayed. This film is only, almost a historical accuracy masterpiece. However, maybe the film might be, too real, allowing the inaccuracies of 9/11 to accurately portray as well. Rather than stripping down the confusion to make things easier for an audience to follow, all of the misinformed fragments are out there, just as it was in real life due to how rapidly things were unfolding. Different groups referred to the wrong planes by the wrong numbers. There were differing reports on how many planes were out there. After American Airlines Flight 77's impact with the Pentagon, the news reported a fire on the National Mall when there was none. It made the movie hard to follow. Another thing, since the movie is in real time, there is tons of slow & mundane parts that could be cut out, but wasn't, like the boring chitchat between passengers and crew in the beginning. It's also sucks that none of the dialogue given to the passengers were that memorable, outside from the phone calls. Since, there is a large supporting cast with little to no back-story explain in dialogue, it's really hard to relate to some of them. None of them, really stood out. Added the fact, that few of the passengers on the plane's names are mentioned in movie and you get, why I had problem, figuring out who some of these people are. There is also some controversy between some of the family members of the passengers and the investigative officials as to whether the passengers managed to breach the cockpit before the plane crashed. In my opinion, I think the movie depict the right ending. However, I don't believe the way, the movie portray the pilots, Jason Dahl (J.J Johnson) and LeRoy Homer Jr (Gary Commock). I doubt they were killed immediately, seeing how the terrorist need help to gain control of the plane and how to lock the door. While, the movie might seem exploitation, the film was made with the cooperation of all of the passengers' families with their blessing. Yet, there is a few things in value, besides the movie being somewhat a curiosity memorial. About the critics calling this movie, biased American propaganda, I have to say, the film is really, not. The film doesn't really explore the political conflict between the United States Government and Al-Qaeda that much. Nor does the movie depict the attackers as over the top clichés Arab terrorists. Instead, the movie depict the attackers, as deeply misguided religious zealots, who happens to be real human beings as well. Also, to all 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists that believe Sept. 11 was an inside job. It's clear to state out by the research, I done for this report, that United 93 was not shot down by an American aircraft nor safety landed in Ohio. The American Government isn't that strong, to cover all of those inaccuracies. In the end, I can't say, the movie is entertaining. First off, it's really upsetting to watch, no matter, how many times, you watch it. At the time, I first saw this movie in 2006. There is a great deal of discussion about whether America is ready to revisit Sept. 11, 2001. I still, kinda feel that it was too early for a movie to be made, about the subject. Recently rewatching it, I felt the same sense of dread that gripped me then. It's such a downer. Even, the predictable ending is bittersweet, at best. It's still too fresh on the mind of most Americans. Overall: While, United 93 is a story of stomach-wrenching horror and tremendous courage. Knowing the tragic outcome of that horrible day will make you feel depressed. While, I can't recommended others on rewatching it. I can say, at least, keep in mind, that a few people onboard United 93 sacrifice their lives, for the chance that others may live. It is still a powerful, poignant reminder that freedom is not free and every-day life is a gifted, not to be wasted. United We Stand Always & Never Forget."

","I just found this movie after searching for quite some time (like always) for something to watch. I immediately got intrigued by the plot (thriller situation in a plane, heroic true story) and I was sure I found a good catch. Unfortunately, this movie was quite boring, especially the first part. Honestly it could not be worse with such base material and story to work with. I still gave it a 6/10 and it is watchable to an extend but this could have been Oscar-material with better directing and story development. The first half of the movie is completely meaningless and tiring and by the time the second part starts you have no real emotional connection to the passengers of flight 93 or the situation. Surely, for Americans this movie hits some sensitive spots, and hence the big difference in the scores (8.1 for Americans, 7.4 for the rest of the world at the time i write), but whether you are American or not if you want a good thriller or drama there a lot more better ones."
"Seth_Rogue_One","4","0","0","2 March 2016"," In the first half of the movie I wondered why it was called United 93 and not New York Air Traffic Control
","Cause it spent more time on the ground with the air traffic control than it did with the passengers on United 93 in the first 50 minutes!<br/><br/>I was mind-numbingly bored of hearing the traffic control mutter amongst each other air-codes etc and watching blips on radars after just 30 to the point where I wasn't sure if I even wanted to watch more, I however did continue.<br/><br/>And luckily enough 50 minutes in director Paul Greengrass finally puts the main focus on what we as viewers came to see and expect from a movie named after a plane; which is a plane and it's passengers.<br/><br/>And I have to admit that the second half is actually good, the ending is great even but the fact still remains that the first half was focusing on the complete wrong things for most of the time when it should have put full focus throughout the running time on what truly mattered, the flight and passengers of United 93.<br/><br/>So yeah, I still can't recommend the movie for that reason, because a great ending does not take away from the fact that the beginning was really dull you have to look at it as a whole, which I don't think many have considering the enormously current high rating of 7.6/10.<br/><br/>Oh and also, Olivia Thirlby has top-billing here on IMDb but she's more or less an extra in this movie and honestly I didn't even notice she was on the plane until 70 minutes in (despite knowing pre-hand she was gonna be) she's basically the designated crier on the plane, which is a shame because I like her.<br/><br/>A bigger shame is of course the misguided focus of the screenplay and direction when this story deserved so much better."

","United 93 is intensely brilliant. A fascinating true story that some may not have known going in (like me), and that simply had to be told. Thankfully it was told by an outstanding director who made an equally outstanding film.<br/><br/>The film feels so authentic. Director Paul Greengrass hits the nail on the head with this almost documentary of a film, taking you step by step through the events of 9/11 from multiple points of view, all up until the crash of united flight 93.<br/><br/>To find out that the majority of the actors weren't actors but where either playing themselves, or actually worked their characters job in real life was amazing, as the acting was solid and frankly impressive after hearing these facts.<br/><br/>The tension in the film never lets up, it builds and builds, up until the films final frame. The ending of the film is where the intensity truly intensifies, as the passengers charge on the terrorists, fighting for their lives in a final attempt to regain control of the aircraft. This is one of the most intense, and in my opinion, best endings to a film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Overall United 93 is hard hitting. A tragic story with a unique focus on the events of 9/11. United 93 is the movie this airliners story deserved as it does justice by those involved and you cannot help but respect the hero passengers aboard the flight"

","Dramatisations of real-life events often fail because filmmakers somehow feel compelled to embellish the story and to add unnecessary characters, cinematic clichés or simply more context than needed. And in the process they tend to lose sight of what made the material worthy of bringing to the screen in the first place.<br/><br/>This is not the case here. Paul Greengrass's films always have cinematic scope, they never feel like cheap, made-for-TV pieces, yet he has a real knack for that stripped-down, documentary feel that really makes a movie like this work. He has proved it many times with excellent films like Bloody Sunday or Captain Phillips, and the same goes for United 93, as well. The beginning of the movie is truly amazing. Greengrass uses similar techniques here as in Captain Phillips (reminiscent of what Spielberg did in the opening scenes of Munich), building almost unbearable tension with simply presenting the flow of everyday life, people preparing for their journey at the airport. It's all in the sounds and the effective editing. No dialogue here, no 'movie drama', only the suffocating atmosphere, the sense of a tragedy coming.<br/><br/>United 93 never loses focus, and never wants to aggravate things. And by simply telling the gut-wrenching, tragic story life wrote, it truly honours the brave heroes and the memory of the victims."

","It took a long time before I was able to see this movie. Hollywood does not have a good reputation when it comes to films about real events. But I was surprised to see that the events where depicted in a clean way. No superheroes running around in this movie, no over-the-top heroism. Yet, it is a bit awkward to see people, like Ben Sliney, play themselves. <br/><br/>It is a sickening movie to watch, because the outcome is known. Four terrorists hi-jack a plane, kill the pilots and head for the Capitol building to destroy. The passengers panic but on the airline mobile phone service they find out that already planes hit the WTC and the Pentagon. So they decide to regain control over the plane. Although they manage to take out 2 of the terrorist their action is too late, the terrorist at the control lets the plane crash. Most of the events are filmed with a hand-held camera so the movie effectively takes you into the cramped space of an air liner. <br/><br/>The movie is sickening because you know the passengers are not going to succeed. The movie is also sickening because you look at people, the terrorists, who believe that their god will give them access to heaven because they murder people. These terrorists seem like intelligent people, so they should know the difference between believing something or knowing something. Yet, they behave as if they have no doubt about murder. That their god orders them to do that. But it is just something they believe. Did they never ask themselves the question, what happens after death? Do we go to heaven and will our god say, ah, you did a good thing. Or will he say, oh, you are the ones that murdered these people, but your victims are already here in heaven. I can't allow you to mingle with them so you won't come into my heaven. Go next door, to hell. Anyone who knows the difference between believe and knowledge, would have thoughts like that. They didn't. Who did that to them, who brainwashed their minds so much that they chose to die. Whoever, it must be an evil person, probably someone who would never do that himself. Someone who defends the comforts of his life here on earth, who whispers the promises of death in the minds of numskull to retaliate on his enemies. It is a sickening movie to watch."

","How can a film so void of artistry be so effective? This is the question that lurked in my mind throughout United 93. The answer is simple: it's effective the same way watching news footage of the the planes striking the Twin Towers is effective--it confides in the sheer importance, and the Horrifying nature of these events. It's something real, something profound. But is that truly enough? Paul Greengrass thinks so.<br/><br/>So, what is the difference between this film and, say, Faces of Death? Well, that's a tough question. Both rely on the pretense that you're watching a horrific act unfold in real time in front of your eyes; neither film has any substance or characterization, nor do they pretend to. So, why is one critically praised and the other deemed pseudo- snuff? I honestly cannot answer that. I do not know. <br/><br/>Another film in the hyper-realism, docudrama genre is Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant', a film I've rated a 10 here on IMDb. The two are very similar in their approach. But what separates these two films is artistry. 'Elephant' is a film fluid in symbolism and meaning, 'United 93' is a film fluid in heedless chaos. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, 'United 93' is an intense and harrowing thriller despite it's ultimate empty- headedness. A film everyone should see once. <br/><br/>7/10"

","I have just seen this film for the first time, many years after the events that we all remember so clearly. It was shocking, although I knew what to expect. seeing the events of 9/11 unfolding from the perspective of the ground personnel trying to make sense of it all, the sense of urgency and apparently their inability to prevent the hijacked planes reaching their targets. The main focus of the film was on the events on the fourth hijacked plane which crashed in Pennsylvania. No one knows exactly what happened on that plane, but there is enough information available to construct a totally credible sequence of events.<br/><br/>it's one of the most tense things I have ever watched and I was aware of my own fear responses kicking in. The performances of everyone involved are impeccable and completely realistic. Paul Greengrass made documentaries before this film and this shows in the filming and the non-sensationalist approach. The dialogue lacks any dramatic stirring speeches or anything we would expect from a conventional action movie. It's all about how ordinary people would react in a terrifying situation where initially they don't know what is happening, and then the reality dawns on them and they attempt to do whatever they can to survive.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the detail of what happened in Air Traffic Control from the first suspicion that something was wrong, to the events that we saw on the news. I assume that these events were recorded and everything really happened. It takes time for people to understand something so awful and so incomprehensible, even those who are highly competent and very experienced. <br/><br/>I remember how I felt, listening to the radio and looking at the news coverage in the UK. I was bewildered, but it was a long way from me. For these people it was their responsibility to deal with an unknown threat situation.<br/><br/>The power of this film is in its matter-of-fact approach which doesn't make judgements and presents the facts as they are known, in a very dramatic way. I am glad that I was brave enough to finally see it. Well done to everyone involved."

","11th September, 2001. United 93 should have been a routine flight from Newark to San Francisco with 44 people on board. Of course, shortly after takeoff, the passengers on the plane, and later, the world, learned that what happened that day was anything but routine. 4 of the 44 passengers that boarded the flight were extremist terrorists who were out to hijack the flight with a view to crash it into the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. As two planes crash into the World Trade Center and another into the Pentagon, the citizens on board United 93 are left to decide whether to sit tight or try to take back the plane.<br/><br/>Taking no prisoners in the fictional sense, writer-director Paul Greengrass comes as close to uncovering what might have happened in the only hijacked plane not to hit its target on 9/11. By not wrapping it up in the American flag, demonizing the evildoers, canonizing the heroes, or focusing on their tearful telephone farewells to family and friends, Greengrass makes United 93 a gut-wrenching example of ordeal cinema. For it telescopes tightly on the tragedy, not as a rallying cry for the war on terror, but from the plausible perspective of 40, otherwise ordinary people simply responding to the shocking realization that their jet has just been hijacked. He doesn't pad the action with neat little back stories; we know no more about the passengers than they knew about each other on the last day of their lives. Using a hand-held camera, he crowds the screen with the essential gut rush of panic and confusion, whether in the plane or at the air traffic control centre, where many of the men who were there on the day play themselves.<br/><br/>The result is an astoundingly intense pressure-cooker docudrama which plays out - horribly - in almost real-time. With its nigh-on unbearable attention to mundane detail, this is reality that bites like a pit-bull; we watch as the passengers prepare to board at Gate 17, making final cellphone calls, politely avoiding eye-contact, small-talking in the hushed tones of the mildly tense air-commuter - all alongside the men who will ultimately kill them - and the feel of dread is so palpable as to make us nauseous.<br/><br/>United 93 does not offer the political or analytical dimension to the situationist spectacle Al-Qaida gave to the world that dwarfed anything from the conventional workshops of politics and culture. The movie just lives inside that stunned, astonished 90 minutes of horror between one epoch and the next. But in doing so, Paul Greengrass creates a blazingly powerful and magnificent memorial to the passengers of that doomed flight. A chillingly profound profile in courage of forty strangers who bonded under incomprehensible circumstances to face an unspeakable evil!"

","The story somewhat relates to me. I remember I was a first year high school student back then watching the local news TV at night when the station suddenly cuts to a Breaking News section showing live footage from CNN, and only a few moments after that I saw the second plane rammed into the WTC's Tower 2. A few minutes later the news and pictures of the United 93 wreck site also appeared. Paul Greengrass sure did wrote a very fine story that really gives me the shivers. It especially does so on the second part when the movie focuses more on inside the plane. The majority of the first part got the artistry very nice. The transition between scenes and dialogs kept the intense and confused mood very tight. But it all wears its appeal until the more thrilling second part jumps in. The acting overall is quite a decent job, although I think it's Paul Greengrass' genius directing job which did the movie a great deal."

It's one long crescendo, beginning fairly dry and slow as we are intruduced to numerous characters at the beginning of what will end most hellishly.<br/><br/>The focus of the film is primarily the events that take place, and secondarily with the reactions of the characters to these events. The film never gets very personal when it comes to the characters themselves, which is perhaps an observanvce by the filmmakers that, given the horrible things that happen to each of them, it would be less respectful to those victims to explore them very deeply. That's not to say we don't see emotion, as we certainly see plenty. I personally have a great deal of respect for how these characters are portrayed, as to pretend that any of us who never knew the real people they represent would be repugnantly presumptuous; only those who really knew them are intitled to that real insight.<br/><br/>The movie picks up the pace constantly - growing ever more tense with each scene - until it becomes utterly frantic and horrifying.

So what's the flaw to it....well for one thing it will get to you if you knew someone on the flights during those times it's very sad to see a movie that shows that art can REALLY imitate life sometimes and this movie does that. with movies like, ""World trade center"" which is another emotional movie this one did it job without making it into a action flick...the comrade and the interactions in this movie was well done without adding too much or giving away too much...not being all dramatic but not being all action driven either I also have to give credit to the composer John Powell the music puts a move in your heart right up to the end credits and it wasn't dramatic nor cheesy it was just right...so I feel this movie is worth seeing just bring some Kleenex with you just in case. <br/><br/>9/10"

","For those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and are still dealing with what happened on that awful, awful day, it might be wise to skip UNITED 93, a one of a kind motion picture that blends fact and speculation in chronicling what happened aboard one of the four American jetliners that were hijacked on that fatal day. Less is probably known about this flight because this was the one plane that never made it to its destination. This meticulously crafted melodrama tells this difficult story in as much detail as possible, beginning with the the hijackers' preparation for what they are about to do (and from the way it's presented in this film, they did not all appear to be willing participants in this mission) to the final moments this flight was in the air. Director and screenwriter Paul Greenspan proves to be a master storyteller and has mounted this story almost in the form of a documentary. Greenspan wisely chose not to populate the cast with big name stars, the biggest star I recognized was Christian Clemenson who plays Jerry Espinson on BOSTON LEGAL. Greenspan clearly didn't want the viewer to be distracted from the story by having us star-gazing...the story is the star of the film as it should he. Several of the ground personnel depicted in the film are actually air traffic personnel and not actors, which adds a definite air of authenticity to the story. The musical score is minimal...the power of the story compels the film with such power that music is not really needed. The story seamlessly moves from the ground, where air traffic personnel are trying to figure out what is going on, initially believing it all to be a hoax and aboard the flight of the title, where once the plane has been taken over, the passengers realize the helplessness of their situation and make a plan to take the plane back from the terrorists. We then see half of the passengers planning the attack while we see the other half on phones to loved ones saying goodbye. It's not an easy film to watch, but it is beautifully mounted film that is a sober reminder of a little known event that was part of the worst day in American History. A must-see film."
"mattkpsu","8","0","0","23 April 2007"," Worth watching (if you can get through it)
","Overall I thought the film was very well done. It was a moving piece. Parts of it were hard to watch, in fact. Many of the events on the plane were of course guestimation and speculation, but everything was very plausible and well-presented. Great pains were taken in order to keep the timing of events accurate, and it definitely added to the movie.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie is that there are absolutely no big names. In fact, there were a number of real ATC and military personnel that played their own roles. Normally this would detract from a movie, but in this case, I felt it was appropriate because it kept the focus on the events of the day. It also helped capture the actual reactions of the people on the ground, rather than what the director thought they would do.<br/><br/>The movie showed many moments of confusion and disorder within the various control centers. At times, I felt like throwing something at the screen because of the inept actions of the FAA and others.<br/><br/>The film did not address the various conspiracy theories about the plane being shot down in its final moments, but that is fine with me because it would have detracted greatly from the tense final moments. Overall, the film was tastefully done and kept my attention the entire time."

","I've got to be honest; I had no desire to see this film after having watched the television version some time ago. However, my mind was changed after reading several reviews and hearing the opinions from several people I trust. I came to the conclusion that this film was much more than the well-known phrase ""let's roll"" and associated actions everyone is familiar with. The film is set in ""real time"" intended to mirror the actual time-line of events on this momentous day. <br/><br/>The film's time is spent at various Air Traffic Control centers and a Military Command Center as the events involving all 4 aircraft evolve. Early in the film, much detail is spent on American flight 11, which gave the first indication that something was awfully wrong that day. As an American Airlines employee and being personally involved with the activities of that morning on September 11, 2001, it is no wonder that I would naturally become very interested in every detail of that flight as well as American flight 77 that was flown into the Pentagon.<br/><br/>You will learn how the FAA struggled to determine which aircraft were in jeopardy and what lead to grounding of more than 4,000 aircraft over U.S. skies. You will watch as the military was both unprepared and unable to get F-15s in the air in time to be of any assistance. And finally you will see how the terrorists on United 93 were helpless as the passengers and crew on board plan their attack.<br/><br/>This intense, extraordinary film is well worth seeing.

I had always pictured in my mind that these guys were scared out of their minds just like the passengers. I have to believe that nobody is totally cold blooded when they are on a suicide mission. Nobody sane enough to try something requiring so much thought out coordination would have that kind of resolve.<br/><br/>At one point you feel like the leader is about to abort the mission until a younger, antsy terrorist forces his hand. I've read people influenced by jihad almost act like they are affected by drugs, addicted to the violence of jihad, that was captured in one of the characters.<br/><br/>It overall was a great film and was handled with class.

","Based on real-life events of the tragic day known throughout the world as ""9/11"", this film ""United 93"" tells the tale of what happened aboard Flight 93, which is the hijacked plane that did not crash in to it's intended target, but, the terrorists were overthrown by the brave crew and passengers, who valued the lives of those they would save more than their own, proving that heroes come in many forms.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is a highly respectful film in terms of the sensitive nature of 9/11 and for the families of those aboard Flight 93. The story takes place, as one would expect, in almost real-time, flicking between the plane itself and various command centers, both military and aviation. Production values are high, and it's easy to see how much hard work has gone into making ""United 93"" just right. However it seems to fall just short of that mark simply for the fact that, as an audience, we do not get to learn that much about the people aboard Flight 93. If this were any other ""disaster movie"" that would be a disaster in itself, but since this is based on real life events, perhaps it was a good move, as the characters on the plane were real people, real heroes.<br/><br/>Although little is revealed about the passengers, as the film tenses up it is easy to become compassionate for them as they watch what is happening. Most heart-breaking is, as expected, when the passengers begin the much-publicised phone calls to their loved ones. A brave move, and one which in my opinion paid off, was having no Hollywood A-listers amongst the cast. As there were plenty of characters, not everyone got a lot of screen time, but the standout performance easily goes to Trish Gates who plays Senior Flight Attendant Sandra Bradshaw. David Alan Basche, Cheyenne Jackson and Christian Clemenson also gave fantastic performances.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is, at times hard to watch, but it immortalises such heroic actions from ""regular"" people that took place on the day that changed the world forever. Also, the film ends at a very good point. If the film had carried on further than where it did, it would have most certainly been in poor taste."

This is why I give it only 2 stars because it is not being given the sales by Americans.<br/><br/>This men and women were heroes in the truest sense. This film is tough, tight, but very respectful to the people of that monumental day in world history. I have read the Todd Beamer story called Lets Roll which is a great book about one of the passengers who was heard saying ""lets roll"" on a cell phone just before a major incident in the movie. The movie though is about all the passengers and also covers other events of that day. Also, I took my 11 year old to see it and I believe she was old enough for the film. There was a little swearing and the violence fit in to the story. Certainly a parent could have their kids look away during a few moments of violence if they wanted too but I did not need to.<br/><br/>This film is extremely important and should be seen by everyone. Lets start taking kids to the right films. She remembered 911 and she was only 7 at that time. Now she understands it far more.

","OK OK, I saw this movie in the theater a while ago and I just got around to spreading my opinions. <br/><br/>I'd probably give this a 3/10 <br/><br/>There are many reasons that this movie was lackluster at best. <br/><br/>1. It didn't tell any backgrounds of the people that died. If this was dedicated to the people who died on the flight, then it should have told about them. I know the director was trying to get the message across that these people were just random, every day people, but I already know that. What I want to know is who these people were. I want to know why they didn't deserve their fate. I wanted to cry at the end, but tears never came. <br/><br/>2. The movie was not done well. They had a pretty large budget for this movie, but used small amounts of it... They pretty much needed one set: The Plane. Aside from the end, there were no cool shots (the way it ends was cool) <br/><br/>3. But the ending could have been better. I know it is clichéd, but if they could have fit a few news reports in, it would have made it more moving I think. <br/><br/>4. The crowd I saw it with sucked... Everyone started cheering when they slit the terrorist's throat. If you clapped when this happened, you are probably going to hell. It is still a person. <br/><br/>5. It is too soon to make money off the tragedy. That is just lame... they should have let people in for free or like give 100% of the money made to charities or something. That's as bad as Mel capitalizing off of Christ in The Passion. <br/><br/>6. Everyone knew what was going to happen, and it is meaningless to see. The director doesn't do anything different or really cool... and since the plot is already given, it is like watching a special news report, but a little more interesting. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest just downloading it off bit torrent to not pay corporations to make a meaningless film to make money off a tragedy. <br/><br/>I pray to god that WTC is better."

","All due credit must be given to director Paul Greengrass for a tense and gripping thriller that keeps the viewer on edge throughout the course of the movie. Sadly though there is very little factual merit to this story.<br/><br/>Firstly one must bear in mind that the whole dramatization of the evens unfolding within the cabin are based entirely upon many highly questionable cell phone and air-phone calls. The cell phone calls alone have already been scientifically proved to have been almost impossible from an aircraft moving at that speed, not to mention it's altitude. Although there isn't sufficient space for an in depth analysis, here are two very well written articles which may be of interest:<br/><br/>http://physics911.net/projectachilles.htm<br/><br/>http://physics911.net/cellphoneflight93.htm<br/><br/>Most interesting is Mark Brigham's air-phone call to his mother which began - ""Mom? This is Mark Brigham."" OK seriously when was the last time anyone used their full name when calling their mother? Also, Todd Beamer who's call appeared to have lasted the longest, would rather speak to the Verizon operator than have her connect him to his wife. This is something she could have done in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Most disturbingly was the portrayal of a German passenger aboard the plane, who's name appeared on the passenger manifest, yet other than that nothing more is known of him. However the director has decided to portray this poor man in a rather negative light, simply for being a pacifist and wanting to try to negotiate with the hijackers. Could this be a deliberate metaphor for the increasing political divide between Europe and America? As an American it seems to me that from a very early age we're brainwashed into believing that military might is a positive asset, while pacifism is simply for the weak. In reality it is quite the opposite!<br/><br/>Finally with regards to a post-script appearing prior to the end credits stating that the President did not scramble aircraft because he did not wish the plane to be shot down is again nonsense. Anyone who remembers where they were that tragic day will also remember where George Bush was - or more to the point wasn't. Apart from a brief statement that morning it wasn't until later that evening that any of us heard a single peep out of him. The responsibility for scrambling aircraft sat with Vice President Dick Cheney.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief the scrambling of military aircraft does not invoke shooting down the airliner as a foregone conclusion - in fact that is an extreme last resort. It has always been a common practice to scramble a military escort to any hijacked airliner in order to get it safely on the ground. Cheney flat out refused to do this.<br/><br/>I will leave the readers to draw their own conclusions, but i do urge all of you to look at the facts."

I thought this was VERY poignant. The things humans do, say, and act upon (ON ALL SIDES!) all in the name of ""THIER GOD"" I think is total bullshit period!!!

I simply wasn't ready.<br/><br/>Is this a good film? That question is a very difficult one for me to answer. It feels like a hybrid: part documentary and part traditional film. As you all know by now real people played themselves, especially in the traffic control scenes, which, in conjunction with stripped down official sounding jargon and straightforward camera work, gave it the documentary feel. On the plane, it became a traditional film. But is it good? This merges with the question, ""was it exploitive?"" The filmmakers took liberties with character development. There was no traditional character development at all. Glimpes, but nothing more than that. They properly assumed that we knew the character and story lines of the most prominent passengers as portrayed by the media previously. Allowing for that assumption, the filmmakers essentially placed us amongst the passengers during the last 40 minutes of the film and let us directly observe their fear, their anger, their discovery, and their response. It was visceral, but, in my opinion, it wasn't because of craft, it was because of the painful memory of the actual event.<br/><br/>I think a good film , even if it feels dated when seen years later, is still felt by that latter-day audience on many levels, allowing for that film to be still recognized as a good film. I think that 20 years from now this film will be felt as if it were the equivalent of a TV movie of the week. Without the shared experienced that is present amongst today's audience, it won't have any emotional weight on it's own.<br/><br/>But for right now, this is deeply disturbing film that for some might be cathartic, for others might be interesting for the behind the scenes observation, and for other's might function as a satisfactory action/thriller film.

This film depicts the bravery and valor of the passengers aboard flight 93. By not seeing this film people will slip back into the bubble of security that they had before 9/11. For many of us 9/11 was a bubble-bursting experience that changed our lives forever. This attack on our nation threatened our security and made us realize that we are not invincible. By forgetting or forgiving the actions of the terrorists on 9/11 we are setting ourselves up for another attack. This film will remind you of how you felt on that day. It will remind you of the pain you felt as you saw those towers fall and the hole in the pentagon. Pain hurts, but we need to remember this pain. For the sake of all the people that died, and for the sake of this country."
"plankspanker13","10","3","8","30 April 2006"," An Objective Review
","This is an excellent film, for which I have written a lengthy review that has appeared on several flight simulator-related boards. This particular board's control functions do not allow for the abbreviations of actual aviation terms; they appear as ""shouts"" to the software. All I can therefore do is be very succinct.<br/><br/>There are continuity errors; an Airbus is shown in one establishing shot; flight 93 was a Boeing. The air traffic control display supposedly depicts a near miss by 2 planes at the same altitude. the numbers in the shot represent a 300-foot difference in altitude. Also, and perhaps this may have really happened, there are 2 different characters mistakenly referring to American 11 as a 757, when in fact the plane was a 767. Again, I don't know if this as a depiction of a bona fide error that really happened or not. The depictions of the crew walking to the plane shows United logo imagery that was only adopted in 2003.<br/><br/>I do wish to say that the hijackers are the starring characters, (inasmuch as this film actually has any starring roles) and are very well-portrayed. The seemingly throw-away shot of them avoiding looking at some sexy advertisements serves to illustrate the characters' Islamic altruism.<br/><br/>Oscar nomination forecast: Best Director or Best Screenplay for Greenglass; Best Supporting Actor for Ben Sliney as himself."
"crimaldi-mike","8","2","5","6 August 2009"," Well Acted Movie about the Darkest Day in History.
","United 93 is a movie that is well depicted about what we can assume happened aboard United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. Director Paul Greengrass depicts what we would assume happened in a very, very good way. If you like drama movies, this movie may be a good one for you to see. Just keep in mind that it is based on a true story and people actually did die on that day. (9/11) This movie does not leave out any important details from on that flight. Everything that you could think of that may have happened is covered. The actors do an excellent job portraying the real-life people. The terrorists in this movie well depict what is assumed happened in the cockpit of United 93, and throughout the plane following the hijacking. Even though the characters did a good job, I do believe that the terrorists in the movie weren't as harsh as the actual ones were. They tried and came close, but no one could be as brutal as they must have been. The scenes that take place in the FAA and Control Centers are kind of boring, but they do really depict how it must have been for these people to handle such a major event at once. If you watch this movie, you will notice that you will feel really tense at the end even though everybody should know how the film ends from what happened in real life on that day. I would like to advise you that if you have young children or you just get nightmares really easily or are really emotional about movies that depict that day, do not go and see this movie without preparation or rather just not go and rent it at all because I will say this: It is a scary movie once the hijacking starts. It is also rated R for extreme violence, language, etc. Aside from these things, it is a really good movie that would help people get a better understanding of what happened on that terrible day eight years ago. Overall, it is well depicted, and don't forget if you do want to watch this movie, please keep in mind the innocent people who died and what may have happened on that plane that kept it from reaching its intended target and killing more innocent people that didn't die from what the passengers did. Bottom line: Really Good Movie, Kind of Violent, and Ending will leave you stunned even though everybody should know what happens."
"user-28221","10","2","5","18 February 2009"," The most moving part of this film is about human nature
","What is the most moving part of this film? Well there are a lot of parts that are moving indeed and different people have their different moments in mind, and for me, this is a great film, and the greatest part is that when the passengers are praying to God, the terrorists are praying too, to their god... This is so amazing... I'm not talking about whose god is the true god or which religion is the true religion; what I am trying to say is the case is people's religions, or beliefs, especially when the chips are down, are truly just what they think or assume they can rely on... When I saw everybody on the plane pray, I laughed, yet I was very clear that it is human nature: you know it probably won't help but as long as you assume there is some hope, you'll still do it, BECAUSE YOU WANNA SUVIVE... Their religious beliefs are what they call upon for help, and it makes no difference if the help is from Christianity or Islam, because it's all just fake hope..."
"janne-junnonen","7","2","5","3 July 2007"," Overrated
","If this film had been released in 1999, it would have been much more interesting... Probably not very convincing though. Anyway, now the plot was kind of ""predictable"".<br/><br/>This was basically a dramatized documentary. It had a ""made for TV"" feel in it. Not many (any) great visual effects, not much action, not very much interesting dialog either. It gives us an illusion of the real-life events occurring as they did and cameras just following the action.<br/><br/>Speaking of dialog, in the real world the hijackers had SOME dialog with the passengers? Not very much in this film...<br/><br/>I can't really say I was disappointed. The film was everything I expected, in a good sense and in a bad sense. But definitely not one of my favourite movies, merely an average one. Of course the ending is touching, but you could not really expect anything but."
"andrew-1283","3","2","5","3 December 2006"," too much ATC chatter
","About two thirds of the film is unexciting chatter from air traffic control staff trying to find out what's happening, followed by a short free for all on the plane. OK, that's because all that chatter was recorded, and no-one really knows the detail of what happened on united 93, but it doesn't make for riveting cinema. In reality it was a tragic episode, and it should have been left that way. I mean it should have been left as a real event, a news item at the time. The film is not a significant work of art, as for example Picasso's Guernica was.<br/><br/>We could have done with more background about the lives of the passengers and aircrew in the weeks before the flight took off. As it is, they are rather two dimensional characters. Ironically, it is easier to understand the context in which the hijackers are operating, because of all that has been written about them (and people like them) since."
"knokno","6","2","5","12 September 2006"," Terrible and important event, but ordinary movie
","This is not a great movie, and this is very sad, because these terrible events deserve one. The cinematography is ordinary, looking to much like a movie for television. Sequences are badly assembled, showing suddenly shoes of a guy walking, insists on an earphone, and big shots on a glass of water. So directing seemed pretty bad to me.<br/><br/>It is a pretty hollywoodian movie after all, with lot of insistence, lack of subtleties.<br/><br/>People are so emotionally involved when watching those events that it seems that they just can't, for now, see the movie as it is, because we can read so much great things about this movie.<br/><br/>I believe it will change, after some years."

Too bad that those actors and actresses doesn t even know what is happening in their own country.

I am saying that statement for you to open your eyes and please stop believing everything you hear and see on television."
"TimeaSiesta","3","2","5","24 August 2006"," Fair But Not Great
","This film generally met my expectations, but didn't strike me as well as it might have for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) The FAA and military dispatch center scenes demonstrating the early confusion on the ground were overly drawn out. So were the scenes of the terrorists in their seats wondering when to strike. Those could have been distilled down and their relevance could have been made just as forcefully. Even if there was some semblance of trying to stay true the actual timelines of those two aspects, and to whatever extent they had to be compressed to fit the film's 91 minutes, there just seemed to be far too much of both.<br/><br/>2) I would have replaced the monotony of those minutes with scenes showing the other ends of the passengers' final phone calls. In particular, I would have wanted to see and hear the call received by Lisa Jefferson, a cellular company's customer center supervisor, who was in contact with Todd Beamer. She was interviewed extensively by the news media once the event ended and the facts were known, so portraying her on screen either by herself or an actress could be deemed ""old news."" However, if writer//director Paul Greengrass were to prepare a complete a docudrama for future generations, showing her significance and including her actual words could have added much to the context. The same can be said about the loved ones, friends and even voicemail devices on the ground that other passengers reached.<br/><br/>3) Todd Beamer's iconic statement of bravery on behalf of all the other passengers, ""Let's Roll!"", which I had expected to be treated as a resounding call to heroism, was handled almost as an under-the-breath throwaway line. He might have really said it the way it was ultimately shown, but it called for more of a ""Hollywood moment.""<br/><br/>4) Among the epilogue's titles, I was left with a quite unexpected negative reaction because it seemed wholly unfair for Greengrass to mention the lack of effective military air accompaniment, thereby implying a sense of ineptness. There was no useful purpose served by such ""Monday morning quarterbacking."" Had armed military aircraft successfully been scrambled, obtained positions alongside UAL 93 and brought the aircraft down, we as a nation would search our souls for generations about whether the right decisions were made and if the right actions were taken.<br/><br/>On a positive note, Greengrass deserves credit for making this very good decision: Abundant casting of the actual people who were doing their best on the ground under enormous unprecedented pressure. It was a definite plus. After all, who could convey their words, actions and states of mind better?"
"jstornatore","10","2","5","6 August 2006"," One of the best movies ever made
","I saw Paul Greengrass's ""Bloody Sunday"" and was very impressed. However when a movie that dealt with America's most horrible day was going to be directed by him, I got very nervous. I didn't feel that he was the best to direct this movie. Oliver Stone or Steven Spielberg seemed like better candidates instead. However when Greengrass's documentary style of filming was used it created such an unsettling mood, which only added to this great drama. The acting was incredible and actually, some of the actors in this film were actually portraying themselves on 9/11. I can't begin to visualize how much pre-planning Greengrass had for this movie. Every shot is perfect. This movie, might be a modern classic. I feel it has its moments that rival films as dramatic as Schindler's List. In short, this movie is destined to become a classic, and is one of the best movies ever made. This movie will be a definite Oscar contender this year and if it is not, I will be very disappointed. I also sense a definite Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble for this movie."

I lost my job and was forced to move back to the Netherlands.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday at a local theater, and I left shaken and disturbed, and very close to tears.

"guillermotorofan","10","2","5","21 July 2006"," The definition of the word ""powerful"".
","Here is a film that has rustled everyone's hair, and even people who could care less about these ""political"" films have taken down notes. This is a frightening and powerful portrayal of the events of September 11th, 2001. At that time I was but a wee lad of 9 years old, only 9 days away from being ten. I sat in class about to watch another lovely edition of The Magic School Bus for science class, and the television refused to show it. Our teacher left the room, came back startled, and turned the TV to the news channel. The first and one of the most disturbing things I will ever see was one of the towers, with a gaping hole in the side, smoke billowing upward. I did not understand then, but I do now. Moments like these are the ones in which I miss the innocence of childhood. Where wicked things were unbeknownst to us. Life moves fast, and this is a whopper of a freeze frame. <br/><br/>Acting: 10/10<br/><br/>Each actor gives a heart filled performance, and wisely, no big actors were cast in the film. Big actors would have ruined it, making it a horrible attempt at capturing real people. Oliver Stone really, REALLY, should have taken a note of that.<br/><br/>Writing: 10/10<br/><br/>Though this wasn't exactly ""written"" per say, it was pieced together well. <br/><br/>Directing: 10/10<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass takes material and treats it with fatherly care. I will forever respect him for his lovingly crafted portrayal of disaster.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 I gave Greengrass a horrible time for his horrible hand-held camera work in his previous Bourne Supremacy, and now I swear he must have come across my words as he has done much better this time around. Bravo on the improvement, and especially on that ending shot!<br/><br/>Special Effects: As far as my well trained eye could tell, none to be had.<br/><br/>So in the end, this leaved me with the feeling I can only describe as fulfillment. Does it answer any questions? No. None. It documents a horrible day so that hopefully we can look back in respect and learned from these experiences.<br/><br/>Final Diagnosis: A"
"OttoVonB","9","2","5","16 July 2006"," 9/11, minute by minute
","On September 11th, 2 planes crash into the World Trade Center after being hijacked. Before news of this spreads across the country, flight 93 has taken off, carrying on board 4 terrorists intent on crashing it into the White House. As news of the other targets reached the passengers, they fought back.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is a minute-by-minute reconstruction of what happened in the tower, control room, air traffic control and - crucially, the plane itself from the security checks to the fatal crash. Fittingly, British director Paul Greengrass opts for a documentary approach, setting aside sentimentality and assembling a cast of unknowns. He also received approval from all all involved and the passengers relatives, no mean feat considering the recent nature of the events depicted on screen. The result is a fluid film that feels very authentic and is, in its final moments, unbearably tense (expect to find yourself in an unusually silent cinema at the end of this film).<br/><br/>As respectful as ""united 93"" is and as much as it is admirable for sidestepping jingoism or being manipulative, it is not without flaws. The first, that will largely affect cinema audiences, is the unpleasant photography. Fuzzy focus and (often useless) breakneck movements do a disservice to the film. If Greengrass wanted a documentary look, why not just shoot it raw and have it that way, rather than add these contrived and unpleasant elements? The film also has too broad a focus for us to be emotionally involved. Rather, we are left horrified by the last scene and the fact that it is grounded in reality. Exploring the terrorists and passengers more might have given this more human dimension. Nevertheless, it remains very interesting and well made, with great detail and effort put into scenes that do not take place on the plane. Unexpectedly rousing our sympathy is the confusion in the air traffic control center. Thankfully, the director opts for archive footage whenever possible for sights of the twin towers and silence rather than music to underline a strong scene.<br/><br/>These strengths outweigh the weaknesses and make ""United 93"" an important piece of contemporary cinema and, for non-Americans, a good insight into the confusion our American friends experienced on that surreal day.<br/><br/>Well worth a look."

","After nearly a month of no cinema at all (I hate summer recess) here comes United 93. The story of one of the planes that was hijacked on that dreadful September 11th.<br/><br/>I'm searching for words on how to describe this film: everybody that hasn't been stuck under a couple rocks for the last few years knows what happened to the plane. The people on it knew they were going to perish and decided that their lives would not go in vain - they went and made sure the plane did not get to the place the terrorists wanted it to go.<br/><br/>As I'm writing this I'm having a strange fit of emotions and I'm fighting back tears. During the watching of the film I didn't have such - I was overwhelmed with another set of emotions, caused by memories. I went to visit NYC in October 2001, just 4 weeks after the attacks. The trip had been booked long in advance, and I wasn't willing to cancel it. When I saw this film it all came back to memory. I guess that goes for the most people that watch this film - everybody goes in with their own mindset and own set of memories of that day, and everyone comes out differently.<br/><br/>The film itself then. I can't put many negatives to it: the way it is played out feels a lot like the dramatized documentaries they do on TV every now and then, only better. What is seen here are humans coming together to fight their last battle. Humans as they are supposed to be, sadly in a place and environment no one should ever find him/herself in.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 disturbed emotions."
"brimblemeister","10","2","5","12 June 2006"," One Word....WOW!!
","When I saw this advertised I was a little bit surprised at how soon after the tragedy but after seeing it I'm glad it was released now! Ill start off and get my rant out the way that the acting in the air control centres was pretty awful and very amateur at best. But I was still absolutely engrossed.<br/><br/>Whilst this incident is still photographic in most peoples mind this film really hits some emotions. I can say this is the best film I've ever seen at recreating an actual incident and one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm glad this team portrayed these people the way they did as true heroes, because this is what they were & still are. The movie starts a little slow but after seeing the whole film you can see this is building a fascinating film, the information at the start I felt was all important in holding this together. But when the film starts to focus more & more on Flight 93 I could not blink, it was amazing acting on the plane, and I don't often well up in films, I actually never had but I did in this. Knowing this all actually happened (or very close to) and the people phoning their families was an extremely powerful scene. The lady or man i can't remember who offers her phone to a younger girl to ring her family is brilliant and is a reminder of what humans are all like at heart and how we should be more often, all helping one another. The thing I found amazing is although we know these poor peoples tragic fate I found myself willing them on to try and take over the cockpit and staying alive and not till the very last scene did I really believe it. For me I think the families who this film directly affects should feel honoured their loved ones were represented in this way, for who they really were true heroes (I don't mean to offend anyone if you don't feel this way) but after some testing times with Western and Eastern culture this film really emphasises this small Al-Queda is a minority and although you fell hatred for the ones who performed the hijackings and were behind them it made me realise this is a small number of people.<br/><br/>Being British I'm a big fan of British directing, I love the honesty and grittiness they usually generate and this was no exception, the directing was top notch! The moods, thoughts, emotions and hopes were all captured perfectly and just gave this film everything you'd want from one especially recreating actual events. This film for me has to be best picture at next years Oscars, albeit they are a while away and with many films to come out that is a bold statement but it deserves massive recognition! And Paul Greengrass deserves at least a nomination for directing, simply amazing! You may think this review is not weighted so heavily towards the films actual content but believe me once you've watched it and I highly recommend you do, you'll see what I'm on about! Simply a stunning motion picture and deserves full marks & R.I.P to all those who lost their lives in 9/11 except the hijackers!"
"rparham","10","2","5","29 May 2006"," An example of excellence
","One thing is for certain: United 93 is a difficult movie to watch. It is unflinching in it's almost moment by moment dissection of September 11, 2001, at least from the point of view of the air traffic controllers, the military controllers and, of course, the passengers and crew of United flight 93. It pulls no punches, doesn't soft pedal anything and really only restrains itself at the last moments, where taste would allow nothing else. And in doing so, writer-director Paul Greengrass has crafted what is almost certain to be the best movie in 2006. That is a high bar to set, but it is difficult to imagine any film coming any closer to the excellence on display here.<br/><br/>United 93 is, almost needless to say, a gut-wrenchingly detailed and, seemingly, accurate, re-creation of many of the events of the morning of 9/11. It's principal focus, more or less, is on the titular flight that was the only one of four planes hijacked that morning to fail to reach it's intended target, in this case, the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. We see the passengers and crew going through their average routines, preparing the flight for takeoff, talking about their lives in snippets, nothing out of the ordinary. The flight control centers that are key to the days events are also introduced, tracking planes, worrying about the weather, the usual stuff for them. We also see the terrorists preparing themselves, praying and gathering their weapons. They appear, to the average individual, no different than anyone else. Few would realize that these four individuals are capable of the acts they are about to perform.<br/><br/>To give a traditional plot summary, beyond the above setup, is practically useless. This is not really a traditional narrative film. Greengrass has put it together in an almost documentary form, using almost no recognizable actors (and often utilizing the real individuals that were working in the air traffic control centers), hand-held camera moves and very few filmic tricks. We believe we are in the rooms with these individuals when it happens, following along as the day's horrific developments unfold. It is almost shocking to view the early moments when the first flight is believed to be hijacked and the air traffic controllers almost dismiss it. It has been so long since something like that has happened, they can't believe in the possibility. It is only after listening to cockpit transmissions from the first plane to be reported hijacked, American 11, that the reality of the situation sinks in.<br/><br/>We are quickly drawn in to the confusion, the sense of pure helplessness in the film. These men and women at the various locations are simply unable to really do anything, and as audience members, we can sit and scream mentally on the inside to do something. But that day was simply one that was unprecedented and beyond comprehension. The actors in United 93 are stellar in their performances. The nuances, delivery and body language are more believable than almost any other fiction film I have ever witnessed. The direction is near perfect also. The editing and choice of camera angles bring us into the action, never locking us out.<br/><br/>Throughout, Greengrass mounts the tension impressively. We know the outcome, how things will turn out, but we can't help but be caught up in the moment. After the terrorists capture Flight 93 and the passengers begin plotting to take back the plane, the moments as they call their loved ones and give their goodbyes are heart-wrenching, to say the least. Composer John Powell deserves a strong notice for crafting an understated, yet amazingly effective score that does not manipulate your emotions, but underlines what is happening on screen, especially in the film's concluding moments.<br/><br/>For those who might complain about the portrayal of the terrorists, I find this a difficult point for anyone to argue over. Greengrass gives them as much objectivity as the other characters, and we cannot help but be affected, emotionally, by their actions. We see at least one, the lead terrorist, portrayed by Khalid Abdalla, who is obviously having reservations about his actions and decision to go forward with this plan. His fellow hijackers are more than willing to make the move, but he is not. The final actions are known, but Greengrass does not reduce these men to caricatures, they are believable men who do inexplicable things.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to watch United 93 and not be flooded by a range of emotions, ranging from sadness, helplessness, and, most significantly, anger. You almost find yourself wanting to jump onto the screen and take matters into your own hands, to stop the inevitable from unfolding, but you must just watch as the film moves toward it's inescapable conclusion.<br/><br/>There are few other films that are this effective at moving an audience without manipulating them, and for that reason alone, United 93 is an impressive feat. But it is more than that. It is a template for how filmed accounts of events such as this should be mounted, a defining moment in film history. United 93 is the very best movie I have seen in a long time, and will not be quickly forgotten."
"ladymoonpictures","8","2","5","25 May 2006"," True American Heroes
","Following the deadly attacks on America, I twice visited the crash site of Flight 93, going behind the scenes. I wanted to get closer and somehow gain a better understanding of the significance of what happened that day and what it meant.<br/><br/>Take a rare, inside look with me and perhaps reflect more deeply into those events and the heroic sacrifices rendered for each one of us by the men and women of Flight 93.<br/><br/>January 11th, 2002 was a bitterly cold and blustery day just outside the town limits of Shanksville Pennsylvania. Standing at the temporary memorial site, the frigid air held the flags straight out at attention. With camera in hand, I had to frequently hold it under my arm against my body, so I could cup my ears, trying to provide some warmth and protection from the relentless, snow-laden gale. A road wound back into the trees, beyond an unlocked gate. I could see a cabin and vehicle parked there. Large, bigger than life orange signs stood on each side of the gate, sitting in the field on either side, which read, ""Road Closed."" Plenty of small white no trespassing signs lined the path.<br/><br/>With some real misgivings, I drove in and parked in the driveway. The thick evergreen trees made it appear darker outside. The wind had seemingly stopped because of the protection provided by the trees. Fresh snow covered the ground, only blemished by the tire trail that led up the long driveway to the cabin's front entrance. I approached the far door, where footprints in the snow led and knocked on the door. I waited 15 seconds, but no one answered. Deciding not to knock twice, I turned around to leave when the cabin door swung open. A comely man, appearing to be in his 30's, with long, dark brown hair, dressed like a lumberjack, scowled directly at me.<br/><br/>""Sorry to interrupt you,"" I said, introducing myself by name. ""I always lock that gate."" He murmured. ""I'm not sure why I didn't lock it this morning, although I should have."" He continued to reject my presence. ""There are 'no trespassing' signs all along that gate"" ""I sincerely apologize for the intrusion."" He paused a moment, ""Accepted."" He said.<br/><br/>I explained my interest in writing a patriotic piece about Flight 93. ""Is that the accident site over there?"" I asked. He nodded and stepped outside and kept walking, with me following. ""This isn't actually my house. It's down there"" He pointed through the thick growth of tall, evergreen trees. I said my name again and waited for his response. We shook hands. ""Hi, I'm Barry Hoover."" ""I know I can go down to my property, but I'm not sure if I can take anyone else."" He said, walking towards the structure, with me following step for step. Stooping, he showed me the base of his garage and how it was moved off its foundation from the force of the blast. ""You are at ground zero."" He said, standing back up. ""First, this was a death scene. Then, it was an accident scene. I was not allowed to come back to the house for 12-days."" He said.<br/><br/>I realized how much his life had been disrupted. ""I didn't have any clothes, toiletries  nothing  and had to go buy all new things, and borrow."" He explained how he had to live in a hotel. ""I'm sorry you had to go through all that."" I said, empathizing with his ordeal. ""My concerns were for all those families who lost their loved ones"" He said, ""not for me."" Windows were still missing. The doors, originally blown off their hinges had been replaced. The inside was still vulnerable to the wind and rain. The furniture was not salvageable. His house, from top to bottom, had been pelted with bits of aircraft and contents, most of which were gathered up by investigators. Charred, black patches of trees and shrubs dotted the landscape, which were more visible on the second visit, after the snow had melted. ""I'm amazed none of those little fires spread into bigger ones."" He said.<br/><br/>There were hundreds of pieces of metal from the aircraft that were no larger than a quarter and wires that still covered the ground like confetti.<br/><br/>I turned around and looked out through the glassless window, back towards the crash site with a better sense of the magnitude and force of what had taken place right where I stood and tried to envision the horror of those final imperiling, heroic moments being experienced aboard the aircraft The sacrifices for freedom of those brave heroes who died on Flight 93, who viewed liberty as being worth more than life itself, are truly worthy of our constant remembrance. May we never forget."

While conspiracy theorists speak their minds and patriots vehemently try to discredit them, United 93 is a bit misplaced in this foray.<br/><br/>It evokes such a wide array of emotions and responses that one starts to struggle with the true intent of the film. Are we supposed to hate Muslims? Are we supposed to blame the government? Or is this so implausible that this is just some attack to go against what the conspiracy theorists speak out about? It's an interesting quandary, but in the process, Paul Greengrass made a super-realistic film that will certainly spark debate (and in the case of my father, a lot of racist hate). United 93 will most likely be the definitive film on 9/11, even though the whole genre to this event has really yet to be touched. Until something more sinister is brought along, this will be a tribute to those that were in that plane."

","A legitimate tribute to common citizens, who, when faced with the realization that death may be imminent, chose to fight back and possibly save others while they are at it.<br/><br/>The characters are not known actors. Each person was asked to read a bio of their character so they might be able to do a better job of being them, not simply being a good actor. Some of the flight controllers and military people are the real people who did those jobs on 9/11. It dramatically increases the realism.<br/><br/>The movie is real time. The characters don't know anything more than they did at that time on 9/11. No patriotic speeches. No over the top action heroes. No ultimate evil villains. Real people. Muslim terrorists doing their deed, not cartoon characters. Scared people doing the best they can in a terrible situation.<br/><br/>You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It will make you ask yourself if you would have had the courage to act as these common citizens did. It will remind you that there are people perfectly willing to kill any American, man, woman or child.

","Fist of all let me just say that i am not an American ,and therefore probably don't feel the same level of Patriotism as some of the American viewers, i have to admit that watching this film does provoke some strong feeling in me.<br/><br/>What i like about this film is the fact that there are no cheesy line, gimmicks, or glorified Americanise (see independence day). All there is is the director detailing a event as it happen to the best of our knowledge, showing us how a group of stranger banded together to survived and draw courage from each other to try to come out of a difficult situation. And i have to admit, listening to the passengers making call to say goodbye to their love ones brings a few tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>A good movie is one that makes you think after you walk out of the cinema, and i think this movie does that to me. Even now i still got this question in my head.... If god forbid, this ever happens to me, would i have the courage and do what these men and women do?"
"moviemanMA","10","2","5","9 May 2006"," The Inevitable
","The events that took place on September 11th are still embedded into the minds of Americans everywhere. For months there was no escape from those dreaded images and the idea that terrorists are stronger than previously thought. The last thing to worry about would be a a picture about the events on that fateful day. Upon hearing that there would be not one but two movies released less than five years after the catastrophe (Oliver Stone's World Trade Center being the second), I was skeptical to say the least. Is our country ready to relive those terrible hours on the big screen?<br/><br/>United 93 takes a look at the last hours of the passengers aboard United Airlines Flight 93. The films opens with the terrorists making some final preparations before they leave. Director Paul Greengrass jumps around throughout the film from control room to control room and back to the situation aboard the plane. Because of all people involved, there is no need to delve into backgrounds for the characters, just the fact that they are present is all that is necessary for the film to work.<br/><br/>The movie isn't completely centered around the flight of United 93, but the events leading up to the fateful crash in Pennsylvania. One idea that is constant throughout the film is that question of 'what now?' Today's world has changed because of what happened in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania. We are much more cautious and anxious about taking the next step. In 2001 no one could have foreseen this happening to America. A country that for hundreds of years has taken in all sorts of cultures and given them fresh start on life. It is almost a stab in the back. To see the panic in the faces of the air traffic controllers and the stewardesses is a chilling reminder of how we all felt that day.<br/><br/>Greengrass luckily didn't go out of his way into making this a blockbuster smash like The Perfect Storm. Both are stories that have holes missing in the actual time line of events. The only certain aspect of these movies is the outcome. Rather than relying on the big name actors to lead the passengers in an uprising against the terrorists, Greengrass acquires talent in numbers, forging an element of realism in the passengers. The casting of actual military personnel is a much needed touch that makes the movie that more believable. Without this aspect of the film it would be making a mockery of the event and smearing the movie industry.<br/><br/>The message being sent isn't to be more patriotic or more anti-Islam. The message emanating from the film to be informed and to understand what ordinary people can accomplish in an extraordinary situation. Of course these people should be honored and remembered, but the movie doesn't make them into Harrison Ford's and Sigourney Weaver's. It creates their legend. They saved hundreds possibly thousands of lives, taking their own.<br/><br/>Skeptical as I was, I only knew of one thing coming into the movie and that was the outcome. I knew that there was no way this movie could end happily. Michael Bay tried to do this with the movie Pearl Harbor and made a shamble of such a solemn and tragic event. Although the ending was certain, the beginning and body of the movie was basically a mystery entering the theatre. It truly was an informative and necessary piece.<br/><br/>So where is our country now? Have we come any farther from when we once were? United 93 doesn't answer that question. The answer lies within every American. Do we move on and remember the thousands of lives lost that day, or do we stay in the past beneath the pain and agony that came screaming out of the sky?"

"ark30inf","10","2","5","3 May 2006"," Reality as Art
","Sometimes an artist tries to interpret reality, heighten it, and massage it in order to make clearer its real meaning. But there are some rare realities that are so overpowering that they stand alone and any massaging can only diminish it. Unfortunately, in most cases, the ego of the artist cannot resist the imperative to try and clarify further. The director in this film has successfully resisted these natural artistic impulses, and in so doing allowed the art of reality to manifest itself, as itself. That in itself signals an artist of a higher caliber.<br/><br/>This is not a documentary. It is indeed an artistic film.<br/><br/>Beyond art, the reality of the events are straightforward. There are no political statements, no indictments, no rah-rah. We see failure and we see heroism in equal parts as normal people react to crisis. We see competence and incompetence hand in hand. We decisions made and responsibility taken in one moment, to be negated by incompetence or a flawed system in the next.<br/><br/>This film shows us a massive system designed to protect us break down in chaos and confusion. Those elements of the system capable of processing information and those capable of acting were not in concert.

The North American Air Defense Command, the FAA, the Air Force, the CIA, the FBI were unable to save thousands of lives and an irreplaceable American landmark of the soul on that day despite the desire and will to do so. But Tom Burnett and the others on Flight 93 were.<br/><br/>If there is a message in this film. Perhaps that is it.

"moviebuff587","8","2","5","2 May 2006"," Much Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be.
","I had a hard time deciding whether or not to go see the film United 93. I didn't make the decision to go see it until the other day when I saw Paul Greengrass, the director of the film, interviewed on the Today show. He explained how he got the approval of every family member of the passengers on the actual flight United 93 before making the film.<br/><br/>The major worry I had going in to movie was the fact that it was going to be hokey, and, in fact, be dishonorable to the families who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. I tried my best to go into the theater with an open mind, but when the subject matter is as controversial as this it was hard to go in there without having a predetermined idea of what it was going to be like. My original idea that the film wasn't going to be good was completely off...<br/><br/>The first thing you realize about United 93 is that there is no major score that accompanies it. That's a good thing, because that last thing I wanted was a suspenseful or thrilling score that would become the signature of United 93 distracting from what the film is actually about. You also notice that the movie is filmed on hand-held cameras so that the viewer gets the affect that he is actually experiencing the events of that day. It was a gritty way to film it, and possibly the only way it could have been done correctly. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass decided to shoot the film on real-time. Real-time means that however long the film is that's how long the events actually took. This is another way that Greengrass pulls the audience into the horrific events, and, because of that style of film-making, the film is extremely difficult to watch at times. <br/><br/>The major triumph of this film is that it doesn't exploit 9/11 in any way. Instead, it's a terrifying portrayal of an event that no American will ever forget. This film is not played out in the way a thriller would, but it unfolds on a necessary slow pace that lets the viewer soak in every detail that happened less than five years ago. Most of America has no idea about a lot that occurred on 9/11 and this film teaches a lot on what went on in all the Aircraft control rooms as people learned that we were being attacked. Much of what went on the actual flight United 93 is unknown, because we only know what the passengers, that called their family members, told, which, was enough to base an entire film on.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the United 93, it does fall into a few clichés. One is where a passenger makes it to the plane just in time. Whether or not that actually happened we will never know, but because it's a common cliché in films with airplanes, which makes me think it may not have happened. However, never does the dialogue on board the plane become unbelievable, and the reason for that is because Paul Greengrass shot really long takes, some even 40 minutes long, so that the relatively inexperienced cast could get comfortable in their surroundings and deliver the dialogue smoothly and effectively. Even the famous line, ""let's roll"" isn't given a lot of focus, and if you don't listen for it, you could miss it.<br/><br/>The final 20 or so minutes of United 93 is some of the most haunting film-making I have ever seen. There is one scene where the passengers are reciting the Lord's Prayer in the cabin of the plane; while the hijackers are praying for the act of violence they are about to carry out. <br/><br/>There's nothing I could say that could give you an idea of the affect that this film will have on you, or that it had on me, and many other people. This film was made the best way a film based on 9/11 could have been made at this point in time, meaning, a film this close to the actual events. Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center will have a lot to live up to, and if it's not even on par with United 93, then I believe it will be trashed. United 93 is the best film of the year so far, and the most disturbing film in years. United 93 gets a 7.5 out of 10."

","No one should be afraid to see this movie. It is truly an emotional ride, but the courage and presence of mind of the passengers/hostages of United Flight 93 makes them, in my mind, true heroes. They were not victims of a hijacking. They were the true martyrs for a higher cause, not the terrorists. They gave their lives as a sacrifice to save others on the ground from what the terrorists had planned. Their families should be proud of them. The only criticism I have is the use of the ""f"" word by one of the actors. The character the actor portrayed was a man of faith and the actor did him and his family a disservice by uttering that word. I can't imagine the real person he portrayed would have uttered it, even under those circumstances. Except for that, the movie was a very moving tribute to 40 (minus the terrorists) very brave people."

"Acolin_f","8","2","5","30 April 2006"," Eerie, like a horror movie
","Online Slate magazine has a pretty good write-up about this movie. (http://www.slate.com/id/2140690/) Except the author doesn't say that watching the events of 9/11 unfold is eerie. It is like watching that horrific day all over again with the clarity of a horror movie. We know what the bad guy is going to do next. We know the innocent, happy girl is going to make a mistake, and despite our inner admonishments and hands clutching the theater seats, sure enough, like an idiot, she opens the wrong door.<br/><br/>With horror movies, we have the frustrating benefit of foresight. The director lets us in on the secret. With 9/11, we have the wretched frustration of hindsight.<br/><br/>First there is the Discovery Channel's review of the 9/11 Commission Report, which found a damnable lack of foresight, intelligence co-operation and imagination in a defense system that already suffered multiple attacks from the same terrorist organization, including one previous attempt against the very same target! Then there is Thomas Friedman's book, The World is Flat. He details the extensive $400K, multi-team globalization project, which al Qaeda undertook to attack the towers, the Pentagon and the Capitol building.<br/><br/>In some respects, this is movie making at its best. Hand held video follows the terrorists through their daily prayers and preparations, nameless, faceless people board the plane amid scraps of conversations and phone calls. Air traffic control centers follow yellow markers on the screen. Bureaucrats shuffle papers and attend meetings. Then one plane is off the screen and nobody knows what is going on. Then another plane is off the air. United 93 taxis down the run-way, preparing for take-off. Four young Arabs sit quietly in first class.<br/><br/>Another plane is off the screen. The military is alerted. A plane hits the World Trade Center. The director is clinical about the timing and conversations of the events. His eye never wavers as the clock winds down to the inevitable. This isn't a roller-coaster. This is a grind.<br/><br/>Our government doesn't look bad. They just look woefully unprepared. The mother of one of serial killer Jeffery Dahmers' victims spoke in court. She said there was nothing wrong with her boy. Yet nothing, she said, prepares you for a monster like Dahmer.<br/><br/>So it was with the military and the air traffic control centers. Although Islamist extremists tried to bomb the WTC before and they successfully bombed the USS Cole, we never met a monster like bin Laden.<br/><br/>The director doesn't amplify the courage it took those soldiers of faith to dive head-long into an oblivion of structural steel. He juxtapositions the religious preparations of the terrorists with the last minute prayers of the doomed passengers.<br/><br/>And then it is over. You are left alone, in the dark, after a nightmare ride to death. The emptiness and the hollowness of their jihad inhibits you.<br/><br/>Unlike Tora, Tora, Tora or the first and second Pearl Harbor movies, after watching United 93, it is easy to see how the schemers and manipulators gave us the war we got. Neither side may be the moral right in this cultural war over globalization and scarce resources, but after watching this movie, you want war. You want justice and you want revenge. I am not sure the Afghanistan war alone would have satisfied our national appetite for revenge."
"misterembryo","8","2","5","30 April 2006"," A respectful account to a tragic event.
","United 93 was the first Hollywood rendition of the unforgettable 911 plane crashes. Thankfully there was no Titanic love story, and no big budget re-enactment of the 911 crashes.<br/><br/>Tastefully, Writer/Director Paul Greengrass decided to show three of the plane crashes from the perspective of the control centers. This turned out to be a very interesting, and suspenseful way to present the tragedy. The decisions that had to be made and the actions that weren't being carried out, really revealed the hopelessness of the situation. Although this created suspenseful moments and great anticipation, the same conversations and shaky camera movements for almost an entire hour became a bit tedious.<br/><br/>There is no main character in this story. Instead the main character is the body of passengers that boarded United 93. The reactions of the passengers and flight attendants seemed very real. United 93 is made up of all kinds of passengers. Business people. Families. Tourists. The portrayal of those aboard United 93, down to the moments when serious decisions needed to be made concerning the terrorist attack, seemed painfully believable.<br/><br/>Greengrass was also successful in making it clear that the terrorists were also human. The terrorists displayed moments of hesitation and fear to commit these acts of terror. Though their actions were undeniably vicious, they were men that would do anything to serve the Lord.<br/><br/>My only complaints were that the control room conversations did begin to drag in the beginning, and an ending, or lack thereof could have been improved.<br/><br/>There is a great, great rise in the climax and the movie definitely makes an impact. But frankly, it seemed like the movie took the easy way out by using text on the screen to tell the rest of the story rather than presenting it visually. With that great rise in suspense leading to nothing, the movie almost feels incomplete.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a great reminder of how significantly the event affected our lives. Thank God they didn't make it out to be a Shwarzenegger blockbuster or a Pearl Harbor romance. Instead it respectfully told the story of the individuals aboard United 93 who had no choice but to become their own heroes."

I cried, I held my breath, and I remembered exactly where I was when 9/11 happened. I was pleased to see that the theater was crowded; I was afraid that because of the controversy surrounding the trailer for the movie that no one would go see it. I also must add that the writing, direction, and acting are all Oscar-caliber, though how to decide who to nominate in the acting categories would be impossible.

"cutieflva","10","2","5","29 April 2006"," I was on that plane
","My brother mentioned seeing United 93, just like he did the newest Star Wars Movie, it was the newest ""must see"" film in theaters. So, as we walked into our 12:45 p.m showing of the movie, I remember wondering what agenda Hollywood would try to push this time. Would it be another War of the Worlds, glorifying the military as our last line of defense? Or maybe a Titanic, with a great love story in tragedy? We walked into the movie 5 minutes late, and were surprised to see it had already started. I would learn later, that along with following realistic time constraints, the movie did not have credits. The dramatic irony was intense. We all knew what happened- but we wanted to know how, or did we? I found my curiosity was at odds with my strong sensitivity to the tragedy. I could take knowing the planes were hijacked. In fact, while it was difficult to re-watch the CNN news broadcast of the two planes that hit the twin towers, It was gut-wrenching and near impossible to sit through what happened inside flight 93. The two planes that hit the buildings were just that- planes. At this point in the movie, we can only stomach what we see unfolding on flight 93, and cannot fathom the lives lost on the other two planes or in the twin towers. I remember wishing they'd stop going back to the plane camera- that they would just leave it in the control room. I didn't want to know, but I did. In the same way we are all curious about death- and yet deathly afraid of it. We watched as people boarded a plane that seemed like any other. We watched as people very much like ourselves relaxed, drifted off to sleep, and engaged in carefree conversations about future plans. At the ending of the movie, it said there were no survivors on the plane. What I know seems to defy that statistic. I feel as though I was able to escape that crash today. That I was sitting on board that plane with each of those passengers, I was the girl crying and praying in the corner, and somehow I survived. No one else did- but I did. Watching each of the passengers talk to their loved ones- all wanting to tell them just two things: 'I love you"" and ""goodbye"", two words we've all had to tell someone who means the world to us at one point in our lives. The one comfort I usually find in sad movies is that I can say ""this is just a movie""- the degree of separation is my comfort. Not today. This was not just a movie- this was real. When we sat down in that theater we boarded United 93. My fear is in the repercussions of this movie. It is powerful. It will jar you. I will never forget walking out of the theater, getting halfway down the exit portal, when I hear a muffled, high- pitched, cry coming from right next to me; my brother had finally broke down- he could contain it no longer. And as we walked out of that movie theater, crying like we had just learned of the passing of a close relative, gravity seemed a bit heavier than usual. People just like us, got on that plane- and died. <br/><br/>This changed the way we see death. We're so desensitized to it. We saw struggle. We saw blood. We saw a passenger break the neck of a hijacker. We felt what it was like to be in a situation where you knew you were going to die. You begin to ask yourself how you would act, what you would do. Would you be that girl crying in the corner, or one of the men that bull rushed toward the cockpit? <br/><br/>I can see this movie causing hate crimes. Since I have been to see the movie, my awareness of middle-eastern-looking Americans has been heightened. The actors who portrayed the hijackers looked Americanized; they were wearing suits and polo shirts, not turbans or robes. What will the response be by the American people? Will our emotional paranoia drive us further into hatred for people who resemble these hijackers? Can we contain this hatred? Can we only honor those who died only five years ago- without feeling the need to do something about it? This seat on United 93 has left us all with the same traumatic feeling of an American who survivedan American who will not let his fellow countrymen die in vain."

After five minutes of this immensely annoying tactic I was getting bored. I soon began to fast forward and everywhere I stopped it was more of the same inane drivel. Back and forth the camera goes with sophomoric pretense that is astounding in its ability to bore and annoy. The acting is just as bad.

You see your loved one portrayed--based on no research whatsoever--as a collaborator and traitor to the passenger rebellion. This is inexcusable, chauvinistic and insensitive. Why, I would also ask, are all those passengers sobbing on their phone calls when in fact the reports are that they were calm? The truth would have been more moving. All of that said, the movie is powerful and I was sobbing hard at the end, and all other contenders for Oscar for best editing should not bother renting tuxes. Still: the film would have been ever better without the unnecessary creation of a villain among the passengers. Did Mr. Greengrass not think that the hijackers were villain enough?"

"zackerywest","Null","3","10","29 April 2006"," My Two Cents on United 93 and the Backstory
","This subject must be dealt with. As a nation, we risk being blinded by a kind of PTSD if we cease to function rationally when this subject or the fate of those passengers in particular and their unfathomable decision, is uttered. I don't know if a film, which is generally considered to be the most potent form of communication, is the best way to deal with it.<br/><br/>The film is, deliberately or unwittingly, an allegory or microcosm of the Curse of the Modern Age. Great minds have commented that the possibility that the weapons and tools of geniuses can and will ultimately fall into the hands of those with neither the intellectual ability to conceive of them nor the associated responsibility to humanity for their use  is very real and is our greatest enemy. The coupling of ideological fanaticism with this little glitch in the economy of innovation is what made the September 11th attacks possible.<br/><br/>The struggle that took place on Flight 93 encapsulates this ugly battle, which, at its heart is man's highest faculties (the use of advanced technology, and understanding of human psychology and fear; the effect of 'blitz' actions) applied in the most base way (fanaticism and anger), to the most humdrum and unsuspecting of subjects. It was a real 'down and dirty' play, a proverbial kick in the balls.<br/><br/>And it failed.<br/><br/>What most affects me is the failure of the attempt to seize psychological control over the passengers, as was successful on the other flights that day. Clearly, the effect the news of the other attacks would have on their hostages was not something the planners of the hijacking accurately figured into their deliberations, which must have been extensive.<br/><br/>This single aspect, that those who would attack a group of hapless travelers had not considered either the depth of their strength, duty, selflessness, courage or humanity  is the chief idea in this sordid matter. It is paramount because we are in a struggle for our humanity, not only in a cultural sense, but within single cultures, single nations, and even single individuals. This struggle between the higher and lower aspects of our species is not exclusive to one gender, race, culture, creed, age or religious persuasion.<br/><br/>The highest purpose of any individual or society or species cannot, logically, be realized without freedom, and there is no materially freer (financially, culturally, religiously) country than the United States. 'Live Free or Die'; the dichotomy of freedom-loving people willing to go toe-to-toe with the greatest enemies of freedom, and the incarnation of its own fear is counter-intuitive, but actually makes poetic sense. One reason freedom is so special is because it enables a formidable defense, when provoked, but needn't resign itself to a militaristic or passive disposition by default. Because...what kind of life is that? Attacks upon freedom are attacks upon the self; thus, though freedom may not prevail, it cannot entirely be defeated.<br/><br/>I think the terrorist agents in these attacks were behaving like neglected teens, and that the United States has indeed been stingy and somewhat self-righteous with freedom. When I see the human desperation required to enact those attacks, they appear to me as cries for help  and I'm not being dismissive. The main reason is that the perpetrators have no negotiable terms. These were not attacks aimed at a strategic objective, like Pearl Harbor, or which would cease at a defined state of affairs.<br/><br/>When human beings resort to terrorism and behave like animals, they have already surrendered their humanity, and we know well what human beings with no humanity are capable of. It is a mistake to sympathize with this behavior. I think the course to take is to recognize the real reasons for such attacks: feeling excluded, disenfranchised. I realize a lot of the rest of the world would say I'm being smug in this analysis, but fear of the good life, a deep-seated inferiority complex, and actually being excluded  manifested as envy  is the only explanation that adds up. Inherently, religion is not a cause; it will always be subject to the host; which is simply our design. A person may resign his personal control or judgment, but this is willing. Religion is like software; it can be uploaded or downloaded into any willing 'carrier' or system. Moreover, aspects of religion may be played-up or played-down. The question is: why are certain people disposed to faiths, and aspects of those faiths, that support other objectives? Ought not we to consider what that seminal, grass-roots ethos is? There are Muslims in America who are law-abiding. There are, too, Christians, in America and abroad, who conceive monstrous plots to kill in the name of their faith. Let's call it what it is: their dressing up their personal needs in something larger, not owning up to a deeper psychological cause. That's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>Our Achilles heel is also our secret weapon: freedom enables us to keep our wits and fight smartly; to oppose or reconcile as appropriate - most especially when the unthinking impulse is to destroy. Is there any greater terrestrial power than what I have described? It's giving your humanity a weapon and a flower, and choosing for your enemies when they cannot. I don't see so much of that kind of Kingly power; I don't see us acknowledging what our weaker enemies cannot themselves acknowledge."
"c-blauvelt","4","6","27","29 April 2006"," Discordant, Incomprehensible, and Lackluster American Mythology
","I've never felt much of a connection with American history in the cinema. I've found U.S. history to be portrayed solely as disastrous moments like Pearl Harbor, the Vietnam War, Kennedy's assassination, or the Civil War. If not taking this approach then Hollywood wants to make history sexy, by playing out clichéd romances or revenge thriller narratives against the backdrop of historical moments. If it falls into the latter category, then a film about the Revolutionary War has to become about a family man with a mysterious past who has to confront his demons while protecting his family or exacting revenge for them like Mel Gibson in Roland Emmerich's film ""The Patriot."" Rarely, is American history portrayed without glamour, without commentary, without subtext. I can truly say that Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" is such a film.<br/><br/>And it completely fails. Not that I like the type of movies mentioned previously. I loathe them, because I want a more personal view of our American history. ""United 93"" is admirably devoid of artifice and glamour. It does not turn these real people into characters with backstory and additional conflicts. It presents them as being extraordinarily ordinary, even dull. Greengrass presents a fairly real-time account of what happened to the passengers of this plane, without bringing in any outside context or historical hindsight. What makes the movie so unsettling is that the people in the film (I hesitate to use the word ""characters"" here)find out about the events of 9/11 in the same state of confusion that all Americans felt on that terrible morning. The people on flight 93 don't even know who's taken over their plane. The people in the air-traffic control tower don't know who's flown planes into the World Trade Center. In fact we see the utter failure of the government to react to the crisis in time. The greatest accuracy is assured in Greengrass's historical narrative by his exhaustive research of what really happened. The movie should be a resounding catharsis, a creative exploration of our great national wound, and yet it fails.<br/><br/>It fails because we have constantly heard this story since 9/11. Indeed, it is a heroic tale, and worthy of retelling. However, Greengrass tells this story the exact same way we have always heard it: as a series of events written down on a timetable, with people reduced to the roles of terrorists and heroes without any understanding of why these roles formed in the first place. It is history utterly without context, which for Greengrass was entirely the point. I admire that he didn't try to turn this film into an ""Air Force One""-esquire battle in the sky between heroic Americans and evil terrorists. But it is unavoidable that the events of flight 93 have become the greatest American mythology of the 21st century: that Americans would have the tenacity to fight back against terror while facing certain death is awe-inspiring. The legend, however, has become greater than the reality, as the film clearly shows. Greengrass wanted to portray the mundane nature of life in contrast with the extraordinary events of the hijacking, but here he utterly failed. Whereas most of the passengers on the plane were concerned with their typical business and family problems, the terrorists are also portrayed as merely carrying out a job. We don't get any insight into what the terrorists are thinking as they are about to kill themselves and a plane-full of other people, nor do we see much of what the passengers are thinking in response to this. All the action takes place externally in this film, while the more interesting conflicts are the moral dilemmas the terrorists and passengers are facing internally. It is a very immersive movie, because the viewer truly feels like he or she is there, present on the plane, but somehow removed, detached, and unable to respond. Perhaps Greengrass was trying to instill this feeling of inaction, impotence, and detachment in the viewer so that he or she could feel what it must have been like to be on the flight, but I think that's giving him too much credit. The fact is: this is one of the most poorly shot films I've ever seen. Greengrass is clearly trying to convey a documentary-style realism here with his verite-inspired hand-held camera work. He is trying to create a sense of truth, of cinematic reality to complement the extensive historical research that went into the film. But the camera lurches and shakes so erratically, so completely without plan or design, that it is almost impossible to tell what is happening in key moments of the film, especially when the passengers decide to fight back. I rarely get motion sickness while watching a movie, but here nausea truly set in. This made it impossible to appreciate the flow of real-time events in the historical narrative. <br/><br/>I appreciate that Greengrass wanted to make a movie devoid of romanticism, but the fact is flight 93 has become an American mythology based on ordinary heroes and patriotic catch-phrases (""Let's Roll). It is impossible to do justice to the cultural conception of what happened on that plane. And as a result, the actors turn in mechanical performances designed to make them seem like real people. But in the end, despite being devoid of romantic labels, they are turned into roles. Here is the terrorist, here is the heroic passenger, here is the flight traffic controller, here is the military officer. So even though he doesn't turn these people into characters, he does reduce them to functional roles playing out their historical functions dispassionately, incapable of escaping their tragic destiny."

","I was very disappointed in this version of Flight 93. It is jumbled and confusing at best. There is no comparison to this version and the A&E Version. Do yourself a favor and watch the A&E Version, it is 10 times better. The A&E version covers more of the personal lives of the passengers and the loved ones they called from the plane, the Universal version barely touches on it. Half the time I could not understand what people were saying on the plane, it was too mixed up and confusing. Maybe that was the way it was on the plane - who knows, but as a movie it stinks this way. I am sure that the family members of those on that flight are disappointed as well. If I were a family member of any of those on Flight 93, I would think the A&E version does more justice to those who sacrificed their lives."
"paul_pooty","5","4","16","30 April 2006"," Not a moveon.org conspiracy theory nor GOP propaganda. But why see it?
","Flight 93 wasn't shot down. It took off too late, allowing passengers time to learn that unlike past hijackings, this one involved no plans to land and demand money or the release of imprisoned comrades. So more of them were inclined to fight back. People on the first flights to be commandeered had no such warning; because of a pattern established over decades, they believed that submission was the only way to survive. The few who tried to resist were either stabbed or hindered by chemical sprays. I'd say those on United 93 were heroes, so what if self interest was among their motives? Nevertheless, it doesn't warrant an America's Most Wanted-style reenactment that probably resembled the actual hijacking about as much as an episode of The View. Just as news footage from the Battle of Mogadishu reveals that Black Hawk Down was just a poorly imitating high school play, or a Discovery Channel special on naval aviation gives us the real thing in comparison to the glaringly inaccurate Top Gun. Many people, however, don't see movies for information or even entertainment. To them film is an accompaniment to a night out with friends and a conversation piece afterward at the ice cream parlor or coffee shop. Anyone who places themselves in this category has a reason to see United 93. All others, save yourselves the ten bucks and watch the network or cable news version."

","It's tough for me to think about this story, because it is very bitter-sweet, on the one hand, you have American's fighting terrorists, and on the other you have the terrorists who already took over the plane, with the ability to crash it in mere seconds...<br/><br/>I went in with my wife and my 5-month old baby boy and sat and watched the unfolding of the lives of those who really did make a difference. They were real heroes. Not movie actor action hero, with special effects and as many chances to get their lines right as they needed. No stunt men, to do the job for them, Americans, no matter what color, or nationality, together, United. <br/><br/>Don't forget 1993. The blind sheik 'Rochmon' set off the bomb that blasted the inside the Trade-Center. Not totally successful, however it should have been enough to set us on the prowl then. Afterall, that was on U.S. soil. In my opinion, we dropped the ball, big-time, when it came to a realistic follow-up investigation with a search of any and all connected to this blind and who ever was thinking like-minded with him as well. The reason that we get attacked, is that we don't properly show the 'animalistic' terrorist community, that we will not be used as toilet paper for their anti-American beliefs. <br/><br/>This has been the second most powerful movie for me of all the true stories, that I have ever seen. It is hard to go through it again, although I love this film and the stripped down selfless acts that these people were committed to finishing, in the light and coming darkness of their own situation.<br/><br/>This is what I believe America and real Americans are all about. Standing up for each other, in desperate times. Seeing it through to the end. However that end may be, in it's finality. That say's everything. These weren't men sitting in some dimly lit Little bar telling how they beat down a bunch other men in a bar fight or bragging about something from the glory days, this was men and women, that looked grim death in the face. And had no other choice according to themselves, but to fight....to the death. This was the code that they had and or found in mere moments. ""Let's Roll"" the man said. That was his life's Tag-line. His motto. That was real. They had the look of fear in their eyes and most likely terror in their hearts, yet they sent a number of terrorists, (that were trained to kill Americans) straight to terrorist Hell!! <br/><br/>I wept at the end, when the plane was, upside-down heading for the ground.<br/><br/>Heart-wrenching to think this, is the reward for standing up for their country, and yet that is just like the soldiers! Doing this, for someone else. The ultimate act of Patriotism! A sobering Bravery. Heros, none can effectively argue it with me. I was yelling at the screen, at the terrorists, toward the end, like I have never done at a movie screening, ever!!!<br/><br/>I say, thank you to the hero's that gave their lives for others and if you got a problem still, get face to face with GOD.<br/><br/>Whew! What an experience I was drained and my voice was 'horse' at the end.<br/><br/>I applaud Mr. Greengrass in the research and work that he conducted, to commit himself to bringing this chain of events to the forefront of our hearts and minds. I wanted to know the other story about that flight that just never seemed to get a decent news covering. I say thank you to Paul for putting this into a place that we can see and realize that sacrifice that was made. To see the tragedy of this senseless act by those looking to kill Americans, without regard to our God or us. I cannot get this out of my head the heroism that these men and women showed, in the time that we needed heroes most!! <br/><br/>This was an incredibly moving and terrifying film...I highly recommend.

This includes Christians, Jews, and the great Eastern religions: Hinduism, Buddism, and Shinto. Their bible (the Koran) urges and encourages them to convert we ""nonbelievers"" into good Moslems; but if we refuse to do so, they are obligated - on pain of religious anathema and banishment for heresy - to pursue us and to slay us. So they hate us and wish to destroy us because this is what their religion mandates, and this is why they feel so sacrosanct in committing their dastardly acts of mass murder in the name of ""the Prophet, Blessed Be He."" These themes are brilliantly brought out in the film and make it quite clear that there is only one solution to the Moslem ""problem."" We must kill them in greater numbers, at faster rates, than they do us, so that we can destroy their economic infrastructures, their livelihoods, and bring them to their knees economically such that they are ready to throw their Korans into the trash and listen to entreaties from us to conduct themselves as decent human beings and to finally learn that in order to survive, one must accept one's fellow human beings for what they are - and for what they are not."

","Before the movie got released I thought it was too early to make a 9/11 movie. So I didn't expect the movie to be great before I watched the movie. When I expect nothing, I should get something great, right?<br/><br/>But no! I didn't get something great.<br/><br/>It was a long and boring movie. Mainly it happens in the flight centrals in different cities where they talk about what happened to the planes. Why should the people find dialogs in the flight centrals interesting?<br/><br/>Though the boring movie, I found TWO scenes ONLY thats good for me. These scenes was the scene of the second airplane-crash on WTC and the scene of the end. Or else nothing good or interesting in the movie.<br/><br/>Just by the end of the movie, it appears 4-5 pages with text that tells what happened on the day. I was like ""what the..."". Movie is meant to be visual, not like a book.<br/><br/>I gotta say something to the director. Get more visual! And by the word ""visual"", I didn't mean stuff like action, shooting or explosion. But September 11th happened too much to make a movie in flight central and United 93 only. There's a lot more stuff around 9/11 to put in the movie, but the director did not.<br/><br/>What a lazy non-creative director! You gotta pay me back!"
"KenVeryBigLiar","5","2","6","22 September 2006"," A mediocre movie, at best...
","Evaluating this movie is not an easy task. This happens because (almost) all of us will be judging this movie having in mind what happened on the 11th of September in 2001. And I think that it is very important to state this. If this movie was supposed to be purely fictional, everyone would judge it differently.<br/><br/>This forces me to address another issue, and not a friendly one: were the events that happened in 11/9/2001 really perpetrated by Islamic terrorists or was this only an excuse for a more sinister truth, as suggested in the movie ""Loose Change 2nd Edition""? I will not be discussing what it think is the truth. I have my opinion about that, and you have yours. The thing is, if you believe the ""official"" version about what happened, you will probably think this is a tribute to those heroic people who stopped the terrorists from crashing another plane. But if you believe the ""alternative"" version of the story, you will probably not like it because all of it sounds like a big lie.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: I don't think the movie is bad, but I don't think it is good either. I like the way the movie was shot, with a feeling of ""amateur camera"" and the actors perform well. But apart from that, there is not much else I can say in favor of this movie. If the story was not supposed to be based on the events that took place on 11/09/2001, it would be rather weak.<br/><br/>And please don't think ""but of course this was supposed to portray the events that happened in 11/9/2001, you dummy!"" because I would have to say that, in that case, it doesn't look much of a tribute to the memory of those who died, but more like a chance to make some profit out of people's suffering..."

"silverrain-4","Null","2","6","27 August 2006"," UNITED 93 - a belated wake-up call?
","When is it the 'right' time to make a movie about 9/11? Five years? Ten? Never? If the terrorists had attacked say, an underground mine of 2000 workers and killed them all with an explosion, would there have been all the media hype? Probably not.<br/><br/>Despite what Americans think about terrorists, calling them 'evil' and 'callous', they forget one important fact: terrorists are extremely intelligent and will outwit the best of our best every step of the way. They also have unlimited funds. Add the fact that fanatics have no qualms about dying for their beliefs and you have an undefeatable power. They don't care what we think of them.<br/><br/>The Twin Towers were attacked for one reason only; visual impact.<br/><br/>The WTC was a famous US landmark and targeting it drew the necessary news coverage. Add the attempts on the White House and Pentagon, both also US icons, and you have a nation terrified out of its wits. This basis of terrorism is of course, terror. Considering how the US treats Arab countries, expecting non-retaliation is sheer arrogance.<br/><br/>The unexpected downing of the Twin Towers was an added bonus for the terrorists. They must have squealed with glee as they watched their targets collapsing. It is extremely difficult to 'aim' a large airliner at such small targets (relatively speaking) and the pilots had considerable skills to do so (pilots trained in the US). No doubt the Towers falling spoiled the terrorists' 'fun'. Once the towers were gone, so was the visual impact. All that remained was smoke. The light show was over.<br/><br/>We cannot imagine the insufferable losses of 9/11, but police officers and fireman will tell the same story; they were merely doing their jobs. They did not know that the Towers would fall, but the shortsightedness of this is remarkable. Consider two, 300+ tonne commercial airliners, laden with highly flammable jet fuel slamming into buildings at over 400 miles per hour. Is it not feasible that the building's superstructures would become compromised? Even so, what were we to do? Leave the buildings' occupants to fend for themselves? It was a lose-lose situation.<br/><br/>Many emergency personnel knew that once they entered those buildings there was a chance they would not return. This is true of any emergency rescue. These folks are not heroes in the way we have glorified them. They are simply brave souls willingly to face extreme adversity in the execution of their duties. Many of the souls lost on that day would baulk at the idea of being 'heroes'. They would claim they were simply doing their jobs.<br/><br/>Whatever your beliefs, we cannot deny the incomparable bravery and spirit of those personnel. We do not know the facts of UNITED 93 other than vague radio messages and telephone calls made by passengers. Dialogue had to be created. The situation was well-handled and the dialogue believable, however much artistic license was used. UNITED 93 attempts to show an objective view of what may have happened aboard the stricken aircraft. It makes no claim to accuracy.<br/><br/>Even though we knew the inevitable outcome, I still found myself rooting for the passengers. Yes, the jerky hand-held camera action is annoying and there was too much time given to the hijackers praying and not enough character building of the passengers. But it did show terrorist fanaticism. I doubt there was the hesitation shown by the hijackers in the movie. Fanatics do not falter. Their minds work on 'autopilot', believing firmly that what they are doing is required by them of their Gods. Who are we to argue?<br/><br/>Whatever your thoughts, UNITED 93 is an acceptable and believable account of events, however inaccurate. It does a very good job of portraying the confusion by both NORAD and the FAA. Scenes aboard the aircraft will keep you glued to your seat. Anyone who has ever been in a crisis situation will know that there is first disbelief, then chaos, followed by arguing as it then all goes to pieces and those involved realize that they are ill-prepared to cope with the situation. Communication always breaks down. Incredibly, it is only since 9/11 that the US' security services have begun exchanging information.<br/><br/>The 9/11 attack was just the tip of the terrorist iceberg. As long as the US continues to invade other lands and insult their leaders, they will be under threat from organizations far more powerful that they can ever hope to defeat. Praying just will not do.<br/><br/>Terrorists have infinite patience and funding and I they want to bring us to our knees, they can and will do so with ease. Inevitable future attacks will be better organized and funded and will result in the loss of tens of thousands, possibly millions of Americans. Targets are shopping malls, cinemas and any critical US installation. Imagine 200 planes hijacked at the same time, or the orchestrated blowing up of packed shopping malls at Christmas time.<br/><br/>We need better leaders to help defend our own borders, not interfere in the lives and beliefs of other countries; an act that has gained the US international notoriety. Bush's war mongering adds fuel to the fire and his arrogance at thinking he can defeat these terrorists continues to threaten Americans. He needs to put down his club and listen. Bush's ideas and actions are little different than those he calls the ""evil ones"". Murder is murder. In any God's name. Iraq is a prime example. Examine life in the US very closely. How much freedom do we really have?<br/><br/>The world's opinion of America and is not very high and that 'superpower' arrogance will one day be removed. Whatever it takes and whatever the human cost. See the movie and form your own opinion. UNITED 93 is not professing to be the whole or any truth. It is well handled and very watchable. Decide for yourself."

Usually someone speaks, but you could have heard a pin drop.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, the director, shows you something true (or as close to true as facts allow). Most films that are fiction and have great stories move us emotionally, but those films that are true and have something we remember involving a devastating event effect us to the core. I think most of us can remember where we were when we first heard the news of 09/11/2001. My mom remembers running down the street at 24 years old telling everyone that Kennedy had been shot. I remember watching the space shuttle explode in the 80's (skipped out of school that dayha ha), but nothing compared to watching the live television coverage of the World Trade Center disaster.<br/><br/>Greengrass, being English, doesn't just concentrate on the plight of the passengers, but allows the audience to see it from the terrorist's eyes as well.<br/><br/>Spoiler: There is a scene where the primary terrorist is sitting next to a prominent executive in a designer suit and leather shoes. You see him continuing to stare at the shoes as if to be thinking my compatriots and people are dying and starving and this greedy American continues to consume products at will without regard to survival.<br/><br/>As you watch this film, keep in mind that the film is just as long as the actual flight of United 93. Given the circumstances, what would you do? What amount of terror would you be feeling? The passengers had only a short time to react to all the things that were happening, yet they found the time to call their loved ones and tell them bye. Greengrass' film is emotionally draining and powerful. Greengrass takes you on the ride with the passengers and doesn't let you go. I did find myself having an urge to leave the theater because I wanted to get off the plane. Then I reminded myself, ""They couldn't get off, so I won't leave them."" This film will be the one remembered in years to come as the pivotal film about 09/11."

","It took me a while to gather the strength to see this film. I live in New York, I am, many of us are, a part of this story. I went to see it several hours ago, right after the life sentencing of Zacarias Moussaoui - I wasn't going to see it, but somehow this sentencing provoked me to buy a ticket, sit in the dark with fifteen or so total strangers, and completely immerse myself in this. In effect, I just re-lived with shocking and visceral realism, the events of September 11, 2001. I lost it. I cried throughout the whole film, starting with one moment towards the beginning when one of the hijackers, Ziad Jarrah, calls his fiancée from the airport terminal and tells her he loves her. The only reason I know his name is because I have read up on the history of each of the perpetrators - this film does not name names, there is no 'central character', though there are recognizable ones (Todd Beamer comes to mind), and aboard flight 93 Jarrah was the only hijacker with any semblance of a normal life outside of his fundamentalist lifestyle, he did not break off relations with his family, friends, or his fiancée, whom he reportedly called minutes before boarding the aircraft. There was something about this moment that gave me a terrible sinking feeling in the bottom of my stomach, a feeling that can best be described as the horrible inevitability of everything. The feeling remained, and it is still in me as I am writing this. I was amazed, first off, at the skill of this film. It is an incredibly tight and realistic piece of film-making and quite unlike anything I have ever seen. I thought, though very difficult to watch in areas, it was tasteful, and did not stoop to gratuitous violence, and in the few areas music was used, it did not impede on the narrative, and didn't try to falsely elevate the drama in any scene - something I am so thankful for because I would not only have been truly disappointed had this film resorted to any cliché, but probably also angry. The story was told with respect, and with honor, and avoided cliché's as a rule. The hand-held photography really does lend to the story, I'm not usually a fan of this technique, however it worked because over the course of the film the camera-work became more unstable and shakier, until the final moments which were confused blur. This film, more than any I have ever seen has the ability to do two things, and this depends on the state of the viewer. It seems like it could either pacify or radicalize people in their opinions on what America's role is in the world and in this 'war on terror'. In the back of the theatre (Village East, New York City) a woman began to laugh hysterically during the final moments of this film. I could feel the animosity of the crowd, and there were loud 'Shhhh's. But this demonstrated to me the complete absurdity of life on this planet."

It's been 4.5 years since 9/11, and many have forgotten why we are where we are today. I've had a flag hanging outside ever since, not once has it came down.

","After watching the movie United 93, I almost wanted to cry in my seat at the theater. The audience was completely silent and somber when the movie had finished and the lights went up in the theater. Nobody talked. Nobody said a single word. People just slowly got out of their seat and left the theater with sad faces or tears in their eyes. <br/><br/>United 93 reminds us all of what happened on September 11, 2001. It reminds us of who are as Americans and where we were when the 9/11 tragedy struck the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. United 93 also made me realize that the President of the United States is one of the luckiest men in the world. For all we known, the terrorists aboard United 93 might have been using the 737-222 aircraft to try and crash into the White House in Washington, D.C., but we will never know for sure. <br/><br/>What we do know for a fact is that United 93 was heading for Washington, D.C. and that the brave passengers aboard the aircraft prevented the terrorists from reaching their intended target. What makes the President of the United States so lucky is that common, ordinary American people on United 93 sacrificed their lives to save the lives of those living in Washington, D.C., including the President of the United States (although the president wasn't in Washington, D.C. at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks). <br/><br/>How many times has a President of the United States been lucky at avoiding assassination attempts against his life? How many times have ordinary American people, or American soldiers, or Secret Service agents sacrificed their lives to save the President of the United States? <br/><br/>Although I was a little hesitant about seeing United 93 at the theater, I am glad that I did watch the movie. It made me realize how important it is to remember the people in our own personal lives (friends, family and relatives) who mean the most to us and how we should call them on the phone more often and say how much we love them in our hearts. After watching United 93 at the theater, I called my mother at home and told her how much I loved her and how important she is to me in my life. That is how great of an impact that United 93 made on my life after watching the movie. I wanted to cry and it made me think about the passengers of United 93, my country, my mother and the President of the United States.<br/><br/>I would encourage people (especially young teenagers) to go watch United 93 in their local movie theaters. It is an excellent movie and it seems to be very accurate in its details. It will remind you to never forget about those who sacrificed their lives on United 93. And by watching the movie, you will feel as though you are paying your respects to the honor and the memory of those who gave their lives in the cause of American freedom and liberty on United 93."

","After seeing the exceptional TV Movie ""Flight 93,"" I didn't think that any film, even a theatrical feature, could match the power and emotion of that film. But Paul Greengrass has proved me wrong with his powerful new film, ""United 93,"" the first theatrical film to be made about the events of September 11, 2001. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing this heroic true story to life. The use of hand-held ""shake"" cameras give it a very documentary-like feel to it. There is also no dramatic embellishment as well; all we see is the passengers and crew as they attempt to re-take their flight from the hijackers who are hell-bent on killing hundreds. We are also there as air traffic controllers and military personnel attempt to find out what is going on, and to get a hold on the situation. Greengrass has crafted a masterpiece that not only serves as a great companion piece with the TV movie ""Flight 93,"" but also serves as a reminder of the heroism that saved our nation's capitol. Grade: A"
"flipgirl38","Null","2","6","30 April 2006"," I Felt As if I Were On That Plane.....
","United 93 will no doubt become one of the most controversial films to be released by a studio this year. It is a film that is difficult to watch in that the events that took place happened only five years ago, and for most of Americans, happened in a place no one would actually see with their own eyes. It is, in fact, a sort of surreal event most of us experienced through television and newspaper. Yet with United 93, we are put into the positions of the air traffic controllers and the passengers themselves as they go on about trying to de esculate the situation that would become 9/11.<br/><br/>The camera is a first person point of view of the events that took place that day. We are never given a particular character to connect with, instead connecting in unison with all Americans with the events that unfold during that tragic day. Greengrass edits this film with precision and power, smoothly flowing from one air traffic control tower to another, as the controllers try desperately to understand the hijackings taking place. These shots are inter cut with the passengers on board United 93, not knowing the events that have begun to unfold, even before they take off.<br/><br/>The experience of watching this film is intense, and quite difficult to watch in many areas, yet I found it hard to turn away from what was unfolding on screen. The camera boards the plane as if it were just any other passenger, quietly observing the small talk, the flight attendants carrying on about their jobs, the pilots preparing for their flight. We see the terrorists calmly seated in first class, knowing what is to happen within a few minutes, yet being unable to stop them from carrying out their murderous plans.<br/><br/>By the time we see the actual take over of the flight by the terrorists, the WTC have already been attacked, the fear on display in that plane is so overwhelming, and so real, I didn't know what to think. The messages to loved ones by the airline phones broke my heart, yet we never hear or see the other side of the line. We wouldn't if we were actually on the plane, so why would we in this film? The rebellion is heart pounding, and before you can blink, the film ends, and you remain in your seat, heart pounding, hands shaking, and in total shock of what had been witnessed.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass did absolutely amazing work with this picture. Using no name actors in the roles of the passengers and the air traffic controllers made the film more real and that much more of an experience. It doesn't sentimentalize the events that took place, nor does it become judgmental or linear. It was a day of grand confusion and fear, and Greengrass was able to take his camera and quietly observe the chaos that took place that day.<br/><br/>United 93 is not an easy film to witness, and I don't recommend everyone to watch it because of its subject matter. But if you feel emotionally strong enough to witness these events, I whole heartedly recommend this picture. Very few times can film be considered an actual work of art. I consider this to be one among the few.<br/><br/>HIGHLY Recommended.<br/><br/>MJR"

","I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I decided to go see this movie. I knew that if it was accurate it would be great, and that was more than true in my opinion. Having read the 9/11 commission report, as well as other federal documents on Flight 93, and listening to the phone conversations online, I would have to say that this movie is about as real as you can get in a documentary/style film. The actors looked very similar to the real victims of this tragedy, and I firmly believe that since the film was made with the help of some of the people who experienced the tragedy, it was even better than it would have been. United 93 is a movie that will hit you deep inside. No matter what political affiliation you are, this film will remind you of the sacrifices that these men and women made, and life's true value. 9/11 affected us all in one way or another, some more than others. United 93 is fitting in every way, and is definitely a film everyone should see. A lot of people, especially on the east coast, are saying that it is too early for a movie about September 11. I ask you this then. If it is too early for a film of this matter, then why did the victims families and friends of flight 93 help out with getting the film right? This film is about heroism. The bravery, courage, and selfless-service that those men and women endured on Flight 93, and to have the courage to fight back is a quality that every American should have, and remember.<br/><br/>I end this post with the famous words from one of my biggest role models and heroes, Flight 93's Todd Beamer. ""Ok Guys. Are You Ready? Let's Roll!"" God Bless America 9-11-01 - WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER"

","The morning of September 11, 2001 will remain in the memories of all Americans for the remainder of time. The terrorist attack against the US was one of the most haunting acts ever seen by this country. For those families who give forth the information for the making of United 93, God Bless you and your loved one(s). I believe that the making of this film will not only share the stories and the impact felt by all on 9/11 - but, also teach those who didn't directly experience, as well as educate future generations who did not experience the horror of 9/11. United 93, a very dramatic, suspenseful, and orchestrated film based on the attacks on the US on September 11, has been directed well, and the detail in the film is remarkable. At times, as I feel the film was intended to do, YOU feel as though YOU are on the plane with all of the victims of terror. The suspense that builds up throughout the film, the dramatizing that was recreated, gave a very clear view as to what happened that bright, sunny Friday morning. Very good film, I recommend it to everyone to see, taking its rating of R into consideration. This movie is very dramatized and visual, showing many direct shots of what took place, blood, death, etc. Do see it!"
"dust-7","Null","2","6","30 April 2006"," Documentary style - but a bit too film-school
","This film will move you for what certain points in the film symbolize. We know how it ends, yes. But I confess to a tear as the final cards rolled explaining what happened, in brief. The same about midway through the film as they were about to cut to the 93 cabin, even in the boarding area as the terrorists sit right next to the other passengers.<br/><br/>There are flaws in the film-making. The Blair Witch tussle-with-the-camera 'realism' is slightly overdone at the FAA center when the goofy and incompetent Air Force liaison is brought in at one point. There's one or two other points in the film, as well. The 'realism' is also had by some improv, and people stumbling over their lines, just 'as in real life'. But it doesn't play in film, in my opinion. Dirty Harry, NYPD Blue, had this sort of indy camera work. But the actors crisply delivered their lines, without stumbling over them. And that made for 'realism'. People know that these, and this movie, are a staged show - lights, camera, action. That's exactly what you don't want to remind them. They should not necessarily have scripted more. I mean, Sliney (not mentioned in IMDb cast list as of 30 APR 2006) knew what he said and did at the time. That's fine. But he and others should have run through the delivery at bit, first; a couple of takes at least. It takes one out of the film when the gal at Northwest Air Defense (NEADS), who is always feeding the officers bad info, seems to almost be looking into the camera as she muffs her lines.<br/><br/>The first bit of the film, people boarding 93, the cuts to the FAA center and NEADS, really do have a documentary feel. You can suspend disbelief. Every now and then, these problems, just mentioned, pop right before you on the screen. But the bit before they really concentrate on the cabin drama is interesting, and sickening really. NEADS is portrayed as being just completely clueless. The FAA is on top of things. And local flight controllers, more like the military, just can't seem to believe what they are seeing and hearing in the transmissions. Everything just happens so fast that bureaucracy is slow to act. Some behave, as we're led to believe they actually did, as if they had all day to make decisions.<br/><br/>So Air Defense has an air 'scenario' planned for that day, up in the North Atlantic. Plenty of planes to go. But there are no planes in the air. When completely misinformed about what is going on, they still turn on the TV to see CNN broadcasting the smoke from the first WTC tower. And they are told - that's a small plane. They cut to Sliney at FAA and he says - look at that damage. There's no way that's a small aircraft. Where's our American 11? Umm . . that has to be American 11. I don't know the actual story. But according to Sliney, the FAA didn't miss a beat. So in real life, if that's the truth, the military was clueless because the FAA relied upon this incompetent liaison who seemed not to know what to do without his papers to push and pen nearby. The fact is, it didn't occur to anyone at FAA to simply pick up the phone, and call NEADS. Sliney - this is Sliney. We're convinced that's American 11 in the side of the WTC. We're tracking up to ten other possible hijacks at this very minute (they brought out a white board in the control center, and began listing suspicious flights). What are you going to do? But he never made that call. Heck with the liaison. Get him another another donut and some coffee, and make the call yourself.<br/><br/>So they get to the plane. The cockpit door is pretty much swinging open all the time. But when the hijackers do attack, the door is closed. They force a stewardess to give the 'secret knock', co-pilot opens the door, and he's attacked and wounded with a knife. The captain, with his lunch tray over his lap, fights back with his arms. But he's quickly done. And the stu is killed. The terrorists get control of the plunging aircraft. And two others herd the passengers, and other stewardesses, to the back of coach, but not before attacking one or two that had been in first class, sitting with them.<br/><br/>The reason these passengers hesitate is because they imagine that the hijackers will just land in Cuba, or something. And they'll be freed. One man insists on that explanation. And he's just not going to be wrong. Apparently he's in this scenario because he, too, was on a phone. Ultimately, Greenglass has the passengers literally putting this know-it-all down, before they rush the two hijackers in the coach cabin. The other reason they hesitate is because one hijacker appears to have plastic explosive rigged to some lantern batteries, which was probably also described in phone calls. Turns out, the explosive is just modeling clay. But that holds them in check.<br/><br/>Finally they make the rush, first getting the modeling clay guy. Then they get this kid who viciously had been attacking passengers with his knife. He goes down. Then with the cart they literally start poking holes in the cockpit door. They are about to break through when the co-pilot terrorist crashes the plane into the field.<br/><br/>It's the story of the passenger's selfless heroism; and dueling religions in the film, as the passengers resort to Hail Marys and Our Fathers, and the terrorists their prayers to Allah. Some might give a bad review to the film because it might be seen to encourage resolve in Afganistan, and Iraq. And that's not their politics. While the film is flawed, it's a film worth seeing, as many of the passenger's families have recommended."
"heartstorm","10","2","6","30 April 2006"," An excellent source movie
","If you hoped to forever forget how you felt on September 11, 2001, do not go to see United 93.<br/><br/>From the beginning, United 93 walks you through the events that changed the world that day. And rather than treat the events is a sappy manner, the filmmakers opted for a more Sergeant Friday ""just the facts"" approach while not forsaking drama.<br/><br/>There are no assignable heroes in this movie. What we see are people on the ground and in the sky who assume leadership roles and do what is necessary for those moments in time. The phrase ""let's roll,"" which became emblazoned on our minds post-911, is as underplayed for the viewer as it likely was on the plane that day.<br/><br/>The movie avoids being politically correct as well yet offers us no political commentary either. The terrorists who hijacked United 93 are portrayed as devout without being completely dehumanized. There's anxiousness and hesitancy along side the strange devotion to their God and their mission; a devotion which wins out as they yell ""Allah Ackbar"" before carrying out their heinous acts. In short, there's no doubt left that these men are Muslim, yet the film draws no conclusions for us about either Muslims nor Islam in general.<br/><br/>Absent from the film is the tendency to overstate the hero status of the passengers and crew of United 93. The movie successfully contrasts two groups: the terrorists who gain control of the plane in order to die for their mission and those passengers and crew who fight to live. The contrast is a reminder that heroes aren't heroes because they want to die, rather, they're heroes because they value life.<br/><br/>The chaos of the day is also clearly portrayed without raising the cliché questions which have politicized the event. Replayed are the first few hours. Like most Americans that day, those watching the movie miss the first strike. By the time the second tower is hit we have gotten an insiders' look at how things work in air traffic control and we realize that hindsight is always 20/20 and September 11, 2001 is no exception to that rule.<br/><br/>Stunned silence on the screen as the second tower is struck was mimicked by other movie goers. And the decision to land all planes comes off as a brave decision deserving of cheers.<br/><br/>Yet the flaws of that day are equally and painfully obvious: the military and FAA lacked cooperation; there were confusing reports (at first it was assumed that a small aircraft hit the first tower); etc.<br/><br/>The most redeeming quality of United 93 was the ""resistance"" scene. We know the end to come, and yet we're left to admire, and even feel like cheering on, those who fought back on the plane that day. Which leaves one asking oneself: What would I have done?"

You get a very good view of the emotions and actions that the writer perceives the hijackers to have had. You see the same thing in all the people who were on the flight. The insight into what happens at the ARTCCs at each major air center was very realistic. Fear everywhere. Interesting political commentary is weaved into this movie. It would be virtually impossible to leave this movie without having been moved, having thought a little deeper, and having realized that you too have the power to be extraordinary, just as the people on the flight were truly courageous.

To name just three: combining actors with real characters portraying themselves, employing a close-as-possible real-time time-line (Real-time Terror, 01 April 2006, Film Journal) and keeping the actors portraying the terrorists apart from the rest of the cast during rehearsals and until filming (Interview with Lloyd Levin, 28 April 2006, The Michael Medved Show).

The movie in my opinion was done in good taste, not over the top since much of what happened is purely speculation. Paul Greengrass had permission from each victims family members and had his crew interview each family extensively so the victims would be portrayed as true to life as possible. My only complaint is the constant motion of the camera, I would guess it was done in this way to give a ""chaotic"" feel or maybe to have it seem more like a documentary.

I am an airline pilot and was horrified by the act of the first officer (co-pilot) that opened the door without looking through the peep hole after ""the flight attendant"" knocked.

","Films about tragic events that everyone knows about, don't always paint the subject matter with seriousness or caution. However, United 93 did an excellent job on telling a story about an event in that day in history. Greengrass' directing was spot on. The characters were richly portrayed and believable. It also doesn't slow down on the intensity and chaotic scramble of events as it gives a realistic feel in the process"
"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","2","2 September 2019"," United 93 is one biographical memorial that soars over any and all genre tropes.
","Any feature tackling the events of 9/11 is surrounded by a thin line that when crossed, ventures into the realms of sensationalising a tragic event for entertainment purposes. It's a difficult subject to tackle, and one that needs to be conveyed from a semi-neutral perspective that prevents any glorification of certain individuals without substantial evidence. That being said, the hijacking scenario that took place aboard United Airlines Flight 93, a plane temporarily controlled by al-Qaeda terrorists intending to crash into US Capitol, is one of the most challenging narratives available.<br/><br/>The inevitability of its outcome serves as a harrowing depiction that showcases human nature at its most desperate. The passengers, acknowledging the suicidal exploitation, exerting one final desperate surge for survival. The terrorists, controlled radically by religion, performing disciplined actions predominated by extremism. The flight control employees chaotically coming to terms with the country's vulnerability and inability to provide national security. Several heightened perspectives, combined together in a symphony of technical flawlessness, that never at any one point resorts to Hollywood sensationalism.<br/><br/>This, is Greengrass' greatest achievement. Whether you appreciate his erratic control of the camera and clinical approach to worldly situations or not, his literary interpretation of the proceeding events, both in the air and on the ground, is so technically assured that it is almost impossible to criticise. Producing sobering thrills from simply analysing at an air traffic radar monitor is nothing short of outstanding, and the nullifying effect Greengrass creates is not a result of his astute direction. It's the inevitability of this tragedy. Witnessing the flight number ""AA11"" abruptly disappear, without showing any dramatisation of the impact, is what sends chills down the spine. Observing the traffic controllers and military personnel come to terms with the attacks beckons to our own reminiscence of when we ourselves watched the events unfold back in '01. Such intelligence is utilised to depict the background chaos, that it never once disrupts the distressing urgency of the film's purpose.<br/><br/>Everyone will remember the World Trade Centre attacks, some may recall the Pentagon blast, but how many of you honestly remember the United 93 flight? News coverage can only cover so much in such a heightened time of turmoil, which is why this biographical drama is so important. It doesn't just retell the events, using footage from that very morning. It shows the very best and very worst of humanity.<br/><br/>With the cooperation of all the passengers' families, Greengrass managed to produce a subtle level of sympathy and empowerment in well under two hours. The earnest phone calls home as passengers plead their love one final time. The surge of togetherness for that one last push, in spite of the unlikely chance of survival. And aside from the portrayal of Christian Adams, a German passenger who received minimal development and therefore came across as desperately appeasing as opposed to methodical (which was a questionable choice to say the least), every single passenger was portrayed delicately and lovingly. Powell's score also accompanies the ensuing drama with a visceral amount of palpable tension.<br/><br/>United 93 is not entertaining. If you want to watch a mildly enjoyable film and dismiss the extremities of reality, put on 'Shrek' or something. This, is real. This is harrowingly depressing. But most profoundly, this is important. With Greengrass commanding every single frame to technical perfection, United 93 will leave you breathless."

","This is why Paul Greengrass is one of my favourite directors. We all know what happened to United 93, but the tension never went away for a second. The last fifteen minutes is so frustratingly intense. I say frustratingly because we know that the passengers don't save the plane. I even felt angry for most of the film because it felt like I was in the plane, feeling the desperation of the passengers and the hatred towards the terrorists, even though we know next to nothing about the characters.<br/><br/>The scene where the ATCs spot the second plane coming from the right and slamming into the tower was just so powerful because Greengrass' directing made it feel like I was in the tower, like the ATCs, watching the plane hit the building for the first time. I felt my muscles tense as I, in a way, prepared for the impact of the plane.<br/><br/>Just wow. Incredibly powerful. I want to say I ""loved"" it but it's hard to, given the subject of the film."

","I was a little doubtful of wanting to anticipate watch a movie that sparked fear and sadness not just to the United States, but all over the world (even here in Canada) about the tragic plane crashes of the September 11, terrorist attacks. ""United 93"" takes us on the painful journey to United Flight 93 as it was scheduled to take off from Newark to San Francisco, but instead landed in field just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The plane had no survivors. It feel like this tragic events happened yesterday when it was actually 12 years ago. To this day I asked myself the harrowing question. Was anyone prepared for something like this to happen? I still felt reluctant of going to see it and I don't think every inch of this tragedy can be fleshed out in just two hours.<br/><br/>But after much debate, I had the bravery to watch ""United 93"". Lots of things happened that day that changed the lives of others, me included. The world was in fear, shock and sadness. And the unity within our brotherhood never felt so stronger. So off I went to see the movie and I said to myself if this movie becomes a forceful tear-jerker or exploitive, I would walk out.<br/><br/>Well from my observation I didn't see any scenes that were a rip-off and or making a salary at the expense of many civilians who were killed in one of the most tragic events in modern history. I was even heart struck when I read somewhere that the proceeds would be funded to family members whose loved ones died on that tragic day. A selfless act like this does not happen everyday.<br/><br/>The characters portrayed in the film, passengers, crew, air controllers, and grief-stricken families were performed with class and compassion. I think the most challenging performance were the actors who played the terrorists and the responses they got after the film was released. Director Paul Greengrass left no stone unturned to recreating this event and making every scene kept real and all the while refraining it from being over-the-top in dramatization or any kind of awkward performances. The research done in making this movie was researched through people who were working and received calls from crew who were on board Flight 93, recordings on cell phones, and data recordings. Mr. Greengrass was doing his homework when he made this movie.<br/><br/>If you remember, it was a sad day for all humankind. You might remember what you doing on that day. And at some point you feel like a jerk just sitting there watching the stuff happen on the screen. This movie makes you want to get off your chair and get involved and help these people out. The patrons on this aircraft are just average folks like us, going to some destination. This movie pays homage to people committing selfless acts to save one another's lives and to show that humanity is out there.<br/><br/>As an order of precaution to younger viewers watching, be advised that there's a lot of heavy violence, very loud scenes, ruthless actions and profanity happens in this movie. Therefore, just watch this movie with care and see for yourself what this movie brings to you."

","Almost everyone has an idea of how this film is gonna end but what director Paul Greengrass has done in between the opening & closing credits here is what makes United 93 a truly devastating & unforgettable cinematic experience. Featuring an unknown cast of actors to make the drama more plausible & to provide it with a documentary feel, the film is crafted with great eye for detail & recounts the horror event that shook the entire world with unflinching accuracy.<br/><br/>United 93 is the story about the 4th hijacked plane on the doomed September 11 morning which was the only flight that failed to reach its intended target. After collecting detailed accounts from the victims' families, the cast & crew here try to recreate the entire event when passengers on-board this jinxed airplane put up a fight for not only their lives but for thousands of others who wouldn't be alive today if the hijackers had managed to make it to their target.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Paul Greengrass' United 93 can be argued for trying to cash in on a sensitive subject matter that's still fresh in the minds of people who lived to witness that tragic day but what's absolutely heartwarming to see here is that Greengrass has treated its delicate content with utmost respect and the whole film is an unflinching, gut-wrenching, emotionally traumatic & moving cinema dedicated in memory of everyone who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Thoroughly recommended."

","This review is dedicated to the heroes of flight United 93 who gave everything to save others. Rest in Peace and God bless. I never cry during movies, never, unless it is a true story or based highly off a true story. I have seen United 93 a few times and every single time I try to fight the tears, but they come out. I love this movie not for what it's about but for what it is. This is based on real events with real people and some people who were actually involved with 9/11 are in this movie, and that just makes it that much better.<br/><br/>9/11 is the biggest tragedy in American history, in my opinion. I was in 1st grade and I had no idea what was going on. A few years ago I watched at least 10 History Channel specials on 9/11 and I was fascinated. I don't really believe in the conspiracy behind the attack, but I'm not going to talk about that. Back to the movie, it starts with the terrorists who hijacked United 93 praying and shaving in their hotel room. That was their ritual or something, they did what they believed was right, and now their burning in hell. There are some subtleties in this movie. The pilot and copilot are talking about their future plans and the audience just has this uncomfortable feeling because you know this doesn't happen. It's hard to watch this movie knowing everybody dies. <br/><br/>The flight takes off from there the events are in control of the director because nobody knows what really happened. The director also focuses on the flight control people from New York and Boston, I think. There were so many it was hard to follow. I just listened for the accents. Slowly, the tragedy unfolds. We get the first few hijackings and the first plane crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. From then, chaos ensues. Most of these people played themselves in the movie and basically recreated what happened in the movie, and wow, the audience sees how confused these people were and they really had no idea what was going on. They did all they could but America was really rendered useless. They tried to contact the terrorists, planes were appearing, disappearing, then reappearing. The audience then sees the second plane crash into the tower and then everybody realized that America was under attack. <br/><br/>I loved seeing the chaos in the control rooms and what America was trying to do to deal with this problem. We almost resulted to shooting down these commercial planes. The White House and Capitol Building were evacuated. The Sears Tower in Chicago was evacuated. Meanwhile, United 93 passengers were just casually eating breakfast completely unaware of the world around them. The only thing I could think was that this was their last meal, and tears started flowing. Every scene in the plane was just so emotional, between everyone saying goodbye to loved ones, to the terrorists being anxious and struggling to maintain control. I'm glad the movie didn't focus on the World Trade Centers and we didn't see them collapsing. This movie is about United 93 and what happened on that plane. Possibly the best part of the movie is that there are no major actors involved. There are a few 9/11 movie with big name stars in them and it is a different feeling. These actors are all nobodies and that is how it needs to be. It shows how these regular people took matters into their own hands and risked everything. These passengers are heroes and how they realized they were in danger by what their loved ones have told them. Unfortunately the plane ended up crashing in a field in Pennsylvania and there were no survivors. This isn't a spoiler, it's just history and everybody probably knows this. The last scene is the passengers attacking the cockpit and killing two of the four hijackers. They try to take control of the plane but the last shot is the plane going down into the ground. The ground gets closer and closer and the music gets more and more intense and then it just ends, black screen, a soft chorus, and information about 9/11 comes on the screen, then cue the credits. Overall, United 93 is an emotional roller-coaster and really depicts the events of 9/11 really well. It was horrible but in a day of darkness there was a small glimpse of sunlight. These people took matters into their own hands and even though they didn't survive, they made the terrorists fail in their mission and made that day that much less horrible. It was assumed the plane was going towards Washington and thanks to the passengers of United 93, that did not happen. This movie has my respect and should not be judged with an award or a seal of approval. It should stand on its own and be what it is. See this move and appreciate how America stood strong n the face of terrorism. Again, this review is dedicated to Flight 93 and all of its passengers and passengers who lost their lives, along with every other American who lost their lives on 9/11/01."
"jnelso19","9","1","2","1 January 2013"," A Hard Topic to Tackle on the Big Screen
","One thing that can be mutually agreed upon for anyone who was sadly a part of this tragedy is that it's never the right time to make movies like this. Whether it's a movie about Pearl Harbor or the Rwandan Genocide, someone is going to be disturbed, upset etc. about the material portrayed on screen. So when Mr. Greengrass decided to make a film this early about 9/11 was going to shake some people up. Sadly to say, there is no need for spoilers for this film since we all know the sad ending for these people just trying to travel. Anyway, what makes this film great isn't the material that was presented but rather the taste that Greengrass used when presenting it. He contacted the victims families and worked with the ones that returned his calls in order to present the characters in the most realistic ways possible. You'll notice the biggest name in the cast is the man who played Tom Burnett who won an Emmy for Boston Legal. This makes the film all the better, you can see where these actors could easily be one of us. Something that Oliver Stone failed to do with World Trade Center. Greengrass also did a great job by simply replaying the events as they unfolded instead of creating a faux storyline to throw in (even though the German character was more than likely exaggerated to say the least). He brought in the people who were actually there and had them tell their story rather then hiring a bunch of actors to just guess. Hell it gave one person an opportunity to work in Hollywood in the future (watch the Green Zone and you'll see who exactly it was). Even then, Greengrass used his Bourne style of filmmaking to keep us at the edge of our seats. You know how the film ends before it even begins and you still believe that things will turn for the better. That's all Greengrass and if it wasn't for The Departed, Babel and the 5 film rule, this would've been nominated for an Oscar. Just a great film that could've been treated with a lot less respect, considering that it was not written by an American (Greengrass is British to those that don't know), but it was treated with all the respect that these heroes deserve.<br/><br/>To All Haters: This film isn't meant to do anything more then just tell a story. Unlike Michael Moore who has a blatant liberal agenda (and an extra hundred lbs. he can afford to lose, politics and his lawsuits aside), Greengrass just wants to show what happened on 9/11, no more no less. This is something that should be appreciated in a Hollywood where an agenda is always evident (no matter what issue, but there's always one). <br/><br/>RIP to all those lost on 9/11. No time passed, war, or movie can bring back those lost so the best thing we can do as humans is to learn from history and try and better ourselves as a race."

","United 93 took place on flight United 93 and counted down to its demise on September 11, 2001. A topic most writers jump through hoops to avoid. United 93 personally touched my heart and gave me emotions of extreme melancholy. It flawlessly describes the tragedy that the events during 9/11 were. I wouldn't say It was uplifting because in my opinion it wasn't, it was dark, senseless, tragic, and awful. However, the heroism of the passengers seemed quite impressive and uplifting, until you find out their lives ended so abruptly. You will feel for the characters, due to the fact that they died for no apparent reason, however, they did sacrifice their lives in order to protect the lives of thousands of other people. So in the end I say United 93 is by far one of the most emotional 9/11 movies out there, its beautiful, well acted, well directed and bold (topic wise). 10 out of 10"
"hellraiser7","10","1","2","12 November 2012"," Darkest Day
","For me it all started with silent discovery, I'll never forget the sick sinking feeling I had when I saw the broadcast on one of th towers that were just hit, and that sinking feeling kept going down more and more as the situation developed and got worse, at the time I knew that something terrible in human history has occurred and nothing will ever be the same again. Is it too soon to make a movie about this someone once said, my personal opinion no it's not because we must honor and ever forget it.<br/><br/>The film was all honest and real like were actually seeing a documentary. Everything in it takes place in real time and really gives you that feeling like your right there as everything is slowly but surely unfolding. We see the frantic pacing and struggle as controllers to get things under control which most of it turns out to be fruitless as things are falling apart. But most of all further in the movie we are totally involved with what is currently happening in United 93 as the terrorists start making their move.<br/><br/>It was a great idea that unknowns were used in the film some of them were experienced actors that you might have seen on TV or films. And most of there aren't even actors. Everyone looks like ordinary regular people and that helps because everyone in that flight were ordinary people like yo and me. The terrorists in the film, what makes them frightening is how human they seem, their scared and hesitant in what their about to do but know they have to do it, these people really believe in what their doing but it's a blind devotion and through their eyes their completely devoid of human soul; much like how cult members in Jonestown followed a false religion to the bitter end. Do I hate them, I won't answer that because I can only truly hate a person for trespasses committed against me or others that are innocent that I know or don't know, but what these guys did is completely unforgivable in my book.<br/><br/>As we see the ongoing action we feel may things as things start to happen; Fear, shock, anger, dread, and sadness which was everything I felt from the first discovery. The them in the film is not just about remembering what happened but about true heroism in the face of danger. There are two forms of heroism shown both silent and aggressive. The passengers, we don't really get to know but through their actions that most of them are putting into action with silent ingenuity opening lines of communicating by using the airline phones. We see them constantly calling their relatives or anyone else to relay news about what is going on and started to realize something must be done and now. And so we see everyone getting together, organizing a group, orient themselves in the very little time they have, and come up with a quick plan of attack. We see even more acts of silent heroism one woman passes out of the eye of one of the terrorists a phone to a fellow passenger so the passenger can call her family. another is when one passenger runs quickly toward a bathroom stall to call 911. Their doing these things because their the only things they can do for survival and know there is a possibility they might not get through it they at least have to try. Those scenes when we heard the passengers talk to their families and friends telling them good bye and that they love them, made my heart bleed.<br/><br/>At the end I couldn't help but cry, feeling that sense of powerlessness knowing I couldn't help them or why they couldn't survive.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"tendobear","10","1","2","8 November 2012"," Intense
","Infuriated, confused and scared - these are just some of the emotions that I had after watching the movie, which I'm sure were just some of the emotions director Paul Greengrass was trying to instill in the viewer. Greengrass really captured the realism, the fear, and the panic of the United 93 in a taut, intense and compact 111 minutes, which is much less time needed by most films these days to even reach the final act. Greengrass' use of hand-held camera does 2 things: one, brings the viewer into the action, so you feel like you're watching events unfold from their point of view. Two, the shaky camera enhances the feelings of confusion and fear. Interestingly, an entire cast of unknowns helps to underline the point that the passengers were all strangers to each other (and to us), but as the movie progresses a few of the passengers really stand out and you know them as ""the guy with the cap"" or ""the woman with the glasses"", which is pretty realistic if you think about it: in times of desperation and intense pressure, you probably won't go through the proper introductions and you'll bond with each other and recognise each other by appearance. United 93 was an incredibly smart and taut treatise on the terrible and ill-fated flight; it doesn't take sides or point fingers, but it does try to tell an honest and brave story from all perspectives."
"mjg32","8","1","2","25 October 2007"," Well done
","Well done Paul Greengrass.<br/><br/>United 93 is a superbly well made film, especially coming into its own during the terrorist attack sequences. The last half hour is very intense, and Greengrass has created a fully believable, documentary style account of flight 93. Having a full cast of unknowns also helps with the believability factor; and the shaky hand camera that got so much criticism after The Bourne Supremacy really is wonderfully used here.<br/><br/>Okay, there are some truly awful lines of dialogue, but I do feel harsh pointing that out - because a lot of effort has clearly been made on this film. But this isn't about talking, its more of an experience.<br/><br/>The people who criticise United 93, seem to because they think films should not be made about this kind of thing. The same happened to Schindler's List. Seeing as movies are a hugely popular culture, surely there isn't any better way to educate people on these matters. Greengrass clearly didn't make this for entertainment or to make money, this was a tribute to everyone involved during 9/11, and a very good one at that."

","I was only 11 at the time of the terrorist plane crashes, and although at the time I remember being transfixed to the t.v after school (and with time differences, the events had all ready mostly happened by then - ) the shock never hit me, as I was an 11 year old kid who had never even heard of the Twin Towers before. I've of course learnt lots since then, but the events of September 11th have sometimes faded into a political mire.<br/><br/>This film was fantastic as it brought the events rushing to my mind and my heart properly for the first time. I actually shed a tear at its conclusion, and I don't do that very often. I recommend this to anyone who wants a film that will make them remember and think - it is nothing to do with politics, pro-Americanism, anti-Americanism it is just simply a tale of heroism and tragedy.<br/><br/>The only minor quibble I have is the rumoured role of the ""coward"" German - something which I really hope was not intentional as it would mire what was otherwise an account completely neutral to the political debates which followed."

","but this movie was still entertaining. I liked how in the beginning we get a perspective of what the terrorists were going through as they prepared to take their own lives. The actions depicted on the airplane seemed reasonable with what could have happened. Once the hijacked the terrorists over take the cockpit in a very brutal fashion. All the passengers are sequestered at the back of the plane. They make phone calls and find out what has been going on with the world trade center. The high point is when the passengers decide they must try to overtake the hijackers. Unfortunately, we already know the outcome and that they did not have enough time to save the plane.<br/><br/>I also liked the idea of showing what went on in the air traffic control rooms across the country. There were confused as to how many planes were hijacked and the military seemed to be disorganized. They couldn't get a straight answer from anyone in the beginning.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing. Tells a worth while story of true events that are still emotional watching."

","A responsible adult carries the duties and trials of his or her world; day in, day out, day after day. When it comes to watching a movie I want to be entertained. I stay away from ""catharsis"" movies where you have to feel bad to feel better. Quite naturally I think, I feel better when I smile. I cannot define this movie as either cathartic or entertaining. If it is fair to classify there being a higher level of movie making, this film could be the standard. It brings to life a horrific event and it brings the event home. These figures from the nightly news became real people to me. They became my neighbors. They became family. I felt pride and hurt. I grieved for their loss. It enlarged my heart and reminded me of a resolve I had already made (and too often forget) to be a better human being. This film should not have been rated R. How can a film that should be shown in every high school be given an R rating? One thing that has been hard to shake after seeing this film is how much garbage comes from the entertainment world. I don't think I was aware that a movie like this could be made, but now that I know it can, I want more."
"sagecrane","9","1","2","13 March 2007"," Exceptional realism
","I was very impressed with United 93...it was not at all what I expected; it was like watching a documentary, especially as many of the people in supporting roles were 'real' (non-actor) people, and some had actually been there, (in the Air traffic control rooms etc.) on 9-11. I watched it a second time, with the commentary. Very good. My only criticism, and it is probably one that will cause some irritation, is that in the commentary the director NEVER mentions the very fine actors who played the roles of the terrorists. I would also like to have seen some brief interviews with them in the special features. It would be extremely interesting (to me) to know how they, as actors, and men of Middle Eastern background, felt about the roles, the whole situation, and the movie. I came to IMDb to at least find out their names. Why are they ignored? They did a great job, playing horrific roles. I give them credit, given everything that transpired, it must have taken a lot of courage to take those parts."

","There are milestones in history, days when the word changed, when tomorrow was a different world than yesterday. June 28, 1914 - start of WWI. September 3, 1939 - start of WWII. 9/11 - arguably start of WWIII.<br/><br/>The story of 9/11 only starts being reinvented by Hollywood. What is for sure is that it will look different than the 9/11 that we all lived through. This is why I appreciate even more a film like 'United 93' which does not try to present an embellished story, does not play on patriotic or even politic chords, uses actors whose faces are as anonymous as the faces you can see in a real airport, and catches not the spectacular but the human dimension of the event. The characters in the movie are people like us, who are caught in a moment of craziness of history. They all behave like human and not like superheroes, they fear, they pray, they cry for their loved ones. Even the terrorists are veridical, they have fear, the sweat an pray - just human on the wrong side of history.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass' previous movie 'The Bourne Supremacy' was a imaginary thriller almost hard to watch because of the nervous cut in very short sequences, which intended to create a dynamics of its own in the minds of the viewers. What did not work well there works pretty good in the real-life thriller 'United 93', and combined with hand-held camera gives a feeling of authenticity to one of the best docu-drama that I have seen lately."

","United 93 was the first movie released that dared tackle the all-too-sensitive subject of September 11th. It went under an immense amount of controversy; some felt that it was too soon to release a film about such a horrific national tragedy. Despite the initial criticism, however, United 93 manages to handle such a delicate subject gracefully and poignantly, creating a unique cinematic experience that is nearly impossible to rival.<br/><br/>United 93 tells the powerful and emotional story of the only hijacked flight on September 11th that failed to reach its intended target. The film switches between air traffic controllers and the passengers/crew of the ill-fated flight. The film delves into the human experiences aboard the flight in a tasteful manner: instead of relying on big-budget effects shots as one might expect for such a massive event, director Paul Greengrass effectively uses a documentary-style approach, creating an unparalleled sense of realism that deeply adds to the emotional punch this film offers.<br/><br/>This film literally gave me chills. It's suspenseful, heartbreaking, and emotional at the same time. You'll forget you're watching a movie during it: the actors and the crew have collaborated beautifully to created a unique experience that will haunt you for a long time afterwards. This film is certainly not one to be missed by anyone.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 (Excellent)"
"fwomp","8","1","2","26 September 2006"," Good Flick But Plays On Recent Emotions
","This could be the toughest review I've ever written. Being a born-and-bred American, I have a few protective sensibilities regarding my home country. When 9/11 happened, I was just as stunned, fearful, and outraged as most of my fellow countrymen, I'm sure. And watching a film related to those events only a few short years after that dreadful day, I could feel those same emotions smoldering within me. Trying to objectively rate this film based solely on its merits becomes a bit sticky, simply because that emotional scar is still so fresh. But I'll do my best.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about UNITED 93 is that it's filmed using hand-held cameras, giving the viewer an intimate sense that they are an active party within the movie. This is most effective when we're on the plane (for reasons stated earlier) and get to witness all of the passengers' interactions with each other and the hijackers. The other excellent part is that there isn't one star that we follow, nor are there any big name actors/actresses in the film. Every person is just as important as the next. I applaud director Greengrass' script interpretation and this seldom used method of filming.<br/><br/>Another admirable item is that the film shows us how off-guard the FAA and the military was immediately following the hijackings. As the movie moves between the FAA headquarters and the military's interactions with these public offices, we get to witness the incredible chaos that ensued and feel the frustrations as they try to figure out which planes are risks, what to do about them, who has the authority to shoot them down (if need be), and the unavailability of President Bush.<br/><br/>The big issues with the movie will obviously be very personal. Each individual will probably feel differently about it. Mine were of manipulation. Since this is still a fresh memory in the minds of most Americans (including my own), I felt as though the film makers were trying to feed off of those memories. This isn't as horrible as it sounds, though. Some of the best films play with our feelings. The risk here, however, is what we do with them. Do we continue to fear? Or hate? Or do we learn from these experiences and move ahead? This film won't give you the answers to those questions, which is both a strength and one hell of a flaw.

","For someone that experienced 9/11 in America, watching this movie made me experience a ""panic attach"" outside the movie theater after the movie was over.<br/><br/>I was crying and sobbing for a while, till I finally got a grip.<br/><br/>The movie was made in a most clever way; by having unknown actors and the way the movie was shot makes you almost believe you are watching a documentary.<br/><br/>You experience the horror as you're watching it. You believe it was real then and real now. And that's what makes it worst on you mentally.<br/><br/>It made me go back to that day, and realized how much I minimized the effect it had on me over the last five years. This film makes you experience real terror as closely as ever made by the cinema."

","It was impossible to enter the theatre without having reservations regarding Hollywood's attempts to exploit 9/11. I was relieved to see that the end-result did not succumb to crass commercialism or righteous finger-pointing; reality certainly beats fiction and this film proves it. The last 15-20 minutes kept me at the edge of my seat. The film although lacking a central character manages to convey the chaos of that particular day, the emotional ups and downs, the stress and the horror. We see the lack of preparedness of the authorities and get a glimpse of how the passengers of the particular flight responded to the hijacking. A big thank you to the people that worked to make this film and to tell the story as it probably was..."

","A good movie, not only for its entertainment value but also because of its message. We still don't know exactly everything that happened on that fateful day and we may never know, but this movie accurately portrays what we know so far in respect of this particular flight. The director did an excellent job, showing the determination and the human weakness common to us all in both the passengers and the hijackers. The relationships were accurately portrayed and tension was realistically created right to the end. Some scenes were a little drawn out in places but the overall effect was an excellent movie with a message for us all. The cast did an excellent job in accurately portraying the tensions that must have been felt by all on that plane. All in all, an excellent piece of cinematic achievement that forms part of history lesson for the future, to commemorate all who died on that fateful day."

There were no outstanding performances, just the whole thing worked together to tell the story well on one of the most shocking days in American history.<br/><br/>My wife and I were on the edge of our seats from the very beginning, and the ride didn't stop until the very last scene of the movie. We were RIVETED to the screen! We were both emotionally moved, tears, mixed with the anger and we were sure those were the reactions of many of the folks who were actually there in the places portrayed.<br/><br/>There are no ""10"" movies in my book, only very close 9's.

","This is the best movie of the year thus far. It is an incredible piece of film that everyone should see. In fact, it plays so realistic it is hard to believe there are actors up there on the screen. My knuckles were clenched white near the climax of this movie and I was so caught up in it I was stuck to my seat like cement. Go see it because it should win the Oscar for Best Picture this year.<br/><br/>The buildup in this movie is simply masterful as gradually we realize the chaos ensuing as America's skies are under attack. It is such a shocking revelation that such a thing could happen here. Then the terrorists intentions are revealed as CNN shows the footage of the World Trade Center and we are shocked again. When the camera rolls to the scene on Flight 93, the real suspense builds, for I myself, was unaware of the outcome of the flight. My hat goes off to Mr. Greengrass for managing to place me in the passenger seat of that flight and make me feel so much compassion and shock at the outcome. A simply unforgettable movie that shows respect for the subject matter."
"DonFishies","8","1","2","12 September 2006"," A magnificent and harrowing film experience that is essential viewing for anyone
","Over five years after that horrific day, the world still is being influenced and changed as a result of 9/11. It was only a matter of time before a Hollywood studio would greenlight a film specifically about the event (instead of just letting scripts trickle in with blatant mentions of the event). And so, this year would be marked with two interesting takes on the event: one from veteran Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, and one from relatively inexperienced British director Peter Greengrass. I have yet to see Stone's film, but as you can probably already tell, I was very impressed with Greengrass' film.<br/><br/>Greengrass has done what most filmmakers and studios would almost never even dream of doing. He has written and directed a film with a cast of relatively unknown and/or inexperienced actors, to help dramatize the events that took place on September 11, 2001, in real time. Starting out on the terrorists preparations for the act, the film then transports us to the airport terminal and all of the characters either boarding or waiting to board Flight United 93 to San Francisco. What proceeds is a mix of footage from both the flight itself, and from the air traffic control stations at various airports across the United States.<br/><br/>What makes this film so unique is the fact that besides a few phone calls and radio transmissions, there is really no hard facts about what exactly happened on Flight 93 that day. Greengrass has managed to use this fact to his advantage, and has written out a fictional basis of events based groundly in the actual known facts. While the set-up to the actual terrorist take-over of the plane is not exactly too exciting, the moments afterwards are absolutely fascinating to watch. Everything you may or may not have heard about happening on that plane plays out in truly dramatic fashion, and it strikes just the right chords at just the right moments. Seeing these almost completely unrecognizable actors give absolutely heartbreaking portrayals of these real life people is just that. You will be hard pressed to not feel like choking up as the film draws to its finale.<br/><br/>And it is not only the passengers that shine. The actors portraying the terrorists are real, and are emotional beings. They are not the horrifying monsters that the American media have played them out to be. They have families at home, they are scared about the mission, they do not know whether or not they are making the right decisions. They are conflicted totally, and Greengrass and his flurry of actors allow this to play out magnificently on screen. In getting many of the actual military and airport personnel on duty that day to portray themselves, Greengrass stumbles slightly. While it gives the film a much larger push in means of realism, he also sacrifices these scenes to looking and acting amateur. You can almost pick out exactly who the actors are, and who is not. This is only a minor issue however, as it does not completely ruin the film at all. It just takes away from it at certain parts.<br/><br/>The film has no big special effects, and relies heavily on the original CNN footage to showcase the sequences involving the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. The image has been played out far too many times for any of us to forget, so it was nice to see them not forcing themselves to have to redo the scene themselves for dramatic effect. The old footage is enough to allow the memories to flood back to us, and continues the dramatic feel of the picture. In fact, even with the recreated stuff, the film still strikes me as being realistic enough to feel as if these new items are not new at all. The plane itself, the air traffic control rooms, the costumes, even the food, look painstakingly recreated, and as a result, breathe total realism. Of course, the shaky and bizarre camera angles also allow for the viewer to feel as if you were standing right there on that fateful day. And if that does not make you any more emotional than the film already makes you, than there clearly is something wrong with you.<br/><br/>I was not anticipating this film to be great at all. I was not in the camp of the film coming ""too soon"", I just thought it seemed like a shameless cash-in that could have been spared for more original work.<br/><br/>But now I realize that this bold work is in fact, quite original, and is frighteningly realistic to boot. Greengrass, while creating a controversial picture, has delivered a magnificent and harrowing film experience that just simply needs to be essential viewing for anyone who watches the cinema format, or just anyone in general. It may not be overly amazing, or have any real entertainment value, but the way it begins to absorb you and never let go is exactly what good cinema is. And of course, is the most we can ever ask from a filmgoing experience, entertaining or not.<br/><br/>8/10."
"shorty_babe_mel","10","1","2","12 September 2006"," Breathtaking...and incredibly real
","First off, I had no intentions whatsoever of seeing this movie since like most people, September 11 has left a large scar on my heart. I thought it was too soon when I saw previews of the World Trade Center movie and I thought oh here we go... The thought that some director and a cast of people making money off the tragedy of thousands of Americans in New York and elsewhere was beyond me. However, one must remember, its not always about the money. Seeing this movie was not about giving money to those people who contributed in making this movie, it was about recognizing the true heroes of that one very fateful day...The firefighters, the policemen, the paramedics, even the ""average Joe"" people like me out there...the people on United 93.<br/><br/>United 93 is unlike any other film that I have ever seen, or for that matter will ever see. Only one other film has ever evoked the same amount of emotion, if not more; was The Passion Of The Christ. This movie isn't the cheesy ""lovey drama"" of the Titanic and certainly does not rely on fantastic special effects to keep you in suspense...but it feeds solely on human emotion.<br/><br/>The film starts out on a typical Monday morning in the Newark, NJ airport...everyone waiting in the waiting area to board their plane...The hijackers join and sit down just like ordinary people. Everyone boards the plane and things go quite typically until a man steps out with what looks to be a bomb strapped to himself and says the plane is being hijacked. People call relatives and friends to hear that the World Trade Center has been hit by hijacked planes...and an overwhelming sense of heartbreak consumes you as you realize that this is the very end. The people can either give up and let them carry out their plans, whatever they may be...or they can stand up and fight them.<br/><br/>The beginning of United 93 was a bit long, as for me anyways, you began to realize what a disconnect there was between our government and the military and etc...But towards the end of the film you actually felt like you were sitting in the plane and were one of the passengers yourself. I felt the horror hearing that the World Trade Center was attacked, I felt the heartbreak as the phone calls were made to family and friends as people realized that their end was coming ever nearer, I felt the rush as they rushed the hijackers...and I felt the loss, even a sense of myself being in that plane as it crashed into the ground...and felt the innate sadness at the end as the summation of all the previous events tied together as one...ensuing me deep into them.<br/><br/>What an utterly brilliant film...is all I can really say. I could not think of a appropriate movie to see in ones life...Something that touches the heart and the soul."
"hughie522","6","1","2","11 September 2006"," Maybe too soon, but certainly gripping...
","Is it too soon for a film about September 11? Maybe. One thing's for sure, though, 'United 93' is definitely a good thing.<br/><br/>The film is, among other things, interesting, gripping, physically and mentally draining and frighteningly realistic. Though it lacks the emotional impact I expected (with the exception of the film's sudden and quite subdued ending), it certainly provides a great insight into at least one part of the September 11 tragedy. The acting is consistently good and convincing, and the whole film is very believable. So believable, in fact, that it often feels more like a documentary than a movie.<br/><br/>Not wanting to be overly critical (as this is a sensitive subject), I couldn't help but feel, as I watched the film, that I was watching a group of extras. Not because there are no 'big name' stars or because the actors are unconvincing; quite the opposite in fact. The problem is, I felt as if I was watching 'background actors'. It's very hard to associate with any of the characters (or rather people) because of this, and as such a lot of the emotional impact is dulled.<br/><br/>The film is not so much enjoyable as interesting, and with its high production values, believable characters and shocking realism should satisfy those who believe it is not too soon. For me, personally, the most shocking and emotionally devestating part of this movie is the footage of the Twin Towers burning. That affects me more deeply that any Hollywood film ever could, no matter how good.<br/><br/>Six Stars."
"hewyrappe","4","1","2","29 July 2006"," Good movie but has minor points
","When reading previous comments about this movie I see a lot of praise. It is supposed to show the true tragedy and courage of 9/11.<br/><br/>Well, it does show the courage of all the people on flight United 93, and it is certainly not just a Hollywood money maker. It kept me wondering for hours after the movie, how it could have happened and who in the world would do such a thing.<br/><br/>I guess this is especially the case for all American viewers, as I am from The Netherlands.<br/><br/>One very big minor to this film for me was the camera work. It is extremely shaky and seems unprofessional (done in order to create a chaotic feel to the movie?). Because of the camera I became nauseous when watching the film and I seriously had to close my eyes for a couple of minutes because I couldn't stand the way the camera view was shaking heavily.. I don't know how many people will have the same as I did but I will certainly not watch the movie again, just because of the poor camera.<br/><br/>If it would've contained steady footage etc it would have gotten an 8, but since I believe the camera is sh*t, I'm giving the movie a 6.<br/><br/>Hope you find this useful."
"mm-39","7","1","2","25 June 2006"," Fresh Style
","I like documentaries, and the documentary style of Greengrass is fresh! The only negative is the bouncing camera work, I find it disorienting, and the bouncing gave my wife a headache. Using the real life people gave a documentary feel. No PC or political agenda just the actions of real people. The heroic behavior of everyone trying to save the country from the attack had to be told. The part with the controllers in the tower and the J Sac command gave realism similar to Black Hawk Down. Worth renting. I will never forget that horrific day, with the death of so many. I was shocked to see a few people at work happy about it. I guess this shows the evil in this world and how ugly evil is. 7 out of 10. A movie onto itself."
"highkite","10","1","2","7 June 2006"," Realistic and powerful.
","The attack on September 11 which we all know about is yet again recorded in this tragic docudrama about the fourth hijacked plane -- and the only one to not reach its target. With almost limitless realism, United 93 fills you up with such emotion that you can't help but feel like you're experiencing the events.<br/><br/>Inspired by Gus Van Sant's movie Elephant, director-writer Paul Greengrass silences any attempt to commercialize this movie and portrays the events on United Flight 93 like they were meant to be. This story fills us with anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, and shock as virtually unknown actors (some playing themselves) are shown watching as the terror rises in New York and Washington. Greengrass directs this movie in such a way that leaves you breathless. His hand-held swinging, shaky camera comes right into the action and portrays every real emotion that the people on United 93 would have had.<br/><br/>Never in my life have I seen such a powerful, and realistic portrayal of an actual event, making the movie almost too hard to watch. And although you want to look away, and though you know the inevitable will happen, Greengrass manages to convince you that there is hope. The characters show both human emotion and forced emotion (the four Terrorists hiding their fear and pushing themselves towards death). As the movie switches back and fourth between flight 93 and the flight control room, we are exposed to dialog documented from actual conversations and transcripts from September 11.<br/><br/>The movie stays true to the events without going overboard, and truly focuses on the humanity, the inevitable tragedy that we all hadn't see coming. The audience feels almost motionless as United 93 comes to a closing, throwing the characters into countless near-death emotions, swinging the camera back and fourth as if it was really happening. What we now would call a painful day, America never saw coming ('A hijacking? Yeah right!').<br/><br/>United 93 really inspired me both artistically and emotionally. More complicated than it looks, Greengrass presented to us a raw and truly unbelievable film that examines real-life horror. This is definitely a movie to remember, and one that in my opinion truly deserves recognition."
"paultd","10","1","2","6 June 2006"," The story of our generation
","We may never know the truth of the events which transpired on that Day, but that is not important here. The official explanation leaves me wanting, but neither do the array of conspiracies seem plausible. But do not let this film become propaganda.<br/><br/>See it for what it is, a poignant observation of character intertwined with crumbs of fact, as all the classic cinematic stories before it were. Let us put aside such bickering, and be in awe of humanity never before put on display so vividly.<br/><br/>The utter confusion and disbelief that reigned on that Day is so clearly reenacted, the raw emotions so prevalently on display, that one has trouble separating this inspiring story (and it is no more than a story) from reality. We feel we could be seated on United Flight 93. It requires no stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>There are two types of acting. The first emphasizes stirring, larger than life performances often seen from the likes of Pacino. The second kind is so subtle that you forget it's all an act. Neither is the superior form, but for a poignant flashback to that Day, there is no doubt which form is most appropriate.<br/><br/>Leave the details to the history books, the news, and the documentaries. Facts are scarce in United 93. Facts are trivial."

My pre-conceptions pictured a huge Hollywood disaster movie walking over the tragic events of 9/11.<br/><br/>The first 5 minutes had the audience quiet and expectant showing the kind of direction the film was going to take. It proved to be a far more personal film than expected, developing empathy and understanding of the characters. The plane passengers are matured and a sense of unity is created.<br/><br/>The camera work and directing worked to set the mood and make it feel like a real experience. Whilst watching the film, I was drawn into a sense that this was just another day, and these people were normal people. It shows for example, the mundane activities of boarding a plane enforcing the reality by giving the associations we all experience on a flight.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film enjoyable and would recommend this to any film-goer. However, I did have some reservations whilst watching. Although the camera work was very effective in places, emphasising the ongoing confusion, I felt it rather dizzying. The film moves from scene to scene quickly yet build up seems abrasive and slow.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film 7/10"

This film may be controversial with reference to this event, but Greengrass portrays this historic day as a celebration of humanity and sacrifice against the war on terror. This has enabled me to understand the loss that USA has had to come to terms with and made me realise that London's loss last year was also significant and that we in the West need to make a unified stance against terrorism and ensure that we do not mix this up with war between Christanity and Islam.

It didn't place the blame on anyone; it was a mostly a presentation of the facts.<br/><br/>The first half was done as if the viewer was an observer and it bounced back and forth between all the different aviation authorities and military as they tried to figure out what the hell was happening. Halfway through, after the terrorists took over flight 93, the action never leaves the plane.<br/><br/>I found myself rooting for the passengers. After they charged the cockpit when they were trying to take back the plane, I was saying to myself, ""Get the pilot up there. Come on, you can do it.""

As they struggled in the cockpit, I was all tensed up with my arms crossed and hugged close to my body. I was bracing myself for the impact.

In fact, the names of the passengers are not really mentioned. Regardless of political affiliation, I believe that many people will be able to respect the movie.

Unless you've been in a coma the last 5 years you already know about 9-11 and what happened but that did not deter from the story that was told. The precise documentary style and factual approach was excellent. I was so nervous during the whole movie. On the edge of my seat, heart pounding, picturing myself in their situation. I thought the guy who played himself, the head of the FAA, was awesome. I didn't know until afterward that he wasn't an actor. He was great, I actually thought he had an Oscar worthy performance. I have never had such a feeling during or after a movie as I had with this one. After watching it, I was like ""wow, those people were so brave, such heroes."" Later that night, on Larry King Live, they had 4 family members of the victims on and they wholeheartedly agreed with the facts of the movie and gave kudos to the actors that played their fallen loved ones. They also said that 10% of the opening week gross is going toward a memorial in Pensylvania where the plane went down. I am so glad that they approved of the movie, it was pretty graphic and I was wondering if they would be upset about that.

","I cannot even begin to explain how disappointed I was with this film. I know people are reading this and are wondering how I can be so negative toward a film so controversial without sacrificing nationalism.<br/><br/>If anyone has seen the TV special about United 93 (I believe it was on A&E), they will know what I am talking about. In the A&E version, it made the audience feel like America won. I know people are going to reply with, ""So and So amount of people died...It was a tragedy...America did NOT win...blah blah blah."" Obviously the events of 9/11 were tragic, but the reason that Flight 93 has become so popularized is because of the heroic nature that a small group of citizens were able to display amidst a day of bloody chaos.<br/><br/>In the A&E special, the audience was immediately introduced to the passengers after 10 minutes of the movie. The director captured the emotions of both the passengers and their loved ones back home with great effectiveness. The struggle at the end of the movie was so emotional and even though the plane was shown crashing, you were overcome with great sorrow...but also with a feeling where you were proud to be an American...you were proud and ever so inspired to know that we as Americans are capable of a great number of things. We live in a nation where headlines publish stories of death rather than life. Papers and television cover car accidents and double homicides, but we never hear about the fireman that saved a family from a burning building. We don't hear about the high school service groups that spend their time after school working to raise money for less-fortunate, but we do hear about the high school students that were busted for drugs after the bell. There is no time or space in America for uplifting stories about true, real-world heroes. Those people on Flight-93 were heroes, and they deserved to be portrayed as such.<br/><br/>I was attending this movie with the intent of creating an emotional bond with the passengers and their families. I wanted to cry when the decision was made to attempt to take over the plane while dozens of passengers phoned their final goodbyes...but I couldn't. The movie spent 5-10 minutes at most with the passengers throughout the entire movie. No one with connections to immediate family that were affected by that crash could possibly have felt anything from this movie.<br/><br/>I am tired of the posts on the message board as well - ""two things that prove that Bush knew about 9/11."" F*CK if Bush knew. This movie is not about George F*cking Bush. This topic is not about George Bush. 9/11 is not about George Bush. 9/11 is not about the United States Gov't. 9/11 IS about the NYPD. 9/11 is about the thousands of volunteer workers, like firemen, doctors, and caring citizens that spent days and weeks and months of their lives saving others. Let's praise and salute those people, not brush them under the bed with Bush talks."

A third for, dare I say, making me laugh from time to time, by way of peculiar actor performances which were amusing.<br/><br/>This movie seems to rely completely upon patriotic support and a desire to honour the people who perished on September 11, 2001. If one takes that out of the viewing experience, and views it as a work of fiction, it remains a bad movie as it doesn't provide the audience with a compelling story. All of the characters are under developed. There is no story line upon which to focus our attention. Worse yet, what is happening over the course of the movie feels arbitrary and without motivation.<br/><br/>Example: the four hijackers do not appear to be working together in a well co-ordinated manner. They are presented more as bumbling fools who seem unlikely to have been successful, especially with their very peculiar behaviour prior to launching the hijack attack.<br/><br/>The way the passengers were portrayed was, in my opinion, insulting. Four men begin an attack and not one of the passengers close to them responds instictively with a counter attack and the reasoning presented (to not counter attack) is very thin.<br/><br/>Over all this is a movie to watch to learn how NOT to make a movie."

Contrary to much of what I have read about ""United 93,"" I would certainly not venture that it is one of the most important films in modern US history. I was fully aware of the time-line of events of 9/11, which made the movie quite dull and as a result not compelling in the slightest.<br/><br/>This is the first of the many problems with the movie: you already know what is going to happen. From start to finish, the entire plot has been fully documented and hammered into every American mind (fundamentally altering our perception of just about every event in the ""post-9/11"" world). Knowing that 93 will crash, which airplanes are hijacked, and when they reach their targets sucks all of the tension out of the movie. The only exceptions are those events on the airplane that Greengrass had to concoct to fill the real-time drama. The most intense part was waiting to see when and how the terrorists would take over the plane. Unfortunately, this excitement is diluted by the knowledge that Greengrass had to fabricate most of these scenes, since we know very little about the actual occurrences on the plane.<br/><br/>From this notion comes the second problem, which is Greengrass's direction. As we can see from ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" Greengrass is quite fond of the shaky hand-held camera. He uses it in this case to make the film seem more realistic, almost in a documentary sense. We even have some characters playing themselves, like Ben Sliney, to give it more authenticity. His attempts to blur the line between documentary and drama are nothing short of obnoxious and close to nauseating. The cameras in ""United 93"" are constantly shaking throughout the entire movie, even inside the control rooms. Greengrass also leaves in shots with intense glare from the sun, which did nothing but give me a headache. Instead of making the action seem more real, the camera work, combined with the fabricated action sequences, just makes the viewer more aware that he's watching a movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps most at fault, however, is that there just isn't enough plot material to fill the movie. The first hour is dreadfully boring. We know what's going to happen, we know how the day develops, and we are given no characters with whom to identify. All we have is a ceaselessly fluttering camera giving us no reprieve from the constant motion sickness and nothing to occupy our minds.<br/><br/>Commendably, Greengrass avoids (for the most part) blatant heart-tugging. Since we don't even know any of the characters names, let alone who they are, we can't identify with their sadness. Greengrass carefully avoids that pitfall in the interest of portraying the victims on flight 93 not as tragic figures, but as heroes. In the sense of honoring the characters, he does succeed, but at the expense of the viewers interest."
"darksidelingua","5","2","7","18 May 2006"," It was OK, but not GREAT by any means...
","There has been a lot of controversy with regards to it being too soon to release a film about September the 11th. I personally thought that it was not too soon, and didn't see the problem in the film being released.<br/><br/>After reading all the controversy, I had to get my hands on a copy of this film! I succeeded in the task set and I just finished watching it.<br/><br/>I was NOT impressed at all. I imagined it would be more hard hitting than it was. To me a good film MOVES you, and I didn't find it very moving at all. This is a list of reasons why I wasn't enthralled with this film and why this film will not stick in my memory after today: <br/><br/>1)The characters were one-dimensional. None of the characters were explored in that much detail. Because of this you didn't get to KNOW any of them and thus could not FEEL for them.<br/><br/>2) I found the acting very blah. Not enough emotion was conveyed. I would imagine that if you were being hijacked you would have a look of terror on your face pretty much consistently, even when trying to hide it.<br/><br/>3) The layout of the film with the flashbacks at the beginning... I didn't think that worked very well.<br/><br/>4) What was with the air hostess announcing ""Just a bit of turbulence"" on the loudspeaker after half the plane already knew they were being hijacked... what kind of bull is that? <br/><br/>5) How comes everybody had the same identical black flip mobile phones? And why were all of them were able to use them in the middle of the sky. I personally have never been able to use a cell phone on a plane when it gets to a certain height. Everyone who wasn't on a cell phone used the satellite phones.The hijacker would glance over and give a mean look and the person would bend their head lower and the hijacker did nothing all... not a warning.... NOTHING! <br/><br/>6) The hijackers were like baby cats (you know that word that can refer to a cat or female genitalia). The one hijacker that they sent to overlook the whole plane whilst the others were in the cockpit, looked about 16, and really timid. I would imagine a real hijacker to be a bit more aggressive and threatening than that, and considering he was such a wimp I don't know what took so long for the other passengers to beat him up.<br/><br/>7) The ""bombs"" the hijackers had around their waists were as flat as pancakes. If they really did contain explosives, there would have barely been enough to blow up half a body.<br/><br/>8) The whole Lords prayer thing at the end before the guy gets ready to go and ""rush"" the Islamic fundamentalists, so as to conclude the film on a Islam VS Christianity flex, when people are feeling emotional about the whole thing I thought was lame.<br/><br/>The thing that I did find really realistic was the incompetence of the authorities. They had about 50 million phone calls and they still were acting like they didn't know what was up. How typical!<br/><br/>I felt somewhat sorry for the poor woman who tried to report the hijacking and got transferred to about 100 people and ended up getting hung up on in the end.<br/><br/>My favourite bit was were where one of the guys on the plane call his mother and his mother says to his father, <br/><br/>""Call the police."" His father's response was, <br/><br/>""Can they fly?"" <br/><br/>Well that's all I remember for now folks."

","I was a bit apprehensive about viewing this film, wondering if enough time had gone by for me to revisit this terrible day in our nation's recent history. There is no single word that can describe this movie other than POWERFUL. The director, Paul Greengrass uses hand held cameras and jumping from shot to shot to give the film a docu-drama feel. Also, the choice of casting several of the actual air traffic control and military personnel involved as themselves lends a sense of realism to the film.<br/><br/>The story begins on that terrible morning and shows how the people involved conduct their business. The tone of the film is very non-biased, we see air traffic controllers, flight staff and passengers portrayed as regular people, not as heroes or bad guys. Although I knew how most of the day's events played out, I still found myself hoping and wishing for a different ending.<br/><br/>This film is quite an emotional roller coaster, and is definitely not something easy or pleasant to watch, but great cinema sometimes can be painful. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie."

","It's not by any means a perfect film. However, it is touching, relevant, and educational, and it provides us with insight about the last hours of a group of people who fought to survive and prevent another disaster on 9/11/2001.<br/><br/>Its director does a masterful job for the first half of the film, as we are introduced to the key people of the day. We see how several organizations dealt with the events as they unfolded, and we wonder how some details were overlooked, other pieces didn't fall into place, and once in a while, you feel like yelling out loud: ""what were they thinking?"" or ""how could that have happened?"". The fact is that the movie, which at times feel spooky as if someone had been running a video tape on the plane itself is probably too intense for its own good. It tries very hard to portray what might have happened on the plane, and it does it with much intensity. Unfortunately, the personal connection level to anyone on the plane doesn't really exist. We really might never know if there was a leader among the passengers. We understand their desperation and the need to overcome the terrorists, but it is difficult to digest how they overcame their fears and pull together their resources.<br/><br/>It is a respectable effort, and it makes you wonder how it will match against the upcoming Oliver Stone effort. Still, it is an important film, and technically it's practically flawless."
"xanthes","8","2","7","29 April 2006"," Start healing
","As a former flight attendant, I felt drawn to see this account of flight 93. As the movie started I recalled the series of events on 9/11 and how worried I was for friends that still worked for the airlines as well as friends that frequently traveled. I couldn't believe the miscommunication going on between the FAA and the military. I also thought it was amazing that our President couldn't be reached to get authorization for possible military action. Since this film is done in real time, there is no time to get to know the personal stories of the passengers/heroes. Even though I knew the outcome, I still found my self hoping that somehow they would be able to take over the plane and at least someone would survive. I think the real purpose of this film is to help us face that dreadful day but also to remember the American spirit...nothing is impossible. To all of our fallen heroes, may we never forget."

","Wow. That's all I have to say. I think that everyone in America knows where they were on that fateful day. I was in my 7th grade art class. A teacher came in and handed my teacher a slip of paper. When she read I still remember the feeling of horror spread throughout my body. I remember going over to my best friend's house later on when my father had to go into the hospital for a blood transfusion. I remember watching the planes hit the towers again and again on the news because that's all that was on on every channel.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie brought all that back. Every feeling of horror and fear and panic and shock. Seeing the plane hit one of the towers was an incredibly powerful moment, but the real moment that drove everything home for me (every feeling of pain) was watching the passengers on the plane call their families from phones.<br/><br/>There's nothing really I can say about this movie other than go see it. It's not a film that can be described. You just have to sit back in the theater seats and let the blackness surround you as you concentrate on the images before you. This documentary style film starts out slowly. You just keep waiting for someone to burst into a room yelling ""The World Trade Centers have been hit!"" There is a knot in your stomach the entire time because you know what's going to happen and you wish to god you could change it."
"tomcat91468","10","2","7","29 April 2006"," It made you feel you were there.
","Today I went to see United 93. From the start, it gives the movie goer the feeling of being there. The camera work puts you in the center of the action and dialog and never gives you a breather. It seems like real time as it goes from the FAA to the flight controllers to the military to the people on the plane. There is no hype, there is no false bravado. It is a tough movie to watch in that it does indeed seem so real. The emotions are raw. I feel I want to see it again so I can watch the technical aspects of the movie. I didn't notice them today. These do not get in the way of the telling of the story nor do they bring attention to themselves. The next time I see this movie, after I rest up a bit, I want to try to concentrate on the editing. I usually pay attention to editing and camera work, but it went right by me this time. As for the telling of the story, it brings back the feelings I had that morning when everything changed. I'm still weak in the knees from the rekindling of the memory. Absolutely go to this movie and see it on the big screen. This is a big screen movie."
"NotSureifthisis7734","10","2","7","29 April 2006"," I can't recall seeing a more intense film.
","How can one give a spoiler to this film?<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it: this is strong stuff. For the most part the movie is played very low key, letting the events speak for themselves. Anything more would have been too much. The score is effective, but so muted that most of the time you do not know it is there. All the actors (and the air traffic controllers who in many cases play themselves, an extraordinary feat of casting) do an outstanding job. Both technically and as a story, the film is a marvel. You are there, and I sympathize with those who would prefer they weren't. If you have doubts, you may want to wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>But I have no sympathy for the accuracy hypocrites, the same who couldn't get enough of Michael Moore's rubbish. Yes, it is accurate. In broad outline, we know exactly what happened and the film conveys it very well indeed. Are there things we can't know? Certainly. For example, the hijackers may well have been scared (two of them anyway) but how can we ever know their feelings? What we do know and get to see is that they will murder even when there is no necessity. Greengrass spares us nothing. <br/><br/>Note to Hollywood: Jodi Foster is nowhere to be seen and she was not missed.<br/><br/>As I write the film has opened very well on a per screen basis, but who knows how well it will do over the next several weeks. I certainly can't imagine anyone wanting to see this film more than once, but I have been wrong on that before. Like a lot of people, I have wanted to forget 9/11/2001. ""United 93"" brings it all back. After I left the theater, I was grateful. But it's up to you to decide if that is a good or bad thing."

","United 93 is a gripping account of what really happened aboard the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Forget all the conspiracy theories put out by pacifists and liberals. All Americans should be required to watch this movie to see what the civilized world is up against. From start to finish, you'll be proud of those who gave their lives to defend our country from moslems. What's also telling is how incapable our military was prior to 9/11 because of massive cuts from the Clinton administration. In the end, you see that what makes America so great isn't our government, but the general population that knows that freedom isn't free; you have to earn it."
"strumdatjag","10","2","7","29 April 2006"," Suspenseful, Well-Acted, Jumpy Camera-work
","Paul Greengrass has created a suspenseful, well-acted version of events regarding United 93 and the heroic passengers onboard. This is a great movie for these times, regardless of your political opinions. While some have complained that it is ""too soon"" for this movie. From a story-telling standpoint, the opposite is actually true. While the telling of this heroic story is very moving and suspenseful in 2006, I suspect that a channel surfer 30 years hence may find boring the long introduction of everyday scenes of passengers boarding and sitting in an airplane. Yet, for the current theater-goer, the familiarity with the story and the understandable obliviousness of the passengers and crew to their impending doom only adds to the suspense. The hand-held camera for the most part makes the viewer feel like a passenger in the aircraft and a fly on the wall in air traffic control rooms. However, I was distracted and annoyed by much of the sudden irrelevant zooming and jerking especially at the end of many shots. It was not as nausea-inducing as the previous Greengrass film, ""The Bourne Supremacy"", but a little less jumpy camera-work would have helped this movie. Because of the somewhat excessively jumpy camera-work, and the lack of timelessness to this otherwise great film, it gets 3 1/2 stars or an 8/10."

","While watching this movie, I couldn't help getting the feeling that I was watching a propaganda piece. Besides that I found the storyline very dodgy to say the least. For example: the passengers are allowed to phone everyone they know and get the info that the plane will hit a (civil) target, while the terrorists are steering towards a big city? I believe the terrorist understood the English language, while we are told that they earned their experience to fly planes in USA. Another example: I was told that in reality they couldn't find the plane, here they show scattered material in the woods nearby, speculating that the plane crushed into tiny pieces. And last but not least: The melodrama in the left behind families was understood, but very very overdone.<br/><br/>First I ask: Where is the plane? And second, if there was a plane, I believe the fighter-jets shot it down. Third: Where were the jets from Andrew airport? Fourth: If we believe the Twin Towers were an inside job, why should we believe the government saying that this plane was taken down by passengers? <br/><br/>I give it a 6, but only in respect of the left-behind families."

When a plane crashes it leaves wreckage, and bodies lying around and there were none to be seen in the images shown on CNN, NBC and other major stations. Cellphone calls out of an airliner? Wasn't possible at that time... This whole movie is just another bunch of crap your government is feeding you, they've even got Hollywood helping them covering up what really happened that day! You people should all watch movies like LOOSE CHANGE, IN PLANE SITE etc. etc. Those movies present hard facts, and not twisted dramatized bullshit like this one does!

"bryanburchard","4","2","8","29 May 2006"," Should have stayed home and watched CNN
","Regardless of what the newspaper critics want you to believe, this film was done for no purpose other than to cash in on the 9/11 attacks. The film opens strong giving you insight into what the terrorists were doing up to the point of attack. However, it's a better sleep aid than Sominex from then on. Basically you watch as the men at the airports study over their blinking dots(airplanes). Whenever a dot disappears you get the privilege of witnessing about ten different men and women asking each other where it went. Whenever a plane crash occurs they cut to the CNN footage. Then once again back to the men and women asking each other whats going on. Although I'm sure this is similar to what really happened it makes for a very poor film. Half of the film is spent having people ask the same questions over and over. ""Where'd the plane go?"", ""Is it another Hijacking?"", ""Whats going on?"". Nothing ever actually happens in the film. The big finale isn't even a finale. No crash, no fire, no aftermath, just a cut to black. They could of at least went to some of the families, or just simply showed anything at all. The film is a realistic portrayal. So realistic that it is just plain boring. Find someone who taped the CNN coverage of the 9/11 attacks. You will get everything you get from this film without all the pointless in-betweens. The only way I can see anyone being entertained by this film is if you were someone who was deeply touched by the attacks. Then it will probably tug on your heart strings and evoke a ""strong, emotional"" response that everyone ""claims"" this film creates. This isn't a work of art, this isn't even entertaining, clearly this film was created for one reason only.

"anhedonia","8","2","8","30 April 2006"," Compelling, tough to watch at times, though Greengrass takes license
","""United 93"" is not a film you can tell your friends you loved, or even liked. Sitting through it is a tough proposition. Nevertheless, given the circumstances, writer-director Paul Greengrass made the best film possible out of this story.<br/><br/>Is it too early? Has our psyche healed? Are we ready for films about 9/11? Well, that's what we're going to find out this year, not only with this film, but also with Oliver Stone's ""The World Trade Center."" And someone's adapting the book, ""102 Minutes,"" into a movie, too.<br/><br/>Just as Greengrass did in ""Bloody Sunday"" (2002), he gives ""United 93"" a quasi-documentary feel with hand-held camera. It's about as close to cinema verite in fiction as we're going to get. Greengrass is awfully good at shooting hand-held films - I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004). And, truly, there is no other way he could have shot ""United 93.""<br/><br/>Unlike ""Flight 93"" - the made-for-TV film that first aired on A&E in January - ""United 93"" doesn't simply concentrate on what happened aboard the plane that crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pa. Greengrass fits the hijacking of the airliner in the context of that entire, crazy day. He runs two parallel stories - the panic on the plane and the utter confusion on the ground. And unlike ""Flight 93,"" Greengrass doesn't immerse his film in any sort of sentimentality. Yes, we see passengers calling their loved ones, but the conversations are all one-sided and Greengrass really doesn't stay on them for any length of time. What we get our snippets and they're more than adequate to convey the passengers' emotions.<br/><br/>It was a smart move on Greengrass' part not to cast well-known actors in these roles. There are a few recognizable faces, but the names don't spring to mind and that unrecognizable quality lends more credence to the actors. Greengrass also doesn't bother with trivialities such as back stories and this also helps immensely. He doesn't want to spend time on typical hijacking-movie clichés - passengers spending time with their families, the odd coincidences, the chance meetings, all that nonsense. He gets right to the point - this day was chaotic on the ground and in the air and that's what he wanted to capture.<br/><br/>The film also does well to grasp the chaos on the ground as military personnel and air traffic controllers tried to figure out what was happening and how they could mitigate the situation. It is obviously clear that this nation was not prepared for this and, although Greengrass doesn't go out of his way to make this point, it's abundantly clear this administration had no idea how to react. Our leaders' incompetence continues to this day and anyone who actually believes that our illustrious leader has made this world safer is positively delusional.<br/><br/>Greengrass takes license with the story. Much has been made about how this film was made with the cooperation of the families and from thorough research of countless documents, including the official 9/11 Commission report.<br/><br/>But clearly Greengrass' film is based on supposition. And, frankly, some of it was tough to swallow. I have no doubt everyone on board was petrified, but this film makes it seem as if the flight attendants were of no use, completely incapable of doing anything because they were so distraught and frightened, and that the passengers did pretty much everything. Also - and I have no idea who this passenger is supposed to be - but Greengrass takes a huge leap when he clearly implies one passenger not only does not approve of what the others are planning, but tries to impede them.<br/><br/>There are also other bits - dealing with the hijackers' target, some of the goings on in the cockpit etc. - that are based purely on conjecture.<br/><br/>The final sequences are tough to watch. However, I wish Greengrass had a bit more faith in his storytelling ability and the story to avoid relying on a pounding musical score to accompany the chaos and drive the emotion.<br/><br/>Considering ""United 93"" to be the definitive story of Flight 93 would be a mistake. It tells the story of what might have happened. And kudos to Greengrass for avoiding any sort of rah-rah jingoism in favor of a gritty, unrelentingly disturbing and uncomfortable telling of the story.<br/><br/>I am glad I saw ""United 93,"" though I honestly don't know whether it is exploitative or not. It certainly is not without its flaws. I would like to see filmmakers tackle more 9/11 films. However, it would be encouraging to see them not only handle the events of that day and how it impacted people, but also how this nation and our government has dealt with it, the changes that have taken place in our lives, the stripping away of some rights, the callousness with which this administration operates, the nationalistic rhetoric that only isolates us even more.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM: I changed my rating for this movie after seeing Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" only because that one made me appreciate Greengrass' film more. I still believe Greengrass took a few too many liberties, but his lean, efficient storytelling is deeply under-appreciated."

I left it with the same feelings of utter sadness that I experienced that morning. I highly recommend skipping this film if you're in no mood to be depressed. Overall, it was well done and accurate.

I often get ""caught up"" in a movie... this one made me feel as though I was on the plane, having to make the decision to give up my life to avoid further tragedy.

I was at Moody Gardens in Galvetson, Texas and we were in a small room with several people looking into a Aquarium. A middle east family walked in and you could hear a pin drop. I hope we never go through this again and i'm afraid if we do it will be much worse."

","United 93, one great amazing film displaying all the strength and courage and emotions to everyone. It clearly was a success and I'm sure that the above comment by Steve Nash is exactly what everyone feels after watching this movie. However, my biggest complaint is, ""CAN PAUL GREENGRASS STOP USING Hand-held CAMERAS!?!?!?"" I understand he made the Bourne Supremacy which also had the same camera technique and that Paul finds this to be an ""artistic"" way of displaying the tone. However, my mom who really wanted to watch this movie, had to keep her eyes closed for more than 50 minutes of the film due to the nauseating photography. That's the only spoiler I give in this comment, the cameras (Sacré bleu). On another fact, my mom who kept her eyes closed during most of the duration of the movie even cried. Therefore, that clearly displays how strong this movie's emotions can be displayed. Really amazing."

","This is a great movie! OK having said that..its much more than a regular film release...its subject matter is so dear to the nations hearts that I was worried if it would be overly-exploited in some negative Hollywood fashion. instead I was so pleased it was so tastefully and realistically done. It made me feel like I was there on the plane and in the control tower with the crew and passengers...a certain intangible magic happens that created tension and a certain ""realistic"" discomfort in such a way that I haven't felt in a film in a very long time. I believe this is based partly on the fact that the family and friends of our hero's of united flight 93 were involved with the making of this movie both as creative consultants and as inspirations plus add the true grit vision of Paul greengrass...and when heart and soul are combined with such historic subject matters ....you get the ever elusive ""greatness"" the audience on opening day upon the rolling of the final credits were flabbergasted ..some tearing....some shaking heads....some frozen...some clapping you came out tired having gone through a plethora of different emotions...this is the ""real deal "" Bravo to all involved!"

","Although the script and acting were believable and well done, the camera movement destroys the experience. The director may have thought that the first-person point of view would help viewers feel as if they were in the middle of the action, all it seemed to do for this viewer is upset my stomach.<br/><br/>Constant shaking and shifting of focal points make it impossible to know what one is looking at while watching ""United 93."" Besides a perpetual vibration that gives the impression the viewer is always panting, the focus jumps from one corner of the picture to another. The only movie that does this ""confused bystander"" point of view worse is ""Blair Witch."" I have tried to see ""United 93"" twice. Although I managed to actually sit through my second viewing, I left the theater feeling as if I had been spinning in circles the whole time.<br/><br/>Again, I have to admit I was a little impressed with the script and the acting. I can also say that, in moderation, the first-person POV would work well for this movie, but overall, a bad headache and an upset stomach ruined ""United 93."" It might be a good watch when it comes out on DVD, but until then, I would suggest avoiding this movie unless you have a strong stomach."
"Pulpmariachi","7","2","9","29 April 2006"," Much Better When It's Limited to the Plane
","I said it in my review of ""Brick"", something is going to have to blow me further away to make me think of it as a better movie this year. And ""United 93"" isn't that.<br/><br/>In fact, I was rather disappointed.<br/><br/>The scenes on-board the actual plane are amazing and tense and define a lot of...stuff. You know, that Americans can unite for a short period of time. That, though we may all be different, we all love and care for other people.<br/><br/>Then everything else is pretty much ""Armageddon"". We're in the scenes where everyone is in the control room, babbling incoherently. I was bored. Everything made this to be a story about United Airlines flight 93, not everything else that was going on on September 11th. In fact, that's what I was really hoping for. But no. We're in that stupid control room and it's taking away from the film. Not to mention, it all felt like a prolonged scene from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". ""Do you want to report a UFO? Repeat: do you want to report a UFO?"" As an audience, we know exactly what happened that day from an outsiders' point-of-view. I frankly wasn't interested in seeing what the military was doing.<br/><br/>I do like Paul Greengrass's work, but I think he shakes the cameraman by the shoulders when he's filming something. There are times when the shaky camera does work. Like the hijacking and the uprising. I would be willing to bet that those times were just a big mess of confusion, and I think the film delivers that greatly. But everything else is super-hand-held. It gets annoying. I've seen other, better, hand-held movies. Just look at ""Saving Private Ryan"" for one. When the characters are steady, the shots are nearly steady. The same goes for ""The Constant Gardener"" and any Robert Rodriguez flick pre-""Spy Kids"". They know how to control it and it works better.<br/><br/>The camera-work is more overused here than it is during ""The Bourne Supremacy"". ""Supremecy"" was all about confusion and spy-tactics and everything, so it was effective. People know what's going on in this movie (after a certain point and strictly limited to those stupid control room scenes) but they don't know what to do about it.<br/><br/>Again, the United 93 scenes work so much, because Greengrass lets us get into the characters (or as much as they could base off the characters). The phoning home scenes are touching and show that people do care about others besides themselves. There were no messages of hatred or anything, even though what these terrorists were doing was pretty horrible. Those final moments (before the uprising) were about making peace, and that is demonstrated greatly. We saw it in ""Munich"" as the main characters suffer and we in turn are more connected to the action on screen. This is what happens during the plane sequences.<br/><br/>Personally, I think Greengrass should have abandoned the whole ""real-time"" aspect. This makes all the control room scenes seem like a dull episode of ""24"" while the cameraman has a seizure. He could have easily made a tight film cutting all that out, and emotionally I believe it would have impacted everyone even more.<br/><br/>""United 93"", while it is a good film, it could have been delivered in such a better way. I repeat (because I'm a post-Modernists and we do like repetition), the airplane scenes are gripping and heartfelt and the best parts of the movie. Pity it wasn't limited to just that.<br/><br/>B"
"p-stepien","6","1","3","12 September 2012"," Hard to 'dislike'
","An morbidly exact reenactment of the famed United 93 flight, which crash-landed in a field on September 11th and thus failing to reach the target point. By way of story memories of proceedings are still strongly etched in the minds of most of humanity, even though specific details are unknown. Paul Greengrass attempts to bring forth these details presenting a real time movie of occurrences which took place that day.<br/><br/>With great focus on detail and language, the story shifts between control centres across the country and passengers of the doomed plane. Dialogues are painstakingly realistic, even professional lingo is used during conversations between air control personnel. Deeply essential to this realism is the all-engulfing feeling of utter chaos (enhanced by a shaky lens), giving an evocative understanding of how surprised and unprepared officials were to the attacks reacting in confusion and emotions to a situation outside their guidebooks. ""United 93"" goes to great length to present a matter-of-fact portrayal showing the fright, hopelessness, acceptance of inevitability and then the fatal moment of bravery. Characters aren't really presented or portrayed, their actions in response to the situation they were in are more important, while the rest is fittingly ignored (out of reverence to the victims).<br/><br/>With such a picture brought about so soon after the attacks the movie holds a large amount of reverence to (most) victims, one can help but question the necessity of making such a movie. Ultimately a documentary style re-enactment in true cinema verite style brings no commentary to the disaster and while it causes several moments of gut-wrenching honesty, can anything ever really overshadow the feelings that everyone had on that fateful day? Do we really need to film it and see it in-depth to accept the tragedy? Even though mostly tasteful, reverential and with a required subtlety I couldn't help but question necessity. Essentially a movie that in honour of victims is hard to be disliked, but I couldn't help but question how exploitive a movie like this is...<br/><br/>One asinine no-no by the filmmakers is the much talked about presentation of a German passenger in negative light, even though there are no suggestions that he ever went against the remainder of the passengers giving it a despicable anti-European touch, which shockingly and inappropriately disgusts."

","I clapped after seeing the Paul Greengrass film United 93. The film is deserving of whatever praise it can get and the brave real-life heroes are just as worthy. The film shows 9/11 from two prospectives, the hostages fighting for their lives on Flight 93 and the air traffic controllers struggling to stop the bloodshed on the ground. It is one amazing movie that honors the people onboard the flight without forsaking entertainment value. The movie in my opinion marks The Bourne Supremacy director Paul Greengrass as a world-class filmmaker. Realistic with actual control operators portraying themselves and accurate depictions of the fear and terror aboard the flight. Beautiful movie-making at its finest."
"imdbbl","Null","1","3","18 June 2010"," Terrible first hour saved by extremely emotional and gut-wrenching final third
","Four young Arabians prepared themselves physical and spiritually in order to hijack flight United 93, the night before the fatal 11-S-2001. Same day, other three planes were hijacked as well and reached their targets: The World Trade Center and The Pentagon. British director Paul Greengrass gives a close version about what could possible happened inside the plane, basing upon the last recordings from the pilot cabin and the telephone calls made by the passengers to their beloveds. The movie shows how the passengers tried to subdue the terrorists, one of them with a bomb tied to his waist, once they had killed both pilots and one of the passengers. Meanwhile, we see the prevailing crisis in the Air Traffic Control, trying to deal with a situation which leads to close all the country's aerial space. Despite the courage of the passengers, the United Airlines' plane, with an original route to San Francisco, crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, without reaching its target, located in Washington D.C.<br/><br/>Watched The Green Zone yesterday, also by Paul Greengrass and decided to check some of his earlier work. United 93 seemed like a good choice even thought I knew it would be hard to watch. I have to say that the first half of the film, which shows the FAA and the military finding out slowly that several planes have been hijacked is extremely dull. I realize they're portraying what happened as best as possible but seeing these two groups (which were completely unprepared) dealing with the situation, looking at radars, using jargon and so forth, does not make for good cinema. It was absolutely excruciating and I nearly gave up on watching United 93. <br/><br/>Having said that, the final third of the film which shows a group of passengers rallying up and together conjuring a plan to take over the plane from the hijackers was incredibly well done and extremely emotional. I found myself thinking ""Come on, kill that Mother*****!"" as the passengers started to fight the hijackers, such was the emotion of what was being portrayed on the screen. It truly was gut-wrenching. Unfortunately, everyone knows the outcome of this story, the plane crashed, no one survived. Still, what these group of passengers tried to do is nothing short of amazing, and for that sole reason they deserve their story to be told. I wish that instead of what we saw in the first half, Greengrass had shown us perhaps the background of some of this characters, or the simple mundane events in their lives prior to the flight as it would have made for a much better film.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"callanvass","7","1","3","11 February 2010"," It's well made no doubt about that. Rather manipulative though, and not as impactful as it's made to be.
","United 93 is a movie I had heard people rave about for years, due to it's shocking realism, and the impact it makes on you. Well it did make an impact on me, but I had many problems with this, when all was said and done. In my opinion, this seemed to be really exploitive, and an attempt for the film makers, to cash in on what happened at 911. Personally I think this is a tragedy that didn't need to be revisited, and should have been left alone respectively. The actors in this movie, look like just that, actors. I didn't sense any realness to them, and the movie didn't give me enough to care as much as I should have, when the movie was finished. I'm a Canadian, but I was deeply affected to what happened on 911, like a lot of people were, it's just this movie Doesn't do it any justice. The Arabiacs often complain about injustice, and the treatment directed towards them, that America gives them. Well it's there own fault, by doing what they have done, they have dug there own grave, ruining it for a lot of other innocent Arabiacs. United 93 left me feeling a little empty, and cold, after it was over. It was a well made movie, but not worthy of all the acclaim it has gotten.<br/><br/>Bottom line. United 93 is an effective, but over-hyped movie about the 911 events. It has many flaws, and as I said, left me feeling a little empty, when all was over. It's well worth a viewing, it will make an impact on you, but it wasn't the masterpiece people said it was.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I waited a long time before seeing this one. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm too cynical, but <br/><br/>when this movie came out I thought it was too soon after 9/11 and smacked of exploitation. As I write this, we've just passed the 8th year anniversary of the tragedy, and I was finally ready to sit down and watch it.<br/><br/>I was pleased to find that the film respectfully and soberly deals with exactly the events of that single flight, and only the events of that single flight with no over-the-top theatrics. In other words, we know the final fate of both the ship Titanic, and the plane United 93, but there is a world of difference between the way those tragedies were portrayed in the respective films 'Titanic' and 'United 93'.<br/><br/>Again, <br/><br/>maybe I'm too cynical but, <br/><br/>it was a damn entertaining film. The plentiful use of hand held camera techniques gives a very immersive feel, making the film overall a jaw clenching experience, as if you are there aboard that fateful flight. Far greater than purely fictional Hollywood fare such as 'Airforce One' or 'Flightplan'.<br/><br/>Before I get tons of hate mail, let me state once again, I fully admit, <br/><br/>I may be too cynical. <br/><br/>Yes, I am talking about 'entertainment value' about the dramatization of a National tragedy. But let me explain.<br/><br/>I don't generally buy into most 9/11 conspiracy theories, but I've always had my doubts about the official story regarding the final moments of this particular airliner. Are the events in the film true to life? Is that what really happened? I don't know if it's even fully possible to know beyond a handful of cell phone calls what was going on up there. Clearly no matter what happened at least some of the passengers acted heroically. Clearly it ended in tragedy. But, ask yourself, if a known hijacked plane presumably en route to The White House *wasn't* shot down by military aircraft a half hour after the Pentagon was struck and way more than an hour after both Trade Towers were hit, why not? <br/><br/>My point being... is this *the* story? The whole story? I don't know. I kind of doubt it.<br/><br/>But it is A story. And one that makes for a pretty good movie. And that is the only foundation upon which this review is based. Is it worth seeing? Yes."

They are not just killers, bloodthirsty criminals.<br/><br/>The films describes very well the terrific face to face between those men and the passengers of the 93. Ordinary people, like you and me, not heroes, who suddenly realize that their plane will be used as a gigantic weapon, more, as a monstrous shell against some federal building, or something like that. The passengers who have just heard of the twin towers destruction. Passengers who are liquefied in horror.<br/><br/>Passengers who decide to fight for their lives.

","I clearly remember this day and never forget along the time I live. Far away thousands of kilometers from USA, in Turkey, about 5 o'clock with local time, I was watching the news on TV. I couldn't believe my eyes which saw attacks on TV. Shocking attacks to the twin towers and Pentagon caused a panic in USA. This condition is transferred to the cinema very well. Whole departments concerned with these tragic hijackings got them amazed and even the army was shocked and couldn't know what to do. Even today people don't know how such tragic attacks happened and lots of plot theories are expressed all around the world.<br/><br/>The story explaining the last hijacked plane United 93 shows the wild face of the terror. According to the plan that appears afterwards all planes should have crashed at the same time or close times to their targets. But this fact was not possible technically because of the delay time of the planes. This is explained impressively in the film in which United 93 hijackers see that twin towers' last moments and get the crash message when they are in cockpit. People's behaviours describe the inevitable end and in this times you feel like in this plane. Also a man's conversation between his wife was taking part densely in press.<br/><br/>As a member of Islam, only thing I know definitely is that not All Muslims are like those people. Unfortunately the people who govern USA show all Muslims are like terrorists. I condemn the people who realized these disasters and caused the innocent people to die. While watching hair-rising hijacking scenes I was shocked and didn't want to be in United 93. The scenes make you feel as if you live these moments.<br/><br/>In addition to those words, USA considered these tragic facts as war reason and after that the Neareast never had a peace. Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon and it is said that Iran is in row now. Shared characteristics of these countries are Islam is mostly believed religion there. It is also said 3000 or 4000 innocent people died during the crashes but several times of these numbers are dying in Iraq after the war had started. In other words 3000 or 4000 people are dying just each month in Iraq and furthermore no mass destruction was found there USA alleged it for war.<br/><br/>To sum on, wherever or whoever terror comes its' name is terror. It can be sometimes realized by the members of an organization as it was 11th day of Sept 2001 or it can be sometimes realized by a state as it was or it is in Iraq.<br/><br/>Not necessary to talk too much about it.

","Of course, I had witnessed the second plane--the infamous United flight 175 crashing into the second tower of the World Trade Center. That particular event brought the United States to its knees in the hands of Al-Qaeda terrorism. That of course, happened on September 11, 2001. Of course, that plane was hijacked, as well as American flight 11, which crashed into the first World Trade Center before United 175 suffered the same fate.<br/><br/>Then, soon afterwards, United 93 was hijacked and was doomed to crash into an important financial or military building in the United States. Most likely the hijackers aimed it at the Capitol or perhaps the White House, as I could see in the dramatization of the day America fought back against anti-American terrorism in ""United 93"".<br/><br/>Before the flick, a famous passenger called out the famous code signal ""Let's roll!"" Well, the famous two-word phrase was toned down just before the time the passengers and crew fought back.<br/><br/>What I also liked, in addition to the dramatic attempt to overpower the hijackers and take over the plane, was the events leading up to the United 93 hijacking. You see the air traffic control employees in Newark seeing one of those hijacked planes---United 175----right before their eyes---crash right into the World Trade Center. Upon impact, the controllers were frozen dead in great shock and awe.<br/><br/>I also like the actor Ben Smiley, who played himself as the guy who, after the devastating turn of events that include a suicide plane crashing into the Pentagon, ordered the famous nationwide ground stop on all departures and eventually, forcing all U.S. civilian planes not part of the four doomed planes to land immediately. I felt so sad for all of those planes that had to land at airports and stay there indefinitely.<br/><br/>Of course, I was saying to myself, ""Why can a terrorist infiltrate a cockpit and force the plane to go down to crash?"" A pilot, who was one of the passengers during the time the passengers fought back, was pushed with some help into the cockpit to fight off the terrorists who were piloting the plane. He knew it was not going to be easy. These bad guys were hardened terrorists who were willing to die to make their point. <br/><br/>Regrettably, everyone died on flight 93 as it hit the ground at Shanksville. I don't know how far Shanksville was to Washington D.C., but at least, something good came out of what was the most terrible day ever in America."

The newscast at the time was more interesting than this movie.<br/><br/>Characters are cold, the story is slow and overly drawn out, and doesn't offer anything over what we already know.

I sobbed through it (I knew I would, which is the reason I didn't want to watch it in the theater).<br/><br/>As I think someone else noted, the most powerful thing to me was seeing people praying...some to Allah, some to Jesus Christ and (though I didn't hear it) to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Jesus said ""If you know that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift on the altar and go be reconciled to your brother, then come back and offer your gift to God."" I couldn't help but think that if we only tried that, to talk to each other about our hurts and disagreements first, instead of our own flavor-of-the-week deity who we only talk to in our own context and understanding, as if talking to ourselves, maybe we could head off tragedies like this before they happened. Jewish, Christian, Moslem. If you read the Bible you realize we're all cousins in a way. All related to Abraham in some way. Yet how we have shamed his name and the name of whatever God you choose to pray to with our refusal to accept each other in our humanity and love each other to life rather than hating each other to death.<br/><br/>Even some of the comments here blame politicians, etc. But that's not the answer. Talking won't always help. It's interesting that I watched ""The Great Dictator"" today, too. It's the comedy Charlie Chaplin made showing the madness of Nazi Germany and Hitler specifically. Sadly his warnings in 1940 came too late. But even warnings won't always help.<br/><br/>Yet we can try. And maybe if we can't get through to madmen we can get through to those who, like the folks on United 93, took a stand against destruction. But we need to talk to each other for that to happen. Every phone call I heard (in this film and in other documentaries) that was made from that plane was to a family member to pass on thoughts of love. Maybe we should all do that, and while we're doing it, talk to our ""enemies"" as well. And pray for them. But only after we've talked to them and tried to come to an understanding of who they are and how we can live together in a beautiful world rather than hating each other into a hellish one.<br/><br/>""Bless those that curse you.

The lack of 'stars' was a positive plus, the list of people playing themselves an added bonus - in many ways this was more of a good documentary (and in my opinion way better than the Michael Moore documentaries that have been made recently). A worthy Oscar nominee, it's a total surprise to this viewer that the usual suspects have made the grade, and this wonderful, moving and tearful movie has not been considered.<br/><br/>I've flown many many times and the realism of the in-flight scenes and the real life lack of 'ultra-heroism' was a refreshing change from the normal Hollywood pic. The passengers as depicted showed emotions and actions that left me feeling like someone who was on the plane with them.<br/><br/>A truly amazing movie - if you have not seen it, you have no excuses, go see it NOW!"
"shay_D","10","1","3","8 February 2007"," Disturbing
","The movie brings to life the story of the ill-fated United 93 flight with few side-tracked embellishments. Unlike the tradition of movies like Titanic or Peal Harbor, where true historical incidents were woven through fictional love stories to make them more marketable to a wider audience, United 93 uses its literary license to flesh out the characters and events using cockpit black-box transcripts and interviews with family, friends and officials on duty during 9/11. The movie is as close to a true depiction of the actual events as could ever be possible.<br/><br/>The documentary style and use of actual aviation personnel to represent themselves lends to the sense of cold hard reality. The hijackers are presented as regular people, afraid and anxious of death and the failure of the mission, but still compelled to follow their beliefs, driving on sheer adrenaline.<br/><br/>The movie was disturbing to say the least. The sense of panic and fear is conveyed very effectively. The average American viewer could have been a passenger on any of those flights and that suggestion that lingers just under the surface is the most unsettling of all.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie, but would caution the family and friends of those lost on any of the four flights that some scenes may be extremely emotional and distressing to them."

","""United 93"" is brutal. This is not a film for the weak hearted or ones still pained from that dark day 5 and a half years ago. It is perhaps one of the most moving and powerful films I have ever seen. The fact that it was a true story is so gut wrenching. Looking back now, I am surprised I didn't just start crying...I walked out of the theater so stunned and I felt as if I had a knife in my heart. The film is not cliché or sugar coated - it is as realistic and honest as it is able to be. No one in the theater talked - utter silence throughout the credits...<br/><br/>United 93 is mesmerizing. This isn't a movie for America...this is a movie for mankind.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Mario64","10","1","3","4 February 2007"," A powerful and respectful film about tragedy and heroism
","United 93 has no major stars, and not really any truly amazing performances. It just has everyone doing what they're supposed to adding up to a piece of work that's unquestionably one of the most emotionally gripping in modern cinematic history.<br/><br/>The film basically follows a three viewpoints through the tragedies of September the 11th: the air-traffic controllers, the military, and foremost the passengers of United Flight 93. In my opinion the film should win the Academy Award for best Film Editing for moving back and fourth so fluidly between one viewpoint to another, showing how and when certain people learn what's going on, and how and when they make the choices they do. There's not a wasted second of screen time. There is not a lot of character development, and there's absolutely no back stories, and the movie is better off for it. It's about people caught in a tragic situation, about people doing their job, and about people stepping up even when there's a great chance of no great outcome. There are no Hollywood heroes, and even in the case of the terrorists there are no villains, just people being people. We know what's going to happen, and that makes watching the film often nerve-raking, but everything is done with respect and honesty in what happened that day.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass deserves a lot of credit for putting together this masterpiece, but ultimately it's the accuracy that holds it together. I'm sure almost endless research was done to keep this film as true as possible. Sure it's not exactly how it happened, which would have been impossible, but it feels like it's exactly how it happened. Not one moment feels phony and the intense sequences don't make you say wow they did that great, they just leave you silent because you're practically experiencing the tragedy from a perspective few other have ever. This film did fair but not great at the box office understandably because many think this is a little too soon. Whether it's too soon to see something like this is up to each individual. For me it wasn't. I would encourage anyone on the fence to see this because it's a movie to experience; just unlike anything in modern film."
"Chris Knipp","8","1","3","26 December 2006"," A work of remarkable clarity about a terrible day
","Director Paul Greengrass began as a documentary journalist-filmmaker with a political bent and showed himself an excellent maker of the pseudo-documentary in his 2002 Bloody Sunday, about a shocking event in Northern Ireland. He then used his energetic camera to liven up The Bourne Supremacy. His political awareness is evident in United 93 in the lack of emotionalism or bias. We see that the commercial flight direction and military air authorities could not get authorization from above to bring down the hijacked planes even after the demolition of the World Trade Center, but this appears more as a system failure than as an indictment of the government's executive branch or anyone else. We observe people on the ground doing their professional best under extraordinary conditions. And we observe an ordinary flight, with the usual chitchat, until all hell breaks loose and terror strikes.<br/><br/>This real-feeling, superbly edited film is in contrast to the empty grandiosity of Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. United 93 illustrates the principle that a large budget is not even the best way to achieve a vérité effect. On the scene reporters don't have expensive equipment. A look at the cast will show you this film has actual military officers and air traffic controllers playing themselves, most notably including Ben Sliney, who started his job as the FAA's top controller on the morning of Sept. 11; and the passengers and the hijackers on the aircraft are played by people who are unknown to us, as the actual people in that place on that day were.<br/><br/>The budget allowed the film to show officials trying to cope with events and the action on a single plane, so that is what they did. But this gives us the best overview of the events. For Greengrass, economic necessity is also artistic logic. Surely the essence of September 11th is that four coordinated plane hijackings occurred, and that as far as we can tell only one plane's passengers staged a revolt. United 93 is the only one of the four hijackings on that day we have any orchestrated record of, and it is the only one where we know of heroism among the victims  though some of the specifics of the latter as shown in the film are conjectural. Here, we see how the situation was grasped slowly by air traffic and military personnel, and later by the passengers on the flight. Greengrass deserves highest praise for conveying a sense of immediacy and authenticity on both levels.<br/><br/>Some day someone may have the courage and imagination to make a film from the point of view of the perpetrators, as Marco Bellocchio has described the seizing and murder of Aldo Moro in Italy from the point of view of the kidnappers in Good Morning, Night. Such an exercise in point of view can only lead to challenges and stimulation for the viewer. But that is not what we get here. The film maintains a certain neutral distance from everybody.<br/><br/>Though United 93 begins with the hijackers of this plane preparing to go, the image we get of them is convincing but limited. They seem uncoordinated, and since theirs is the plane of the four that didn't find its destination, that makes sense. They are dealt with neutrally. They're neither humanized nor demonized. We simply see their determination and fear. They're on the edge of hysteria and praying all the time. Was that true? At least it is the simplest, most logical way to portray them.<br/><br/>The rapid movement of the hand-held camera is effective in conveying the excitement and disorder of the moment  up to a point. The film is more effective at conveying the action at military command headquarters and multiple air traffic control rooms than at the enormously challenging task of conveying the situation on the plane. There's terrific suspense there, as we see the plane's takeoff being routinely delayed and the hijackers holding off for a long time before going into action. We're about an hour into the film before the actual hijacking begins on board Flight 93, but the action on the ground among the flight coordinators, who've seen the films of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon being hit, has keyed us up to a fever pitch. This is part of what I meant by ""superbly edited."" The cutting also has a fine, rapid rhythm that always feels exactly right.<br/><br/>When things become really chaotic and terrifying on board the plane, this is where the filmmakers themselves lose a little bit too much control. Not being able to see anybody clearly or follow what's going on may fit the event, but a director has a duty to his audience to clarify some things. Those who've chosen United 93 for their lists of the year's best have every right to do so, but they may have gone a bit overboard out of an overwhelming sense of gratitude that anyone could have the sangfroid and clarity to make the unthinkable bearable and watchable; that such an emotionally fraught recent event could have been conveyed in such a balanced way. This is subject matter it's almost impossible for any American to judge objectively, but my sense is that although this is a beautifully made movie, it falls short of being a great or inspiring one, and hence it deserves honorable mention, but not quite a listing among the year's top ten. _________________"

","I just got finished watching this movie on PPV. I had been wanting to see it, but hadn't had the chance to. This movie kept me riveted to my seats, and if there was ever a seat gripper of a movie it was this one. <br/><br/>I saw flight 93 on A&E, and thought this was the more superior movie, especially when it came to the storming of the cockpit by the passengers. (Or it might be because I was watching it on Surround Sound). I sat their gripping my seat and just watched awestruck at the scene that was played before me. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I kept wanting them to be able to reach the cockpit and save the day...but we all know that didn't happen. The movie was able to show the chaos that happened on September 11, and I can only imagine what the flight controllers were going through, and they must have been out of their minds because of all the confusion. My only complaint is that I wished they would have had some scenes of the people who were talking to the passengers on the plane instead of just the passengers...but the movie was so great that I was able to look over it. This is a must see movie for everyone. I just hope that if i'm in a situation similar to this (god willing), I'll be able to react with the courage that the passengers and crew did on that fateful day."
"jaydek58","9","1","3","24 December 2006"," Evoked the same tension and emotions as the actual event itself
","Paul Greengrass has adequately captured the fear, the anxiety, the tension and emotions of that tragic day. I say, 'thoroughly' because I felt very involved, like I was living it with the victims. This movie was detailed enough to provide the average viewer all of the unknown information that was overshadowed by the barrage of media regarding the events that related to the World Trade Center Towers, not to minimize the heartbreak of that particular location. Paul Greengrass would have done a much better job than Oliver Stone, in telling the actual story regarding the Towers, because United 93 captures the true heartache and emotion of September 11, without exploiting the victims pain.<br/><br/>If one is looking for any heroism in these tragic event, Pual Greengrass has done the job tastefully, and sensitively in the telling of United 93. There is no doubt in my mind that he would have done just as well, if not better, in the sensitive retelling of the story about the Towers.<br/><br/>United 93 was so moving that one didn't take the time to analyze it, as one had the time to do with World Trade Center, since the World Trade Center moved slow enough to be scrutinized but United 93 doesn't pause long enough to give you a chance to scrutinize or judge the story, from a viewers perspective. Bravo Mr. Greengrass! A movie very tactfully done!"
"evanston_dad","9","1","3","15 December 2006"," A Tough Watch, But Tremendously Well Done
","In ""United 93,"" the fictionalized account of what may have taken place on board the sole hijacked commercial airliner that did not reach its target on September 11, 2001, director Paul Greengrass has given us a clenched muscle of a movie. The film runs on pure adrenaline; it's terse, lean and frank. It also happens to be extremely difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Filmed in a bare-bones style, with few recognizable actors and very little significant dialogue, the movie offers an account first of what takes place in several air traffic control centers in different locations as the realization that planes are being flown into buildings around the country settles in, and then it confines itself exclusively to the cabin of the doomed flight itself, after the passengers have learned that they're being used for a suicide mission and fight back against the hijackers. Greengrass resists the urge to sentimentalize the events or make heroes of anyone; the resistance of the passengers is not filmed in dramatic slow motion set to a booming soundtrack. Instead, it looks confused, messy and panicked, the desperate acts of people not suited for their roles. Likewise, the scenes that take place in the air traffic control centers have the atmosphere of authentic immediacy. I was at work the morning of 9/11, and the way I learned about what was going on matched very closely the way the people in this movie learn about the events -- through snippets of overheard conversations, images on the news, and random rumours.<br/><br/>Many people have decried this movie as being unnecessary at best and downright dishonest at worst. Some have called it a blatant piece of American propaganda. I don't get that. I admit that while I was watching it, I did wonder if I could justify a film about such a sensitive subject that doesn't really have a point of view and can't even claim to be an accurate recreation of events. But then I watched one of the special features on the DVD, a short film about the relatives of those who died on this flight. Many of the actors met with the families shortly after filming, and Greengrass held a special private screening for the relatives before the studio released the film to the general public. All of the family members felt nothing but solace and a sense of peace after watching the movie. Almost all of them expressed their gratitude to the filmmakers for making the film and telling their loved ones' stories. They seemed unable to understand why others wouldn't want a film like this to be made. One of the rationales used against this movie is that it came out too soon after the date of the tragic events depicted in it. In response to this criticism, one of the family members replies, ""It's not soon enough."" So if the families who are most closely affected by the event don't feel the need to justify the movie's existence, why should anyone else? <br/><br/>And as for those who claim that the film is a piece of manufactured propaganda, the Internet culture now allows every Tom, Dick and Harry to publish his or her opinions in cyberspace (my own included) as uncontested fact, but how do any of these bloggers know what took place on that day? They don't. Perhaps no one but the people on board ever will. Greengrass never claimed that his film was a factual recreation, but rather that it's a suggestion of what might have happened based on available evidence. It's easy to sit at a laptop in a coffee shop and claim that the movie is crap based on a bunch of conspiracy theories floating around in the ether, but until anyone has anything better to offer, I'll stick with Greengrass's version of events <br/><br/>Only a mere five years after 9/11, it's hard to believe that there was ever a time when Americans were so dismissive of terrorism. As this film shows, 9/11 worked because Americans really had no context for believing something of this magnitude could ever happen. Surprise was the terrorists' greatest ally. So no, I don't think it's too soon to show movies about that terrible day, or to keep thoughts of it constantly with us. The more we're prepared, the less likely it is that something this horrible will happen again.<br/><br/>I can't say I was entertained exactly by this movie, though I was never less than completely engrossed in it. But I can certainly say that it is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"Mikeylito","10","1","3","11 December 2006"," Do Not Go Gentle...
","British documentarian Paul Greengrass has constructed a chilling re-creation of the events of that morning by focusing on the one of four flights that did not reach its target.<br/><br/>Greengrass and his collaborators interviewed over 100 friends and family of the crew and passengers of United Airlines flight 93. The result is an absorbing theory of what happened on that morning.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a rare, for this film, moment of melodrama. A man, presumably in a Manhattan hotel room, is praying in Arabic. His companions soon tell him, ""it's time."" We quickly move to Newark International Airport where we view routine happenings. Pilots and flight attendants arrive for the flight. Passengers, including the soon-to-be hijackers, are passing through airport security. The plane is being loaded with luggage, food and, ominously, fuel.<br/><br/>We're taken to various other locations: Air Traffic Control in Boston and the FAA's command center located in Herndon VA. In Herndon, we're introduced to Ben Sliney. It's his first day on the job as National Operations Manager for the FAA. At this point, the day is normal.<br/><br/>Sliney meets with his staff as the plane is loaded and taxied onto the tarmac. Because we, the audience, know what is about to happen, there is palpable tension in the unfolding of routine events: the stowing of carry-on luggage, the taking of breakfast orders, a pre-flight checklist.<br/><br/>While United flight 93 waits on the ground for over 30 minutes for takeoff clearance, American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175 have taken off from Boston and are in the air. Greengrass takes us to Air Traffic Control in Boston where a controller notes a problem with American 11. It is off-course and he can't contact the pilots on the flight.<br/><br/>Back at Newark, the pilots of United 93 finally are cleared for takeoff. A familiar command is given. ""Flight attendants: prepare for takeoff."" For United 93, the point of no return has been reached.<br/><br/>Greengrass masterfully unfolds the events of the morning taking us from the plane to the decision makers-turned-bystanders at air traffic control centers in Boston, Cleveland, and New York. Sliney and his crew desperately try to gather information as one hijack after another becomes apparent.<br/><br/>This is a docudrama. However, what separates this film from the melodramatic fare that normally occupy this genre is the near-total lack of melodrama. Greengrass assembled a cast of largely unknown actors to dramatize his work. In fact, a sizable portion of his cast includes actual participants in the various ground locations to which we are taken, especially the aforementioned Sliney.<br/><br/>However, the key cast member, which goes uncredited, is our memory (, or in the case of those not alive on that day, history). We remember what happened that day: in New York, in Washington, and on Flight 93.<br/><br/>We sit and watch a meticulous and dramatic re-creation of what may have happened that morning on Flight 93. Since no one survived, we will never know what actually happened. However, Greengrass' interviews including anecdotal accounts of telephone calls from the plane, cockpit transmissions, and other events probably come the closest to giving us a sense of what happened that day."

One of the most powerful things about the film is that you know the airplane is going to crash but as the movie develop you hope that the people in the airplane is going to survive and when it crash you are breathless and you are done and this film has an impact on you several hours after you have left the movie. I also have to say something about Paul greengras his script and his direction is faultless and I think this is going to win an academy award for Best original screenplay and probably also Best director Paul greengras deserve that. I also hope that the music of the film is going to win an Oscar because it is absolutely breathtaking.<br/><br/>And I have to say that if the academy don't select this as best picture of the year I will be very surprised and I will be sad because it is the most important film of the year."
"general-melchett","10","1","3","9 November 2006"," A powerful, heart-rending and shocking film - United 93 is absolutely spiffing.
","United 93 is possibly one of this year's most controversial films - but it is one that was made for a purpose - the first ever feature film on 9/11. And I am glad to see that the first ever film on this topic was this. United 93's biggest success, I thought, was its strong, realistic, and powerful script - the way we switched between Air Control and the United 93 flight was a very well-done theory, and one that has been done in a brilliant and truthful way - nobody exactly knew what was going on then. Though we never will know what it was really like, United 93 brings us extremely close to reality, and lets us feel everybody's struggles.<br/><br/>The scenes on the plane when the terrorists took over were hugely distressing - the hand-held camera work and lack of Hollywoodisation only made it more shocking. The most upsetting scenes on this film were the ones on which the passengers were speaking to their families by Air phone - they knew full well that their fate was not a good one, but just couldn't put it to their loved ones easily. The ending was extremely unforgettable - the bravery of the passengers who stood up against their assailants shall never be forgotten, and is brought brilliantly to the screen. Though there aren't many clear scenes of violence and stabbing, the screaming and blood make the experience of United 93 a hugely distressing one - this was easily best with a low budget. The last ever shot was one that shall stick in my mind forever - the ground drawing closer and closer, and then all went black.<br/><br/>More good things in this film are the musical score, for a kick-off - it was hugely tense, involved no searing orchestral music (John Williams is a culprit for this crime), and made the scenes in various Air Control bases much more tense - and the little-known cast, who have delivered brilliant, captivating, and expert performances - Tom Hanks be damned. The opening scenes were hugely difficult, especially the ones with the waiting passengers and pilots - they had absolutely no idea what was going to become of them, and that their experiences would one day become recorded in the annals of history.<br/><br/>On the whole - United 93 is nothing short of spiffing - even the title menu on the DVD had me captivated before I even started the film. A must see. 10/10"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","3","7 November 2006"," ""Do we have any communication with the President at all?""
","I have yet to see any of the films that have been coming out lately about the 9/11 attacks, and I had deep reservations about this movie, simply because I had a hard time imagining how they could make a movie about what happened that day and really do justice to the events that took place and the people that were involved. I guess I just couldn't imagine how they could make a movie about 9/11 and keep politics out of it, but director Paul Greengrass has done just that, and with spectacular success. I think that the only line in the entire movie which might have carried some political message is the one I put in my summary line above, but even this would only be a political statement if it were forced to be.<br/><br/>In reality, no they didn't have any communication with the President, but that was because he was sitting in that classroom in Florida. He was making a public appearance and was simply not available for standard contact, I guess you would say. Bush largely escapes criticism in Greengrass's film, which I must say is something of a relief. I think we have seen plenty of films that bash Bush for his response to and behavior during the 9/11 attacks, regardless of how relevant they are. Greengrass understands that we don't need to see that anymore.<br/><br/>The government itself, however, receives the full blow of harsh criticism, spearheaded by such scenes as the air traffic controllers trying to get permission to act against the hijacked planes before they reach major metropolitan areas. They are still struggling to get this permission more than an hour after the second plane has hit the World Trade Center, and if I remember correctly, up until that time they were only given something like two or three jets. Unarmed ones.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film tells the powerful story of the people aboard the flight that took control of the airplane from the hijackers and disrupted what may very well have been the destruction of the White House. Regardless of the lives lost (the White House had been evacuated long before the plane would have hit), to have lost the White House would have done catastrophic psychological damage to the country. In a different way than the loss of life in New York had, but if the White House had been hit, people would barely have noticed the Pentagon.<br/><br/>The film succeeds not only as a humanitarian story about the incredible bravery that took place on board United 93, but also as a telling of the events as they happened. It succeeds as a crackling thriller as good as any of Tom Clancy's ""Ryan"" films, with the added bonus that everything that takes place is real. It works as a thriller without even needing to resort to fiction or contrived situations. The tension that you feel is so real that it's almost like you're watching the news. <br/><br/>As I said, I haven't seen World Trade Center, and I'm a little nervous about it, mostly because Nicholas Cage is starring, but if they can make movies this good about the 9/11 attacks, leave the politics at the door, and tell the story so powerfully and with so much respect for those lost, then it will settle my reservations about films about 9/11. Whether this can be done with the second Iraq war, however, remains a mystery."

I believe they have done their best to depict what happened on flight United 93 and would recommend anyone to watch it.<br/><br/>Even though we knew the outcome we were still on the edge of our seat willing the 'heros' to succeed and save the flight. Incredible viewing, though not from a movie buff's point of view. It is so hard to imagine being in the shoes of the passengers yet the movie brings you close enough to try.<br/><br/>The DVD contains extras where the actors meet with the families who are still living with their tragedy everyday. Some of who dies had very young children at home and families yet still they gave their lives to try to save others. Incredibly moving."

","By the time I actually saw ""United 93"", I had read quite a few reviews of the film, almost all very positive. And of course, I knew the details of the real life event. But none of these prepared me for the raw intensity and power of Greengrass' script and direction. By choosing to make it in the semi-documentary style using unknown actors, he took a big risk but the end product is beyond reproach. I sat clutching a cushion throughout the film, palms sweating and heart pounding. The carefully edited depiction of the reactions both in the air and on the ground as the tragedy unfolds is a masterpiece of film-making. The last 10 minutes are positively gut-wrenching and are going to remain with me for the rest of my days. I am sure that only minimal artistic licence had to used in guessing the events on board the plane and even that must be very close to actually what happened. If this film does not win Oscars for Best Picture, Direction & Screenplay & Editing, the awards will cease to have any meaning for me."
"herbsewell","10","1","3","17 October 2006"," Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made
","United 93 succeeds at creating, what Greengrass called, a ""believable truth."" The power of this motion picture, using the improvisation of professional and non-professional actors and a documentary look, is in its drawing directly from the 9/11 Commission Report (cell calls, ATC data, NORAD data, eyewitness testimony) adding only a speculation on whether or not 93's passengers breached the cockpit door. As Greengrass points out in his commentary, the commission report said they were ""seconds away."" You are never anywhere but where the filmmaker wants you to be: on board the aircraft, in the various ATC centers, with the hijackers. It is impossible not to feel the fear and the rage of the passengers and ultimately impossible to escape remembering our own sadness and emptiness and resolve."

And the key element to the whole 9/11 events was ""time""...and it's even more-so now in the post 9/11 times.<br/><br/>Of course as a movie...it needs to make money to cover the costs of making it in the first place. But I don't think ""making money"" was the sole purpose of making of this film.<br/><br/>The events that happened on that flight was unprecedented I think...it's the only one where the passengers were able to assess the situation from cell-phone calls made to relay up-to-the minute information about WTC and Pentagon, realizing to the passengers that they were on a suicide mission. They knew the evil they were facing, and they knew their fate. And the most gut-wrenching part was the fact that most passengers had time to call their loved ones and say goodbye for the last time. That's too real for words. I believe that the contact with the loved ones in the plane gave the passengers incentive, motivation and strength to plan the attack against the hijackers so that they can back to their families. The evil in that plane was real and palpable....as is the evil that was happening in New York that day...and the passengers chose to become fierce warriors to fight against it.<br/><br/>We must face this evil...whether we like it or not...it must be dealt with...just like what happened on that flight. It's a hard fact....a hard truth....just as 9/11 was a hard truth...but we can't look away. We must know this evil before we can even begin to destroy it.<br/><br/>It was a hard fact on that plane that day.....and to watch this movie might help to come to grips with the reality of this evil that actively exists in this world today....because we know the painful outcome of that flight can not be changed. We have to accept that their fate was due to an act of pure evil, done to us as well, collectively as a nation. We most certainly are at war...to deny that would be foolish, damaging and insulting to the memories of those who died for our nation on that day."

","United 93 is an extremely important movie on highly sensitive subject of terrorist attacks which took place on the 11th of September, 2001. However, important doesn't always mean good. It's relatively easy to shoot a pompous flick using cheap tricks in order to arouse strong emotions among the audience. After the screening, I can say that United 93 isn't and even does not try to be this kind of film. Director/screenwriter Paul Greengrass depicts dramatic events by the application of documentary style through the entire film. The film is shot solely with the use of hand-held cameras. Although at the beginning its chaotic style is hard to swallow, with time it appears to be an ideal solution to portray a tragedy in a credible, thorough way. The fact that the cast comprises of practically unknown actors is also of great importance. Thanks to daring formal measures, we are under the impression that we're really among those people on a plane. Continually vibrating camera gradually triggers off anxiety and almost unbearable tension. Greengrass rises to the occasion and directs with great reverence and restraint all the way to the completely devastating ending which leaves viewers speechless and the picture turns out to be a rewarding experience. To conclude, United 93 is simultaneously an incredibly powerful, intense movie and excellent homage to the victims of every terrorist attack. Therefore, the viewing is essential."
"charchuk","6","1","3","13 September 2006"," Emotionally powerful, but not necessarily great
","A very emotionally powerful finale does not make this a perfect movie, or even a great one, though it is an important one. For the most part, it felt more like a documentary than a fictional, creatively crafted film, which works, I guess, but made it confusing and even boring at times. The beginning hour or so, which focused mostly on the air traffic controllers, FAA, and military, was the prime culprit of this, and I felt like a was watching a doc much more than a film. The scenes which focus on the flight itself are by far the strongest, because it feels very real, raw, and moving. The shaky cam works best here, because it feels like you're part of the action, rather than watching it. Unfortunately, not enough time is spent developing the story on the flight, and it feels shortchanged by the end of it. The mix of unknown actors and people playing themselves makes it very realistic, though not necessarily better. The ending is very emotional, perhaps the most of any film I've seen, but it doesn't make the entire film better - just the ending. Overall, a good film that is very realistic, but also overrated."
"kidboi","10","1","3","13 September 2006"," Unbelievable
","That is the one word that describes the movie for me. It has been more than a week since i have seen this amazing piece of work and i am still in the power of it. Yes, it's that great.<br/><br/>Now, for a movie to catch your attention, what does it have to do? Well, for me, it has to have character development, the movie has to introduce the main characters to me. It has to show me their habits, it has to show me what are their turn-ons or turn-offs, it has to make me believe this character is not just a card board cut-out. A documentary, on the other hand, shows everything form aside, it doesn't interfere with the conversations, there aren't any scenes that explain the character, yet you steel feel for them as they are real. United 93 has the ability, a mystical force, if you will, that makes you believe the characters are real, that makes you feel like you know them for all of your life, as if they were your friends. And United 93 does this without studying characters. It is a hybrid movie, half-motion picture, half-documentary.<br/><br/>I think everybody would agree that it's pretty hard, or even impossible, to make a 9/11 film without touching politics, but United 93 does it. It doesn't make anybody a hero, it doesn't make anybody a fool, it is a look from aside, it makes you feel like you are one of the passengers, it's all about the moment, not about the aftermath.<br/><br/>United 93 has been my most powerful film experience to date, not only did i cry towards the end, i was also shaking. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before during a film. This is, without doubt, one of the most powerful and important films of the 21st century, and i truly do hope people will remember it. I certainly will.<br/><br/>10/10"

It is (to my knowledge) a very direct portrayal of the events of September 11th. Much of the first hour of the movie takes place not on the plane, but in air-traffic control rooms on the east coast, as they figure out that these attacks are taking place. The second half of this movie was very powerful. I was very moved watching the people on the plane as they knew that they were likely to die soon, as I think most people who remember September 11th would be. That being said, the first half of the movie was pretty darn boring. I think that the thing is, this isn't really a movie. There aren't really characters, or a plot, or dialouge. Their more just trying to show something that happened in the most direct way possible. That being said I'd still recommend seeing it once in your life."

The film makers have shown a lot of respect by taking unknown actors. There was one frighting aspect: The hijackers were portrayed as common people.

","I've just read a couple of the previous comments and I'd just like to add that I don't agree with the whole American heroes thing. For those who consider the movie is an additional movie dedicated to showing how great the American ideal is, just consider being on board for a second. I've seen the film as a real documentary plus the fact that following the people on board makes you feel the tension even more. Yes they were common people just trying to save their lives, but who wouldn't have ? Considering the events and the fact that they all knew two planes had been hijacked and thrown into the WTC in Manhattan, I think this is something normal that they tried to act and not wait for their death to come. To conclude, the movie doesn't show them as heroes because what they did (for their own sake) doesn't make them heroes. It is the context that makes them heroes. And heroes they probably were !"

"EmperorNortonII","8","1","3","18 July 2006"," United 93: A Tale of Terror and Hope
","""United 93"" is the first movie about the events of September 11th, 2001. Some critics have speculated that, after nearly five years, it was too soon to make such a movie. But the surviving family members of those who had perished had nothing but support for director Paul Greengrass. And ultimately, the movie proves to be respectful and well-crafted. One good thing about ""United 93"" is the flow of the story. It starts steadily, as we see the terrorists calmly preparing for their mission, the crew and passengers boarding the airplane. Then the tension builds as reports of the other hijacked planes surface, and chaos reigns in air traffic control centers. Finally, the story reaches its climax as the passengers rise up against the terrorists. Admirably, there are no exaggerated performances or characters. The terrorists are not stereotypical villains, and the passengers are not over-the-top heroes. The immortal words of Todd Beamer, ""Let's roll,"" are not presented as a catchphrase, but underplayed. The cast consists of unknown actors, and also includes air traffic personnel who were actually on duty that day, including Ben Sliney, supervisor at the National Air Traffic Control Center at Hearndon, Virginia. ""United 93"" presents a shocking moment in American history, a tale that simply had to be told."

Its attention to details is obviously unbelievable, the characters - mostly unknown actors - are potent and make the moviegoers feel like they were on that flight. Plus it also shows very effectively the errors made by public authorities in dolling with the tragedies."

"UnreaL_TW2000","10","1","3","28 June 2006"," Feedback for the trailer
","I was browsing through movie trailer section of Apple Quicktime official website when I came across a link to United93. Initially it seemed to me just another movie about an aircraft accident. I usually had no interest in this kind of movie, but since there's a link to production crew interview clip (most movies do not have an interview with the pro. crew open to the public), I went ahead to watch the interview.<br/><br/>The interview was no longer than a couple of minutes, but then it stays as an infinite loop in my head.. United 93 is not really a movie. In fact, it is a genuine documentary of what happened on September 11 a few years back in the States. The families of the passengers on those planes involved in the accident and the survivors of the plane-crash contributed to the realization of this documentary. While many of those plane-high-jacks took place that day, most of the viewers were sitting at home or in their office. Most viewers are not first-hand witnesses and know nothing except what the media like newspaper or television broadcast showed them ---------- until now.<br/><br/>It is a documentary like no others. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, most of us were unaware of the details of events happened on that very day. The purpose of this documentary is to let everyone understand the details of what really happened, and how the crisis was handled by the government and military officials. If you are someone who cares about 'the truth behind', this is something you wouldn't want to miss."

","This film was respectfully done. Very non Hollywood. No sappy music or heroic speeches. Just very raw and very real. I'm not one to be moved by a film but watching the first half the viewer is tempted to want to jump on the screen and warn the characters of their fate. It's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit as it deserves a place in motion picture history. The only complaint I had is that the lady from the TV show Wings was playing one of the passengers which was a distraction and break in the reality of the moment.

No political statement, no overacting, and the actors that played the terrorists should be expecting a background check they were so convincing.

","United 93 Director/Writer: Paul Greengrass Running time: 111 minutes Certificate: 15 Amazing! What a film. United 93 uproots you from amongst the cinema audience and plants you, heart and soul, into a passenger seat on the only hijacked flight which failed to hit its target on September 11th 2001.<br/><br/>The film is shot in very much documentary style, filmed in real time with a grainy contrast and close, fast moving hand held direction, which encapsulates the realism of the overwhelmingly tense ordeal. Many of the military and air ground staff were actually played by real employees, none of the actors where known stars and the simplicity of the story telling all contributed to this feel of reality, which was perfect for a film that endeavoured to re-create one this centuries most astonishing disasters.<br/><br/>The story is very simple. We are taken into the normal working day of the National Air Traffic Control Centre and a section of the Military. Once we are familiarised with each department and their function, the drama begins. The Twin Towers are attacked. As the first plane explodes into the side of the building, the hijackers on flight 93 begin their reign of terror. By the time the Pentagon is attacked, the hostages realise that they are not being held for ransom and neither will they be returning home. Amidst the tears of fear and the heartbreaking phone calls to loved ones, fuelled by the utmost courage and bravery, the passengers on flight 93 of United Airlines of America decide that they will not be idle front row spectators to the destruction of the White house.<br/><br/>The patient build up of this film can easily be mistaken for a slow and boring beginning. But the British Writer/Director takes his time in familiarising the audience with certain terminology and characters, whilst slowly winding the coil of this film until the level of tension built up, could bind galaxies and leaves you biting through nail, finger, bone and marrow. And when the coil is released, we are caught in an emotionally charged, whirlwind of a 3rd act which leaves you frozen at the edge of your seat, with tears poised on the edge of your eyelids. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Best scene: As the first plane hits its target and the time to attack beckons for the terrorists on flight 93, the suspense created leaves you shaking."
"AndrewPhillips","10","1","3","21 June 2006"," We should remember
","I fully understand that for many this film has been made too soon after the horrific events of September 11th. I have to admit I was one of them, on seeing the trailer at the cinema I was shocked to think that a motion picture was even being contemplated let alone made and released.<br/><br/>As time went on I started to read and hear things about it that got me thinking this was not one of your typical Hollywood films, big stars, etc and that intrigued me. So today I went to see it, with some trepidation.<br/><br/>The actors get across that these are just every day people like you and me, faced with an extraordinary situation. Ben Sliney, playing himself stands out. What a major undertaking for each and every one of those actors who took on a role of one of the passengers, the responsibility to that persons family and friends must have been overwhelming at times, so to each of them well done.<br/><br/>There is a tension that runs throughout this film. The attention to everyday detail is almost too painful to watch as are the phone calls to loved ones, yet again though there is no Hollywood schmaltz, just honest pure feelings handled in a sensitive way.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass has made a film that, without all the trappings of Hollywood that makes us sit up and think. He makes us care about people he tells us little about. He makes us will the passengers to bash the brains out of the hijackers, even though we do not believe in violence. He makes us feel. Most important of all though is the fact that he makes us remember. The people on that plane did not set out to be heros, they acted out of a human need to survive but in doing so they became heros, saving numerous lives.<br/><br/>I know it might be too soon, but these people died standing up for their right to live, and I for one think we should never forget that, and if this film goes some way to making us remember then it has done a good job."
"dfogarty","10","1","3","14 June 2006"," An uncomfortable film
","This film moved me perhaps more than any other. Comparisons with Schindler's List are not relevant: Spielberg's film has been discredited by news that Herr Schindler may not have been the saint he appeared to be in the film. United 93, on the other hand, appears to stay as close to the truth as it can.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""truth"" is rarely absolute. The film portrays the truth devoid of context and this is its stumbling point. The truth behind these attacks is very complex and, if lessons are to be learnt, I think Greengrass could have attempted to contextualise the deaths of these innocent people by pointing out (perhaps in the written epilogues) that similar deaths are caused on a daily basis...and it is this fact that probably lay behind the decision of the hijackers to do what they did.<br/><br/>I realise that this may be offensive to some people, but it is not intended to be. The actions of the hijackers were horrific and the film does a great service in ensuring that the victims on United 93 will never be allowed to fade away into statistics. Their memory will be preserved for eternity. As a work of art, the film is also astonishingly good. At one point I almost left the cinema so ashamed was I that I had paid money to see the final minutes of these people's lives.<br/><br/>However, I think that the message we should draw from this film must be that it is never acceptable to kill innocent people in war, whether they are American citizens in an aeroplane or Afghan wedding guests or a mother and child in a house where Al Qaeda's leader has been located.<br/><br/>I fear that the film will further harden prejudices against Muslims. The image of attackers praying in Arabic juxtaposed against victims praying the same Christian prayer left me feeling very uncomfortable. Of course, it is not the film's fault that people feel this prejudice against people. That is down to manipulation by the media and the governments' (wilful) failures to address this problem. However, I wonder why Greengrass didn't try to redress the imbalance by pointing out that horrifying as these deaths were, they are repeated regularly in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan as bombs explode in employment offices, missiles home in on market places and shells fall on beaches."

","This is probably the best movie I'll never see again. I can't say that for certain, but right now I feel that I wouldn't want to see it again. However, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I highly recommend it for anyone that feels they are ready to deal with such a sensitive subject again.<br/><br/>This is probably the least ""Hollywood"" movie I've ever seen. It was superbly presented, and it almost makes you feel like there was a floating camera there that documented the actual events. A true ""fly on the wall"" kind of feel if you will. Mundane, ordinary conversations such as one between pilots regarding how many days they're having to fly that month are portrayed so realistically. The real time aspect helps to give a feel of reality while creating a sense of building anticipation and anxiety that takes you back to that day. You could have heard a pin drop in the theater until the latter scenes. Then you begin to hear an almost universal whimper and sniffle from throughout the theater.<br/><br/>It gives great insight into how the events of that day truly changed our everyday mindset. When you see the ATC and FAA reactions to the fact that they think they have a hijacking in progress it's angering until you remember how it used to be pre-9/11. We were all guilty of the attitude we would now chastise anyone for taking. I don't know it for sure, but I understand that most or all of the ATC and FAA agents in the film are the actual ones that dealt with the events of that day, not actors. You also won't likely recognize many, if any, of the actors in any of the other roles. That aspect helps to make everyone come across as just an ordinary, everyday person dealing with an extraordinary situation. After seeing the movie I went and checked out pictures of the Untied 93 hijackers, and the casting for those roles was absolutely perfect. <br/><br/>I'm proud of the fact that this movie was made in the way that it was. I was afraid we were going to see an over-dramatized, sensationalized version of the story, but it was done very respectfully."

","When I first heard about this film, I dismissed the idea of seeing it almost immediately. Why would I want to subject myself to watching people hurtling to their doom? However, I then read several positive reviews that convinced me it was worth seeing. After all, what event is more important than September 11th in contemporary history? It is important that we all think about the meaning of that day, and this film provides an interesting perspective on the events both inside United flight 93 and in the air traffic control centres that watched events unfold. The film looks like a real-life documentary, and this effect is accentuated by the use of unknown actors and even people on the ground who played themselves. The director has gone to great lengths to try and portray events as they actually occurred, using the best available evidence, and seems to have made reasonable guesses about what else may have occurred inside the doomed airline. This film leaves you with plenty to think about and should not be missed."

","This is such a realistic portrayal of some of the events of Sept. 11, 2001 that it is difficult to evaluate this film as one does other movies. Yet, this is an artistic creation, and all decisions regarding script, cast, set, etc. were made for specific reasons by the director. I believe Paul Greengrass has achieved something never before in cinema--a truly compelling and gripping portrayal of actual events, without succumbing to Hollywood jargon or cliché or an overindulgence in sentiment, taste or reverence. I didn't realize until after watching this movie the first time that the cast includes people who portray themselves. While that lends a semblance of authenticity I don't think it would have been any less realistic with all professional actors. This is a movie that deserves respect and recognition because it succeeds as an outstanding film as well as a credible account of events. I doubt any other movies that portray the events of 9-11 will come close to achieving such a rare balance."

"Robert_duder","8","1","3","25 May 2006"," Nicely made, tastefully done, a tribute to heroes!!
","I feel that before I go ahead and review this film I have to make a small statement. September 11th, 2001, devastated the world, especially of course those families who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. There has been a lot of controversy around Hollywood seemingly trivializing the events but it has to be expected that films would be made about. World wars, Serial killers, bombings, and worse have all been subject to film making and if done right simply recognizes the events and helps us remember. I have no beef with films being made about 9/11 and I review this film with the utmost respect, and caring for families and victims of 9/11 and those hijacked planes. My less than perfect score does not in any way represent how I feel about the situation or the people but rather film making style, and how I felt about the movie. If I offend anyone I am deeply sorry.<br/><br/>United 93 is made in an extremely unique and different way. The cast is the exact definition of an ""ensemble"" because no one person gets a ""lead role"" or to be the defining character. Instead this is a very real dramatization, in real time of the events on 9/11 eventually leading up to the ill fated flight United 93 who's passengers took control of the aircraft in an effort to stop the terrorists from hitting any other targets. It is believed that they very possibly saved a Washington Target, perhaps even the White House. The film unfolds at a fairly significant speed and each event hits home like a rocket. Watching those planes hit those towers absolutely transports you back to that day and makes you sick to your stomach. We get to see perspectives from the Air Traffic Controllers, and of course the crew, passengers and even the terrorists of United 93.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass who wrote and directed the film did a stellar job. I think it made people nervous that Greengrass also directed the intense action sequel Bourne Supremacy and he could have made a real big budget Hollywood mess out of a very emotional subject but instead he made it so downright real it was barely a film. It's near impossible to say any one thing about any one actor in the film, they all do such an incredible job of just being real, scared, hurt, angry people. Greengrass even remarkably gave us a small peek into the terrorists who were also scared, determined. angry, and even having second thoughts at certain times. That's pretty incredible to be able to bring some of the worst real life villains in history and humanize them almost to the point of feeling sympathy for their religious fanaticism. The film doesn't try to be what it's not and never tries to add anything for dramatic effect. It's probably one of the most accurate film portrayals in history.<br/><br/>In some ways that becomes this films short coming. It has no ""plot line"" per se, no characters that you can really get involved with, it's not your average movie going experience. It's almost documentary like without actual information being provided. It drags a little in the middle and the ending is very abrupt but at the same time completely appropriate. It's almost impossible to judge a movie of this caliber because it's not meant to be entertainment per se but truly a tribute to those heroes who possibly saved countless lives. The film is absolutely worth seeing for the reason alone that it's probably one of the most uniquely done films ever. And on top of that it's a touching and well done tribute to those men and women. 8/10"

During the film and after I left the theater, I was filled with a large array of emotions. Sadness, empathy, anger, and vengeance come mostly to mind.

To see a depiction of what it was like on board was gut wrenching - awful to see all those people say their final goodbyes, the tears, the anguish and some even had hope that they would be OK and get out of this alive. It was definitely hard movie to watch. Throughout this movie, you can't help but wonder how it would be possible for so much miscommunication and initial disregard of the first hijacked plane - how much time was wasted and how little it says about the control towers who had to turn on CNN to see what happened to flight 11.

And when the passengers called their families and friends giving messages of love and goodbyes to them it made me think of how precious our time with our family and friends are. The people on that plane gave their lives to their country and that demands respect. Although they were scared they fought and bleed giving courage to their country when it would need it most.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","3","1 May 2006"," True Heroes
","Timing is everything. Much of the criticism of ""United 93"" does not pertain to the movie itself, rather its timing. Is America or the world for that matter ready for a movie about 9/11? I think there is always a time for and need for stories of ordinary people who become great heroes. I think that Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" is a very powerful and moving motion pictureby far the year's Best. What also makes it unsettling is the beginning of the movie is so unnerving, because we all know how it all ends. ""United 93"" is about heroes arising in chaos, not so much a lost cause act or one of desperation, rather people taking action out of courage and a commitment to do what is right. Greengrass's story inspires and touches one's very soul. Part of the experience for me was that of anger and my disgust for bulliesalthough the hijackers are jihad or holy warriors (in their minds), they are bullies. And like most ""bullies"" they ultimately face people who reclaim their nobility and courage as heroes taking a stand. My guy says in the movie, "" I don't care if it (the bomb) is real, I'm going to break his f--king hand!"" Greengrass, an acclaimed TV documentary filmmaker, employs a similar style and look in ""United 93"". The movie is unplugged and powerful. <br/><br/>I had read that Director Greengrass chose for the most part unrecognizable actors so as to focus attention on the story. As an ensemble the cast is phenomenal. In the story 9/11 begins as any other day at the airport. However, we see Ziad Jarrah (an excellent Khalid Abdallah) and his men prepare for their suicide mission. They among the other 40 passengers and crew board United Flight 93 bound for San Francisco. Ben Sliney plays himself as FAA head during this recreation of the events of 9/11. He is an amazing man who turns in an outstanding performance. <br/><br/>Three other planes were hijacked for terrorist attack. The FAA slowly uncovers this terrorist attack as the four planes one by one disappear off the transponder grid. It also turns out that on September 11, NORAD was conducting a large scale exercise. After the first airliner crashed into the World Trade Center, the havoc surrounded FAA jurisdiction and NORAD command strategy and privilege. Only the President can authorize an Air Force ""kill"" operation over US air space, and the President was not immediately reachable. Also NORAD has well defined strategy for outside threats, but little in terms of internal domestic attacks. Ziad and his men take control of United 93 armed with box cutters and using the threat of plastic explosive bomb. Their mission target is the White House. Using the on-board phone it soon becomes apparent to passenger Thomas Burnett (solid and strong Christian Clemenson) that Flight 93 is on a suicide mission. He along with Mark Bingham (quiet and powerful Cheyenne Jackson), the rest of the passengers and crew realize that they must rush the cockpit and regain control of the plane. <br/><br/>""United 93"" leaves an indelible mark in our conscience. The passengers on United 93 know in all likelihood that they are going to die. While they make plans for their last stand, people call loved ones to say good bye for the last time. The experience is heart-wrenching and humbling. I wonder in such a situation knowing that I were going to die, and what there was to do was fight to the very end if I would be as brave. The people on Flight 93 made that choice, and were amazing heroes. Perhaps that is some consolation to the loved ones and family members they left behind. The passengers of United Flight 93 embodied all that is brave and noble. They shall always be remembered. Paul Greengrass honors both their selfless action and legacy in ""United 93"". ""United 93"" is at times difficult to watch, and should be seen."

For those who say the movie came out too soon, I would echo the sentiments of Todd Beamer's dad who said: ""It is not too soon to honor those heroes.

Here is true patriotism: the willingness to remember the mistakes of the past and to admit them in public so that change for the better is possible. These people showed us the chaos that they endured as they tried to follow their training and protocol and yet failed to get cooperation or permissions from their superior officers or counterparts at other agencies.<br/><br/>I am glad that Mr. Greengrass decided to make the movie in real time for the events that occurred aboard United 93.

","This movie was not a good movie. It is easy to go for tragic emotional impact with an event such as 9/11. In fact, in making a movie about 9/11, an amazing amount of tact and respect are necessary for this. The events in this movie were highly dramatized is highly speculative, but in melodramatic way. This review is not an attempt to belittle what happened that day or on that flight; rather, this is an attempt to say how far off this movie was from reality, to say how far off this movie really was from telling the story it was going for.<br/><br/>While the movie tries to capture the essence of the shock of that day, and while it somewhat outlines events that happened, it cannot help but be taken in a soap opera way. It is a watering down of an important day. It is hardly deserving of awards, and it seems as though the only reason this film gained notoriety is because it was made about 9/11. If one steps back from the film and really watches it, it is no where near a great film.

","United 93 was well done in some respects but that is only skin deep. There were subtle but disturbing things about how the movie presented things. To begin with, they really presented the terrorists in a sympathetic light. The lead terrorist is a reluctant participant who even takes the time to call home and say ""I love you"" before attempting to murder hundreds of people. The facts on these terrorists do not support this in the least. They trained for months if not years. They were fanatics who willingly signed up for this. Their views told them that they were about to enter paradise (40 virgins included) and that they would even be able to have 20 select friends and family join them in the afterlife (sounds like a sweet deal to me). Video footage of Mohammed Atta (the head terrorist) shows him smiling at the prospect in his preparations to carry this out.<br/><br/>United 93 also EMPHASIZED problems in how the government responded to this baffling and unthinkable attack. How many times did they show a lack of resources or a lack of communication (over and over). From the standpoint of 20/20 hindsight it is easy to criticize. The movie is harsh in its portrayal and hardly cuts people any slack. What president has EVER ordered a hijacked plane to be shot down? Blame blame blame the administration but portray the terrorists as sincere, devout Muslims who really only want to be true to their convictions and they still have some humanity about them. Show the terrorists briefly attack passengers with minimal blood but then show rebellious passengers bludgeon a terrorist to death graphically as they pounce on him like a pack of wolves. Show passengers pray Our Father as they face death but show the Muslims praying to their god at the same time as though there is some kind of perverse parallel or equivalence.<br/><br/>United 93 clearly has an agenda behind it. Even the DVD documentary is telling when it portrays a woman expressing her anger, not at the terrorists of course, but at the administration for what it failed to do in this historic and unprecedented attack on American soil. I think it is sad that the makers of this film used this tragedy to foist propaganda. It is hardly faithful to what happened that day and any positives are eclipsed by the negatives of Hollywood orthodoxy."

Watching it now, you imagine that if you saw these terrorists at the airport, your suspicions would immediately be aroused, but thinking back to pre 9/11, the film depicts how everyone was oblivious to what was going on around them."

","This astonishing movie has some very strong points I would like to address: We've got a problem. In September 11, 2001 America was the victim. In a strange, perverse way, the rest of the world began to suspect that America was the attacker. Most of the people in my country don't give a dime about the ""official"" story. They think that all was set by the government or at least with the complicity of some politicians, including the President, George W. Bush.<br/><br/>This movie is not a propaganda and that's why It could serve as a testimony in a better way than any other efforts, such as government press releases and fake documentaries: There are no superhero characters, terrorists are what they are, but not monsters, there are no ""patriotic"" or didactic dialogs or actions, and, best of all, it didn't buy any of the conspiracy theories. Just the simple facts. The truth, sometimes, is very hard to believe in."

This movie does nothing but honor these heroes who gave their life for our country and tells exactly how heartless and cruel these terrorist were that committed these incomprehensible acts against these innocent people and the many more they would have killed had these men and women not stood up against them. It doesn't play up the drama to add more adventure or excitement for the viewers and is told in more of a documentary way.

","I must admit when I first heard about this film I feared that it could have been handled so badly and even may have been made a bit too soon after the event. To be honest if it wasn't for my wife I probably wouldn't have even gone to see it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at the way the subject matter was handled and the drama was built nicely. With a powerful story that everyone in the cinema knew inside out and some fantastic performances I would recommend this movie to anyone. I found myself thinking about what I was doing on that September day and the sheer mundane normality of ordinary people turning up to board a flight brought home the absolute horror of the atrocity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I did find myself trying to work out who was an actor compared to who was really present that day but that is just a minor quibble. If there is a complaint about this film it is that it went for the gung ho America will not take this lying down ending with the passengers storming the cockpit. As no one really knows what went on in those last seconds of Flight 93 to try and imagine it for us all was a bit crass for my liking. I believe this would have been a far more powerful piece of drama if the film had ended at the infamous ""let's roll"" statement and left the rest to our imagination. As a result the film is slightly overlong and I came away feeling a little disappointed. I can understand why the producers thought the ending was a good idea as it would definitely have Middle America standing up and hollering in that way only Americans can!

The passengers had precious little time to determine what was going on and to devise a counterattack. You know of course that they're going to fail and the passengers certainly knew that the likelihood that they could take over the plane and fly it themselves was almost non-existent. But they were determined that if they were to die they weren't going to allow the plane to hurt anyone else. They died fighting and representing the greatest values of our country---self-sacrifice, teamwork, faith in God and iron courage."

The director himself spoke of the bravery of those terrified passengers as the first act of retaliation in a Post 9/11 world.

"keith-farman-1","8","1","4","7 June 2006"," Superbly crafted docu-drama. But.....
","If this film sets the tone for the many 9/11 related films in the pipeline it will have served a useful purpose. Though necessarily conjectural in detail, in broad terms it tries to tell the nightmare story whose tragic ending we all know, without embellishment. Claustrophobic cinematography, an atmospheric understated score and self-effacing performances by a largely unknown cast, give Greengrass's film an impressive air of authority. Its razor-sharp, relentless editing creates a crescendoing pace towards chaos that is so effective that at moments one has to remind oneself to breathe out.<br/><br/>No, the questions that press in remorselessly are not aesthetic. There is no sign of disrespect towards these iconic victims in the form or content of this superbly crafted docu-drama. It is in the fact of its existence and its commercial cinematic production and distribution within a disturbingly opaque political context, that one's doubts and qualms are aroused. There are no rights and wrongs here - only judgements. Many Americans for example, regard re-cycling 100's of tons of metal from the World Trade Centre debris into the building of a new warship, as respectful and appropriate recognition. Others, and I am among them, regard it as at best, deeply insensitive to the precious uniqueness and diversity of belief of the thousands of human beings whose lives were erased before our very eyes in September 2001. Death. Live. Reality TV with a vengeance. Greengrass's film engenders precisely the same ambivalence - you cannot look away for a moment, but feel as if you should. Seductive, transfixing imagery. Obscene in effect, but not intent.<br/><br/>Greengrass has made some no doubt sincere efforts to justify his film. That he made it, not how he made it. For me, the ultimate justification is that he has recreated an image of an appalling reality with such care and attention to detail that it forces us to ask ourselves - should I be watching this? And genuinely struggle with the answer. Whatever it may be. After all, unlike the live TV pictures, United 93 is a planned, financed, publicised creation, that will make a substantial, intentional and desired profit. The camera makes unwitting but not always unwilling, voyeurs of us all. All is intention. And you can't prove an intention. I hope I will not be misunderstood when I recall a harrowing but in a sense uplifting story from the concentration camps: in unspeakable conditions, with no shred of privacy, when individuals went to the toilet, their fellow inmates, human beings, turned away. Cherishing the dignity of another and with sensitivity recognising it through refusing to look.<br/><br/>I would not argue with the view that watching the film of the original events of 9/11 was in a sense a duty - in a democratic society. Yet real political events and actions that led up to such insanity helped bring it about. And unless we are in a sense responsible for the actions of those we elect, then democracy is a sham. But in their endless repetition, are we in a sense watching the same images? Is the legitimacy, sensibility of these repeated viewings, automatically validated by the fact that in a literal sense they are the same? This is the kind of dilemma Greengrass's film poses for me. Surely it is of the logic of corruption that we are unaware of it when it is taking place? Refusing to watch the events of 9/11 as a means of denial is as dubious as passively sharing their repetition. The great strength of United 93 is that as it displays good judgement, avoiding all the major pitfalls and horrendous insensitivities we may fear from future films, it poses profound questions about our relationship to images we pay to see and that are created with the motivation to profit. Only in this can I see real justification - the film does not, and does not seek, to offer any insights or explanations to illuminate these dreadful events. To help us understand them better. To accept the view that they are simply inexplicable, meaningless, insane acts by insane people is to buy into the fear and paranoia peddled by politicians both sides of the Atlantic. There is no future or peace in victim-hood. Even less if it is revengeful.<br/><br/>And I cannot help but wonder whether a film with the same rigorous attention to detail and concern for the horror experienced by precious human beings, about to die needlessly and pointlessly, would get made, still less watched, if it were set in Baghdad on the first night of what was called 'Shock and Awe' - to America's eternal shame. And ours."

","I have to stay this movie was really boring. I thought it would beat out the last 9/11 movie. In my opinion this movie was not even close. When I walked into the movie and my friend and I were the only ones in there. We knew that could not be good. But we sat down anyways and watch the first 5 minutes of the movie. After that we all were just talking about other stuff. I have never done that in a movie. The first hour of the movie was nothing special at all. Just like shots of normal people doing normal stuff and it was really boring. When you started to get into the good part of the movie where planes where being hi-jacked it was totally a different movie. Once the first plane was hi-jacked we kept our eyes on the screen for a while but then it kept going in and out of action. The movie was OK. It was not what I thought it would be. It's more of a short educated movie, not what i thought it would be. On our way to the movie, we saw a poster that was promoting the two towers. That one is going to have lots of problems and controversy over. But over all this was a okay film but not thing to go crazy over. 6.4/10"

","We all remember that fateful day of September 11, 2001. We sat in our cars listening to the radio, at home or at work watching the television sets, or in a desk listening to our teacher reveal the horrific news that had just occurred. For us that were young in our life at that time. We knew what was happening, we knew a kind of rounded view of why it was happening, and we knew that something was not right. What we didn't know was this: What was happening to those on the flights? What was happening inside the airports, to the families on board the flights, and in the buildings that were being hit? What about those that were in the control tower? Let me tell you this, I went to see this with my parents, I am 14 years old, and it hit me harder than the both of them combined. Every kid in America over the age of 11 needs to see this! This is the only movie I have shed a tear in. This movie brought to life an aspect that will never be revealed to some people. You are on the edge of your seat from start to finish, mainly because you know what is coming. This true-story action film drives drama into you until you cannot handle it any longer. It is a movie that when you see it for the first time you know what is going to happen, but are constantly hoping that they will pull out of the situation. This movie puts vulgar and sorrow into your heart. At parts of the movie I wept for those aboard the flight and their family, and at other times I wish I was the one aboard the flight with the fire extinguisher in my hand ready to destroy the enemies that put harm to our American family. Through all of this it is a must see for any age. I felt yesterday, while viewing the movie, more horrible than I felt the day of September 11th. Please go see this. It is the right time! If not now, when? Even if you hate the movie, why it was created, and wish you would never have seen it, I guarantee you will come out with a different understanding. If you were working in a control tower, I will tell you, you think you know it all? You will also come out with a completely different understanding of what was happening. Though there are few people that do not like this movie there are still some out there, and I ask you please do not destroy this movie from its worth. If you destroy it think of the families you are hurting, though you may not view it that way, you are hurting families. Families who lost loved ones who wanted you to view what happened on that day and you blatantly put disregard and say that it was horrible and you wish no one else will see it. These families need us to understand what happened!"

","Like so many, I had to make myself go to this movie because I felt like it maybe too soon.

Our anger has faded and our determination compromised because of Iraq and the length of time it is taking to find Osama Ben Laden. This movie is like Pearl Harbor or Saving Private Ryan, in that it reminds us that people shed their blood and gave up their freedom for the welfare of others and therefore; they, and what happened on September 11th, should never be forgotten and should never fade from the forefront of those minds who witnessed this heinous act!

That little trick can't be used in this film because it's about truth . . . and remembrance. If I saw this movie 10 years from Sept. 11, 2001, instead of last Saturday, I'd still react and feel the same way. It was thought provoking and long after the movie was over, it was still on my mind. For me, this movie turned Sept. 11th into more than a day of terror. It turned Sept. 11th, 2001 into a day of heroics. I was filled with sadness, anger, respect and pride.

","It is difficult for any American alive and aware on 9/11 to look at this movie clearly. I believe some years will need to pass before we can look at this film as an aesthetic piece, a work of art. As it stands, the feelings are still too close to the surface for a lot of us. It's hard to separate what you think of this movie with what you think of the events being portrayed.<br/><br/>I also think that the one sensible critique I've read of this movie, that it essentially lacks a theme, or some kind of perspective, is an accurate one. In a way Greengrass's achievement is tremendous here: he essentially disappears from his own movie. Much of this docudrama feels about a half step up from something like GUNNER'S PALACE, which was essentially a raw footage documentary with a narrator slapped on it. This strategy has ensured that the movie will be acceptable to the greatest possible audience, and that it won't alienate anybody sensible: it's a mirror, essentially, and will reflect back whatever political opinions you bring to the film. But those who question the point of the exercise ask an interesting and worthwhile question.<br/><br/>All of that said, I found this an absolutely riveting movie, often excruciatingly intense and emotionally draining, yet still compelling. Greengrass's camera work is far more suited to this material then his previous action flick, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY -- he is not good at staging action choreography, but is exceptionally gifted at livening up static scenes, especially of people sitting around talking into microphones (much of the movie). A lot of the moral thrust Greengrass brought to SUPREMACY makes more sense here, too -- the one thing the movie does argue for is the obscenity of violence.<br/><br/>I have a number of intensely-felt opinions about 9/11 and this story especially -- I don't think they're really to the point here. I am glad I saw the movie and think Greengrass has done this country a great service by making it, whatever it's successes or failures as an aesthetic piece."

"annalisefarmer","9","1","4","4 May 2006"," Surprisingly far and above all my expectations
","Several weeks ago when I first saw the preview for ""United 93"", my initial reaction was that I would never see it. I immediately labeled it as pro-Bush propaganda aimed at rekindling fading sentiment and waning patriotism. I refused to be manipulated by the over the top dramatic reenactment of events that we can only imagine to have taken place. In the past few weeks, though, I've been hearing increasingly positive reviews and I finally gave in to my curiosity and saw it last night. <br/><br/>My only real problems with ""United 93"" lie within the first few minutes. It opens with the soon-to-be hijackers in their hotels getting ready for their big day. They are chanting from the Koran and reciting their daily prayers. I didn't appreciate this initial emphasis on religion of Islam, implying it to be the motivation behind the terror. This complaint, however, is the only one I have of the film. I can only give praise from here on out.<br/><br/>My knee jerk reaction from the first preview I saw could not be farther from reality. ""United 93"" portrays the events of the morning of September 11, 2001 as accurately as it possibly could. There were no known actors in the film and I was very surprised to learn in the credits that many of the characters actually played themselves. This only makes me think that at least the action portrayed on the ground isn't all that far from the truth. And why would anyone stray from the truth of 9/11, the reality of it is heartbreaking enough. Obviously there's not a lot known about what really happened on that plane, mainly just cell phone calls to family members, but the film does little to glorify the passengers of the one flight that failed to reach its target. They are not national heroes; they are real people. <br/><br/>The movie is obviously sad, and how can it not be? Yet, I feared that it would be so emotional that I would have to cry myself to sleep. While I am still very somber hours later, ""United 93"" mainly caused me to reflect on how tragic that day was. If only communication had flowed freer, perhaps a few of those flights could have been saved. I also greatly appreciated that the film did not point fingers or attempt to blame anyone or any group for failing to stop the terrorists. <br/><br/>I feared that the film was hoping to produce another round of ""rallying around the flag,"" but instead I was surprised how not patriotic (not at all to say unpatriotic) it was compared to many other Hollywood films. I don't recall the presence of a single American flag. It's documentary style produces realism that is exceedingly more moving than anything of the likes of the music video for ""I'm Proud to be an American"". ""United 93"" might perhaps be one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I know that is quite a superlative statement, and it could be that in a few days when the effect of this film wears off I will feel differently. However, for now I really believe this to be true. I think that this is a film that everyone should see. Regardless of whatever preconceived notions of you may have of it, this is two hours that could not be better spent."
"craymond","7","1","4","2 May 2006"," Grim but useful reminder of an awful day
","United 93 definitely brings back the emotions of 9/11--possibly even more so because at the time there was so much confusion that no one could be sure what was happening. Now that I know what happened, and even though there's no real suspense in the movie, my stomach was tied in knots for almost two hours. The confusion of the day, for almost everyone involved, comes through clearly. There is an implied--and often explicit--criticism of the government response to the day's events, particularly the FAA and the military, as if they should have been immune to the confusion surrounding such an unprecedented attack. Don't get me wrong--this is no Michael Moore type slander, and probably most of the criticism is deserved. But I can't help but remember watching John Ford's ""Battle of Midway"", filmed in June 1942 during the darkest days of World War II. I was probably 11 years old in about 1960 when I saw it, and I still remember the pride I felt in our Marines as they defended that tiny island, even though they ultimately were overwhelmed. Lots of mistakes were made then, too, but we had a war to win; it was not a time for pointing fingers. Maybe United 93 would have been as inspiring, if John Ford had made it. As it is, the movie is a grim, but useful, reminder of an awful day. I just wish it had been more than that."

What it turned out to be was a movie about the air traffic controllers, local, military, and national who were struggling to try to understand what was happening. The parts of the actual united 93 flight seemed almost tacked on. It did make me want to read more about what happened there, specifically about the people on board. A couple of the passengers really had just a few minutes to figure out what was going on an come up with a plan. Who were they? What had they done in their lives that suggested that type of character? The most moving parts were the brief scenes of a few of the people calling home - it seemed most got answering machines - to say good bye. I assume they only showed those that got answering machines because then they got the actual words being spoken. It was almost a documentary with regard to the air traffic controllers as many of them were not actors.

Approximately 25% of the movie viewing time was shown aboard United 93. Although tense viewing, with a bedlam finale to take passenger control of the aircraft,little is shown of any personal interaction between the hijackers and passengers, which might have occurred.

No flag waving patriotism, no jihadist anti-American rhetoric from terrorist organizations - just a re-enactment of what happened that day.<br/><br/>Many of us watched NYC, The Pentagon that day.

I recall particularly how people stopped being sympathetic to Lisa Beamer, after she became a media princess.<br/><br/>The film has none of this. It shows what happens on the plane right from boarding/taxi among passengers, and hijackers on this particular flight.

","I would love to have Hollywood finally make a film (or twenty!) that shows jihadists, in all their demented villainy, being opposed and defeated by, say, courageous U.S. and/or N.A.T.O. special-ops forces.<br/><br/>However, in the meantime, I'll gladly take ""United 93."" The faux vérité approach -- which has been used and abused since at least ""N.Y.P.D. Blue"" in the early '90s -- is old hat to audiences, but never has it been more effectively employed than here by Greengrass. During the last 10-20 minutes of the movie, my heart was pounding so fast and my hands were shaking so much that I feared I was going to have a coronary. I found myself trying to WILL from my theater seat the passengers of Flight 93 to make that last, final, desperate push over the terrorists, into the cockpit, and to the plane's controls. Of course, the passengers don't make it. And, of course, I knew this when I walked into the theater. But that didn't make it any less devastating when I saw it on screen.<br/><br/>I implore everyone to see this film early and often. If we don't send Hollywood the message that we're adults and that we're tired of mindless, P.C. escapism, we'll have no one to blame but ourselves when Hollywood continues to shovel celluloid junk (e.g. ""R.V."") at us."

There were no ""black hat"" villains...there were no John Wayne heroes...United 93 had people...from different walks of life...with different beliefs...and died following their hearts. Perhaps, with more movies like this, we may come to an understanding why people do what they do all around the world. I was not watching a movie. I was viewing life...from both sides. We all pray to the same God...and we all eventually die. Perhaps, with love and understanding, we all may all one day live together peacefully before we do meet our Maker."

","I went and saw this movie the night that it came out. I have to say that I was shocked at how good this movie was. The camera angles and shots treated us like we were right there with them. When the movie was over, everyone got out of their seats and walked out of the theater. Not a word was uttered. Although there are no well-known names in the file, every actor/actress was great.<br/><br/>They did have one girl that played military personnel at NORAD that was awful. I feel that the rest of the cast was great except for this one girl. But don't let her acting ruin the film for you. The real life reactions more than make up for it.<br/><br/>The movie is right at 2 hours but it does not feel like 2 hours. The events that play along are smooth and right on par with what happened. This is definitely not an action movie."

Leaves the audience silent and speechless at the conclusion.<br/><br/>It accurately and totally captures the chaos of the day. One plane, then the next, then the next, etc. The way the passengers (and the hijackers of 93) learn about the prior incidents is much the same that we all did..., shockingly, with the fear of ""what in the world is going on, what's next?""."
"fluffyclown","10","1","4","30 April 2006"," A Stunning Experience
","As we all know and remember, United 93 is based on events that took place in America on September 11, 2001. I have heard many people say that it is too soon to have made a film about that day. Our wounds are still fresh; our anguish, still palpable. On some levels, I understand, and agree. The emotional impact of 9/11 still has many of us reeling in stunned disbelief that we were attacked so brutally and unexpectedly. I went into the theater with a pocket full of tissues, and a hope that maybe, just maybe, seeing this film would somehow help heal those wounds inflicted upon us, and embedded deep in our souls. I was not let down.<br/><br/>From the first moment the film came on the screen, the audience seemed to be gripped with tension. A feeling of tightness took hold in the back of my throat, and a heaviness set in on my chest, making it difficult to breathe. I sat there, stunned, my entire being overwhelmed by the impact of the emotions I was experiencing. The film hooked me right in, and it never let go. Even after the ending credits had rolled, and almost everyone had already left, I remained in my seat, amazed. Never before had a film so completely taken me in. It was stunning. Absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>As most of us remember the events that were portrayed in the film, I needn't give a scene by scene breakdown of the story. There are three things; moments really, that I want to share. The first was the audience. I noticed as the theater began to fill up, that most of the people coming to see the film were older. There were no children or teenagers present, only a handful of college types or twenty somethings, and a few more thirty-somethings. The rest of the audience appeared to be 40 and up. A ""mature"" audience, if you will. The second thing was the reaction of the audience to one scene. The scene takes place in New York. Three people are in an airport tower, trying to make a visual contact of one of the missing airliners. They spot it, and a second later watch in horror as the plane smashes into the second tower of the World Trade Center. At that moment, the theater went completely silent. No one spoke, moved, or even breathed. All had been stunned by the impact of the moment. Several agonizing seconds went by; then very slowly conversations between audience members in hushed tones could be heard beginning again. It was a moment felt and shared by all.<br/><br/>The third thing, or moment was the ending. The final scene had just ended, and the credits had not yet began to roll. Again, the entire room went still. No one spoke or moved for several seconds. Then slowly, almost hesitantly, a lone audience member began to clap. A few others joined in, but the applause only lasted a few seconds, and then died out. As the audience began to leave, very few spoke, and those who did, used very hushed tones. I sat transfixed in my seat as I watched the credits. I couldn't move. It was as if I felt it would have been irreverent to not acknowledge all that had been involved in the making of the film. That I would insult the memory of those who had lost their lives on 9/11, if I didn't read every single name passing by on the screen. It wasn't until the screen was blank, and the lights began to come up that I was willing to leave. After a few more minutes of stunned silence, I was finally able to breathe easy and release the emotions that had gripped me so tightly during the film. Then slowly but surely, I felt the healing begin.<br/><br/>We may never know exactly what happened on flight 93, but that is not the point of this film. United 93 is a stunning portrait of heroism, faith, and love. It is an honest and heartfelt tribute to those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. For those who are ready, this film can be a balm to your wounded souls if you let it. For those who aren't, wait until you are. In time, we all will heal; but we will never forget.<br/><br/>10"
"chrisplyon","8","1","4","30 April 2006"," Feeling 'United'
","The opening of the story is somber and really feels like something out of Munich as the middle eastern men sat in their hotels preparing for the morning's events citing parts of the Koran and facing Mecca for the first prayer of the day. Greengrass's love for hand-held cameras is well reflected in the first scene and gives the opening a sense of tension without feeling totally like a documentary. For anyone who has seen Paradise Now, you will recognize the shaving of all body hair before the act of faith. This is key, I believe, because it shows the filmmakers attention to detail to the religion. This made me feel immediately that the problem was not the faith, but the interpretation of the faith by the hijackers.<br/><br/>The tension builds in the airport as passengers board United 93 and the terrorists feeling anxious as a delay cripples their plan to leave on time concerned that the attacks made by the others would prevent their takeoff. This suspension is finally subsided as United 93 lifts into the air, but is immediately superseded by the FAA being unable to raise AA11 which was heard over the radio with an odd transmission. The news is passed to the New York branch of the FAA and the group is notified to watch AA11 for odd characteristics.<br/><br/>The tension builds as the wondering whether several other aircraft that are unable to be raised. The audience is sucked in with the overwhelming amount of information to be kept up with. As AA11 hits the first tower, the two other real hijacks at the time, AA77 and United 175 are mixed in with a dozen other proposed hijackings including Delta flights. The military and FAA fight for action against each other with rights to fly and clearance from the FAA to the USAF's lack of available fighting aircraft. For near 45 minutes we rarely return to United 93 only to see major developments including the commencing of the hijacking. The tension builds because you want to know more about 93. The film keeps that tension and builds more and more of a case against the terrorists with their desperation and anxiety when the news comes in about the successful completion of two other planes.<br/><br/>We return to United 93 where people are calling their families and informing people of the hijacking. One passenger saying the Lord's prayer with a Verizon worker while we intercut with prayers of other passengers and the prayers to Allah by the hijackers.<br/><br/>As the plane inches closer to the Washington area do the passengers rally in the back and plan to attack their hijackers. The tension is taken from the ground to the air as we don't go back to the ground for the last part of the movie only knowing that mayhem has overcome the FAA and the USAF as the order was given to land all planes.<br/><br/>In the last scene, the passengers storm the hijackers, but are quickly thwarted when the new plane's pilot rocks the plane back and forth. The passengers continue onward and beat the living shnock out of one of the hijackers. They continue forward and the plane rocks again. The tension builds. You can see the terrorists eyes that he is prepared to ditch if the mission becomes any more compromised. I was sure, no matter what I already knew, that the passengers would make it to the cockpit and take control of the plane and be safe once again. They continue forward and encounter the second hijacker that slows them down a bit, but is soon overcome by the ensuing mob. The passengers make it to the forward galley and begin to ram the door to the cockpit with everything they can. Third hijacker props himself against the door to hold back the passengers so that the fourth can continue to fly. The tension is unbearable. You, as a viewer, know that time is running out. The free-handedness of the shots makes you think you are in Saving Private Ryan or some intense war sequence with all the yelling and shouting and utter desperation on both ends. The quick and close shots hold you and keep you wanting more.<br/><br/>As the final shot in the movie ended, I sat there, unintelligible. I had only once felt like this once before in my life. The memories of that day rung so loud I couldn't escape it. I cried and remembered my vow that day to never forget.<br/><br/>The movie is very emotionally driven and very rarely distracting with the filming style. It does not feel like a documentary. But there is one actress in the USAF (played by herself) that can't act and she sounds fake and breaks the tension when she speaks. It is like nails on a chalkboard. But other than that, the film keeps an incredible tension.<br/><br/>No matter what people say, the film is not as much propaganda as people say it is. Munich was more propaganda than United 93. Not that I don't like Munich, but the movie is what I tried to capture in my first 9-11 video that I made at magnet. Just the intensity and horribleness of it all.<br/><br/>It really was moving. I neither recommend this movie or denounce it, however, for the same reason that I didn't do that for The Passion of the Christ. Each person has his or her own time for seeing that kind of thing. If you aren't ready for it, don't go to it. It is an emotional roller-coaster."

","This film was presented as a real-time story of the events of 9/11/2001, and it was one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. No big stars, but definitely some familiar faces. Stars might have distracted from this particular story. The terrorists were presented as realistic young men on a mission, driven by their beliefs, trying desperately to keep their courage up. The passengers were realistic people, normal people in an extraordinary situation. This was a very honest view of all the surprised and confused people who were in control, their struggles to communicate, their difficulty getting control over a completely surprising situation. Most notable was the score. Without realizing it, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire picture, even in the very beginning when the mundane activities of loading a plan with passengers, taking off, etc. were recounted in detail. I knew what was about to happen to these people, but it was the score that kept me whipped into a frenzy of dread. I especially admired that no one was made a madman; no one a buffoon; no one a superhero. People were praying, both the hijackers and the passengers alike. People were making phone calls. I felt like I was one of those passengers. What would my message have been to the people at home? Please muster the courage to see this film. It will change you forever."
"Movieman02","10","1","4","29 April 2006"," A Movie You Can ""Feel""
","I'm going to have to give United 93 4 out of 4 stars.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with about as many people in the theater as there were on the flight itself. It made the movie seem more real than it already was, and believe me, that is VERY real.<br/><br/>I have never (after watching thousands of movies) felt more nervous during a movie than I have tonight. It wasn't special effects or a new type of story with a smart villain that did it. It was the terrifying fact that these people we're real and this story actually happened. I knew what fate awaited these people, but no one knows exactly what happened on board.<br/><br/>As the movie moves along at it's real - time speed, you feel like you are both in the United 93 flight, and in the Air Traffic Control center at the same time. The environment was recreated with intense realism. You learn at the same time as the ATC staff about the hijacked planes and the destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The movie was (needless to say) very well researched. Not many movies accomplish such a feat. The director poured unmeasurable effort and care into his film to recreate this horrific event.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare movies with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever. It is irrelevant. Serious movies use humor as ""relief"", United 93 does not want you to feel relief, it wants you to feel everything the passengers felt as they went through it.<br/><br/>This movie left me speechless after wards and if I wasn't with company (who were also speechless) I probably would have stayed in the theater until they had kicked me out. I ""felt"" this movie more than I have with any other movie. I wanted to help out those passengers. I wanted to charge at the hijackers, regain control of the plane and show those terrorists why Americans will always defeat them because we believe in our country! I wanted to call my family and tell them that I won't be coming home because I was about to die for the greatest country in the world so that terrorism and the slaughtering of innocent people will not take place. I wanted to fight a war on terrorism.<br/><br/>God Bless America."

","There is nothing Hollywood about this film. In fact, it breaks many of the cinematographic rules we've come to accept as requisite in great film-making--but when one views this unrelentingly gripping account of the flight that fought back, you'll forget all about that.<br/><br/>Much of the cast is comprised of the real men and women who responded to the 9/11 hijackings in flight operations or the military -- a symbolic testament to the gritty realism and uncompromising attention to fact and detail the filmmakers endowed in the film United 93.<br/><br/>It is not the best movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely the most realistic. There is no fanfare or sensationalizing. There is no hurrah, no uplifting conclusion to leave the audience appeased. It is a breathtaking, heart-wrenching account of what happened on that flight. I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to see it, if not for the firsthand perspective it offers, see it at least out of respect for the families of the people who lost their lives that day."

","I was skeptical about a movie done on the tragedies of September 11th, but after hearing family members of the victims approval I decided to go. Go now if you can as some of the proceeds for opening weekend will be donated to the memorial fund. This movie brings back all of the emotions that we all felt on that fateful day, it's gripping and heartfelt. I think it was done as accurately and truthfully as could possibly be done based on the facts that are known about this tragedy, I don't think it could have been done any better. It's so hard to put this movie into words, but I'm so glad that I did go see it. If you still think about 9-11, if these people are still in your thoughts and prayers, go see this movie."
"wallflower_83","9","1","4","29 April 2006"," Great movie, that should be experienced
","What does one say, particularly an American, about such a sad, yet inspirational tale? I guess, in a way, this film is like Titanic... we all know how it's going to end. With a lot of tears. But it's not the Titanic, this is recent history. This is five years ago and many people think that's too soon. I understand that point of view, but I do not agree with it. I won't summarize the plot, for the mere fact that if you're reading this here, you know the story already. I imagine if you see this movie, while the credits roll, you will ask your friends where they were when they heard about 9/11. I know I did.<br/><br/>Anyways, about the movie. This movie is hyper-realism at it's best. It's done in a very straight forward, documentary style. Many of the air-traffic controllers are played by the people who were there. All of the passengers are basically no-name (unfamous) actors and actresses. All of this contributes to a super realistic feel that the movie carries well. Perhaps too well for some (or many) of you.<br/><br/>The movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It is honorable to the memories and lives of the people who died on that day. It is something that should be viewed and talked about. Not tucked away and forgotten as our society seems so apt to do. Is it a tough movie to watch? Yes at points it is. Will you cry? Probably, most people did. But if you want to see the most united America since that day, go sit in the theater with this movie. You will see. Everyone is quiet, everyone is humbled, everyone is in awe. Everyone realizes and acknowledges again."

We all know of the story of Flight 93, that crashed in Pennsylvania instead of the intended target of Washington, DC's capital building. Or more.<br/><br/>This film, directed and written by Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy) did intensive research of Flight 93, in every detail from the stories of the flight's doomed passengers, to the black-box recordings. However, this film does have its flaws.<br/><br/>First, this has already been done. Anyone who saw A+E's TV movie Flight 93 knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Second, I disliked the camera work. The way it was done added realism to the film, but it go to a point where it just became tiring and blinded the atmosphere of the movie itself.<br/><br/>Third... well, that's basically it.<br/><br/>Overall, I would only recommend this film to those who wish to see a memorable tribute to those who died on September 11, 2001.

","There are many theories about what really happened on September 11. There are hundreds of theories about the twin towers, next to nothing is known about the pentagon. But there are facts about what happen on the fourth hijacked plane that was meant to hit the White House. It didn't hit its target. The passengers of the flight fought back but unfortunately they crashed. This movie did not work for me.<br/><br/>As a movie this was boring. It was to slow and the story took to long to get started. There is nothing worse then that when you already know the story and how it ends. One thing that saved this from 1 star was the intense and thrilling last ten minutes. The only reason I would consider watching this is in respect to those who died. This would have worked better as a TV movie. I have seen a few of September 11 terrorist attack movies and documentaries so I wasn't so excited about seeing this.<br/><br/>The only reason I borrowed this was that Paul Greengrass directed it. He done a great job with The Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum. Again the hand held camera is used. Which makes It shaky. If you didn't like it being used in Bourne Ultimatum you may be disappointed. But it does make you feel like you are on the plane with the passengers. Which adds to the intensity of the film. Unfortunately he disappointed me this time.<br/><br/>Some of the actors and actresses were believable and some weren't. Also I didn't think they would show some of the passengers getting hurt. It may disturb some people.<br/><br/>This would have been good as a TV movie but it didn't work as a actual movie. I don't recommend this.

","I had high hopes for this film. I was hoping for a tasteful and insightful look at how the events of 9/11 unfolded. Unfortunately this film is neither.<br/><br/>The film had a general lack of interesting information or explanation as to the dynamics of the events of the day, which I would have appreciated. Over 90% of the film was shot in air traffic control centres around America, and on the planes themselves. A huge amount of this footage was what I would call 'padding' - I.E. shots of people whispering, talking, generally building the tension. This is fine for the start of a film as it sets the scene. However to make an entire film out of this types of footage doesn't make for good watching. The film makers balance this out by using shaky hand-held cameras and distressing footage (shouting and violence) designed to play on your memories of 9/11.<br/><br/>This film adds no emotional or intellectual value whatsoever to the memory, or the debate, of the tragic events of September 11th, 2001. I would expect this level of story line and direction from high school students, not multi-million dollar film studios."

","The problem with this movie is not it's pace, not it's factual or documentary-like nature, not the movie director's interpretation of the events, but the general angst the director has to turn this fragile subject into a movie. Of course 9/11 was one of the most dreaded days in history, but only because of the tremendous media exposure and multiple-angular shots of the scene. The day Bush started the war in Iraq was a day sentencing more people to death then any other day in American history, and that is the controversial side this movie doesn't tackle. Therefore it gives no more than a shallow depiction of the events, rather than an in depth investigative movie.

Perhaps the chronological proximity and the sobriety of the events minimize the artistic license taken, which in turn contributes to the film's realistic power, which is as compelling as any in cinema since ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>""United 93"" tastefully concentrates on the titular flight, which was the day's sole hijacked airplane that failed to reach its destructive destination. Equally enlightening are scenes set in a handful of air traffic control centers, ranging from the regional to the national level, and one military outpost. The cumulative effect, which fascinatingly is not explicitly noted until the closing titles, points out how truly heroic the efforts of those on United 93 were, considering how utterly confused those on the ground were. The film also parenthetically comments on the changes in the mindset and security of America in the last half decade, not preaching but rather just noting in retrospect. Much like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, numerous incidents in the film leave the viewer in head-shaking wonder as to how they occurred. One must realize that for the most part the tragedies were not due to incompetence, but the unfathomable concepts behind the nefarious plots. Remembering how different things like air travel were five years ago will make one realize how much innocence was lost on that fateful day and how drastically the world has evolved in the short time since then.<br/><br/>Although British, Director Paul Greengrass proves to be a near perfect choice to helm ""United 93"", no doubt due to his prior experience with films similar in content (""Bloody Sunday"") and style (""The Bourne Supremacy""). ""Sunday"" was a bleak docudrama about Irish protesters who were killed by British troops, a likewise resonant theme (at least from the Irish perspective). His jittery hand-held camera method, borderline nauseating in ""Supremacy"", works very well in the more static environment, effectively depicting the confined chaos of the day's events.<br/><br/>The wisest choices made by Greengrass and company are intentional decisions to avoid convention. Virtually no familiar faces or names appear among the cast, and many of the professionals actually play themselves. Even casting character actors with recognizable faces would have degraded the film, as the actors' anonymity contributes heavily to the film's natural and relatable everyman quality. There are few of those overly dramatic shots that can only occur when knowing what happens next. Several shots do linger, but are more poignant than heavy-handed, and would likely be unnoticeable if the viewer didn't know the future.<br/><br/>Being cognizant of the entire story definitely strengthens the emotional impact, uniquely accenting the drama of mundane events rather than plot direction. Leading up the hijacking, all of the flight's events, expressed as normally as possible, serve as an contrasting anticipatory requiem far more heart-wrenching than any such scene bolstered with slow motion or dramatic music. Imagine how differently one would view every little thing knowing it was one's last time to experience such minutia. That is the quiet power of these early scenes.<br/><br/>If there is a misstep, it is simply in trying to cover too much. But such an error could easily have been glaring instead of subtle, and the brisk two-hour running length is refreshingly neither compacted nor strung out. However, bouncing from the intimate setting on the flight to the more impersonal bedlam among controllers produces an occasionally uneven tenor that disrupts the emotional connection. That dissimilitude is also a necessary evil though, as seeing the collage of events is required to contextualize the key individual snapshot.<br/><br/>For those who looking for a gripping and affecting true story that provides rare optimism about the human race, or perhaps for those who are curious to see how our nation has changed so much in so little time, this will likely be one of the best movie experiences of the year. But as well as the ""United 93"" was made, it is not for everyone. Some people simply will not be comfortable watching these events, whether it be the recent nature of the attacks or the genre itself. Those people are not at fault, as once familiar shots and stories are again shockingly potent. This is not a film that everyone should see, although everyone ought to be reminded of the themes present.<br/><br/>Some will come away dwelling on the failures that took place, but that's not what the film is about. ""United 93"" cathartically calls attention to what changed that day, how it did so, and the honorable self-sacrificial traits that surfaced in a time of crisis. 9 of 10 for what might be the best film of the year.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A weighty yet touching social and emotional statement, and recommended viewing before the the onslaught of summer blockbusters."
"coolfortheone","10","1","5","11 May 2006"," United 93
","United 93 I think this is definitely one of the most difficult reviews I will write, regarding one of the most difficult films I have seen. The events of 9/11 will haunt all those who remember the day. America is still reeling from the terrible tragedy and the effects of it are too profound for me to attempt to summarize. When talk of a 9/11 movie came out I rolled my eyes. Horrible thoughts flashed through my mind imagining Hollywood would exploit another disaster by throwing teen heartthrobs into typical action scenes held together by a flimsy romance hoping to create a conventional thriller to appeal to brain dead audiences. Thankfully director Paul Greengrass has delivered a respectful, profound, emotional, and expertly crafted tale of 9/11. It is a real time account of what occurred on board United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot. The filmmakers were smart enough to know not to exploit. They do not bring forth conclusions or attack anybody. It does not try to portray anyone of the characters in an overly flattering or degrading way, creating straightforward heroes or villains. This film takes the viewer and places them on board the plane with the rest of the passengers awaiting their impending doom.<br/><br/>All of the passengers are based on real people, but never do we learn who they are. No background insight is exchanged, there names are never even mentioned. Only through little bits of chit-chat throughout the movie are we able to learn little if anything about them. The terrorists never talk about themselves amongst each other; they only speak of their mission. They are complete strangers, which is appropriate because on a plane you would not know anyone. The cast of unknown actors were given studies of their real life counterparts from the family members of the victims. Greengrass was then able to partially improvise some of the events. The story also covers events surrounding U.S Military Air Traffic Controllers; real Air Traffic Controllers were used for these scenes. Greengrass films his story like a documentary, using his hand-held cams like a fly on the wall; his style of direction is perfect for the movie. The tension that the story builds up rivals that of the greatest thrillers. The audience brings all their outside knowledge into the theater and knows how the flight will end and all the events that will follow, the characters do not and the ultimate dramatic irony is now set.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to analyze the emotions I felt during my viewing, because the experience kicked up such a whirlwind of them. I feel there is much I want to say, but am having trouble doing such. I will be damned surprised if a 2006 movie comes along that is as well made and powerful. United 93 is a movie going experience I will not soon forget, I suspect everyone who sees it will feel the same way. The climax is especially haunting functioning as a primal, brutal scene that looks into the most basic of all human actions and emotions like few films have ever, as normal men and women fight up an airplane isle armed with makeshift weapons, kicking, punching, scratching, screaming, crying, choking, blinded with survival instincts, as a man throws down a piece of metal into the ground with the intent of killing a fellow being while screaming his God's name in praise. If that does not stir you up, I do not know what could"

","The movie was more than anything to me (aside from emotional reactions) informative. It shed a lot of light on the behind the scenes events of 9/11 from the perspective of Traffic Control and the Military especially. With the inclusion of real participants the reality was heightened greatly.<br/><br/>United 93 seemed very authentic on the ground but I couldn't shake the fact that many of the plane events had to have been dramatized and that wasn't disclaimed. <br/><br/>The wounds are still fresh and this movie certainly won't make that any easier but I for one am glad I overcame my aversion to this hard subject and the painful memories and hope you do the same. <br/><br/>as a movie: 7/10<br/><br/>as a tribute to the crew, passengers and ground people involved or lost:<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","The effect this movie would have on me became very clear when I was walking to my theater. There was a special makeshift corridor made for those of us seeing this movie. When I got in my theater there was nary a seat open, and I struggled to get a chair. I sat and watched the film start, and I slowly started feeling my arm develop goose pimples. With the shot of the terrorists, and then with the terrorists actually entering the plane. With every movement and phrase I my innards started to wrench themselves, as if they were a wash cloth that was getting wrung out. ""We have a possible hijacking"" one of the characters said. ""I doubt that"" his boss said. Then you saw it. One of the most shocking piece of footage ever shot. Then through some very minimal dialog, you saw the other plane hit the other tower. Then, one of the most memorable pieces of cinema that I have ever seen, one of the most memorable scenes of all time, the passengers aboard United 93 hear of the Twin Towers, and decide to fight back against their captors. Yes, we all know what happens in the end, and i don't need to spell it out. But, this film is like constantly being shot in the gut. With every ""I love you"" it hurts a little more. This is the movie that they will be showing in schools to teach about this event in 30 years, and I could't be happier about that."

"SHB_73","10","1","5","29 April 2006"," They would not go down without a fight.
","United 93 is a fitting tribute to those who died on that plane during the September 11th hijackings. Flight 93 was the only plane of the four hijacked that day that didn't reach its target (possibly the Capitol or the White House) Director Paul Greengrass does an excellent job in this film that tells the true story of the plane and the brave passengers who decided to fight and try to take control from the terrorists. The movie has a ""real time"" feel to it so it makes you feel as if your on board yourself, because of runway traffic, 93 was the last of the 4 jets to take off. The passengers on board find out about the World Trade Center and Pentagon from their cell phones when they talk to their family and friends and they realize its a suicide mission so they decide to try and stop the terrorists. The actors in the movie are virtual unknowns and a majority of the ground control (particularly FAA commander Bob Sliney) play themselves which is fitting because they saw the tragedy up close. The hardest part of the film is watching these heroes as they say goodbye to their loved ones on their phones before they try to take over the plane. United 93 is a emotional and powerful story of what happened that awful day and the true story of the men and women who would not go down without a fight."
"Deckard-16","10","1","5","29 April 2006"," Shattering!
","Now there are 4 slots available for the Best Picture Oscar of 2006. Paul Greengrass and his crew have crafted the most nerve tingling (mangling?) thriller since THE CHINA SYNDROME. This retelling of the 9/11/01 and the imagined telling of the final minutes of the the real doomed flight United 93 is one of the most harrowing thrillers of all-time. It almost feels obscene saying that (it is an awesome thriller) because it also an incredible paean to actual real-life heroism (albeit doomed). This may be a perfect movie (as the necessary vodka shot and ale chaser flow through my system). There is not a single false move in this film. The casting is no stars perfect. The cinematography and editing are in perfect sync sometimes to my frustration. I can't believe the restraint Greengrass put on the emotions and the violence. This is very straight forward storytelling. I'm sure the kneejerk suckups at FOXNEWS and the oxycotin addled Limbaugh idiots will find fault with Greengrass's time spent on the terrorists motivations, but I think it added further power to the actions by those against them. THIS IS A GREAT FILM."

","While this movie did a very good job at depicting the events of the morning of 9/11, we only know a little more about flight 93 than the other 4. It was particularly accurate in showing that the flight was less than half full for the flight to SF from Boston (40 passengers). Normal load is 70-90% but the 4 hijacked planes each went with about a 30% load. <br/><br/>The film was quite riveting and had my heart pounding. It was like an ""Airport"" movie, but the tension was actually increased by our knowledge of the end game. The film did a fine job of respectfully showing each of the characters, though I hope the flight attendants would hold it together better than the film displayed. <br/><br/>The question that still hangs in the air though is: where is the wreckage. People of Shanksville found debris from the flight miles from the crash site. An engine was found hundreds of yards away. But no bodies, luggage or aircraft. We've seen crashes before -- they don't disintegrate or ""pulverize"". Just like at the Pentagon, I have to ask: Where are the passengers???<br/><br/>http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1336167662031629480 <br/><br/>Be careful how you execute vengeance!"

","I went to see united 93 today and I can say that it is extremely well done. Through out the entire thing you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. Though most of the movie happens in the various flight control centers you couldn't help but feel as though you had a personal connection to every passenger on that plane. The people in my theater were so engaged they started clapping when the people stood up as one and fought against the hijackers. The end is the most emotionally jerking(obviously as that is when the plane goes down) but it was done very well. No flashy explosion or anything showy; the screen just goes black and a monologue appears on the screen. The last 5 minutes of the movie nobody moved...it was that intense. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 14. I hope you go to see this movie. It will truly show you what it means to be an American and be patriotic."

About an hour of watching airport control scratch their bums. Then about 30 minutes of really good film. Spot the reality check? The only decent part of the film is the bit that gave Hollywood license to make it up. The acting is good but they put a real bad vibe on the people in charge. Gee, I am glad I am not one of those guys in real life, this film would make me wanna crawl under a rock. None of the characters were developed at all - mostly cardboard. The only one that had any character development had very few lines and was the terrorist flying the plane. No real character stands out and develops a rapport with the audience other than this guy.

I'm afraid that I can't quite understand the academy's recognition of Paul Greengrass as a best Director nominee. There was nothing about his direction that stood out as amazing or extraordinary. Instead, this film reminded me of every other mediocre, made-for-TV movie that i've seen on this same subject. Oh, and the acting? Horrendous. I mean seriously, where did they find these people?

This movie isn't action-packed, it seems to be done in somewhat of a documentary style. The people who were on this flight did what they can, and they represented our country, even though none of them survived. We are not sure if they fought back, this is just a film portraying on a real event that happened. The most high point of the film is when the passengers fight back and start hitting one of the high jackers and remove the homemade bomb and them trying to break in the cockpit to try to save the plane and the passengers. <br/><br/>This is one of three (If I am not mistaken) films that are about 9/11.

I have studied 9/11 for many years and written several papers on it and even wrote a book on it. My interest in the subject is because my dad lost his best friend that day and my high school English teacher lost his brother. The company my dad worked for at the time lost 4 people including another of my dad's friends.<br/><br/>There are some genuine historical inaccuracies here. The actor who played Saeed Al-Ghamdi, looked way too old to be him as he was 23 at the time of the attacks. Ahmed Al-Haznawi would have had facial hair, and Zaid Jarrah didn't have a cleft chin. However, I greatly respect how this movie portrayed the passenger revolt as it wasn't just 4 heroes, every passenger on the plane played a part. Although the younger male passengers lead the revolt, it was the flight attendants who helped them organize weapons and a plan. The one scene that really stuck with me from this movie is during the passenger revolt when Jeremy Glick snaps Ahmed Al-Nami's neck as Richard Guadagno rips the knife out of his hands. I know they couldn't cast perfect dead ringers for all the passengers, but I do greatly respect Greengrass' efforts to genuinely capture the raw hostility and fear even forcing the actors who played the hijackers and the actors who played the passengers and crew to not interact outside of filming. Overall a 10 out of 10 and a genuine powerful tearjerker everyone should watch at least once."

It's also difficult to understand how the producers of such an important film got so much so wrong. Cinematic licence or carelessness? (Look at the error file here on IMDB).
Nevertheless it is a graphic and important re-telling of the events of that horrible day. Most intriguing to me was the fact that I knew what would happen, but none of the passengers, aircrew or ATC officials did. Their false hopes and attempted explanations of what was happening make compelling drama.

The story is told from the perspective of the passengers of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, passengers who realized what was happening and took matters into their own hands, sacrificing their lives for a greater good.

First i will be examining the character development of the film,we don't really know much about the characters only that they are in a flight but we do get to see the terrorist and how they go from the hotel to the plane and how they themselves are nervous about the hijacking.For the passengers we don't really get to learn much about them only that they have families and different aspects about them that would make us feel sympathy for the.When the plane gets hijacked we see how the people began to fear for their lives and how they still had faith that they will live to see their families once more.By the end we see how they know that they will die and they wish to tell their families everything until their last moments and how they will leave so much behind because of the hijacking.
The acting and dialogue was also really good because they were speaking to each other in many different ways that would change with the scene and still feel really real because in the beginning we see how they were talking to their families like they were talking to their real families not just actors speaking with actor families.We also see the how the people who are in the control rooms are speaking like their actually watching the 9/11 events in person and how their sound stressed and all that.When the people are in the plane we do see them act as if it was a normal flight or how a normal person would react or do during a flight and when the hijacking takes place we do see that there is fear.
The editing was also good with a few things that i did not like,one of the things was how they would cut to scenes really fast and it would usually be scenes that are not really related but with the plane i wondered if they were in a actual plane or what was going on because the editing would make it so believable that were i would wonder where the scene was taking place and how they would take the scenes were the plane would move.
My final review on united 93 is that it is a really good movie and it doesn't matter if you like history ot not because it keeps engagement to it because it has a lot of suspense and everything is good about it.you should see this file because it has a lot of good features to it and it packs a lot of drama and suspense and by the finally scene of the movie it gave me satisfaction about how it mostly ended just because a lot of people died but how they fought back felt satisfying."

","On september 11, 2001 four planes were hijacked. This planes each had a different destination for example two of the planes that were hijacked hit the twin towers in New York. One of the planes that were hijacked which was United 93 didn't reach its destination. The movie United 93 is a drama, history, thriller movie. The director of this movie is Paul Greengrass. This movie came out in 2006 which is 5 years after the event happened. I give this film a rating of 8/10 because it was boring in the beginning but then got interesting and it is good way of learning what happened.<br/><br/>Firstly i would be examining the editing about this film. In this scene we see how they are focused on the passengers and terrorists. This was shown in the beginning when everything was fine to when they were about to crash the plane. In the beginning we see that they point the camera to the passengers when they are talking and then they point it at one of the terrorists as they are looking in one direction. We also see this when they are about to crash the plane. We see that they point the camera at the terrorists as they are praying in arabic and then they point it at the passengers as they are praying in english.<br/><br/>Next i would examine mise-en-scene in this film. In this scene we see a sign were it says 'God Bless America"" and we also see the white house. At the beginning of the film we see that the saying ""God Bless America"" is hanged in a wall for everyone to see. This sign might had been placed in the beginning of the film to show that they only want good things to happen in America. We see the white house when the terrorist get control of the plane and place it on the wheel of the plane. This was probably placed their so we could know where they planned on landing since later on in the movie they didn't make it to their destination.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie was overall good even though it was boring in the beginning. You should see this film if you like to see movies that are about history, drama, or thriller."

","The film United 93, a historical thriller, was released in 2006 and was directed by Paul Greengrass. The film revolves around the hijackings that went on during 9/11. It focuses on the flight United 93 and the events that went on during the situation. I would give this film an 8/10 because the intensity of the movie kept me interested but it looked kind of messy.<br/><br/>To begin with I will talk about the editing of the movie. During the last scenes the camera keeps flipping back to the passengers in the plane and the hijackers flying the plane. The impact that this has is that it increases the suspense. Even though i knew what was going to happen there was a part of me that wanted to believe that the passengers would be able to take back the plane during this part of the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed about the movie was the cinematography. To add more to the intensity of the movie the camera was very shaky. The camera just going from one person to another made me feel distressed like the people in the movie. For example when they began calling people to confirm that the hijacks were real the camera just kept shaking. I thought that it was a really cool way to show how the people in the movie were stressed but it gave me a headache.<br/><br/>To conclude the film United 93 showed us what happened during the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Overall it was a good movie because it would make me wonder what was going to happen next throughout the movie. The editing and the cinematography made the movie show accurate representations of the event I would recommend this film to people that like movies that give you suspence."
"renefuentes","7","0","1","22 January 2019"," Flight 93 review from a highschool student
","Flight 93 directed by Paul Greengrass in 2006 is a historical drama that takes us to the events that led up to and what actually happened in september the 11th. This movie tells us of the people aboard flight 93 and how they and the US dealt with the hijacking issue. I give this film a 7/10 because of its acting and dialogue and its character development that the film represents throughout the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, I will be examining acting and dialogue in the film. Throughout the film we see the actors showing us how they react to situations that are presented throughout the film. Dialogue from the movie was historically accurate and for this the movie represents correct historical information that not only informs the watcher of what happened but keeps us hooked with this dialogue. In the scene when they are making phone calls to their loved ones at home we can see how people acted and sense the horror that they went through.<br/><br/>I will now be discussing character development in the film. Throughout the film we see characters learn and adapt the the situation. But as far as character development goes for seeing the characters go through hardships and and developing a new person towards the end of the film we see almost none of this. The characters don't change but throughout the film, only adapt to how I see any human being would adapt to the situation. Because of this lack in character development this film loses its chance at being a 10/10 movie so I give it 7/10.<br/><br/>In conclusion, flight 93 takes us on board a historical journey that informs us about events that happened in the past. Flight 93 does this accurately and with good believable dialogue it lets us sense the tension in what was going on through the people aboard flight 93. However it failed to capture any sort of character development which did not allow us to capture how the people of flight 93 changed and evolved over the flight. Because of this I give this film a 7/10 because it accomplished bringing an accurate representation of what happened aboard flight 93 on september 11th."

Next minute they find out a plane hit the world trade center and then they spend 15 minute trying to figure out what happened. <br/><br/>Huh? Are they for real or what? Any two-year-old could figure out that it was the hijacked plane that hit the WTC.<br/><br/>It started good and then they lost me at 35 minutes into with the totally non believable dialogue that no one knew what happened. No one put 2 and 2 together and maybe just maybe the plane that was hijacked and disappeared near manhattan was maybe the same plane that hit the WTC?<br/><br/>How many times do they need to be told there are hijacked planes before they figure it out?

","I happened to see United 93 when visiting family in a London rental apartment and given we know the tragic ending, I must admit I didn't think I could be so gripped by United 93. Maybe it's because the director and writer Paul Greengrass is British, we get a non-gung-ho but moving account of this terrorist attack. The cast doesn't have any big Hollywood names, but we still really want them to overpower the terrorists.<br/><br/>Even in the final, gripping and horrific scene, I was hoping against hope that the brave passengers managed to land the plane. That's how convincing I thought the acting was. I mean, when I watched the Titanic (the Kate Winslet one), I just felt it was inevitable that the iceberg would prevail, but in United 93 I really thought that just maybe in an alternative universe where Gore won the Miami recount in 2000, the terrorists would be overcome by the heroic Americans."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""United 93"" (2006) isn't my favorite picture by a mile. But this is probably the ONLY movie in my lifetime which left me speechless, for like literally 10 minutes after credits start rolling. Words can not express for devastating, vulnerable, angry i felt after first few minutes when this movie ended. I can not recall when a movie took me so hard, delivered me to the place and left me experiencing events so purely like ""United 93"" did. <br/><br/>It is not a movie where you can identify with someone - you are just a viewer, seeing things from outside - in the beginning (because the whole picture is shoot in almost documentary style). After some time, you won't be feeling yourself as a viewer - you will be in there, with theme, at the time, EXPERIENCING everything. Strange, but i didn't felt like i was seeing good guys and / or vs. the bad guys (although they are the worst what planet Earth could produce in it's lifetime - that is my opinion). That is because of the brilliant and one of the kind to say the least directing and screenplay by Paul Greengrass - for this movie he should be remembered forever (calm down - no one will ever forget ""Bloody Sunday"" or even ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" - but i do not want to even hint on title ""Born"" in with the movie like ""United 93"", which is a most powerful tribute, probably, ever). <br/><br/>Overall, if you are human being with emotions and comprehension - ""United 93"" is something to be witness by yourself. Don't be shine to be devastated by it - it is how a human nature should be responding to it. And to all of you who hated it and called it propaganda and etc. - i feel sorry for you - this masterpiece isn't for you, although it should have been... as we are all human."

I had to take a few seconds before I start the car. It's almost ten years since then. 9/11 grows further into the distant past. Watching it again, I thought some of its power may have dissipated. I got a little blasÃ© about it initially and then the terrorists break into the cockpit. The intensity comes flooding back. I'm shaking once again. I think the growing distance from the actual event has diminished the anxiety but it may always be there. Director Paul Greengrass is able to bring all of it out onto the surface."

This movie is a powerful memorial and is making us very proud of those anonymous people for what they did for the country.<br/><br/>United 93 is also focusing on the people who were on the ground and were witnessing the terrible events which were unfolding that day. While the entire world was watching the tragedy live and trying to make a sense of it, the ATCs, NORAD and FAA officials were struggling to get the situation back into control and despite the incredible confusion going on, did what they could.<br/><br/>Some directors could have decided to turn this into a Hollywood movie and exaggerate the facts but Paul Bluegrass decided to stick to the reality and real history as much as he can and we can feel he and his staff made a lot of research to really honor those heroic passengers.

","The Impossible Film Review<br/><br/>Hi!<br/><br/>A Brief Summary:<br/><br/>The General plot of this true story revolves around a white British family, whom live in Japan due the father's (Ewan McGregor)job. They are on Holiday in Thailand, at a beach front hotel, for Christmas and bear the brunt of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. The Family are separated and of course attempt to find each other and help out others along the way.<br/><br/>I can honestly say this was a great film.<br/><br/>It was gripping throughout. Just a continuous stream of ""what's next"" or ""what are they gonna do now"".<br/><br/>The Acting is 100% Believable, and although all performances were good, there were a select few that were absolutely superb. Ewan McGregor performed well, while Naomi Watts also had a very good performance. Despite these two playing key roles, and acting in a properly ""raw"" and believable fashion, Tom Holland(Lucas)was absolutely astounding. He was the center point of the movie really, and even though it was such a big ask for an actor of his age, he smashed it. It was him that made the film what it was, and his character really helped the flow of the film. Seeing the Emotional roller-coaster he went through, and the way he had to quickly mature, somehow made it very relatable.Certainly not stupid or unrealistic like some have said.Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast's performance as the two, cute, innocent younger brothers was effective, and at times really added a different sort of element to the film.<br/><br/>I agree with certain users who have said things along the lines of ""there wasn't a single Asian casualty in a film about a Asian tragedy"". That is the only thing I can fault about this film. But to be honest, unless you're a particularly observant person like me, it's hard to notice it in the midst of what's going on!<br/><br/>It was well scripted, and it wasn't over the top. This has shown Hollywood how to make a decent true story film. It wasn't ALL action, and it didn't particularly try and force you to feel anything. It was more of an ""open"" movie which you could interpret in your own way. The Cat and Mouse like chase scene where your thinking ""will they spot each other"" is effective yet also unobtrusive.<br/><br/>The Fact that it is a True Story, which is mentioned several times, makes it even more real and touching. To think that what happened there was real (not just the story but many places, such as the hospital, were where these events actually took place,)is heart breaking and truly moving. Especially the Re-Union Scene towards the end. Even most of the people in McGregors Scene who were telling their stories about them and their families were real survivors. This is actually based on the story of the Almarez Family, who were portrayed by the cast of this film!<br/><br/>And it's a good portrayal at that, with no over the top dramatizations.<br/><br/>It's just real. That the best way to describe it...Just Real!<br/><br/>All in all this is an eye opening and must see movie!<br/><br/>An absolute must-watch!"

","The fear, the panic, the chaos.... all of it is depicted in an amazing manner. The film is very short, to the point, and full of thrilling moments. The last 15 minutes or so almost leave you with tears in eyes and make you feel like one of the passengers going through the horror. For a moment one feels as if to vow to never travel by air.<br/><br/>One most emotional aspect of it was how people in it bravely decide to take on the hijackers and devise a plan. How I wish that they had been completely successful with their plan and had been able to land the plan safely after fully rescuing it from all four hijackers. Regardless, them being able to prevent the hijackers from reaching the aimed target itself is a great story of success and I salute them for that.<br/><br/>One annoying thing about the film was the noise and constant, loud chatter in the control rooms. ""There is a hijack"", ""No, there isn 't"", ""We go this way"", ""No this idea is better."" The noise causes headaches an hour into the film. I respect that this is how might have been the case on that chaotic morning in September, but a film should always be made differently, with the aim being to engage the viewers."

","United 93 is OK. I was not interested in watching a movie that told the story of the ""fourth hijacked plane of 9/11"" since this is not what I expect from a movie. Actually, for ""very serious events"" such as acts of war involving many civilian death, I'd rather watch a good documentary that doesn't have to chose between angles and can expand those that are spiralling away from action itself.<br/><br/>The real story of United 93 is pretty simple, alas. Paul Greengrass does a great job of putting in the perspective of that fateful day. Now the real story is pretty lame in terms of action and it is distressing to sit through what happened on this flight. People were brave, but mostly because the terrorists were unlucky departure was delayed thus the shock factor vanished gradually as people got time to phone and understand the big picture.<br/><br/>I don't feel this adds much to the story, on the other hand there was no telling a different story. And I don't think movies should just be made to entertain the masses. Maybe the victims family appreciated the homage, but as a movie it has the same value as a wikipedia entry. I would even say it is less gripping because all is shown and you have little legroom to imagine how it looks like, hence less power to imagine yourself in that plane."

","Based on the true story of United 93 which was the fourth plane hijacked on 9/11 the film is dedicated to both those who died except the terrorists and the families and friends of those who were killed. Paul Greengrass had done a great job directing this film and it was the way he directed it that made it felt the hijacking was actually happening instead of everyone acting.<br/><br/>The film opens with four al-Qaeda Arabs preparing to hijack a plane United 93 headed for California from New York. The passengers who wait at the gate with the four thugs will not know that they will never see their loved ones again and ironically one of the passengers Tom Burnett who is perhaps the film's main protagonist sits beside pilot and ring leader Ziad Jarrah the main antagonist of the film and the pair would go on and end the film as they both fight over the yoke.<br/><br/>Once in the air at 35, 000 feet the terrorists hijack the plane. While Ziad Jarrah and co pilot Saeed al-Ghamdi are in the cockpit the other two Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi hold the passengers hostage. Despite this the passengers knowing they will die if they don't do nothing fight back. Despite killing the two men and overpowering Jarrah and al-Ghamdi the former manages to crash the plane instead of heading for the Capitol.<br/><br/>The film I think was probably slightly different than it happened in real life to make it more dramatic. I also think the hijackers especially al-Nami were criminally insane as he went as far as trying to hit the passengers with a food trolley and using a fire extinguisher.<br/><br/>I honestly think this was a great film full of terror and heroism."

","This movie must be watched every September 11th. Paul Greengrass, the director of the movie has portrayed the events of the crash of United 93 so realistically, you'd feel like you're actually in the movie. The movie uses no-name actors and realistic, un-cinematic camera techniques. It doesn't even feel heavily fictionalized compared to Oliver Stone's World Trade Center which came out the same year as this one. You also get a perspective on the hi-jackers on what their mission is. You can clearly know that they have been brainwashed but just as scared as the passengers are. The movie also takes a lens on various air traffic control centers around the area and watch their reactions to the horrific events of 9/11.

Paul Greengrass does an amazing job of showing the heroism of the passengers and crew who did all they could to stop the hijackers from hitting their intended target. I cannot watch this movie without crying for two reasons - it is based on a real event and the acting is incredible. I really appreciate Greengrass for casting unknown actors so you don't see their celebrity. You appreciate their portrayal for what it is. The ending is especially moving and the music adds to the tragedy. Even if there were no music, it wouldn't be any less powerful. I highly recommend this movie. I like it better than the other movie that was made about United 93 because this one seems less forced and more accurate. It seems the other movie was focused more on adding details that probably did not occur rather than staying true to the story as it was.

I find myself crying not because they all die at the end, but because of the heroic act of retaking the plane. Because of 40 brave souls, that plane did not reach its target that day. The suspenseful music by John Powell was a great addition to the retaking scene. I literally had tears coming out of my eyes.

","In general, ""United 93"" is a well-produced docudrama, but unfortunately the opening scene is rooted in a hate-based approach, which sets the tone of the movie to be inflammatory patriotic propaganda. The terrorists are shown as devout Muslims and since everyone knows how the story will end an immediate distaste for them and their beliefs is instilled in the viewer. And please don't get me wrong, I am not a believer of Islam (or any other major world religion for that matter), but the people who hijacked United Flight 93 were religious extremists. Not portraying them as such only incites cultural and religious hatred, rather than true understanding. A much better opening scene would have shown glimpses of their lives and what brought them to this tragic end. Show them as people who through a series of events are twisted and perverted into extremists who terrorize and murder in the name of their beliefs. So please do not watch this movie, it does not help make this world a better place."

WE all were deeply shocked by those terrorist attacks in New York and DC, and we all watched frozen in horror those blood-chilling moments of crashes.The movie about United 93 could prove a real masterpiece. It is OK but still falls short of its goals. I understand that Mr. Greengrass wanted to make the whole event as authentic as possible, but in reality we needed up with extremely dry, slow, dull and boring footage of almost second-per-second depiction of events. OK, but this is a documentary film, right? I was very bored after 20 or 30 minutes and nearly made myself watch it till the end. I agree, life is not an excitement as it is shown in blockbusters, granted. But then, the filmmakers could better shoot a very accurate documentary and then get a better result.

","I have very little to add to so many of the comments already mentioned here. When the end came, I could not move. I was aware that I was watching a movie, but such was the quality of the production, that it overran my conscious mind. I could feel the sweat breaking out on my forehead, and my body became warm as I watched the anguish mount. I'd never experienced that before. I felt I had regressed to some previous primitive state when I thought of what those evil men did; what they put through so many innocent people. This was not about God and belief, this was an evil act fuelled by delusion. As was all that happened on that terrible and wicked day. It is impossible, for myself at least, to write a coherent and unbiased critique of United 93, for too many emotions are in my way. Nevertheless, having calmed down a little, I remember it as a well made film, with utterly convincing characters. Already suffering from pteromerhanophobia, I will never fly again. One last thing. Evil occurs in the minds of all human beings. We ought not to judge all Muslims by what happened that day. If all Muslims were evil, their religion would have died out a long time ago. Right always wins. Eventually. It is the nature of the world."
"asda-man","5","0","2","15 September 2011"," Took a nose dive like the plane
","""United 93"" was not as great as it could and should've been. It had several problems which most people would call weaknesses but also some strengths that make it worth watching. One of the weaknesses in my eyes was the extremely hand-held documentary feel of the film. Shaky cam is great now and again but when it starts to consume the whole film with no control what so ever it starts to become tiresome. Supposedly it was supposed to show the whole panic and lack of control of the whole situation but it needed to be much more controlled like in ""Black Swan"" or ""The Wrestler"".<br/><br/>Another weak point was the way the first three quarters were so slow. We don't really care or understand about these plane dots that keep disappearing and several calls from planes saying that they've been hijacked. It became very repetitive and the plane that the whole film is about (93, my age) became over-shadowed until the final scenes. In my opinion the film would've been stronger if it was focused almost completely on 93 being hijacked.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the lack of plot. Some may argue that the plot simply was about the 9/11 attacks which is fine, but there were no real characters who we could care about. There seemed to be very little characterisation going on which means the story stalled and couldn't get passed a certain road block. A story could've perhaps been made up, maybe not to the extent of ""Titanc"" but it might've been better if it focused on one or two particular people or families so that the plot could be driven forward a bit more.<br/><br/>But, if we put aside all my perhaps unreasonable comments, they're are some good aspects about the film. It did feel realistic which is a sort of must in a real-life account type film. It felt like you could imagine this happening which was good. It was also good how they used unknown actors as this added also to the realism of it all. The final 20 minutes or so are also really good, when the plane actually gets hijacked and the passengers fight back it's thrilling and intense and it should've been like this throughout instead of focussing on the traffic-control peeps.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is worth seeing if you get passed the slow beginning. It's final act is what the film is about with great and inspiring actions by the passengers. It's ending is also really good and truthful. Perhaps, if you remember the 9/11 attacks you might appreciate it more, but I was a mere nipper."

The families did not want them to be named or singled out, out of respect for the rest, but this is to the detriment of film-making. It means that we cannot empathize with them very much.<br/><br/>A very interesting and moving feature of the real-life tragedy was the fact that the passengers were able to phone home during the crisis - something new in the history of hijacking. Flight 93 makes the most of that. This film, though, pares it right down to repeated brief shots of people saying ""I love you"" and ""Just tell them I love them"".

","I have just recently watched this (much vaunted) film and found it lacked *something* but I couldn't quite work out where. The film doesn't rely on heart-wrenching phone calls (like Flight 93) but focuses on the confusion and impotence, of air traffic control and a military command centre that cannot quite grasp what is going on. Very true I am sure, who the heck trains for such an event? Yet it leaves the viewer feeling cold rather than emotional. The lack of govt. and indeed military response maybe the point, but when has that been news? The passengers and crew, having realised the situation are given just enough due credit for their actions, but it all seems to come to little too late in the movie. Upon reflection perhaps what was portrayed may have been realistic, but just too sterile."

I think it is cheap change to have thrown a mere 10% of profits from the FIRST 3 days ONLY to the memorial fund. Okay, so it amounted to a little over $1 million, but how much more money did the producers and Universal line their pockets with? I just think that is wrong. Shame on you - you should not profit off the misery of others like that.

I know this was the official version of what happened in 9/11/2001 but this is too surreal. The only intelligent people in this movie were the people on the plane including both the passengers and the hijackers. But there is no way airlines could oversee 4200 planes if they were this inordinate dumbs. And good luck for a country that has such a helpless incapable air force. I refuse to believe that after two planes has crashed into the WTC the US air force still cannot send fighters to intercept the rest of the hijacked commercial planes.

"icgiggly","3","0","7","26 July 2008"," Why Flight 93 is soooo much better than United 93
","Flight 93 was amazing. I accidentally rented out United 93 when I wanted to watch this movie for the fourth time with my friends, and seriously every second I was noticing places where Flight 93 did it better. I almost cried with this movie, since it really brings you into the lives of the people who were involved - both on the plane and off, as in the families and all the tearful conversations and goodbyes. When I was watching United 93 I felt like I was watching a documentary. There was barely any emotion in it. Almost the whole thing takes place on the ground in that big airplane controller room with the tvs, and even only towards the middle do some people BEGIN freaking out - up until wayy into the movie no one was even excited, and it was very very boring to me. To me the whole thing was boring, because there was no emotion in it, and after seeing Flight 93, I knew what the story was, and I knew what happened, so seeing a documentary with a little bit more info on the behind the scenes from the controller room was absolutely boring. I watched the movie hoping it would get better but it didn't. The thing is, it probably is possible for people to like United 93, because maybe it could be good, but just not after Flight 93, which I feel may give you an even better grasp of what actually happened that day, and it really makes you cry. It just delivers such a stronger message, and is really amazing all the way through. I saw some comment on United 93 saying something like ""the last 15 minutes make you cry!!"" I did not cry a bit, or even get close to crying! While with Flight 93, the emotion is there, the whole movie, so obviously you cry at the horrible ending!! I feel that the reason someone would cry at the end of United 93 is just because they feel sad about that actual day, and not because the movie itself actually had such a big effect that it made them cry. I admit, maybe United 93 was more ""Hollywood"", maybe because it had more big music or something, or maybe it has some more common actors? I don't know, but if anyone wants to use the fact that Flight 93 had no famous actors in it as a reason to prove it's not big - I bought the DVD, and in the behind the scenes thing they explained that although they totally could have had all the famous actors play in the movie, they specifically chose the unknown ones so that it would look more real and it would look more like actual people were dying and not just some actor in another movie. But I was very surprised though that all these actors were unknown, because everyone's acting in this movie was amazing - truly undiscovered talent. All around, Flight 93 had the perfect script, the perfect actors, and all around the perfect technique to make an amazing movie, and while United 93 might have the Hollywood name, Flight 93 is without a doubt twenty times better."

This gimmick is being used in a lot of movies today and it's not necessary. <br/><br/>Please, producers and directors, movies can be just as dramatic without all the spastic camera work.

","UNITED 93 takes the audience back to the terrible day on September 11th 2001, aboard the hijacked plane which never reached its target. The film is an emotionally roller-coaster ride from first to finish. All the way through, you are thinking that this is one hell of a movie, full of excitement and intensity. But then you just come to think of the true aspect, that this is actually based on the real events.<br/><br/>I can't think of ANY film which has ever given such a great emotionally impression to me than UNITED 93 has. Comparing to WORLD TRADE CENTER which, besides being a great film, tells the story from a more American point of view and is with well known actors, UNITED 93 is based on phone calls from passengers to their families and therefore is a much stronger impression. And the fact that all the actors are more or less unknown makes the impression even stronger. Normally I don't cry during films, but it is certain every damn time I watch UNITED 93 that the tears spring from my eyes like the Niagara Falls.<br/><br/>Everyone should watch this historical film at least once in their life; it is an important story about heroism and about ordinary citizens preventing terrorists from making a world wide disaster.

But the film goes far beyond that. It is simply the finest crafted film I have ever seen. What got me the most was the fact that no matter how many times I have seen it, it seems so profoundly real -- because it is real! The acting and direction are superb. It is excruciating and chilling from the opening scene, and I was holding on with gripped emotions during the entire movie. In all honesty, this film moved me so much that it made me wish I was on board United 93 fighting those totally mad terrorists! Their courage and (and intelligence) to surmise what was happening and put a plan together to fight back, I will never forget or cease to be inspired by.

","United 93 is a frightening retelling of the tragic events of September 11 2001. The film is essentially a real time recount of the horrors of the blackest day in American commercial airliner history. It is the true story of a commercial airliner hijacked by terrorists with the goal of slamming into the White House.<br/><br/>With the Twin Towers already destroyed by two other hijacked flights and the Pentagon already in flames, United 93 was the final assault vehicle to complete an unprecedented attack on America. Not since Pearl Harbour had America been attacked on its home soil, but come September 11 2001, all of that was about to change.<br/><br/>United 93 is as riveting as it is macabre to watch. Here is a retelling of the inefficiencies of bureaucracy; the inefficacy of intelligence and the lack of co-ordination between various civil and military agencies. It is the factual recount of citizen bravery; hijacking horror and absolute pandemonium.<br/><br/>The recreation of the events of that fateful day was dramatized by the filmmakers, but countless hours were spent on effectively developing characters akin to those who lost their lives on that flight.<br/><br/>This film was not produced for entertainment purposes; it is essentially an historical non-fiction documentary, dedicated to the memory all of those people who lost their lives 6 years ago.

","Its only dawn for movies about 9/11, the only full length feature film I know of being World Trade Center, which was terrible. That being said, that automatically makes this the best 9/11 movie so far- I even like it more than the documentaries that recover footage.<br/><br/>Opening on a tense and dark note, the movie wastes no time setting up everything. The terrorists board the plane, the other planes are hijacked, the WTC is hit, and the military is in a frenzy. While all this comes out good, the scenes on the plane are too slow-moving until the plane is finally hijacked in a dramatic and moving sequence.<br/><br/>After the hijacking, the passengers make phone calls to their loved ones, hear of the 9/11 plot, and decide to take action. Everyone on board is a hero, but a problem lies in not knowing who they are.<br/><br/>When people are calling their loved ones you feel for them but you're most likely not going to end up teary-eyed. The performances are touching but not having a story backdrop keeps it from moving you to tears.<br/><br/>The stand out performances of the film are the terrorists aboard United 93. They barely speak much and you can see the inner conflict in one of them simply by the expression of his face. The hijacking itself is very frightening and the terrorists are merciless.<br/><br/>While the film is strong, its a bit too slow-moving and therefore, can make it boring. And not knowing who anybody was makes it hard to evoke any emotion in one unless they lost a loved one that day. I live in NYC but did not, so after my first viewing I felt my attention going elsewhere. I recommend it for one viewing and one viewing only. 7.4/10."
"SteakSalad_101","10","0","1","31 July 2007"," So well-done, so realistic, so tasteful, so gut-wrenching, so terrifying...it cuts straight to your soul
","United 93 was one I skipped over last year. Last year I took the view that any film made so close after 9/11 to be distributed wide in theaters that was about 9/11 was absolutely wrong, exploited Americans, and did not deserve my ticket money. But considering the high success United 93 had, the outstanding reviews it gathered, and its popularity at the Academy Awards, I decided to give this movie a chance at Blockbuster tonight.<br/><br/>I had read all over the place before I watched it that it was an extremely emotionally intense film. I am very attracted to these types of films because many times they cut right to the soul of you and make you wonder how lucky you are. I thought I had seen everything filmmakers had to offer in this genre. I was wrong.<br/><br/>From the very first scene, United 93 reaches out to you and brings you back six years ago to re-witness the terror America went through on the fateful day, September 11th, 2001. In a close-to-real-time manner, we are taken through--from start to finish--the morning that America will never forget.<br/><br/>MANY people still refuse to see this movie and others similar to it because they believe it is wrong to make such a film after the tragedy of 9/11. I can say with full confidence that ""United 93"" is not a piece of B-movie Hollywood over-dramatic crap set on the day of 9/11 to entertain audiences in a summer popcorn movie. United 93 is extremely tastefully done not to provide entertainment for its viewers...but what it does provide is something much more valuable, and that is terror. From the moment you start watching, you are pulled into your TV screen and experience every single gut-wrenching moment along with the passengers on United Flight 93. As if you were one of the passengers on the plane, you experience every ounce of terror, every single moment of fear, and every single bit of hate for the terrorists hijacking the plane. You are no longer wrapped up in a cozy blanket on your couch with your newly installed HD television set you put it into impress your successful neighbour. You're a passenger on Flight 93.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass delivers an exquisitely directed film (one of the best direction jobs I have seen in my years as a movie critic) and paired with extraordinarily realistic acting performances by everyone in the film. The film is shot similar to a documentary and it truly makes you feel like you are watching rare camera footage that survived the crash instead of a film made in a studio. Everything about the film is so realistic, I'm actually having trouble calling it a ""film"" in this review.<br/><br/>Of course, United 93 is not for everyone. It is without a doubt the most emotionally powerful film I have ever watched and quite possibly the most terrifying movie I've ever sat through in all my years of seeing extreme horror films. The violence is extremely strong, very disturbing, and shockingly realistic. There are very few scenes free of peril and sometimes the emotional intensity gets so high you want to turn off the movie. But then you think of the people that really were on that plane--they couldn't just turn off the movie. They had to go keep fighting, and that thought alone will keep you watching.<br/><br/>But even so, this is more than a film showing the absolute terror that went on in the cabin of Flight 93. This is a film that shows true American spirit, and you feel compelled to join the brave men and women who attempt to storm the cockpit. You feel compelled to take up a weapon--which is anything you can find on the plane--and join the attempted take-back of the plane. And even though everyone who watches the film will know the outcome automatically...you still see that last beam of hope inside you. The last beam of hope that maybe, just maybe, these guys can take the terrorists down. Maybe, just maybe, the storm to the cockpit will work. And that's the moment you know that United 93 is more than just a movie...it's a true masterpiece."

However, I still felt that the filmmakers did not do enough in their depiction of the passengers on board and the true bravery that they exhibited in preventing United Flight 93 from becoming another weapon of terrorism. I think the film was a good overall look at the day as a whole, but you do not get a sense of who the passengers (read heroes) on the flight were, where they were from, and how much courage they had to have had to do what they did. the people on that flight selflessly sacrificed their lives so that others in Washington and the capital region could live, and I do not feel that the bravery of this act, nor the character and background of the individuals on board was adequately depicted."

What else could they possibly say about the subject that hadn't already been said.<br/><br/>Well, I was very surprised at this film. I really liked the way it concentrated on the control towers and the FAA and the military and the confusion that was going on. You could see the horror on the faces of these people as they saw the second plane hit the tower. You could see the confusion as they tried to figure out what was happening. It made for some very dramatic and compelling viewing.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass kept this story moving even though things were happening in several places at once.

And I met many people who didn't have a chance on that morning.<br/><br/>This film does by far the best job of capturing the feeling of that morning.

And the sheer joy when they announced that all planes were grounded.<br/><br/>And learning what happened on United 93 was almost the worst - because they knew what was happening. They knew what they faced while so many other victims that day either were obliterated or died not knowing exactly who was responsible or why.<br/><br/>When my daughter (born after 9/11) is ready to know what happened that day, this will be the DVD (or whatever we use to play movies by then) that I will play.

This is the effect United 93 will have. You won't get more tension, you won't get more drama, and still it is a decent film lacking exploitation or exaggeration. Of course, one might be tempted to say, what is depicted here is closer to reality because reality itself is portrayed. Then again, the exact details of what took place on that fateful flight will always remain a riddle. Many pieces have been found, but they can't make up a complete solution. Well aware of this, director Paul Greengrass, on his audio commentary, calls his film an attempt to present a ""believable truth"". - The 9/11 commission found out that the passengers on flight 93 were only seconds away from overwhelming the hijackers. Lines on paper can transfer that into readers minds; but it's images like here that create a lasting impact.

","From the first frame of ""United 93"", it became obvious to me that writer/director Paul Greengrass was very well aware of the sensitive subject matter of this movie. I remember vividly the events of September 11, 2001, as do many of us, and this movie delves into the motivation of the passengers of the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 93, and why it crashed into a Pennsylvania field instead of a Washington, DC, landmark, as the hitchhikers had intended to do.<br/><br/>Every shot in this movie was hand-held, giving it a documentary feel. Every passenger captured on-camera at the terminal looked and acted so real, I thought I was in the terminal with them. Let me say, for the record, it is not easy for me to become that involved with a movie, but I did here.<br/><br/>I also want to give kudos to Greengrass for adding even more to the realism of ""United 93"" because of its cast. The crew of the airliner were real pilots and flight attendants (some of them employed by United Airlines). Many of the air traffic controllers were real, as were many of the military personnel featured in the movie. As an added bonus, some people actually played themselves. I'm not talking CNN anchors, either. Some of the people in this movie were reenacting their experiences on that fateful day, and I found them completely believable.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is not the kind of movie you would ""pop into the DVD player"".

I love the way the sets are filmed from everything from the inside of flight 93 airplane to the air traffic control center, as each moment of this movie unfolds the viewer can keep up with the drama and terror. Also the scenes are shown on monitor of the World Trade Center blowup and the control center scenes of the crew picking up the hijacking of other planes are well done. This movie wraps around the events of 911 perfect from the hijacking of all four planes with the big focus on the 93 flight and the take over from terrorist. The last half of the movie is disturbing as the terrorist overtake the plane in a brutal manner from stabbing passengers and bringing pure hostage horror to the unlucky forty people aboard. In the end these forty people are the real heroes as flight 93 is the only plane that did not carry out the demands of terrorists. Now talk about real and brave human soldiers. Thumbs up to Greengrass for making a film to show the painful terror these people went thru, and it was nice to give their families one last look to honor their memory and to put a final closure on letting the brave ones rest in peace."

The passengers may have failed to save their lives but succeeded to stop the terrorists plans to hit the white house. This is the first movie I've seen dealing with 9/11 and it was very sad. I remember seeing a preview for this in theaters when I saw ""Inside Man"" and thought that looks like a really good movie and it was. The director Paul Greengrass really knew what he was doing with this movie by honoring those brave people on that flight. This movie definitely deserves its 7.9 rating on this website. If you haven't seen this movie yet then go and rent it and get ready to cry. One of the saddest movies I've seen and so far the best movie of 2006."

","I rented this movie out last night after reading the positive review by Roger Ebert. This Movie did just what he said it would. The camera shots were used perfectly to show how fast moving some scenes were. Although none of the actors are terribly well known, they still performed magically in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Another reason why this film is excellent, is because it also brings in to plan how the hijackers are connected to the ones who flew the two planes into the world trade center. This again, was some magic by Greengrass.<br/><br/>So if you're at Hollywood Video the next time, do not let this movie slip by; rent it out, it's superb."

","Does anyone have a comment about the obviously European guy that was the only one strenuously raising doubts about the whole cabin-storming strategy? Unless there's evidence that there was a European on-board actively doing so, it appeared to me to be the only sloppy part of the movie.<br/><br/>It came off as being uncharacteristically crude for a thoughtfully cast movie with such realistic dialog. I suspect it was the writer and director's attempts to symbolize Europe's perceived impotence in the face of terrorism. or perhaps it was an attempt to pander to the American audience (he was a Brit)? I loved the scenes with the ""road warriors"" in first class who are stressed out and oblivious to the extra service they receive from the flight crew when those in economy seem to really appreciate it. They're more concerned that the graphics on some powerpoint may be too complex.<br/><br/>I also though it interesting that it was the corporate guy from first class that was the leader of the revolt. So much for the working class hero!? Also refreshing to see a red-head portrayed in a heroic role ;-) Loved the behind scenes re-enactment of the FAA flight control centers and military command centers. the military lingo was perfect, ""turn and burn"", ""scramble Otis"" and 'weapons!"".<br/><br/>Great movie if you can sit through the anguish of that horrible day again. Also made me miss those pre-9/11 days when planes were less than half full..."

","Little is known about what actually occurred in the waning moments of United Flight 93 on the morning of September 11, 2001. All we have is the mute cockpit voice recorder and the recollection of families based on cell phone messages received from passengers before the hijacked plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pa. with no survivors. We also have the speculative recreation of director Paul Greenglass (Bloody Sunday) in his powerful film, United 93. Shot by Barry Ackroyd using a hand-held camera that makes you feel part of the action, (not recommended for viewers with a tendency to motion sickness), the film dramatizes the efforts of some passengers to free the plane from their captors whom they believed to be dedicated to carrying out a suicide mission, presumably in Washington, D.C. <br/><br/>Using more than 100 interviews with families, friends, and civilian and military officials, director Paul Greenglass shows us what might have happened to the 40 passengers and crew of the ill-fated plane. Striving for a documentary-like reality, Greenglass uses unknown actors and key civilian and military personnel to play themselves, including Ben Sliney who was in charge of the FAA command center. The film, however, does not hesitate to utilize conjecture such as a terrorist placing a picture of the Capitol building on the cockpit steering wheel or details of a final heroic assault on the cockpit. <br/><br/>United 93 begins in chaos and ends in flames. From the barely audible entreaties of the hijackers that open the film to the final prayers of the passengers and crew, the film revisits the fear and confusion of that day. Shifting between the passengers and crew as they prepare the plane for takeoff and air traffic control centers and FAA headquarters in Virginia, we watch helplessly as the nightmare unfolds before befuddled air traffic controllers and military personnel. Without belaboring the point, the director makes it clear that the lack of communications between key sectors and the unavailability of the President and Vice-President contributed to the disaster. Unlike Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911, however, there is no explanation of the fact that the Air Force requests orders from President George W. Bush but receives none. <br/><br/>Excruciatingly slow to move, when the leader Ziad Jarrah (Kahlid Abdalla) decides the time is right to take over the plane, we brace ourselves for what is to come, knowing there can be only one result and the last fifteen minutes are extremely harrowing, to say the least. While, to his credit, Greenglass does not add extraneous human interest dramas, political commentary, or overt demonizing of the Islamic hijackers, the decision to avoid character arcs is both a benefit and a detriment. While it avoids reducing the action to the level of a TV movie of the week, it also deprives us of any knowledge of the individuals involved, knowledge that might help us care more about what is happening. <br/><br/>United 93 does not bring closure to the tragedy or put it in perspective relative to subsequent events but only succeeds in rekindling our anger toward Islamic militants and, perhaps inadvertently, supports the Bush agenda. The result is a powerful experience but one that is strangely devoid of humanity and left me feeling drained and depressed with little space for quiet reflection or contemplation."

"planet9","5","0","4","17 November 2006"," Good movie...but
","OK, yes this movie is good and does capture the agonizing horror of what happened. But...there are some problems with this film that really hurt the overall effect in my opinion.<br/><br/>First of all is the terrible, amateurish camera work. I had a really serious headache after watching the shaking, unsteady camera in this movie. Not since ""The Blair Witch Project"" has anything been so poorly filmed.<br/><br/>And then there is the endless talk, talk, talk in the control rooms that appeared to be amateurs trying to act. This may have indeed showed how confusing the whole situation was but it was not good film making. If this movie had been filmed with a steady camera (and maybe not just one) the effect would have been much more dramatic and devastating. This is not to say that this was not powerful; many moments actually where horrific and brutally presented how terrible this tragedy was.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job of showing how inept the government was, and the military to allow anything like this to happen and it does make a person wonder...just what was going on??? What was going on? One can get the feeling from the way this is presented that maybe the government did know what was going on and even let this happen? I am not the only one of several people who viewed this with me that got the same feeling.<br/><br/>There is no doubt at all that those passengers were true heroes if there ever were any, and I am not trying to minimize that at all by criticizing this film. The absolute fact is the way this was filmed was very hard on the eyes. I felt like I was in a rowboat on a storm tossed sea with all the jerky, unstable camera work, and that along with the endless control room chatter made this a not so good experience for me, because I felt like I was watching a news show and not a movie at all. Powerful, but could have benefited so much more with some good camera work, better acting (for some), and some major stars thrown in."
"The_Void","6","0","5","14 November 2006"," Dull first hour gives way to a more engaging final third
","I have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that this film was being made as while there have been countless films based on real life tragedies, the events of 9/11 only happened five years ago, and I side with those who think it was too early to have the plight of the victims turned into a film. However, everything controversial is of interest me and so I decided that I would watch the film. This sort of film is on the back foot from the beginning, as the writers don't have the element of surprise where the plot is concerned, and so have to rely on other means to ensure that the film is interesting. United 93 is something like a dramatised documentary, and recounts the events leading up to the crash of the fourth plane; the only one that didn't hit its target. I can't say how realistic the dramatisation is as I wasn't there and haven't seen any documentaries on the disaster, but basically what we have is a plane full of passengers deciding to take on the terrorists and attempt to regain control of the hijacked plane.<br/><br/>The first hour of this movie is really rather boring, as we mostly centre on various organisations as the tragedy of the planes hitting the world trade centre escalates through America. I see this as a movie of two halves; we have the moot first hour, and then the engaging and climatic final third, in which the action changes to the plane of the title. In terms of cinema, what happens on the plane isn't all that exciting; and there are better and more entertaining disaster films than this one. Of course, the fact that it's a real life drama has to be accounted for, and it is not the action but the underlying hope that makes the final third of the film such a good watch. Even though we know how it is going to end, director Paul Greengrass manages to make sure that the audience are hoping that everything will turn out well alongside the doomed cast of characters. The reason I cannot give this film a high rating, therefore, is because I didn't like two thirds of the film. The events of 9/11 was one of the greatest tragedies of the last one hundred years, and so this film has a lot riding on its shoulders. Did United 93 do the tragedy justice? Overall, I don't think so."
"jeremy-bogart","9","0","1","14 November 2006"," Impressive
","I just finished watching this and was left pretty amazed. This film sizzles with raw energy from the first frame to last. The cast of unknowns and hand held cameras creates a feel as if you are there in the plane with the passengers. The cuts back and forth between the various flight control centers also feels very real, probably because many of the people in those shots actually do that for a living, they aren't just actors.<br/><br/>I know many people would not want to watch such a film because it reminds them of the tragedies that occurred. Sure, it makes you think back to where you were that day, what you were doing and how you felt. But, to see this film gives you a new perspective on the situation. To see how real people were trying to deal with this as it was happening. As the passengers tried to overtake the plane, there is inspiration that flows.<br/><br/>It strikes a raw nerve, but it remains very respectful. Did Greengrass know exactly what was happening on the plane, of course not. He was able to create enough of a story to make sure that people would have a portrait of what they went through as well as respecting their memories. No one should be insulted by the portrayals of the passengers on board. He tried to make them look heroic in the face of terror.<br/><br/>Just an impressive film. I do not think I will need to see it again. Once is enough as it left me emotionally drained, but one viewing was worth it. Highly recommended."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","8 November 2006"," An important film that is pretty essential viewing.
","After five years, the events of September the 11th are given the narrative touch and are transformed into a big budget, dramatic silver screen production from 'The Bourne Supremacy' director, Paul Greengrass; and it bodes well.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, history has been plagued with humane tragedies such as wars, famines and other such events involving human misery. What United 93 does is take an event that everybody, and I mean everybody, can relate to in their own way and transforms it into something that everybody can experience. Everybody remembers where they were and what they were doing on 9/11 and it's because the events portrayed in the film happened not so long ago, that all the audiences can experience the events unfolding within this two hour or so story before our eyes.<br/><br/>It's not film directors' fault that five years after the Holocaust was discovered to have happened; nobody made 'Schindler's List' but we should be honoured that we have been blessed with the fact that this one event that spawned a new world can be exploited on a medium we can all relate to: film, so soon after it happened.<br/><br/>United 93 takes on a documentary style which is as clear as day to anybody and we're definitely given the illusion through the camera work and editing that we're meant to actually be there in fact this was confirmed to me about half an hour later during the film when the camera gives a 'second glance' point of view shot/look at the radar when a plane merely disappeared from the screen.<br/><br/>What's also odd, but works in juxtaposition is the fact that we already know the outcome of the film. Wanting the protagonists to win and willing them on is absolutely futile as anybody who's either got half a brain cell or is more than five years old knows what's going to happen  it's why recent events that have dominated the news have done for the past few years. Despite this, the tension is still built up very cleverly through means of confusion and (what I presume to be) actual 9/11 news footage, keeping you poised on an absolute cliff hanger every time a new revelation occurs: 'what will happen now? What will they do?' you ask yourself, and you do genuinely care.<br/><br/>You might have already read or heard, but the final twenty minutes is absolutely spellbinding. I cannot praise it enough. It's like seeing slaves rise up against their oppressors or the long suffering victims lash out at their captors. In this instance, Arabs whom have struck fear into the innocent passengers on board are forced to give a last stand they didn't plan on doing and you just can't take your eyes from the screen. If the phone rings, you'll ignore it. It's that addictive.<br/><br/>Just as 'Schindler's List' was to the Holocaust, United 93 exploits a tragic event and the harrowing circumstances surrounding it into the medium of film for all to experience."

","""United 93"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Paul Greengrass <br/><br/>Starring: Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, David Alan Basche, Cheyenne Jackson, & Peter Hermann <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for language, and some intense sequences of terror and violence) <br/><br/>On September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked by terrorists. Two crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center. One crashed into the Pentagon. The other did not reach its target. The courageous people onboard fought back, overthrowing the terrorists and, unfortunately, crashing the plane in the process. No one survived the impact. ""United 93"" tells the story of this plane and the struggle endured by those people onboard--those people who sacrificed everything so that the terrorists would not fulfill their mission. And it tells their story with such a profound elegance and with such masterful storytelling. With almost completely unknown actors and actresses and shot with basic cameras (rather than the high-tech, digital ones usually used for such films), it tells its story with such utter realism and simplicity. This is not a film that delves into conspiracies, hidden meanings, and other such things. We know exactly what our characters know--very little else. The only difference is that we know how their day will end. This makes the movie all the more emotional and heart-wrenching to watch. From the very first scene and from the introduction of our characters, we know that the flight will not end well for them. It is a bleak, cheerless moviea movie that left me drained and very sad, but proud. I was proud of the heroes portrayed in the movie and I was proud of how this movie portrayed them. This is cinema at its best.<br/><br/>Many people may argue that it is too soon for this movie to be made. I do not feel as though this is true. In fact, I think that this is a movie that should have been made. The story of what the people onboard Flight 93 endured is an important story--one that people should know about. How close to or how far from the truth this movie actually is, I cannot say, but it seems like a valid story. It does not appear fictionalized or glorified in any way. Unlike most movies that portray tragedies, we are not given one or two characters to follow and then the rest are simply placed there for fodder to various explosions, stabbings, beating, and other miserable deaths. Every character portrays a real person and we do not follow any one in particular. All are shown as part of a whole. It is as though we are merely onlookers, watching the people as they arrive, learning only what we can as they befriend each other or talk to loved ones on cellular telephones. Our story begins at the airport when they arrive and it ends just moments before they die. All exterior events shown are done so to enhance the events taking place onboard the plane. We are not shown any family members of the passengers and, even when they speak to their loved ones via the plane's phones (or their own personal cell phones), we do not hear their voices. This is done because it was not the loved ones' stories the movie was telling. We know the heartbreaking tragedy they will endure and we do not need to see it on screen. Through the tears of the passengers as they speak to their family members and friends, we are, in a way, seeing the story through everyone's eyes. We are hearing what the families heard and we know exactly what they know (as all events outside of those on Flight 93 are shown through CNN segments).<br/><br/>This is an almost completely flawless film and any gripe I had with it are more like nitpicks on my behalf, rather than actual problems with the film. I did not understand much of the airline lingo used in the ground control centers, making many of the scenes set in these areas useless to me. Is this a complaint? Yes, a complaint against me for not understanding what I was seeing. The dialog in these scenes was not watered down for the sake of more uninformed audiences (like me). Much like if we stepped into one of these areas in real life, we would either understand what we were seeing or we would not. The employees would not use simpler terminology for us. This was bittersweet for me. On one hand, I was happy to see that the movie did not sacrifice any of its intelligence, but, on the other hand, the movie lost me in a few parts and I felt as though I was merely watching chaos. But, then again, maybe chaos was what I was supposed to be seeing. Maybe, these scenes were done this way so that we, like many people watching the news that day, could not truly comprehend what was happening around us. Or maybe it was merely done so to symbolize the confusion and the lack of planning and understanding that the people in these control centers were enduring at that very moment--when the world was going crazy and it seemed as though the tragedy would never end.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""United 93"" is one of the year's best filmshaunting, realistic, and deeply heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)"

","United 93 is not a Hollywood Glamour thriller portraying the events of September 11th 2001 like a daft blockbuster in the style of Armageddon or Independence Day.<br/><br/>The events of that day are well depicted in a Documentary style 'as it happened' mentality, as if the audience or viewer is an observer at every location where things occurred that terrible day.<br/><br/>Kudos then to Paul Greengrass for professional handling of a very sensitive moment in our history.

Kudos to them for taking this angle and because of this, a wonderful, powerfully honest, and realistic film emerged from this.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film was the seemingly ""shakey camera"" annoyance, the extremely small lettering in the sub-titles during the hijackers conversation (had to keep rewinding), and the somewhat disturbing misses during action sequences that the camera could never quite focus on. It was as if the cameraman was a passenger desperately trying to film and never having the ability to get to the core of the action.

","Paul Greengrass, acclaimed director of 'Bloody Sunday' and 'The Bourne Supremacy,' provides this film with intensity beyond climax; tautly and intoxicatingly retelling the events of the ill-fated journey of United Airlines flight 93, which would cease its travel in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Breaching my personal list of the ""100 Greatest Movies Ever Made,"" Greengrass' '93' is easily the most emotionally strenuous film in a decade, leaving its viewers shocked and still and utterly silenced in horror by its conclusion, which, despite being a film of unparalleled quality, couldn't come too soon. This film could go down as one of the greatest un-enjoyable movies ever made, alongside disturbing epics such as 'Schindler's List' and Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ.' From the film's opening sequences to its HEART-POUNDING finale, I was on the plane, alongside the heroes, straight as a statue as I saw the dismay unravel. My knuckles were clearer than ice as a result of clinching my fists with such vigor. The tension was so disheartening I couldn't blink, leaving my eyes cracked as soil outliving a drought. My body was frozen; it was minutes before I could even move, and my shirt had doubled in size because my heart was beating through my chest with such force. United 93 is downright essential cinema. Unfortunately, due to its relentless psychological strain, I can't recommend it to anyone not prepared to witness one of the most brutally disquieting motion pictures of our time.

"grandenchilada","9","0","1","17 October 2006"," Unfortunately, no spoilers here
","It took me a long time to finally muster the energy (and courage) to go see this movie. Like most of this country's moviegoers, I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see it. To begin with, I am not fond of flying and to experience, albeit vicariously, the horrible sensation of knowing your plane is going to slam into the ground, already filled me with terror. Plus, having been in NY that fateful day, I was not finding myself in the mood to relive it, even if it was through a movie screen. However, being a fan of director's Paul Greengrass excellent Bloody Sunday, and having read the almost unanimously glowing reviews, I went. United 93 is a very good film. And it raises many interesting questions. Are Americans ready to watch a film about this subject five years after that terrible day? To me, if they are ready to watch the crap they do on a routine basis, they should be ready to watch a serious film about the day that changed this country's fate. Here we are, rehashing cheesy disaster films like the Poseidon Adventure, when United 93 is the disaster movie to end all disaster movies. You sit through this film trying to soothe yourself silly by repeating the mantra it's only a movie, when you know full well it isn't. This makes it almost excruciating to watch, and I'm almost ashamed to confess, extremely suspenseful. We all know how it ends, and still, even though the film has the feel of a documentary, it is written by Paul Greengrass with a beautiful and horrible dramatic arc that is extremely gripping. What I most admire is how spare and direct and powerful the drama is. It is not nationalistic, jingoistic, patriotic or any of the crap we are used to expect from movies about terrible disasters. Mercifully, there are no famous movie stars playing superhuman American heroes, no Arab villains that are caricatures of evil. Everyone in this movie is human, including, surprisingly, and extremely effectively, the hijackers (it just makes their choices all the more pointless, all the more impossible to understand) . There are no speeches, no poetry, nothing that sounds like words on a page, just the urgent, clipped language used in a time of crisis. Somehow, the words uttered by the people on the command control on the ground as well as the passengers and crew in the air, reminded me of the sparseness of Mamet (without the cursing) or of Harold Pinter. The movie is an existential drama and that is its greatest strength. One of my very smart friends pointed out that the real events of 9/11 seemed like a disaster movie to begin with. On the crowded, stunned streets of New York, one half expected Godzilla to appear in the horizon. It was a shocking realization how much like a movie it was: so unbelievable, so over the top. What's really interesting is that United 93 is as realistic and documentary-like as a fictional recreation of a real event can be. Instead of going for the Good vs Evil cliché that has been the mark of American film since day one, the filmmakers had the guts, the brains and the decency to try to recreate the experience of that day as intimately and realistically as possible. In my view, they succeeded in a way that no other film about real human calamity ever has (try to think about any truly worthy film about the Holocaust, for instance). The creative choices must be unsoiled by superficiality or preachiness. Here there are so many thoughtful, brilliant choices: for instance, the use of some of the real controllers on the ground. They must be the only people who can say their own jargon convincingly. I wonder how difficult it must have been for them to act out again that horrible nightmare of a day. The editing is magnificent, the mostly hand-held frantic photography, crammed with subtle details. I even liked the music, except for a couple of key moments where it felt like an unwelcome intrusion. The movie is violent in itself, but it does not dwell on the violence. It is shot as if you were there. It is a cathartic experience. So how much does film influence our perception of reality? Would the scope, the grandeur almost, of the attacks have been possible without the crazy things that happen in the movies? Once more, it seems that truth is way harder, stranger and exaggerated than fiction, and thus, to make it into a movie, Greengrass and his team went for the real. He turned out to be the perfect director for this film. Besides his mastery at pushing the story forward with almost unbearable tension, perhaps the fact that he is not an American also helps. There is a cool rationality in his sparse, stripped down delivery, yet there is also true empathy for the human predicament. He deserves a nomination both for writing and directing. It has been conjectured that the passengers in that flight knew they were going to die and they decided to die fighting. They must have understood that the hijackers intended to damage another crucial landmark. The movie does not dwell too much on their motives. It makes their rebellion, if indeed it happened, seem logical and heroic at a believable human scale."

Just like most of the people who saw this movie (I imagine) i found it depressing beyond belief. the worst is that no matter how much you sit and hope or pray., you know the people wont live. you get that feeling of someone wrapping a belt around your gut and just pulling it tighter and tighter. the feeling doesn't go away, not even when the movie ends, not then and not a week later. This is not to say the movie is bad in any way. i believe it is something people should see even if they cant handle it. The part of this movie that struck me the deepest is the shot of the second plane hitting the tower. I'm going to end the review here, because i feel that i can not do the movie any justice by reviewing it with words. if you are truly interested, see it. thats really all i can say."

","Paul Greengrass has achieved the nearly impossible. He has created a film about a sensitive subject which is often (insensitively) exploited for political gain or propaganda without using any of the clichés or gimmicks which so often permeate dramatic re-tellings. By using low profile, yet indisputably competent actors, he adds realism to a dramatization that could have been hindered by recognizable stars. Case in point; Oliver Stone's misguided casting of Nicholas Cage in his WTC movie.<br/><br/>United 93 is a poignant film, one which no one will emerge from without having felt what it must have felt like to be on-board the ill-fated flight on the morning of September 11th. The last few moments of the film were so intense that I had to remind myself to keep breathing."

Paul Greengrass creates the most likely scenario of what actually happened on United 93, September 11, 2001. By using the real life people in the control towers and military personnel, he grounded a fictional representation in the truth. The camera work puts you in the action and there is no politicking. It is so real to life that he even creates mercy for the Muslim hijackers. He doesn't make it better or worse than it was, it just is. I want to thank Greengrass for making this film. It should be considered mandatory viewing for high school students. I appreciate that he waited this long to release it. Even after 5 years, the nerves around 9/11 lay open, raw, and this film provides healing."

I think the best part of the movie comes on the United 93 scenario when the crew start taking actions, the last part when they start stopping the terrorists it's breathtaking, even at the end their cry for freedom only stops as they begin to fall down into mainland, having no chance to bring the plane back up, they die as heroes."

","This movie is amazing in its construction. The people get on the plane. The air traffic controllers receive a suspicious transmission. Two planes hit the Twin Towers, and one hits the pentagon. Frantically, these people attempt to track thousands of flights and figure out which ones are hijacked. Then on United 93 the terrorists take control of the plane. During the final 15 minutes or so, the crew and passengers attempt to take back control of the plane. They take down the terrorist with the bomb, then the one guarding the cockpit. They bash open the door. The plane is flying low. The terrorist flying the plane looks scared and frightened. One of the passengers trys to wrestle the controls out of his hands. The camera work is frantic, the sound the music and the imagery all builds. There is one final shot, out the cockpit window that shows the ground fast approaching. Everything stops and the screen cuts to black. This is when I started to cry, because no matter how the movie portrays this event, the event was real. It happened. And no matter how sad and powerful this movie is, the real event was ten times more horrific. This movie gives nothing but facts, nothing but what happened. No motives, no bias, no Hollywood. I was so glad I saw this movie, and if your mind hasn't been polluted by politics and conspiracy you will find this movie to be one of the saddest, and ultimately, one of the most uplifting movies ever made. It is uplifting because of what I took from the film, not what the film gave to me."

"shattenjager777","10","0","2","15 September 2006"," A surprisingly excellent, thoughtful, and deep film well-deserving of all its accolades
","I will note that I say it is a spoiler review because I make some interpretational statements. Obviously, at least nearly everyone who sees the film will already know the plot, but how it will be treated is something you may or may not want to know before viewing.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is much more than one might think before viewing. One might expect an overly sentimental piece of near-propaganda showing the heroism of the passengers on-board the flight and demonizing the hijackers, but writer/director Paul Greengrass has the guts and brains to take this premise someplace more interesting and the technical ability to do so in an eloquent way.<br/><br/>The dominant aspect of the film is its direction. First, Paul Greengrass emphasizes how ""human"" (for lack of a better word) the film is by shooting nearly (if not in fact) all of the film with hand-held cameras. Then, he depicts the confusion of the entire situation by, using a Robert Altman-like series of tricks, forcing the viewer to attempt to place the focus and importance where we wish rather than forcing us to focus where he wishes. While these two aspects do make the film rather a grueling watch, that grueling feeling is completely appropriate and in fact is the main strength of this film.<br/><br/>However, Greengrass also manages to create a film that has a depth beyond what most will see on first viewing. The similarities, ranging from their silence toward the other group to their blind conviction that they must do this even if they die to their desire to let their loved ones know how they feel before they do it, that we see between the hijackers prior to their attack and the passengers before they attempt to retake the plane suggest a number of possibilities. Perhaps Greengrass is suggesting that we could understand these hijackers if pushed far enough--because they are doing what they think will be best for the world as a whole even if it's bad for them, in spite of our emotions toward them. Or perhaps Greengrass is suggesting that the terrorists feel that they are fighting for their lives. No matter the interpretation, it is obvious that Greengrass is suggesting something beyond the thought of ""terrorists=bad; passengers=good,"" which makes this film far more interesting than it may appear.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy that the film takes care to treat the hijackers as human, showing that one cares for his family enough to call them before boarding and then seemingly has difficulty bringing himself to commit the actual hijacking. Greengrass's treatment of the hijackers again suggests a deeper meaning or understanding of the events taking place, so that the film becomes that much more interesting.<br/><br/>The other aspects of the film are rather dismissible, since the actors have little to work with but do what is required of them perfectly and what little score is used is excellent but again little is required of it. But these aspects are not at all an indictment but rather a simple example of little being required.<br/><br/>All told, ""United 93"" is a modern masterwork, with far more depth and thought than anyone would expect in a film about such an emotionally stirring event. Paul Greengrass's fortitude and intelligence are on bright display as he uses his camera, sound, dialogue, editing, and all other aspects of film-making to create the most powerful possible effect. The film is not for the feint of heart and is not for quick and simple hero worship, but for everyone else it is a highly recommended masterpiece."

","I watched this movie last night on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and have never been so affected in my life by any movie quite like it. I was literally shaking and convulsing nearing the end; the highlight of the hijacking scene. Probably what added to my physiological state was crying my heart out in a frenzy of watching all the coverage on t.v., all the documentaries, all the comments of the victim's families during the day, and then to end the night by watching this movie.<br/><br/>I opened myself to the raw emotions that seemingly these heroes (the passengers) must have felt. The raw emotions of horror, hurt, pain, dismay, anger and finally determination. They were determined not to surrender to the evils of these religious fanatics (the hijackers). Can anyone be any more courageous than that? Despite the destined danger they were all in, they collectively became a force that symbolized honor and pride. That is what no terrorist could ever take away.... our will to defend, to protect and to do what's right!<br/><br/>One thing that really defines a moment of controversy, is that both these different groups, the passengers and hijackers were praying. But praying for different reasons. I wonder what the (true) Almighty God thought on that very day. I can't help but bring him into the picture, I guess I'm just angry that he could allow a situation of this magnitude to occur. But I know I'm stirring up unnecessary pain by having views like this. Deep down I know that God in his own time, with his infinite wisdom will bring all these men with evil hearts to justice.<br/><br/>I just pray right now, for peace in all our hearts. And for these wicked ideologies, regime, propaganda and erroneous beliefs to be relinquished. It may not happen in our generation but for the path of the future, may there be hope! <br/><br/>Anyhow, the cinematic and directive aspect scores high, but I guess because we know that this is a reenactment of the real thing, that even the second-rated acting is very real and believable.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a movie that deserves high recommendation and for everyone to see it, but only if they're ready to deal with the emotional impact it delivers. Consider it as one positive thing that derived from this whole madness; the valiant heroes of United 93!"

It turned out to be a very well made film and respectful to all those who lost loved ones on that fateful day 5 years ago. It could be tough watching for many people since it brings back so many painful memories, but I also think it's important to look back from time to time to remember the severity of the attacks and why we're at war. Also, the movie casts relative unknowns, which I think is a good idea, since it makes it feel more real with real people. All in all, it's a solid movie.

","We all know the story here.<br/><br/>United 93 offers great tension and drama all centered around a very real event. The fact this is based on a real life attack which most remember vividly makes it far more powerful than any fiction could be.<br/><br/>One of the constant themes of the film is confusion. So many times throughout the characters on screen are asking ""what the hell is going on?"" or some variant there of. Different agencies getting different information from different sources, with so much uncertainty it's not surprising the response was so slow.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is slow, but methodical, peaking every few minutes with another major event (one plane hits tower, second plane hits tower, plane hits Pentagon, air traffic grounded).<br/><br/>Sadly, you can't help cheering a little bit for the passengers of United 93. You know they won't succeed but it's hard not to find yourself hoping they will.<br/><br/>The filmmakers made a very wise choice I think by using almost no background music throughout the film, this made it seem much more realistic to the viewer.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of interesting 9/11 facts revealed at the films conclusion. Perhaps most disturbing of all, the authorities didn't know United 93 had been hijacked until four minutes after it crashed.<br/><br/>See it if you can handle it, it will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through."

I honor their memory, and I am grateful I'm able to do so, in part, by having seen an amazing film.<br/><br/>What made this film so great was its faithfulness to the events and dialogue that have been established as fact. This made the film so compelling because I got to see for myself what happened, what was said, the total humanness of all those involved. Another aspect I appreciated was how the film didn't pull any punches. It didn't gloss over any of the potentially controversial parts of the film.

","Before i started to write my views of this movie i read some views of some people trying to fault people who have not watched this movie and they give their vain misgivings to make people avoid this movie.I wanna know why on earth a man tries to see things in the most reverse angle . I had no chance to see the previews or read the commentaries or the views of the audience of this perfectly written and acted movie with infamous cast. I had expected to acquaint some cast before the movie started but recognized no one and thought the acting would fill that gap and it well did it.At the beginning of the movie the Koran recitations and the above shoot of NewYork city in association with the Arabic words were to give who really had caused that pall of fateful,dreadful 9/11 incident.Paul Greengrass dared to pull off a movie which many directors did not really dare.A movie to show the verisimilitude scale of what were lived on that flight and what those 33 passengers did to be alive and take the control of the plane from the dreadful terrorists' clutch and show how a man can motivate other passengers to splice their unity to stay alive rather than the patriotism .<br/><br/>Greengrass deserved another ovation to have shown the lack of collaboration between the control centre and the air-force base and he stressed to show how passengers alerted their families by the plane telephones and even a passenger called 911 to let them know what these 33 passengers were going through.Paul Greengrass in stead of cinematographic clichés he wanted to put the main concept of the movie and he never exaggerated the reaction of the passengers and never intended to show the terrorists in a demonizing light.He even gave the terrorists' awkward motions to the audience. There was no ''let's make it for uncle Sam '' clichés.The director not only displayed the fear of the passenger but he elaborately indicated the out-of-control sense of the hijackers.It would utterly be a false approach to show those terrorists as cartoon villains and would make many people have preconceived notions against the director. Greengrass performed no arbitrary act.He pulled off this movie like the only someone who stayed alive from that plane crash onto the ground.It was the most beautiful epitome of the group cohesiveness i have ever seen in the movie theaters.This movie's release in September might not be a coincidence.<br/><br/>To sum up this movie is the greatest example to simulate what was felt in that fourth plane. The scenario was the great imagination of Paul Greengrass and he elaborately made this movie and even babies that will be given birth after 10 years will feel well enough what was the dreadful 9/11 event and like the rings of a chain this movie will be conveyed to the future and The USA will not forget."
"slatoid","7","0","1","8 September 2006"," Interesting Perspective
","The perspective I refer to is that of the air traffic controllers and managers, and how they slowly come to the realization of a large-scale attack. It highlights also how unprepared and uncoordinated the airport controllers, the FAA, the military, and the executive branch decision-makers were. To me it begs the question: Have we improved since then? Given Katrina, I'm skeptical.<br/><br/>The depiction of the interaction between the terrorists and passengers was believable and brought out how horrible the experience must have been. Small nits: given the violent maneuvering of the plane I would have thought there'd be injuries caused from being tossed about inside the cabin, and also lots of vomiting - I didn't see anyone vomit. The passengers seemed more concerned about saving themselves, rather than preventing another attack, and I'm happy the producers did not try to depict otherwise. They were ordinary people, not soldiers fighting for a cause. This doesn't diminish their heroism, it makes it real."

","United 93...<br/><br/>On September 11th, everything changed. But I was young, around 11, and failed to recognize these changes. I had no sense of patriotism, and I had never seen, nor heard of, the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon. Same goes with Afghanistan and Al Queda. It's truly amazing when you look at the whole situation in a broad sense. I knew so little, and during that day, I felt so little. I told Ms. Palmer (my teacher at the time) that the world's tallest buildings were no longer there, and then I laughed. It was sick in a way, but I was so young. I regret saying those things now. And today, September 5th, the first 9/11 movie came out on DVD. I rented it at soon as I got home from school, and having just finished watching it, I have quite a bit to say.<br/><br/>I sat Indian style in front of my 13 inch television, glued to the screen. Whether my legs were numb from the way I was sitting, or whether the movie terrified me to that extent, I'm not quite sure. Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) is the last person I'd expect to direct this movie. He's British, for starters, and couldn't have truly experienced 9/11 like anyone else in America did that day. So, I had my doubts. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>It is art, in it's most beautiful form. Every angel, every shot, every actor plays his part with infinite perfection. Ground-control air traffickers try to get a sense of what's going on, a during the same time a plane hits the first tower...right behind them. The initial hit, the second hit, the Pentagon, and finally United 93 all occur practically under there noses. Intensly realistic dialoug keeps you interested during the most dull parts. But once the plane is hijacked, you're no longer in your seat. The expression on the edge of your seat can't keep up with the film. You are there, and it's that simple. When one of the four terrorists straps the bomb on his chest, you are no longer in the audience. <br/><br/>The score by John Powell is no better or no worse than necessary. It keeps the control room scenes tense, and the flight scenes quivering. I was honestly scared watching the movie. It's that realistic, and it works so well. The biggest passengers on the plane run to the flight-attendants quarters, grabbing fire-extinguishers, wine-bottles, cork-screws, anything to help them. They plan to take over the plane, because they know of the Twin Towers, they know of the Pentagon, and it all becomes clear. This is a suicide mission. But one of the visionary perspectives of the film is the terrorists, who we fear for and pain for the most. How Greengrass humanizes these people...these monsters, is far beyond my recognition.<br/><br/>The famous line, ""Let's Roll"" is played down perfectly. It's not a pre-ready, clichéd. action hero line, but a spur of the moment kind of line. Greengrass could have muted the film, readied the heroes in slow-motion, then thrown the line into the blue like anybody else would have done. But no, it's subtle and jumbled and stuttered. <br/><br/>And when they take back the plane...my God is it great. There's only three minutes left of the movie, and in that three minutes, Hell breaks loose. They jump from their seats unexpectedly and storm the first terrorist. There is no gore, only a ten man-to- one rumble for the protection of their country. There is no choreography or balance, and it's perfect. The other three terrorists are confused. Two in the cock-pit and one in the hall, they can only wait for the passengers. <br/><br/>The violins start, but can barely be heard. Screaming and banging and the plane spiraling towards the ground. Greengrass envisions no take-down, no win-lose. He see's, in a shattering finale, the arms of our nation, grasping for the villains, their weapons, the controls, and hope. There is no moral, no character build-up, no wind-up. We don't see where every terrorist ends up on the plane, and where each passenger is during the crash. In the midst of the struggle, we see the ground, moving closer and closer, spinning clock-wise. And whatever we expected from the movie doesn't come. Instead, it's something greater. <br/><br/>I established my mind-set for where I'd go and what I'd do for this country, no matter how corrupt or uncivilized, because this movie offers you inspiration in open arms, and you can't help but take it."

The film was done in such a way that it focused on the sacrifice that those forty people made on that September morning. The characters looked just like everyday people, not really any big name superstars, some I have seen on TV before, but no Tom Cruise or Sarah Jessica Parker (Thanks you).

The actors seem like real people and it really feels like you are watching passengers on the doomed Flight 93.<br/><br/>There was also a great deal of tension created as the stewardesses walked by the terrorists on the plane. You knew they would strike but not exactly when.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes are extremely disturbing. You watch passengers called their loved ones to tell them goodbye. They knew they were going to die but they had to fight back. The conclusion was sad but also inspirational and respectful to those who lost their lives on United Flight 93.<br/><br/>There was no part of this film that felt like exploitation. It felt more like a tribute to the passengers on Flight 93.<br/><br/>I do think this is a great movie for most Americans but some will not want to see it and I can certainly understand why. I also know there are a lot of questions left opened about 9/11, conspiracy theories, questions about the commission report, etc. This movie does not look to question but only show what information could be ascertained from the people involved and try to recreate in as real as possible fashion."

A movie my sister still can not bring herself to watch, for the simple fact that we know it was not dramatized by Hollywood.. this happened.. these poor people on that plane really did call their families to say goodbye. The man really did pray the Lord's Prayer with the 911 operator. <br/><br/>I hope that these 2 wonderful movies did justice to the character of those brave souls that last their lives trying to protect us by taking the plane down. My thoughts and prayers are still with their families and am so glad that they are honored in these 2 great films."

","My wife and i saw united93 today and i was not that keen to see it.Whilst watching this i was thinking where is Bruce and Arnie,but this is real and no heroes to save the day.This chilled me to the very core of my being,it was done quite well with respect to the people on the flight and the air traffic controllers.The film makers have done well considering that the whole world knows the outcome.The pacing is exceptional and the hand held camera work add to the realism.I recommend seeing this as it is a grim reminder of the evil that man can do,and the courage that we all have in us when facing certain death.Our session had a total of six people and it was quite eerie at the end which was also done well."
"irivlin","3","0","4","19 August 2006"," Good film but the Shake-Cam makes it unwatchable.
","I did like the film in some respects but I do not like to leave the cinema with motion sickness. Paul Greengrass (a fellow countryman of mine) either has a neurological disorder or he's obsessed with throwing the camera around to induce sickness in his audience. There was a time when steadicam was used - very frugally - to try and give a little immediacy to a movie. Mr. Greengrass should try and grasp the fact that steadicam is like garlic - use it a little and only on occaasion. To have the entire film with focus going in and out, and with juddering and shaking (which would make a 7 year old with a camcorder look professional by comparison) shows that he has ""Shake-Camitis"", to the exclusion of all other cinematographic techniques. Anyone else on earth could have made a much better job of the photography. After I had to sit and suffer through The Bourne Supremacy (another of Mr. Greengrass's Shake Cam monstrosities, I've decided to leave Mr. Greengrass's films and his St. Vitus's dance to other unfortunate cinema attenders.

","I was terribly skeptical of just how this film would be presented, especially in light of the incredibly sensitive subject. Only the most delicate and tasteful handling would be accepted by a weary public and this would be no easy feat. This being said, I must say I am still, with each repeat viewing I see, utterly blown away by every aspect of it. I personally own more than 2,000 films on DVD and definitely consider myself an aficionado of all cinema and a tough critic of all but the best of the best. This is one of those films. You won't find any box office superstars starring in this film -- the cast is almost entirely ""regular folks"". Though I am not an air traffic controller, I am a very big fan of Microsoft's Flight Simulator; that being said, *everything* I've noticed in the film seems incredibly well-studied and realistic. The cockpit layouts, alarm sounds, even the banter of the controllers seems absolutely authentic and I would not be surprised to find a very tight script that echoes all available real world data -- from ATC tapes to radar tracks to personal testimonies of the personnel from all agencies portrayed in the film. Do not miss this one unless it is too difficult for you to watch. This resets the bar in film."
"kurt-149","5","0","5","13 July 2006"," is this cinema?
","I expected a lot going in for the screening of 'United 93'. Everything I read about the film made me believe I would love it: the integrity, the sober and unattached style in which the film is shot, indeed would prevent that this would be just another propaganda film for the mighty and superb America that brainwashes us everyday. But no, this is 'Elephant' in the air. A stylistic exercise in how you can prevent the viewer from feeling anything. Instead of realistic, it sucked all the reality out of the facts. Since someone made us believe that a shaking camera means reality, some directors can't shake the camera enough. We are the flies on the wall here, but we don't know where to watch first, cause everything is shouting and screaming. Paul Greengrass pushes our faces in the chaos of 9/11 and leaves it all to us what to do with it. Avoiding the manipulate doesn't mean one shouldn't do anything. Objectivity doesn't exist anyhow. And surely this film isn't objective. It makes choices, but many wrong ones. Okay, if this film proves anything, then it is that the chaos on 9/11 was that strong that nobody did what they had to do, that everyone was so surprised that they missed many opportunities to save lives. I'm the last one to say that film has to have a message, but here I wonder why this film was made. It hardly made me feel anything. I feel much more when I watch the news footage of 9/11 over and over again. I really don't understand why this film was made. To make us believe this should never happen again? I knew that. As every human being I knew that from the moment I saw it happen. Disbelief was also my first impression. And it's also the impression the characters in the film of Paul Greengrass. That explains why they don't get into action. Is that why this film was made? To show that reality can be that aggressive, that hard, that unbelievable that the people watching it, can't uplift their disbelief? While we're trained to do that, by watching films. I wonder. When I read 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close By' I was touched by the story of this little boy who is trying to understand for himself. Here, I have a director trying to understand what was happening that day, but his story doesn't do anything to me."

","This film is a brilliant action film written by life. I was deeply touched by the idea that people really can do such a hijacking without any emotions. I also felt with the passengers and their attempt to turn the situation. Unfortunately the film misses any psychological depth or political statement. What makes people in the third world and some Islamic countries so frustrated that they are open for the fanatic wire-puller who seduce people to such a criminal action.What is the role of the USA and their neocolonialistic friends in the global play, what about the crime of poverty and suppression which is the ground of terrorism. To be very clear: all the negative influence of the west may never be an excuse for murdering innocent people wherever in the world. What about the feelings of the passengers and their intention to turn the situation as hopeless as it it. How develops the team dynamic which empowers them to come to action which is a last chance but it also might be a suicide action. A lot of questions which will made it more than just an action movie. At the end all this questions are still open, they are even not asked. Considering the missed possibilities of the historical and human background I was more than a little bit disappointed."
"YuenTequila","8","0","2","21 June 2006"," United 93
","OK, so I saw United 93 today. I had high hopes for this one, due to a great director at the helm, 5 stars in empire and a really good trailer. Of course the fact that the subject matter is one of the most fascinating issues of the past century also boosted it. <br/><br/>This film was awesome. Its one of those films that hits high on almost every cinematic level, but, and heres the thing, its probably the least cinematic film you'll see at the cinema. The entire piece is shot documentary style, with shaky hand held cameras and understated realistic performances. Its so effective that many times you do think your watching a documentary, especially near the beginning when everything appears fine and you just watch the things that everyone does when they're at an airport/ plane (i.e not much). <br/><br/>The sound design also adds a great deal to this. Particularly the scenes in the control tower, when it seems all the more hectic due to the phones ringing, peoples conversations overlapping etc. <br/><br/>This style of film-making being used was quite surprising, but makes sense when you look at the components of production: Working title pictures (British), StudioCanal (European), and of course it is written and directed by British director Paul Greengrass. Though this is a film about a very American issue, it needed the touch of someone who understands the need for naturalistic film-making. The majority of American filmmakers would probably have the terrorists demonised, and one big American star being the main hero. In United 93 however this is fortunately not an issue. The film shows the terrorists angle for much of the film and I found myself feeling sorry for one of the hijackers on more than one occasion. The passengers are shown as mortal human beings who only risk their lives when they have no other choice. No one character really stands out as 'The Star' (helped by a completely unknown cast), but they all deliver really great performances. A special note should be made of the air traffic controllers and military personnel who appear in the film. Over half of them by my count, were untrained actors playing themselves. This obviously adds to the realism. They were saying what they actually said on that day, not some screenwriters interpretation. Despite the lack of acting experience, they don't stand out as bad at all. I only realised they weren't actors when the end credits rolled and there was so many 'As Himself' credits.<br/><br/>The only problem with this film-and it is a minor one- is the pacing. At times I found myself waiting around for something to happen, but to be fair that is almost certainly how it felt for the characters on that day. <br/><br/>Also I do wonder if the film would be anywhere near as effective if the subject matter wasn't so close to home. If it was a fictional account of a plane being hijacked, it probably wouldn't pack the same punch, which emotionally does give Greengrass an advantage. However he doesn't exploit this half as much as he could, and for that, I commend him. There is one rather poignant, irony heavy moment but I think its easily forgiven when you look at the picture as a whole.<br/><br/>This film could have been terrible. But it wasn't. It was really well made, and handles the subject matter sensitively. I am hoping 'World Trade Centre', will be as good but I suspect it will be more of a 'Nic Cage film'. <br/><br/>Anyway thats the end of my rant. I highly recommend you see United 93, its well worth it."

","'United 93' is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most powerful films ever to embrace the cinema screen. Its writer and director, Paul Greengrass, produced a remarkable adaptation of this unforgettable event. The production gave an out of this world insight into this terrifying flight, as well as incorporating the events that unfolded on September 11th.<br/><br/>The most notable moment in the film, personally, was shortly after the flight had commenced. It was announced to the passengers that they were able to see an aerial view of the New York City skyline. Here, the World Trade Centre was the clear focal point. It became truly chilling how all the assailants took one last look at it, knowing its inevitable fate.<br/><br/>The film has numerous elements that will remain in the minds of viewers for days, weeks or even months after viewing it. From the time the terrorists say ""it's time"", to the final farewells of those on board and the horror of people involved, the picture is a gripping masterpiece. A tasteful, emotional and truly heartfelt portrayal of man's will to survive.<br/><br/>This review was written with the greatest respect to all those who lost their lives on this tragic day."

","OK ... so how does a film about an essentially American tragedy play in Britain? I think 'good but not great' is the answer. No-one seemed to come out of the cinema sniffing or crying ... but a few stayed rooted to their seats, immobile, as the credits began to roll.<br/><br/>This is a good film. Its biggest advantage is its fairness ... all participants are shown as human beings, with emotions, relationships, indecision, and so on. It's made in documentary-style, so don't expect any huge close-ups of reconstructed explosions (thankfully). But the personal stories, brief though they are are very moving - especially when you realise there were SO MANY of them.<br/><br/>I went with a friend who was not too familiar with the whole story. I asked him what he thought of the film. He said he had to shut his eyes for much of the second half because it gave him motion sickness.

United 93 has set an incredibly high standard. It has resisted the temptation to please the general populace with a flag waving, 'God Bless America' action thriller. To have done this would have been too obvious and really rather vulgar.<br/><br/>I don't need to recount the story, for obvious reasons. This is a real time account of two crazy hours, which for most people will bring back some vivid memories.

","Paul Greengrass directs this bold and tragic tale of the flight of United 93. Dozens of passengers were taken hostage when four terrorists hijacked their plane. No person will ever really know what had truly taken place on that plane, but Greengrass and his team piece together a story so majestically, you feel as if you were really there.<br/><br/>It is not only the story, but the way it is told that gives the viewer a ""being there"" feeling. This movie was shot in documentary style footage: the camera looks for the speaker, sometimes it lingers on one person while we listen to another, and other such moves. Unlike with the desperate attempts Open Water made at a true story, this technique brings out a real beauty of the brave people on the day of September 11.<br/><br/>The cast is also made up of all ""no-names"". Actors who have gotten a little work here and there, but have never reached the publicity of Charlize Theron or Matt Damon. However, each actors is very good and extremely professional. Their performances blow you away.<br/><br/>When you watch this film, you will be shaken up. In all seriousness of advice, a box of tissues may be in order.

Why did ""news of this pounding"" cause the guy who had been piloting the plane so skillfully to all of a sudden flip completely out and/or totally lose his cool and his control of the plane? 3.

But on the NO side, i think we NEED this film, as a way of answering some questions and also create hope. Not everybody on 9/11 died in vain, some of them died trying. they didn't just sit there and wait to die, they fought back, not for their country, but so they could see their loved ones again, so they can carry on with their lives, so things can be normal again.<br/><br/>the thing that struck me most about this film was the fact that it took a completely neutral stance on what happened.

"Legendary_Badass","8","0","1","3 June 2006"," A history lesson not for the feint of heart
","Director Paul Greengrass utilizes a variety of tactics to bring to life the story of the high jacked airplane. Most of these are visible to the trained eye or audible to the trained ear. United 93 has a goal that revolves around setting up a recreation of the doomed plane and striving for accuracy.<br/><br/>Most of the film takes place within one of two settings: inside United 93 and inside the buildings of air traffic controllers and other government officials. There is no outside world. We don't see panicking people fleeing wreckage. We don't see the news crews gathering a story. What we get is intended to be an inside look at the process of trying to overtake a plane in control of terrorists, and so the fat is cut. We see that officials get news from CNN faster than they can spread the word amongst their own division.<br/><br/>Taking the audience inside the plane and the control rooms, proves to be a chaotic scenario. The camera is constantly jarred. Many times out of focus or out right grainy, images shake across the screen. This runs in contrast to actually being within a real life plane; as the human eye has the capacity to focus and never delivers a grainy image. The constant bobbing of the camera works to break the traditional Hollywood usage of tripods; but again in actuality our heads keep images rather stable.<br/><br/>The pre-September 11th mindset of Americans is summoned up in one seen. Prior to the knowledge of high jackings, an air traffic controller hears something barely audible in the background of a radio message. He then motions for his boss and says, ""I heard something, it's not American something foreign."" So reassuring it is that our air traffic controllers can identify the language of American with such ease. It is with this representative anecdote that Greengrass constructs a film that takes place in a close-minded America.<br/><br/>Dialogue aboard the protagonist plane, prior to the power exchange and inherit struggle, is contrasting. American passengers speak only of what they plan on doing after the flight lands. They have no worries about the present, only those of what a great time each will have at a camping destination. Each American passenger is living in the future and not the present. By contrast the terrorists aboard the plan are strategizing, and looking for the right moment to strike. This interesting construction of scenes aboard the plan lead us to believe that Americans were or still are oblivious to the present and what is taking place around them.<br/><br/>United 93 is a reconstruction of what possibly happened aboard said aircraft, and as such the last ditch effort of the passengers to seize control of their flight is created by the mind of Greengrass. We cannot know simply by archive phone calls alone, how the passengers went about fighting back. What Greengrass gives the audience is a struggle that is based in reality with the laws of physics applicable. There are no flashy moves or tricks, just the wielding of common items and screams of panic. The plane's final spiral into the Earth is viewed from within the plane; taking the audience into an unsettling nosedive similar to the feeling of viewing a roller coaster in first person perspective. This is fitting as the movie as a whole is told from the view of being there, whether that be in the plane, behind an air traffic controller, or in an Air Force base."

While we will never know for certain what the conversations were, nor what the reactions of the people on the plane were, I thought the portrayals were reasonable and realistic.

","When coming into the theater, people sat down to just a regular movie. Throughout the film, we witnessed September 11th as if we actually were there. When the film let out, everyone was solemn and not one was in a hurry to leave, like they usually are.<br/><br/>This is a great film because I have never seen such a reaction out of an audience. Jaws leaves us afraid of the waters and Schindler's List leaves us respectful and mournful for the Jews but United 93 leaves such an impression that the entire way home I sat in silence. This is a landmark film because it not only united the American people that day, but it united the audience, if only for a few short minuets. In my opinion, it was better than Schindler's List."

","Just saw this movie, was very apprehensive, but oddly enough I did not leave the theater crying, rather I felt very angry! This should be required viewing for all Americans!! Especially the high school & college crowd, as it is their generation who will take on the battle (or perhaps chose not to) against these religious extremists who desire to annihilate us. As for those who say it is 'too soon', well, it is almost FIVE years after the fact. Was the Pearl Harbor attack so quickly forgotten? I found the movie to be very well acted, nothing was done for the sake of 'selling tickets'. No political bias, no gratuitous violence, no over-reaching sentimentality in portraying those last phone calls to loved ones. Thankfully the producers did not choose any big name stars, which could have taken focus away from the subject matter. I applaud the decision (much contested) to reveal just how horrible that day was... but it also revealed how proud we can be of fellow Americans who decided to TRY to help themselves & others."

","I just went to see it this evening. I was worried I would be let down by it by expecting too much. The movie wasn't anything like I expected. It gave you a knot in your stomach at certain points and when it was over, the whole theater was quiet and nobody moved for a minute. It was tastefully done and without taking any sides. The hijackers weren't drooling madmen and the passengers weren't extra special heroes who decided to farce a crash of the plane to save others. They were just regular people that wanted to live and knew they had to do something and do it fast. No one really knows what exactly happened, but enough info can be compiled from phone calls, recordings, flight data recordings and other means to come up with a likely scenario of how things played out. 10/10"

","Although the movie brings out many frustrations felt by most Americans after 9/11, it is poorly done. Cinematography is worse than any B movie I've ever seen. I had heard that many people complained about the trailer to this movie, but I fail to see why. It DOES show up the fallacy of disarming airline passengers. If passengers were allowed to defend themselves, even with non-lethal weapons, then terrorists would not be as eager to attack people they know can defend themselves. Also, it points out how much our military has been downsized to the point that is ridiculous in thinking we are capable of defending our nation. Rules of engagement not withstanding, there should be a standing order to engage and repel any hostile act."

"andell","10","0","3","14 May 2006"," A Heartbreaking Recreation of 9/11
","When I went to see United 93, I simply could not get images of movies like ""The Delta Force"" and so on out of my head. In the back of my mind, I was wholly afraid that this film would become a propaganda piece to illicit a neo-conservative surge of American patriotism that would leave a very disturbing after taste in my throat.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, several in the theater were crying. Many found themselves unable to move. I found myself unable to stop shaking at the conclusion of the film. All of the fears I had of the horror and heartbreak being overshadowed by racist depictions of terrorists and their insane causes were crushed under the weight of a film that really and truly does relive 9/11. It is with this understanding that I say this: make sure you are ready to relive it if you choose to see United 93, because the hopelessness and anxiety of that morning really does precipitate quite effectively in this film.<br/><br/>So what is it about? Well, its about 9/11, and while it does chronicle the specific events of United 93 in a hypothetical way (no one can ever know everything that happened that day), it is much more about what happened in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania on that September 11th, 2001.<br/><br/>It all starts with planning by a group of nervous, and predominately young, terrorists. They look just like everyone else, and convince other passengers for the most part that they are traveling alone on the plane. They bide their time and wait until their ""leader"" gives the signal.<br/><br/>Of course, while they are waiting, the horror unfolds largely amongst air traffic controllers who, trying to map out flight patterns and ensure the safety of the domestic air space, begin to notice many planes are no longer responsive, and are doing things that just don't seem to make any sense.<br/><br/>Slowly but surely the course of events begins to play out, and one by one, planes are identified as being either hijacked, or suspected of hijack. Sometimes, not even the air traffic controllers know a plane has been hijacked until after it has already crashed (as in the first plane to hit the World Trade Centre- they believed it was American Airlines flight 11, however at the time that the first plane hit, AA11 also seems to disappear over NYC)- however with time, even NORAD begins to recognize the disturbing pattern and mobilize.<br/><br/>""United 93"" is not Hollywood in any way- in fact, it has a very realistic feel to it. For my part, I felt like it was 9/11 all over again, and I'm at a loss to describe it with anything but the word ""heartbreaking."" The passengers on United 93, at least in this movie, moved more for the preservation of their own lives than anything else- and I can't think of a better tribute to them than to acknowledge that. They knew their lives were not going to be spared; they made their move to first and foremost try and save their lives.<br/><br/>Their bravery is not negated by an honest hypothesis of what happened on that September morning- rather in their determination not to be victims, they saved an Icon of American democracy, and their deed has attained a level of immortality that cannot be denied.<br/><br/>I very strongly recommend this movie, but I must do so with a warning: you invest a lot emotionally in this story, and just make sure you're ready for it!"
"newcreativeenterprises","9","0","5","14 May 2006"," Subtly anti-American?
","I was puzzled why the director chose to frame the depiction of events with an extended sequence of the hijackers in their hotel preparing themselves ritualistically: praying, reading the Koran, shaving body hair, and then continued to focus on them, with extended close-ups, as they boarded the plane, waited for the right moment to seize control. They were also cast as Hollywood-handsome. The effect was to subtly make us see the events through the eyes of the hijackers and to humanize them. No leaving-home sequences for any of the passengers, saying goodbye to family or friends, all material that could have been obtained from research, nothing to humanize the victims as fully as the terrorists. Why?"

","This movie was amazing. You actually feel like you're on the plane. It's sad and has you at the edge of your seat, but it's great because it makes you so aware of everything that happened. Once you leave the theater you are left in awe, with now words to comment on it. What runs through your head is ""Oh my God, Wow!"". This movie should be seen by everyone who is ready to face the harsh realities. It's such a depressing movie that it has you tearing through it. You can actually feel the pain and suffering that these poor people went through. It's not a movie small children should see, it will give them nightmares. Everyone else should go out and see the movie, it's worth it. It's definitely 5 stars."
"Vash2001","9","0","2","10 May 2006"," An honest and powerful film
","I was deeply touched by United 93. I had already read the reviews before I saw the film and that may have diluted the experience just a bit. Still it was an emotional, powerful experience for me. I was crying just as the people were boarding the plane, others going through their routine activities, like just another day. They were so innocent; they did not know that their lives would soon change forever or end.<br/><br/>This film is not just about the passengers aboard United 93. It is also about the air traffic controllers, because they went through the whole thing along with the flights. Imagine sitting there trying to guide the flights to safety and finding out that two of them had just crashed into WTC. The frustration of the red tape was shown very well. The passengers of United 93 came across as heroes at the end.<br/><br/>Nothing was overacted. The power of this movie is in its honesty and understatedness. I read that some of the characters were played by real people that went through that experience. Normally when we go to movies, it is fiction, unless it is a documentary. United 93 is not a documentary. It is a tragic story of a tragic day in our lives- one that changed us forever in a way.<br/><br/>I am surprised that United 93 is not doing as well as I had expected at the box office. Everyone in this country (USA) needs to see this movie, lest we forget what happened on that fateful day.<br/><br/>One last thing- why did I not give it a 10? I thought the end was just a bit less effective. I don't mean that they needed to show the plane crash; we all know how it ended. The movie needed just a little something uplifting at the end, but that is just my opinion. This is a powerful movie, made with sincerity, and it does not manipulate the audience. I loved it."

It showed how much chaos was going on that day, something I think a lot of people forget. It showed a great job of showing the command centers and the aircraft control centers and the chaos going on in there. The only reason I gave it a 9, is that I wasn't sure how accurate it was when it came to the actual terrorist/passenger conflict. How did they know these things happened or did they make them up? In the one scene, the passengers beat the terrorist with a fire extinguisher. Did they know this or was it made up for the movie.. Overall, i though this movie was fantastic."

","Audience silence:<br/><br/>Knowing that this movie was very accurate made me very proud of the passengers and crew.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me was watching the passengers charge up the aisle and overwhelming the terrorists. As the cockpit door was being knocked down, I imagine that the terrorist pilot knew that his plans to attack D.C. was not going to be successful.<br/><br/>I was not sure how I would feel going into the movie but I cheered loudly as the passengers charged the terrorist and hearing one of them have his neck broken by in a headlock by a large American man.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that I was one of a very few people in the theater whom cheered. Most sat there in stunned silence."
"virek213","10","0","2","9 May 2006"," UNITED 93--An Intense But Moving Film
","Like Pearl Harbor, Vietnam, Watergate, and the assassination of John Kennedy, the events of September 11, 2001 are burned into the American soul for all time--the day in which a four-pronged terrorist plot using hijacked commercial aircraft killed at least three thousand people. But one of those hijacked flights did not reach its target because the passengers on board had other ideas. And it is that part of 9/11 that is explored here in UNITED 93.<br/><br/>United Airlines Flight #93 was en route from Newark to San Francisco on that day, when four Al-Qaeda operatives stormed the cockpit, killed the pilots, and took control of the craft, aiming it for a specific target, which may very well have been the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington. What the hijackers hadn't counted upon was that the passengers on board, using both their cell phones and the phones already installed inside the passenger area, were made aware of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As such, at least a dozen of them made a valiant effort to retake control of the craft. And while their efforts were doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, they saved perhaps tens of thousands more in our nation's capitol.<br/><br/>British-born director and writer Paul Greengrass, who directed the 2004 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, is scrupulous in detailing this intense and deeply moving saga. Though of course he can only speculate as to exactly what went on inside United 93 as the nightmare unfolded, by using the very same civilian and military air traffic personnel that were on duty that day and found themselves faced with an apocalyptic reality, he is able to depict in a microcosm what all Americans were going through on 9/11. Greengrass also wisely does not populate UNITED 93 with big-name stars portraying the passengers, the terrorists, or crew, thus largely avoiding charges that he would exploit these events for the almighty box office dollar. And by avoiding the political rhetoric that the tragic day has been used for since, he puts our focus squarely on the ordinary, average people simply fighting for their own lives and maybe thousands more, irrespective of false patriotism or jingoistic flag-waving.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, and understandably, many will complain that it's too soon for a film to be made about that day. But when *WOULD* be the appropriate time to do it? One must remember that films about the 1978 Jonestown cult massacre and the 1976 Entebbe hijacking saga were made either for the small or big screen within under two years of those events; and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN was released twenty months after the Watergate scandal ended with Nixon's resignation. And while there's no way for Greengrass to avoid the violence of the situation he's dealing with in UNITED 93 (hence the 'R' rating) and still be truthful, he is never exploitative in his approach. It is unquestionably an intense and quite painful film, one of the most intense films to have been made in many years, but it is also a deeply moving film about pure human heroism in the midst of a paralyzing nightmare, and it is an honest tribute to those who died on that day in general, and this flight in particular."

These were ordinary Americans who found themselves in the midst of a an event that was a black day for America, and they did what they had to, to stop any further carnage.<br/><br/>Part of of the movie is interspersed with the routine of UAL 93 and the larger events of the other attacks, and the confusion; the latter half is focused solely on the struggle of the passengers,to the end. It's obviously not meant to be a docu-drama about 9-11 as a whole, but puts those other terrible events as a backdrop for the human drama aboard the flight.<br/><br/>After seeing it twice last weekend, I'm still at a loss of word to properly describe the film, except to say that it is a magnificent tribute. Amid the chaos, death, and destruction, there were acts of incredible heroism, and this is a fitting and respectful telling of one of them."

Maybe the filmmaker/studio thought it would be to horrible to make us see what a child had to deal with.

","Superb dramatization of the events of 9/11 as they unfolded, and the events that occurred on United Airlines Flight 93, the flight that crashed in the field of Shanksville, PA. It is filmed with painstaking realism and every moment is captured through a documentary style of film-making. There is not ONE actor that you would notice right off the bat, several of the film's pilots, air traffic and military personnel play themselves. It is as if you are there with them...and are helpless to do something. We see the flight as it happens and what occurred on the ground. It is as real as it gets. It is basically a recreation of those two to three fateful hours on the ground and in the air. You see both World Trade Center towers get hit and feel the intensity and sadness all over again. You feel a personal connection to the victims and it is incredibly emotional to witness the victims saying goodbye to their families. You see the chatter and conflicting information among the military and you are brought in the plane and on the ground. What separates this from a standard movie was that this truly happened and you are brought back to the place you were on September 11th. One scene that will stay with me was when terrorists attacked some of the passengers, a stewardess and a pilot in a brutal and bloody fashion and you feel like you are in there with everyone. While not gratuitous, it was every bit as intense and I almost had to turn away from the screen but I just couldn't. I must warn you, this is a VERY intense film from start to finish and is by far one of the most intense films I have ever seen. You will come away feeling something from this film, and it earns my highest (and rarest) recommendation. This is a powerful, remarkably moving and tasteful tribute to all of the victims of September 11th and not just those who perished on Flight 93. Please, please make the effort and muster the courage to go see this film."

","United 93, a film about one of the four hijacked planes on September 11, 2001 is a terrifyingly realistic look into the morning of that tragic, and yet heroic, day in American history.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, United 93 seems to be happening in real time. With acting that is so genuine that you are absorbed into the horrifying experience that the characters are going through.<br/><br/>Character development is minimal, with no back-story for anyone on the plane. The connection made to the people is found through phone calls they make to their family, friends and loved ones and through the dialogue, which is authentic and captivating.<br/><br/>Acting is superb, with no big names or high profile actors cast in any role. Even some real U.S. Military Air Traffic Controllers were used to play parts essential in understanding the reality of how confusing and hectic it was for everyone to grasp what was actually happening in those few heart wrenching hours.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy and Bloody Sunday) has made a masterpiece of a movie. While sometimes, especially towards the end of the film, camera movements are erratic and the hand-held cameras used inside the plane is almost disorienting, it captures the frantic pace at which everything must have happened on board United 93 during its last minutes of flight.<br/><br/>What this movie truly comes down to, though, is the heroic and unbelievable story of the passengers aboard Flight 93, who did something that was not only incredibly brave but also undoubtedly lifesaving.<br/><br/>The actions taken aboard that plane and the catastrophic events of that day should never be forgotten by the American people.<br/><br/>United 93 is not an exploitation of the events of 9/11, but an account of the happenings of that appalling day and the actions taken by the hero's flying onboard that flight. It is the right time for people to begin to remember and commemorate the hero's of September 11 with films such as this one.<br/><br/>An achievement in every aspect, United 93 is just as gut wrenching as it is saddening and breathtaking.

","I have never felt like this at a movie in my entire life. The emotions I felt while watching this were indescribable. The scenes on the doomed flight were claustrophobic, shaky and made you feel as if you were there. The confusion and action at Norad and The FAA Control center were real. It plays like a documentary. All of the criticism that has befallen the release of this movie are unfounded. It is respectful and powerful. It portrays the people as they were, just regular people forced into an impossible situation banding together as a last resort to save their lives. The direction is flawless. The acting is superior. The cinematography at times is a little nausea inducing, and that coupled with the subject matter makes it really tough to watch at times. Everything I read and everything I knew about this flight could not prepare me for this experience. It could have been anyone on that plane. You, me anyone. When I first heard about this movie I pictured Hollywood bastardizing the subject matter and having the passengers unfurl an American Flag and chant USA USA as the try to take the plane, but none of that sentiment was present. Best Picture 2006 here it is. Paul Greengrass deserves every accolade he has coming."

","This movie was shot in raw true-to-life format. Acting is very realistic full of powerful scenes - but not over dramatized. The actors do a great job, it's more like watching a home video of actual events then a major motion picture. Throughout the second half of the movie you will find yourself holding back tears as well as feelings of great pride and empowerment. The only part of this movie that I really had issue with was the cinematography. The camera constantly jiggles and moves about throughout many parts of the film - war correspondent style. While I understand it's purpose I think film makers have to be very careful with this as it can leave you with strained eyes and even motion sickness inside the theater (as was the case with myself and my viewing companion). For this reason I think it may be best to see United 93 on DVD instead."
"bobbobwhite","8","0","2","8 May 2006"," Interesting , engaging, and well done
","Excellent quasi-documentary of a tragic flight. The airport traffic control center scenes were especially dramatic and authentic-appearing as the boss shown was the real guy in charge that very day, not an actor. He was a natural! And, I especially liked the everyday lead-in scenes to the main story that showed travelers, planes, airports, employees, etc., going about their typical daily business and jobs before any alarms were raised. Really well done story development.<br/><br/>As much of this film's story is necessarily supposition as there were no survivors to tell the real story, surely a lot of it is not exactly as it happened and much was surely added for dramatic effect to make an engrossing movie. All facts cannot be known so a lot of guesswork and deduction was obviously necessary, and we just can't know how much of what was shown in the film really happened and how much was dramatic film-making. The plane flight scenes were scary and effective, with the passengers showing their individual humanity in their many emotions ranging from cool control all the way to abject basket cases. The Arabic hijackers were shown as vicious, cruel and sadistic as hell but this may have been exaggerated for effect as they may have actually been more coolly efficient; we just don't know what really happened. But, what was shown made for an extremely dramatic film even if it may not have been wholly accurate.<br/><br/>The military's part in the film was shown as frantic and unorganized, and pathetic in results, as no one really knew what the hell to do so they ran around in circles. No one higher up seemed to want to make the ""big' decision to attack the hijacked airliner even as it sped toward Washington, D.C.! Finally sending up 2 unarmed jets was a sure sign of hopeless unpreparedness and incompetence from the outfit that is supposed to guard our country. It was really embarrassing and maddening to me to know that at least some of what was shown actually happened. Are we better prepared now? <br/><br/>The only criticism I have of the film-making is that it took at least 5 minutes for the many angry male passengers to storm the cockpit and get to the pilot, having to overcome just two Arabs, one food cart in the way, and one thin cockpit door. The filmmakers surely had to guess about those details, but I thought those determined men could have easily gotten to the pilot in much less time, as 5 minutes is an eternity in a severe crisis situation like that. The stretched-out time line was most likely an example of artistic license done to draw out the intense dramatic tension. Getting there quicker probably wouldn't have made any difference in the outcome anyway but it was the only thing in the film that rang false to me.<br/><br/>The filmmaker did do an overall great job in scaring the wits out of us and portraying the actual terror that had to be in the hearts of those doomed passengers. And, the heroism of those who finally attacked the hijackers should be lauded forever as a sign of true American courage and part of what makes us a great and powerful country."

","(Stunned silence) That's how I left the theater. It had been too long since the attacks for me to remember them very well. I can't say it was nice at all to have a reminder, but it was necessary. 9/11 is a date that should never be forgotten by any American, and this film will help keep that day alive in people's minds. What this film will also do is tell a story that not many people know.<br/><br/>As humans we have a tendency to dwell on the negative. This amazing film contains the tale of one of the greatest examples of heroism that I can think of. The passengers banded together once they knew something was wrong. It wasn't just wasn't passenger that was the hero; it was all of them. They saved what was most likely the capitol from being hit, and thus saved the entire country. The terrorists, no matter how the film portrays them, we're pure, unadulterated evil. It lifts my spirits to know that there are still people left in the world who can recognize it and actually do something about it.<br/><br/>My screening of the film was quite the strange one. There was a family in the theater with two boys, eight-ish and four-ish. Personally, I think those parents were utter morons for taking children that young to see this movie. Granted, it's one not to be missed, but should be seen only by those old enough to handle the events and remember them. The second thing that happened to make me think of what a buffoon the mother was was here question to the kids: ""Well, did you like it?"" This is not a movie to be enjoyed; it is one to be experienced. I did not leave the theater feeling uplifted or overjoyed like I might at a summer popcorn movie. I was numb, but in a good necessary way.<br/><br/>I can't stress it enough: see this movie. You will leave the theater numb and stunned. I believe that a film like this was needed to commemorate the passengers of United 93 and to forever immortalize their sacrifice. What a job the filmmakers did. Paul Greengrass and his crew crafted an experience that I will never forget."

I won't say I enjoyed watching the movie. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I will say I am glad I saw the film and especially on the big screen. No need to buy the popcorn or Pepsi - my stomach was in knots and I couldn't eat. This is not a munch on snacks and watch kind of movie. It is fast paced and you have to pay attention to get all the details. I had a thought driving home after seeing United 93 that I want to be a better person, a better friend and a better American. It is hard to watch but, I'm glad I saw United 93 in the theater."

","This was the only time I can remember leaving a movie being sick at my stomach. I am truly impressed by this film, by the selflessness of the passengers and by the completeness of the story. This is a must see for every free person on the planet. It speaks of taking charge and doing all that can be done. I was most impressed by the simplicity of the scenes. I was shocked that I was still so sensitive. I guess that we should never become calloused to that tragedy. When the movie was over, the theater was silent. We filed out slowly and the only conversation was in whispers. Thank you for making a film that will be a part of my collection."

","I've just finished watching this movie and i have to say it was one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen,, i also love the fact that to go with the conspiracy theories that are about such as ""flight 93"" was shot down by US defences, the movie never actually showed the aircraft crash and fighter pilots were present in the movie to keep an open ending to the film, either that or this was for pure respect and didn't show the aircraft after the crash. all in all brilliant movie respecting all peoples opinions. the only down fall of this movie was the length but that does add to the individuality to the movie and doesn't over dramatise the events of 9/11 and shows the truth."
"JWBly","9","0","3","5 May 2006"," Brilliant documentary
","United 93 is a gripping, dramatic tear-jerker - all the more so because it is completely true. As my movie companion said upon exiting ""There is absolutely nothing Hollywood about it."" I couldn't have said it better myself. This should be a lesson to Michael Moore on how to construct a brilliant documentary. Whereas Moore's works are essentially propaganda films for the wacko left, this movie presents the facts as they happened - with no narration, no extraneous back-story, and no sledgehammer commentary. When watching United 93, the viewer has no idea of the political views of the director (he is a liberal). That is the way it should always be, and never is in Moore's propaganda films. This director's use of the many of the original participants in re-creating the scene of 9-11 makes it all the more real. The use of the hand-held camera adds an air of real-time drama. All in all, this will probably be the penultimate story of what really happened on 9-11. Every American who sees it cannot help but remember where they were on that terrible day. 9-11 is, after all, the Kennedy assassination of our generation."
"flicklover","10","0","5","4 May 2006"," Heartbreaking, but necessary!!!!
","There has been much debate on whether or not there should be films about 9/11 so soon. I believe that it is important to have films that tell the stories about what happened on that day. We all have our memories of that day, we all remember how we felt. This film is a masterpiece, it captures the horror and confusion that was felt on that day without being manipulative or exploitative. The central event of course is the hijacking of United 93, but it isn't a typical made for TV style film in that it doesn't focus on characters. We don't get to know any of the passengers, the film is in the moment. It doesn't make any political statements, it is about the tragic day that will be part of out collective memories, it is right to have films like this. We need to be reminded of our past , no matter how horrible.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","A must see....the events of 9/11/01 changed history in America. I for one sat in my living room and watched in disbelief as the Twin Towers were struck and crumbled. From that day on my life changed. America changed, our FREEDOMS changed.<br/><br/>Having recently seen the movie ""The Hamburg Cell"" I went into the theater with a little history of how the terrorists met and planned the events that took place on 9/11. It opened my eyes to the way they felt about us and it made me understand their ""plan"" as savage as it was.<br/><br/>Having just been to see Ground Zero a week prior, it was extremely emotional for me. I can't imagine the hell those people went through in those buildings or the utter chaos that took place on those hijacked planes.<br/><br/>It was sobering! The lives that were lost senselessly that day counted for something and I feel they should be remembered for a lifetime. United 93 made my heart go out to the victims and the victims families that will have to endure that pain forever.<br/><br/>It was a tribute to pure heroism...and an excellent portrayal of desperation as they had to face their untimely deaths."
"mfsor","10","0","3","3 May 2006"," Really scary
","This film was frightening because it showed how vulnerable we really are. I was nervous before it started and nervous all the way through. The ending was totally objective, showing the vicious killers chanting in Arabic while the innocent victims prayed the Our Father and phoned their loved ones. And that's the difference between us and them. Yes, there was all the mess with the FAA and the military and lack of preparedness, but the true story was with the passengers who showed themselves to be great American heroes who saved our national capital. They knew what had gone on before and they decided to live their last moments according to the great traditions of American identity. That's was was great about the film: it showed that identity objectively. If anyone thinks the Islamic murderers were equal to the American heroes, that person is not a child of the Enlightenment and our American history."

","I just got out of the theater. When it was over, everyone sat for a full minute, completely quiet. My friend, usually a talkative one, simply said, ""See you tomorrow"" and left. This is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. I don't say favorite- that's occupied by the untoppable Lord of the Rings trilogy- but it was truly amazing. It was powerful and riveting and simply stunning. Greengrass did a great job, shaky camera and all. On the shaky camera note, it was a little distracting at first, but once the movie really got going, I didn't notice. As for the politics of the movie, I think it as fair to all sides. It didn't paint the terrorists as these ice-like monsters. They didn't portray the government as buffoons. They didn't imply that the passengers were heroes worthy of Greek mythology. It was real. It felt real. And as to whether or not they were heroes, I believe they are. Does acting for self-preservation take away any heroics? No. Maybe they were thinking of themselves, maybe they were thinking of those at whatever target they were flying for. Their act was brave, honorable, courageous, and it saved possibly thousands of lives. At the least, they tried to save the 40 lives on board, and to me that makes them heroes."
"Saxman440","9","0","2","2 May 2006"," Not a fun time at the theater.
","United 93 is an excellent movie, but those of you looking for a good time might want to pick another. It is an intense drama that never leaves the reality of the true event that inspired it. It turns your stomach and breaks your heart. Each actor portrays his or her character with an honesty rarely scene in films based on true events. This is an honesty that reflects fear, doubt, hope, and confusion. For those of you who want to argue conspiracy or neglect, don't see this film. For those of you looking for an accurate assessment, this may be close. Its unbelievable how this film keeps you in reality. The utter horror of the attacks is depicted in a genuine fashion, all the while you sit among the passengers of United 93 as they remain terrified amongst the chaos that follows the hostile takeover. United 93 is a hard film to sit through. Though in it stands on its own when it comes to production, a lot of the movie's power comes from the reality of the event that inspired it, and an audience's constant reminder of this. United 93 actually went down. Those people did die. Those people did fight back. You leave feeling depressed; you are on the edge of your seat the entire time with a gut wrenching feeling. It is incredibly disturbing. This is not a movie for anyone look for an escape, however if your intentions are to see an intriguing expose about September 11, and the flight that never made its target, well Paul Greengrass has constructed a magnificent piece."

","Just about everyone on earth knows of the events of September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>Flight 93 - Powerful? Yes Topical? Yes Emotional? Very Controvesial? Definitely! As I sat in the theater waiting for the movie to start, I was wondering if I was going to be able to sit through this. The events depicted are still relatively fresh in my memory and the collective memory of the world. I was wondering if the American public, and the world was ready to see such an event unfold. Remember that it was 20 to 30 years after the end of World War II that the first batch of ""graphic"" movies about it (The Longest Day, Battle of the Bulge, Patton, Midway) started appearing on the screen. And it was much longer before the likes of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Band of Brothers really hit home. While the Vietnam War films (Appocalype Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket etc) took less time from the end of the war to hit the screen, the impact of those events for the people who were there was no less powerful.<br/><br/>The film makers have taken very few known facts (no one will ever be 100% certain of what happened on the plane before the crash), aided by real people who were in the Air Traffic Control Centers, the family members of the crash victims and various news reports to make a very powerful, very real version of what MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. Since, as I stated that no one will ever be 100% certain of what EXACTLY happened, this is probably the closest thing that we will ever get to witness.<br/><br/>The screenwriters and director have taken real people, with real emotions and feelings and turned them into real people. The fear and horror on the plane is real and raw, yet not overdone in any manner.<br/><br/>You see that some people in shock, some in anger and some in fear as they do not know exactly what is going on.<br/><br/>They hear (through the use of air to ground telephones) of the other planes hitting the towers.<br/><br/>On ground, you see the disbelief, confusion and shock by the air traffic controllers, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the military liaison officers.<br/><br/>By attempting to overpower the hijackers and land the plane, the passengers of Flight 93 are not trying to be heroes, but are trying to save their own lives.<br/><br/>The questions remains - can a hero someone who tries something and fails? Is trying to save yourself and others heroic or simple human nature? Those are questions that I do not have the answer for. Maybe none of us do..............."
"schuyler_royal","10","0","2","1 May 2006"," A MUST SEE FOR ALL Americans!!!
","WOW! I just saw UNITED 93 about 15 minutes ago and all I can say is that it is an emotional movie. It is extremely well done. From the air traffic controllers to the on-board action, this movie makes you feel like you are up there in the airplane because you are really scared.<br/><br/>It starts out with the different airplane control agency's trying to track the first three flights that slammed into the World Trade Centers and then the Pentagon. It switches back and forth between that and the flight 93 up in the air.<br/><br/>About midway into the movie is when the action starts. For me, it was my first time ever crying because of a movie. From when the terrorists invade the cockpit to when the plane crashes I was balling my eyes out. The saddest parts are the parts where you get to see the people on the plane calling their families and saying goodbye.<br/><br/>You must see this movie to in a way ""pay your respects"" to those who lost their lives. It is very emotional but it is the perfect portrayal of what happened and it gives you a different perspective. If you are a democrat, you will want to see it because it makes the FAA and President Bush look not so good. MUST SEE!!!"

","As a United Flight Attendant in NYC, I am proud of my colleagues who were on United 93. Actress Trish Gates portrayal of Sandra Bradshaw shows her as the true hero she is. The directors sensitivity is amazing and so is this film! The people who are afraid to see this movie show reconsider, it is one of hero's and standing up to fight for our freedoms. The passengers and crew stood up and fought back. The insight to the breakdown in communications of our government boggles the mind. In less then 1 1/2 hours thousands were dead and we were unprepared. Human nature stood tall on United 93 as they were all alone in the skies but they will remain in my heart forever."

","I've never sat thru a film that gripped me from beginning to end. I knew going in that this film was an unflinching documentary style that psychologists stated could cause serious damage to someone not in the best state of mind.<br/><br/>Luckily for me. I was quite happy. The raw emotion displayed via the actors portraying the passengers in jeopardy is stunning. I've read that a lot of their reaction was based on improvisation as in they pictured themselves in that kind of situation. That to me is the very best kind of acting.<br/><br/>The 9/11 footage and the air traffic tower scenes were OK. it wasn't until we look into the hearts of the people on the flight calling home one last time to their loved ones of their fate ahead of them. I choked. My heart started pounding. I looked around the audience everyone was squirming and holding their hand to their face and gasping.<br/><br/>This film was by far the heaviest film I have ever seen. I could almost not keep from bawling my eyes out. It was good to see once. And as excellent as I thought it was I find it hard to recommend. maybe it would be better as a rental, to be viewed on a comfort level you don't get in the theater."

"chrisfriedberg-1","9","0","3","29 April 2006"," America is reintroduced to a day which most have not forgotten...
","In Paul Greengrass's new film ""United 93"", America is reintroduced to a day which most have not forgotten, this day is September eleventh. ""United 93"" is as IMDb describes, ""A real time account of the events on United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot"". While some consider this movies arrival on the market ""premature"", others may find it to be an awakening experience which has the power to motivate and humble all at the same time. In ""United 93"" Greengrass uses subjective camera work to create a first hand account of what events actually transpired on that day; creating a realistic sense of vulnerability. His use of this first person camera work unfolds possible perspectives ranging from the government, to the air control facilities, to the actual people on board the flight United 93. In order to maintain an authenticity, the film's camera shots were jumpy and the movie sometimes even appeared to be documentary like.<br/><br/>Throughout this film viewers are made to look away from the screen; sometimes due to the subject matter, but often times it is the extreme motion of the camera which forces one to glance away. The audience is subjected to nearly two hours of a realistic fluidity that existed between all the relevant parties involved. As the movie progresses and the viewer is brought from office to office with the real time events, one is forced to stop and appreciate how fantastic this disaster is, and how it has affected the lives of every American since then. Greengrass's use of the subjective shot really forces this inclusion of the audience, undeniably creating the feeling that one is on that flight or working a control tower on that day, and is getting a bird's eye view into what really took place. After all, getting the world to see what happened that day seems to be this director's goal. It is apparent that a financial gain may be made, but the film reflects an honest sincerity never the less.<br/><br/>Greengrass's sincerity doesn't stop with the camera-work; it also exists in the script. This isn't a film persuading people to be angry at Muslims because of this select group of people or what they did; their act speaks for it self. This is a film which experiments with emotionality and script by forcing the audience to listen to one of the oldest most emotional forces in time, religion. As the narrative advances, the terrorist are seen with their eyes closed and heard praying simultaneously with the other Americans on board, forcing the audience to become coherent of their plight. While not defending these terrorist, one must acknowledge the dedication which this film exposes on their behalf. As an effect of this dedication, ""United 93"" really explores its roots in extremism and exposes its terror on the world with Hollywood film, sound, and design. After leaving this film, a part of you will feel as if you went down with them."
