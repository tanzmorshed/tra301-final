"ToldYaSo","Null","127","144","20 September 1999"," The antidote to all your troubles, ""1900"" will sweep you away
","It is at a time like this I wish I could expand my vocabulary to better articulate the virtues and qualities of such a fine film. I also find I'm bursting to talk about this film that I regrettably saw alone. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but desperately want to share it with everyone.<br/><br/>
The talented star of ""The Legend of 1900"", Tim Roth, presented this film along with Clarence Williams III. His encouragement to the audience was that if anyone was the sort who liked to pick apart at films and critique their lack of realism, they should just leave now. He touted this wonderful vision from the director of Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore, and likened the film to a ""dream"". He also said that if anyone had seen his own film, ""The War Zone"", that ""1900"" was the antidote for it. I was slated to see ""The War Zone"" the next day, but that was fine by me. I managed by a sheer stroke of luck to get into this Canadian premiere and found it to be absolutely extraordinary and the best film I'd seen so far of the Toronto International Film Festival.<br/><br/>It seems as though mere moments after the initial credits, that the wonderful storytelling and incredible music combined with stunning visuals almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be seeing films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly.<br/><br/>The story is one of an abandoned baby who is found on a ocean liner by one of the ship's crew. He is unofficially adopted and named ""1900"" for the year in which he was born. At a very early age the boy demonstrates an extraordinary gift for piano playing which is only strengthened in his passing years. The boy grows up with no official identity, into a man having never taken a step off of the ship onto dry land in his whole life. The young man, played by Tim Roth is encouraged by his dear friend to leave the boat and pursue a life of fame and fortune as the great pianist he has become. 1900 declines, explaining simply that everything he needs is on the boat.<br/><br/>Well, that should be enough to intrigue you; there's much more of course, but I've no desire to spoil it for anyone. I must encourage everyone to see this film, I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. It's for music lovers, dreamers, romantics and film buffs everywhere and my greatest hope is that it will be seen by many, many people, especially those I know and love. And after seeing the film, and hearing Tim Roth's words echoing in my mind, he was absolutely right. It is like a dream, a wonderful dream that I wished would never end. And for a future prediction, I see this film as a Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination for 1999."

","As its pianist, this film could be bound for success, but the fact is, it remained relatively obscure. I can't understand why did a movie with this deepness and feeling end up in oblivion. Because, if there are some beautiful movies, this is one of them, from the moment that fantastic Ennio Morricone score begins until we witness the tear-jerking finale. An epic story from tip to toe, we journey through the original story of a man who becomes a pianist on board the boat where he was born. And as he grows, so does the fascination by the others in his art and the questions whether he should take that leap overboard and become a ""normal"" person. A brilliant movie, from the man who brought us ""Cinema Paradiso"" and made us all cry, this won't disappoint you, and it's worth by Morricone's score alone. The sequence where the piano floats freely through the dance hall is anthological. A legend of its own."

","On the first day of the twentieth century, an infant is discovered in the coal room aboard a luxury liner. The worker (Bill Nunn) who discovers the child on The Virginian names him 1900 or more accurately Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen-Hundred. Eight years later the boy loses his ""father"" in a ship accident but discovers an amazing ability to play the piano and a legend is born. It is indeed The Legend of 1900, a fable by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) based on a dramatic monologue by Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco. The story is about a musical prodigy who spends his life aboard a ship, sailing back and forth between the U.S. and Europe, entertaining the passengers with his unique talent but never sharing it with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), an American saxophone player whom we meet at the beginning as he tries to pawn his trumpet. On leaving the shop, however, he hears the only recording 1900 ever made, a master that he had broken into pieces but that was later restored. When he finds out that the master came from a ship about to be demolished, he rushes to save 1900 whom he is sure is still aboard. In the process, he tells his story to convince others that 1900 exists. Through flashbacks we learn about 1900 and how he navigated his life from stem to stern. The question throughout the film is whether or not 1900 will abandon the ship and set foot on land? There is a hint that he might do so after he meets a beautiful young woman (Melanie Theirry). She inspires him to compose a beautifully expressive love song while gazing at her through a window, but the only thing that remains is the last copy of the record and an enduring memory.<br/><br/>The Legend of 1900 creates its own world and I confess it is one that I got lost in. This is a lovely film that has a heart. It is sentimental without question but is redeemed by the glorious music by Ennio Morricone, beautiful cinematography by Lajos Koltai, and a terrific jazz piano duel between the adult 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Morton played by Clarence Williams III. 1900's world has clearly defined limits and he is fearful of venturing beyond. Land represents for him a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end. To me, The Legend of 1900 may be a metaphor for people who find a comfortable niche for themselves in life and are afraid to take risks to see what the possibilities are. In many cases, as with 1900, the world will never know the contribution they might have made."

","This a ""sleeper,"" a very good film few people have heard about. The ones who have reviewed it here obviously know about it and you can see by their comments how well-liked it is.....so if you haven't seen it, check it out. In North America, it's called ""The Legend Of 1900.""<br/><br/>The movie is definitely unique, about a man who spends his entire life on board an ocean liner and is a fantastic piano player. The best thing about this film, to me at least, was not the story- which I did enjoy - but the cinematography. Wow, what a great-looking film. Speaking of looks, Melanie Thierry is gorgeous. Too bad she has only a small part in this movie.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Tim Roth play something other than a detestable villain and Clarence Williams was fun as the arrogant ""Jelly Roll Morton,"" who comes aboard ship to challenge Roth to a piano duel, which has to be seen to be believed. Can you say ""outrageous?""<br/><br/>This was filmed by the same man who did the much more well-known Italian film, Cinema Paradiso, and if you appreciate how good-looking that film is, well, this is even better!"

","This movie was given to me as a Christmas gift in 2004. My friends know my love of ships and movies, so they knew this would be something I was surely to like. And did I. I would have been deeply disappointed if I had seen this at the local CinePlex, because there are so many excellent scene's you will want to rewind an ponder over, even shed a tear or two. Its the story of a baby boy ( Tim Roth )who is found aboard an ocean liner( by actor Bill Nunn ), who spends his entire life aboard this ship. Its a movie that is wonderfully acted by all the cast. It moves with ease an always keeps you in a slight fog that lifts at the perfect moment. The piano score's are exquisite !!!I found it haunting and moving at the same time. This movie is 2 hours long, but it will glide by so quickly you will want for more. Without spoiling it, the ending scene is powerful, its..............well......I'll let you be the judge. Enjoy, Marco"
"marque911","10","78","91","30 April 2001"," A simply beautiful film.
","After seeing this movie I went straight to my video store to buy their copy. Unfortunately, they had only the one copy and wouldn't sell it to me. This movie affected me deeply. It tells the story of a musical prodigy who is born, lives his entire life, and dies on board a cruise liner. The scene where the pianist, named 1900, and his friend ""ride"" the grand piano around the ballroom as the ship rolls brought me to tears. There is a palpable joy in this scene : captivated by the music, they care not where the piano takes them. And take them it does, through the glass wall of the ballroom and down a corridor where they are confronted by ship's the Captain. He does not admonish the pair, just accepts the situation. When 1900 is challenged by jazz great Jelly Roll Morton to a piano duel, he meets the challenge and annihilates Morton with a performance that left me shaking. I replayed that scene over and over. As a pianist myself, I was entranced, thrilled and amazed by the playing. When 1900 delivers the coup de grace, I literally cheered! You must see this film. It is a very special experience."
"=G=","8","59","70","9 February 2001"," A wonderfully wistful mixture of melodrama and music.
","""The Legend of 1900"" wistfully tells its creative, capriciously unpredictable, and musical tall tale with excellence in all aspects of film from sets to sound, costume to casting, and script to screenplay. Roth and Vince work well together in this plaintive, simple story which will captivate those who can make the leap of faith required to ""buy in"". A good film for all but critics, ""Legend"" will likely resonate most with those who equate living with musical expression. La vita è musica."
"slugthog","10","77","96","16 April 2001"," This is a film for which the medium was invented.
","""The Legend of 1900"" is not the most attractive title for a film and the Italian original, ""The Legend of the Oceanic Pianist"", is no better.  in retrospect there is no title worthy of this film.  The marquee should read simply ""See This Film, Your Life Will Be Better for It.""<br/><br/>The story, music, cinematography, direction and, I hazard to say, a near perfect performance by Tim Roth combine to make for a compelling film.  The story is told with a poetic lyricism that is immediately captivating and that is more than enhanced by Lajos Koltai's well stated cinematography. Clarance Williams III's controlled overstatement as an unexpectedly nasty Jelly Roll Morton is the perfect contrast to Roth's underplayed and unworldly 1900.<br/><br/>The American release of the film is 125 minutes.  The Italian release was 160 minutes.  What are we missing.  Maybe this shorter cut is better but I cannot forget the devastation that was wrought on ""Once Upon A Time In America"" for its 139 minute US theatrical release.  I certainly would not be not adverse to being subjected to an additional 35 minutes of the film and judging for myself if it was too long.<br/><br/>Aside from its title the films only flaw is the exit song.  After two hours of enthralling instrumentals the vocal on the exit song undercuts rather than underscores a masterful filmic experience.<br/><br/>...rmk"

","What an excellent movie! I usually am partial to stupid comedies like Zoolander and other ""non-greats"" like like Daredevil and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but even I loved this movie! It's a must-see for everyone.<br/><br/>My sister wanted to me watch this with her because she had to for a school assignment, and since I know a lot about things she doesn't (i.e., cinematography, costumes, makeup, etc.) she wanted to know my opinion. And, although those other subtle effects were excellent, I couldn't help but notice that this movie, too, was one of the best.

","Not a classic, but whoa, some of that piano playing just sweeps you right off your feet. Tim Roth is good as the handsome pianist Nineteenhundred and so is all the the rest of the cast. This cast also includes Clarence Williams III, presumably the grandson of Clarence Williams (the man who wrote the song ""Basin Street Blues"" one hell of a classic), as Jelly Roll Morton. This leads me on to one of the most impressive parts of the film where Nineteenhundred and Morton have a match to see who is the best pianist. There is some piano playing in this scene which will leave pianists with there mouths hanging open. Probably the best thing about this film is it's music. There are many rousing themes played throughout the film, especially the love theme played while Nineteenhundred kisses a girl he has fallen in love with, a simple yet very effective theme. Another thing that makes this film very good is the fantastic camera-shots, especially one of Nineteenhundred as he stands halfway across the plank which leads him from the boat to New York, undecided whether or not he should leave the boat and head for world-wide celebrity on land, or stay on the boat and remain unknown to anyone but the passengers. I have got to get myself the soundtrack to this film and you have got to see it somehow. Enjoy!"

","""I'll never watch another movie again!"" cried my sweet-hearted wife as she wept uncontrollably as the final scene ended. Touched, I wept with her, but made no such vow. She may not keep the vow either, but I can see why she said what she did. This was my second viewing, her first. This time, though, I was deeply touched by everything in the film. 12 years ago, when I first saw it, it was fun, interesting, and for me a real salvation for an actor--Tim Roth--who normally plays the bad guy. Today I can easily say that of the thousands of films I have seen, this one out-ranks all of them--definitely is #1 in my book. I honestly can think of no other great film that is as good. Mary Poppins comes to mind, but still doesn't make the grade like this one. Oh, and we love, love, love Jazz. There's Ragtime here, and Dixieland, and Roaring 20s Jazz, and other Jazz styles--and even quite a bit of Classical. Roger Waters even steps in for one of his classic solos written for this film--and I'm a big Pink Floyd fan because of, you guessed it, their Jazz influence. I've gushed enough, I guess, but see this one, then get a copy for yourself, and watch it once a year--to remind yourself that the inner world, the inner kingdom, is far and away better than anything that world out there has to offer. Anything."

","If you love films (trust me, you would not have waded through some 200 reviews to get to this one, if you did not) then chances are you have a weak spot for almost-perfect, self-contained, little gems like this that not only leave you with an experience you will never forget but do so without benefit of precedent or facsimile; that is, they don't mimic anything that came before. Even more astounding is that Roth made his bones playing bad guys (which he does superbly) but in this rare film you get to see another side of him, and, who knew, he is at his core an actor's actor, he can play anything, it just happens he found a niche playing heavies. The scene where Roth's character goes one to one with Williams, whose character is Jelly Roll Morton, is one of the best strips of celluloid ever and if you have the ability to stop and replay, don't be surprised if you watch it (and listen to it) more than once. Bravo."
"Spleen","8","39","58","4 November 2001"," This is a film I wish everyone would see -
","<ul><li>the more people see it, the more people there are to help me work out what to make of it.  It's hard not to like, and the central conceit, the fantasy story of someone whose entire life is spent crossing and re-crossing the Atlantic, is just delicious - yet there's always something that prevents it from working as it should.  There's too much narration.  Narration aside, there are too many words.  Just before 1900 and the narrator part ways the former explains himself, to some degree, in a longish speech.  The speech was necessary: we needed to hear his reasons from his own lips.  But once it had been given the scene should have ended.  Instead the two characters keep adding postscripts as they walk away from one another - and they're standard, maudlin things which are at odds with what 1900 had been saying a moment ago.  Again and again, there are words where there shouldn't be.</li></ul><br/><br/>But then, it may be that the title character was given too FEW words - at least at first.  Because it's so long before we first hear 1900 express his thoughts verbally (and because in the absence of other information about his character we are unwilling to pass judgment on him until he does) it takes too long for us to warm to him.  In fact we never warm to him as much as we should.<br/><br/>And yet there are scenes - the piano duel, the girl in the rain - that are just fantastic, that make me reluctant to criticise anything at all.  Any film containing moments like those can afford to lose its way at times.<br/><br/>P.S.  Of course, a film about a pianist born on the first day of the Twentieth Century ought to be called ""The Legend of 1901"", which if you asks me sounds better anyway."
"larrydunsmore","10","10","14","7 July 2006"," The BEST piano film ever...
","Well, at the risk of sounding condescending, I am an English jazz pianist who for the past 30 years have worked primarily on cruise ships - some very much like the Virginian. I first saw this movie on cabin TV and it quite literally blew me away, not so much for the whimsical will o' the wisp subject which in itself was haunting and quite beguiling, but for the very reason that I realised to my shock that I had become 1900 in so many ways... least of all that I, like so many other musicians quite simply never got off the ship - anywhere! As for 1900's piano playing - it is incredibly difficult for a non-playing actor to 'mime' to an intricate piece, for example when bass registers are playing, the actor's hands are playing on the top registers! Awful and check out the Tyrone Power Eddie Duchin Story to see how it's not done! Tim Roth had me convinced, even though I knew he wasn't playing... the illusion was perfect. The duel was, despite the predicted outcome... exciting and superbly understated. Fast doesn't mean great but in this case it was. Wihtout doubt one of my favourite films of all time as it is with many of my colleagues in the cruise industry. Whimsical, enchanting, beguiling, poignant and it touches many emotions I hadn't realised I had. I would give it 100 out of 10."
"ghica","8","7","9","16 July 2002"," A more general observation
","It is quite inexplicable to me why many North-American critics and viewers have a visceral negative reaction to sentimental Italian movies. By Italian I don't mean necessarily the language but a certain easily identifiable directorial style. So this category contains movies such as _Il Postino_, _Cinema Paradiso_, _Malena_, but also English language films such as _Stealing Beauty_ and _The Legend of 1900_.<br/><br/>What they all have in common, besides beautiful cinematography, is that they try, quietly and modestly but nevertheless ambitiously, to investigate some aspects of the very essence of the human soul. The emotion used by many such movies, especially the ones directed by Tornatore, is nostalgia: by understanding the pain of irrecoverable loss we are supposed to understand what we truly needed. These movies express perfectly HL Mencken's definition of the artist as ""one who observes the eternal tragedy of man with full sympathy and understanding, and yet with a touch of god-like remoteness.""<br/><br/>However, for reasons I fail to understand, the unavoidable sentimentality of these movies bothers many critics and casual viewers to no end. It's true that sentimental art exposes itself the most to irony and cynicism, but it is nevertheless disappointing to see many critics taking advantage of its vulnerability and indulging in hitting hard and hitting low against such movies. No wonder that art in general, not only movies, is nowadays almost devoid of sentimentality. Artists choose to clad themselves in critic-proof armors of irony and sophistication. Honesty has long become a dangerous no-win proposition.<br/><br/>So I say 'Bravo!' to Tornatore for having the courage to give us some bullshit-free insight into ourselves by showing us what moves us and why. I also say 'Boo!' to the critics who don't get it, and who mistake their expectations and biases for some kind of objective artistic standard."

He tells that he bought a piano from a scrapped ship and found the pieces of the record inside the piano. Max tells that on January, 1st 1900, the stoker Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn) of the Steamship ""Virginian"" finds a baby boy over the piano of the first class in a cradle carved T.D. Lemon and he decides to keep the child. He gives the name of Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred and raises the child in the boiler room of the passenger ship. Years later, an accident kills Danny Boodmann and the boy leaves the boiler room for the first time and discovers that he is a natural born pianist. When Max is hired to play trumpet in the ship, he becomes a close friend of 1900 (Tim Roth) and witness his life, including the duel with the arrogant ""man who had invented the jazz"" Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) and when he falls in love for a girl (Mélanie Thierry) and almost leaves the vessel in New York. When Max left the ship on August, 21st 1933, he lost contact with 1900. Now he decides to go to the junkyard and find his missing friend. In the end, a good story worths more than an old trumpet.<br/><br/>""La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" is a sensitive, poetic and tragic fantasy about music, missing love and friendship, with magnificent direction of Giuseppe Tornatore; top-notch performances of Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince; and haunting music score of Ennio Morricone. The cinematography, costume design and art direction are wonderful and the dialogs are intense and delightful. This film was released in Brazil on VHS in the 90's by Warner, but deserved at least a DVD.

","Imagine, if you will, a world.  A world where movies have thought provoking premises, eye-popping cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, and absolutely beautiful music.  Now, take all these positives and combine them with contrived dialogue, blind editing, cliches, and a plot that meanders on a journey to nowhere.  This is the world of The Legend of 1900.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of feel good movies, Disney has made more than one feature film that has ""pulled at my heart-strings,"" yet I found it almost impossible to care about this movie.  Character development never took place, in fact, I'm not sure acting ever took place.  The movie was filled with unrealistic, ""magic"" moments that might have made more sense in a children's fantasy movie.  But this can hardly be considered a children's movie considering the number of times the f-word is used and the feature is too painfully grounded in reality to be considered fantasy.<br/><br/>To call the dialogue tin-eared is almost a compliment and though the director is Italian it's not as if he would be unable to hire someone who did have a clue.<br/><br/>Speaking of directing, why direct a movie that should be an intimate character study with such an epic style?  The grandeur of the camera angles/movement is impressive until you finally realize that it's there to entertain you through part of the flat plot.<br/><br/>As plots go, we never really accomplish anything.  By the end of the movie, I almost felt that I knew less about 1900 than I did at the beginning. And Vince's character, eyes darting about to the point of distraction, gives a horrible performance with a whimp of a character.  Other than serving as 1900's lap-dog and trite narrator he serves no practical purpose whatsoever.<br/><br/>The thing that bothers me most, though, is the number of people singing this movie's praises.  Endless reviews calling it ""magic"" and ""unforgettable."" It gives me cause to step back and re-examine my long-held views that people aren't generally idiots.<br/><br/>I don't mean to destroy this movie, I simply find myself disappointed.  I had hoped for so much more.  I would love to see this movie redone by a director who knows English and with a script that follows the same plot without the painfull specifics that drive this feature into the dirt. This movie gets a 3/10.  1 for cinematography, 1 for music, and 1 for a concept that had enough potential to make me pick up this movie on a whim."

He hugged friends goodbye and waved and went down. But his pace became slower and slower, and finally stopped. As he described at the end of the movie:<br/><br/>""Nineteen Hundred: All that city. You just couldn't see the end to it. The end? Please? You please just show me where it ends? It was all very fine on that gangway. And I was grand too, in my overcoat. I cut quite a figure. And I was getting off. Guaranteed. There was no problem. It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max. It was what I didn't see. You understand that? What I didn't see. In all that sprawling city there was everything except an end. There was no end. What I did not see was where the whole thing came to an end. The end of the world... Take a piano. The keys begin, the keys end. You know there are eighty-eight of them, nobody can tell you any different. They are not infinite. You are infinite. And on these keys the music that you can make is infinite. I like that. That I can live by. You get me up on that gangway and you're rolling out in front of me a keyboard of millions of keys, millions and billions of keys that never end, and that's the truth, Max. That they never end. That keyboard is infinite. And if that keyboard is infinite, then on that keyboard there is no music you can play. You're sitting on the wrong bench. That's God's piano. Christ! Did, did you see the streets? Just the streets?There were thousands of them! And how do you do it down there? How do you choose just one? One woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at, one way to die... All that world is weighing down on me, you don't even know where it comes to an end, and aren't you ever just scared of breaking apart at the thought of it? The enormity of living it? I was born on this ship, and the world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time. And there were wishes here, but never more than fit between prow and stern. You played out your happiness, but on a piano that was not infinite. I learned to live that way. Land? Land is a ship too big for me. It's a woman too beautiful; it's a voyage too long, a perfume too strong. It's a music I don't know how to make. I could never get off this ship. At best, I can step off my life. After all, I don't exist for anyone. You're an exception, Max, you're the only one who knows I'm here. You're a minority, and you better get used to it. Forgive me, my friend, but I'm not getting off.""<br/><br/>He didn't get off. That's what he said and he did. As I mentioned above, he died with the ship, in the explosion. I believe at this point of the movie, no body can hold their tears back.<br/><br/>By the way, this movie is Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, who is also the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso and Malèna. Some people say the legend of 1900 is the director's compromise to Hollywood-style-commercial movie. Well, I know nothing about this kind... It's a excellent movie. Much I could say."
"TxMike","Null","6","9","13 October 2002"," Wonderful and thought-provoking fable of a man whose life was spent aboard a ship.
","""The Legend of 1900"" is unique in many ways, the first being that it is an Italian film with English-speaking characters. Tim Roth who has been cast as a villian most of his career does a remarkable job as the adult '1900', the simple man, a gifted piano player, who had a his own particular take on life. The story begins as a ship worker is crawling around the ballroom floor, looking for valuables lost by the wealthy guests, but instead finds a baby. It is the New Year 1900, thus the baby's name. He is raised in the bowels of the ship until at about age 8 or 10 he is noticed playing the piano. He eventually becomes the ship's piano player, and his reputation spreads until Jelly Roll Morton takes a voyage and challenges '1900.'  In the end, he lit his cigarette on the hot piano strings!<br/><br/>some SPOILERS - The film actually starts in more modern times as the trumpet player friend of 1900's is selling his horn and telling the 'Legend of 1900' after the shopkeeper shows him a patched-together record of the piano composition that was lost years earlier, parts hidden in the piano. He tells the story in a series of flashbacks, and at the end finds out the old ship has been stripped of all valuables and is to be sunk the next day by dynamite. But he just knows '1900' must still be aboard the ship, because he knew he never could leave. So he borrows the record and a player and goes to every different part of the dilapidated ship, playing the song, hoping to lure out '1900'. Earlier in the film '1900' said, ""My music will never go anywhere without me"" and that is why the master disk never left the ship until the piano, with the broken recods hidden in it, ended up in the shop also.<br/><br/>more SPOILERS - '1900' almost left the ship once, he was going to visit NYC and a pretty girl he met, was half-way down the gangplank, suitcase in hand, well-wishers waving goodby, he paused a long time, threw his hat into the water, and went back on the ship. Only years later, as he and his friend spoke in the bowels of the old ship did he explain, ""I looked at the city and could not see an 'end.' A piano has 88 keys, you know where it starts and where it ends. But the city alone has hundreds of miles of streets, how do you know which one to take, which girl to love, which house to buy? I could not see an 'end' so I had to stay on the ship."" And he did, he had become so accustomed to the small, contained world of the ship that he could not cope with the greater world. Even though it is a movie, one second we are seeing '1900' with a smile, musing about heaven, and the next moment a horrific blast. It is hard to not get jolted by the image.<br/><br/>At 120 minutes this film requires some patience, and the desire to see good character studies over non-stop action. It is impossible to describe in words how good Tim Roth is in this role. We always knew he could play the bad guy, this film crystallizes his overall talent as one of the best in the business. A remarkable story, a legend, with a remarkable character. A superb film."
"cincyguy90","9","7","11","23 January 2009"," Beautiful tragic film
","I agree with most reviewers: This is a beautiful, poetic film, with an enthralling story, beautiful cinematography, and lovely score. Butin the end I found 1900 to be a tragic, flawed character. There was nothing noble in his self-imposed constraint of never setting foot off ship. He came close to leaving the ship but doesn't do so because he was traumatized by the uncertainty of life. His assessment of life was correct: boundaries in life are ill-defined; a person has latitude in how he or she chooses to live their life. A great person is someone who expands their horizons throughout life, who continually seeks more and is willing to take a chance even at risk of failure. 1900, on the other hand, elects to live in a cocoon and prefers to die in his late 40's rather than venture forth. His fear of the unknown resulted in a marginal existence. Except for his ""father,"" he never had any close relationships  1900 is detached even from Max. He refused to allow a recording of his music to be released because that would involve the unfamiliar ""outside"" world. He wasn't a sympathetic character for me. The poignancy in this film is that 1900 was someone who could have had a much more meaningful life. I saw the film as a tragedy. Viewed as such, I liked it but it sure was sad to watch."

","Cutesy and pointless, there's little to recommend about this ponderous film besides the Ennio Morricone score and Clarence Williams III's performance as Jelly Roll Morton (expect that he's trapped in a dueling-pianos sequence that just seems to go on forever).<br/><br/>Tim Roth tries valiantly, but his performance is hampered by the fact that he has no character to play; his ""1900"" is more a labored metaphor than a human being, and there's little this talented actor can do with the weak script (which occasionally has painful bouts of English-as-a-second-language-itis.<br/><br/>But hey, I didn't like ""Cinema Paradiso"" either, so what do I know..."
"tonstant viewer","2","19","43","19 April 2002"," Lovely to Look At, but that's about it.
","First of all, it was nice to see the ship exterior and promenade deck from Fellini's ""And the Ship Sails On"" once more. Every studio should have its own ship, and the one at Cinecitta is lovely. The overall production design and cinematography of this film are a constant delight.<br/><br/>That being said, this ship gets lost in fog around halfway through, and never finds its way again. As with so many Italian films, this movie is about the grand gesture, but all too often here the gesture is clumsy, badly written or staged, or totally inexplicable. The ballroom piano recital in the rolling storm is a memorable gesture, the playoff with Jelly Roll Morton is phonus bolognus, the closing self-explanation of the main character's life and his vision of heaven is unbearable. <br/><br/>You know something's wrong when, in the opening sequence, a ship filled with immigrants enters New York harbor from the wrong direction, with the Statue of Liberty and the island of Manhattan sliding by in reverse. Did they come in from Albany? Unimportant in itself, this howler shows an autointoxicated disregard for truth in the pursuit of gripping but often unmotivated emotion. This self-indulgence kills the whole film. We are told that Truth is Beauty and Beauty is Truth, but in this movie, one of them is a liar."
"revgarham","1","22","60","24 February 2002"," What movie did these people see?
","I can't believe the comments I've read regarding this film (""beautiful"", ""great"", ""masterpiece"" etc.). This is one of the most cliched, moronic pieces of junk I have ever seen. My wife and I rented it on DVD and we were groaning and laughing throughout the entire movie. One particularly laughable seen is where Tim Roth's character lights a cigarette off of the ""hot"" piano strings after his jazz duel with Jelly Roll Morton. I think Jelly Roll is probably rolling in his grave over that scene. I will grant that it is a nicely photographed film, but that's all I'll give it. Terrible script, terrible acting, forgettable music and heavy-handed direction. What was Tim Roth thinking of when he decided to star in this turkey? I now have a new rule when it comes to seeing movies. Never watch anything with ""Legend of"" in the title (e.g. Legend of Bagger Vance, Legends of the Fall, Legend of 1900)."
"jotix100","5","6","12","30 June 2012"," The young man and the sea
","Giuseppe Tornatore's work will always be compared with his excellent ""Cinema Paradiso"", a beloved film of audiences all over the world. He is a talented filmmaker who has worked extensively in the Italian cinema with success. ""The Legend of 1900"" shot in English presents a challenge for the talented director in that it is basically a film with an European sensitivity that does not work too well with a wide distribution. It is based on a monologue by Alessandro Baricco, the author of ""Silk"".<br/><br/>Mr. Tornatore's stories are basically a look to the past as ""Malena"", ""The Star Maker"", ""Baaria"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"" prove. The director's love for his native land translates well as the setting for his films. Working in his native Sicily makes his films to immensely well felt, something that seems to be lacking in this venture. In this ambitious epic, the director adapted the material for a larger than life portrait of a man whose love for the sea proves to be his own doom. This ambitious canvas does not have the same feeling as his more intimate depictions of a society he knows well.<br/><br/>In the written page, the text has an intimate feeling. In the finished product, the film did not translate as well. Part of the problem is the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Virginian, the home of '1900', a man that was born in the big ship. An auto didactic man, he finds a passion in playing the piano as the jazz era begins to make inroads in the life of America and the world. His talent is recognized, but his fear of living outside the only world he knew, prevented his becoming the sensation he should have been by not leaving the Virginian. Not even when he found love for the angelic immigrant he meets would make him abandon the only home he ever had.<br/><br/>Tim Roth does a nice job of the pianist. Taylor Pruitt Vince is Max, 1900's best friend. Clarence Williams III makes an impressive Jelly Roll Morton. Peter Vaughn and Melanie Thierry are also featured. Ennio Morricone's music is a bit disappointing. He has done much better in his long career as a composer of musical scores. Lajos Koltai's cinematography is about the best thing in the film. His take on the luxury liner is impressive."
"SnoopyStyle","5","4","7","12 August 2015"," a character without a compelling story
","Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is pawning off his trumpet and recounts his life on an ocean liner with the legendary 1900. At the turn of the century, a baby is found by the crew of SS Virginian. There are no parents to be found and the crew raises him with the name 1900 (Tim Roth). He never sets foot on land and starts playing the piano. The ship brings immigrants and transports the wealthy. In wartime, it is turned into a hospital ship. It is now being demolished and Max pleads to have the work stopped until they find 1900.<br/><br/>It wants to be a personal epic. However like 1900 himself, it feels like the movie is traveling a lot without getting anywhere. There is little drama and no tension whatsoever. It's an idea for a character but it lacks a compelling story. The sets are beautifully made and the movie looks good. This is a man in the background of great history but his story has no drive."

","This is a movie that will have you thinking about it for a long time after it's finished. It's a unique story, very well written. The cinematography is wonderful. But the soundtrack is enchanting, it takes you somewhere beautiful. There's something romantic about ocean liners of the day & this film captures this wonderfully. Tim Roth is so right for this part, he captures the innocence of someone who has never stepped foot on land, but has a keen sense of people's personalities. The rest of the cast was carefully picked. The Piano duel between 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Martin (Clarence Williams III) is one of the big highlights of the film. The scene that has him recording a song on board the ship while he watches the beautiful Melanie Thierry is poignant. It's right up there with Amadeus. You must buy this film & the soundtrack"

One of Morricone's best. <br/><br/>Full of magical situations made for cinema and cinema only. At times the music takes over the visuals, as to the very powerful minimalism of a face of a woman backed by exquisite and subtle piano piece, to the other extreme, of compelling and dynamic visuals which move with the music, as when the whole ship rocks in the middle of a storm, while the pianist frenetically plays a full sized tail piano rolling across the ballroom, talk about rock and roll!!!

He meets another artist, a trumpeter who gets hired aboard the same ship. They become colleagues in the ship's orchestra that entertains the voyagers. A friendship that goes through years, while the piano player, who is not recorded in any official paper, never goes off the ship. A story about authentic male friendship."
"johno-21","6","5","10","28 February 2006"," They should scraped the barnacles off instead of cutting 37 minutes
","I saw this in the theater in 2001 but for it's US theatrical distribution this film was cut from it's original 160 minute run time to 123 minutes. I see here that a lot of people enjoyed this film which I found to be good but not excellent as many viewed it to be. With a film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore of Cinema Paradiso fame and music from the great Ennio Morricone and the interesting storyline I felt this would be a good film to see but I ended up a little disappointed with the film. We never really learn how with no tutelage Novecento becomes the legendary pianist of the ocean. Presumably as some savant skill he was gifted with that listening to pianists play in the ship's ballroom as he grew up he picked it up without training or the ability to read music. The character is pretty dull despite growing up among hardened seafaring men of the boiler room and below deck and being exposed to high society above deck but I suppose one would possibly be kind of one dimensional if they lived on a single ship their entire lives never setting foot on land. Tim Roth is Novecento. Roth looks stiff in the title role. Despite being in a few hit movies like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Rosencrantz and Guilderstern Are Dead and Vincent and Theo earlier in his many films career he seems to have appeared in far more less memorable films including this one. Pruit Taylor Vince has the same career problem. Despite being in JFK, Mississippi Burning, Barfly and Natural Born Killers earlier in his career he also seems to get cast more forgettable ones than memorable ones. both Roth and Vince turn in stiff acting performances here. Clarence Williams III, best known as Linc from the old TV show Mod Squad plays Jelly Roll Morton. Morton was Creole from Louisiana who had mixed race blood but he didn't look black and looked more French so from a historical perspective as this film weaves an actual historical figure into it's fable, Williams is miscast. Williams by the way is pretty stiff himself in this film. The romantic angle in the film never really catches fire and the film has very little drama. This film looks good, has a mildly interesting story and a great soundtrack but despite it 40 years of trans Atlantic crossings it never really goes anywhere. I would give this a 6.0 of a possible 10 but wouldn't see it again."

A baby is 'somehow' left on a cruise-ship, the boy grows up and 'somehow' turns out to be a natural for the piano, 'somehow' rises to tremendous fame and in the end is not prepared to go out into the endless, asphyxiating world. He goes down with the ship, without having done anyting really worthwile. Neither intruiging depth nor amusing shallowness, no heart-stirring romance or nail-biting supsense: just a pretty long period of time containing not very much.

"bodnotbod","2","10","26","22 April 2005"," Tedious Ivory Tinkling
","Looking past all the things I dislike about this film I find there's an original plot, and one I could take to at that.<br/><br/>However, the film is filled with a number of musical performances that hit all the wrong notes with me. Unless you are heavily into piano music, particularly early jazz, you may find the set musical pieces as tiresome as I did, to the extent that it spoils the entire film for you.<br/><br/>A further problem of the music is that throughout you are to view the central character as some kind of uber-genius of the ivories. If you fail to enjoy the music to the extent that you nod and go ""yes, he is a piano God"" then much of the fuss and story surrounding him falls apart.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure about Tim Roth. For some reason I like him a great deal in Reservoir Dogs even though a part of me feels his performance is flawed. In this his performance seems pretty woeful. He has a tick where he squeals a bit as he speaks when he's in a bit of emotional turmoil and I find that puts me off him. In this film he is also expected to do a bit of genius-fuelled wistfulness, but - I'm afraid - when he does this, I just find he looks a bit of a fool.<br/><br/>It's got a nice feel of the period, but every time I tried to relax into the film and enjoy it, there was always something irking me."

It's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. There's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he's completely self indulgent. I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i'm watching the wrong film.

"FlickJunkie-2","9","3","6","9 August 2002"," Richly rewarding character study
","Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).  <br/><br/>The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him `1900'.  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.<br/><br/>The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room. All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.<br/><br/>Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.<br/><br/>Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz. Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.<br/><br/>The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years.  He has scored over 400 films including ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Disclosure"", and ""Twister"".  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.<br/><br/>
For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience."

","I finally got a DVD of this film, which never played in theatres here.  I was so stunned by its rich characters, atmosphere, emotion and subject, I watched it twice in one night.  This film is so intensely beautiful, it hurts.  It reminds me in some ways of ""The Red Violin,"" following a piano and pianist through the years.  Tim Roth's 1900 has a liquid face that tells us so much before he actually gets to verbalize his feelings about his life. The relationship between 1900 and Max is rich and satisfying.  The music is sublime.  Others have said there is too much dialogue, but I disagree.  The narration is economical and we wait so long for words from 1900, that when they come, you're grateful for every one. <br/><br/>But mostly, the joy for the viewer is exploring the mind of 1900, a man of great depth, a skewed vision of the world and someone unlike anyone most of us ever know.  That's why I go to films--to meet unique characters who subtly alter the way we see the world.  Roth's performance is outstanding, as are those of every other actor in this film.  It's tragic that the film is marred by a really tacky model of the Virginian at sea and a deck set with items never found on the deck of any ship.  The interiors, however, are beautiful and the piano, costumes, extra casting and dock areas are all first rate."
"raymond-15","7","3","6","8 October 2001"," They say that you can always get by if you have a good story to tell. Try this one.
","An outstanding feature of this film is the atmosphere developed in all the crowd scenes.  The early morning arrival of the SS Virginian filled to the brim with well-heeled passengers and excited emigrants shouting ""America!"" is a most moving spectacle. Another crowd scene is deep down in the belly of the ship where stokers grimy and sweaty are shovelling coal into the open mouths of the fiery boilers.  The whole scene is grim and threatening with steel platforms and steel steps, heavy chains and pulleys, men shouting above the noisy activity. Then again many decks above bring us to the crowded dance floor aglow with the rich and famous out for a good time with wine,women and song. Diector Giuseppe Tornatore handles all these scenes superbly and with true feeling. In all this shipboard activity is a lonely man called 1900. Of unknown parentage he was given that name by stokers down below after being found in a box on the grand piano in 1900. He was born at sea, lived his whole life at sea and could never bring himself to leave the ship. He died at sea. The character 1900 is played by three people - a baby (adorable), a young boy (charming) and a grown man (Tim Roth).  Most people will remember this film for the exciting piano playing competition.  I have never seen such nimble fingers as they rattle over the keys and hammer the piano wires into a fiery temperature.  The photography at this point with its multiple overlapping images of hands and piano keys helps to build the excitement. It's pretty serious business because bets are laid on the outcome of the competition. 1900 has one true friend, a trumpet player.  I like the scene where the two men seated at the piano (with the brakes off) race at a terrifying speed around the ballroom as the ship lurches to and fro in the heavy seas. I have a couple of queries though.  I may have missed something in the film but I cannot recall how 1900 learnt to play so well and who taught him.  But it makes a great scene and the music is exciting and enjoyable.   And that girl....peering in through the porthole as young 1900 woos her with his gentle notes.  What a gorgeous angelic creature who touches the heart of 1900 for a fleeting moment!  Such a small role and yet the glow of her face remains long after the credits fade."

Though this physically limited, the thoughts of the man reach every part of the world and add lots of phantasy to his music.<br/><br/>The film is a romance, a drama and phycologic insight all at a time. The legend is carefully embedded in the frame story of one of the main actors - and there is no boring moment from the beginning till the very end.<br/><br/>This film is NOT recommendable for people that prefer the style of ""sex, crime and happy-end"". There is none of this."
"gradnick","1","9","30","30 July 2004"," A metaphor for the movies?
","It's possible that 'cinema' (or ""the movies"") could be one of Tornatore's thematic preoccupations. Given that the director of CINEMA PARADISO made THE LEGEND OF 1900 at the time when cinema was celebrating its first 100 years, it is possible to read the film as a reflection on the state of cinema as it enters its second centenary.<br/><br/>One can't say for certain. For the most part the film concentrates on telling its story. However, the scent of metaphor hangs in the air. Just below the surface lies a resigned nostalgia hinting that the ""greatness"" of cinema may be a thing of the past. Like a big old rusting passenger ship consumed by an indifferent ocean, the brilliance and splendour of cinema has sunk to the bottom of a sea of mediocrity. THE LEGEND OF 1900 suggests that cinema has been reduced to churning out repetitious and facile dead-in-the-water crowd-pleasers, one lumbering TITANIC after another, and it does so by being exactly that.<br/><br/>There is a pivotal scene near the end of the film where Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) talks to the character known as '1900' (Tim Roth) within the rusted bowels of the abandoned ship (the worn-out wreckage of cinema). 1900 has never been on dry land. The ship is the only reality he has ever known, and he refuses to leave. As it creaks and groans beneath them, Max tries to convince him by describing the world beyond the vessel as a place of infinite choice, but he knows that 1900 will never accept the mediocrity of dry land (modern-day commercial movies). There is no place in such a world for the true artist. 1900 will go down with the ship (the discarded notion of cinematic art) rather than compromise his true nature. <br/><br/>So, did Tornatore intend THE LEGEND OF 1900 as a denunciation of big-budget commercial Euro-puddings, cleverly making the film in the vacuous style of its worst excesses (i.e. criticising the likes of TITANIC by emulating them), or did he simply make a vacuous film? I suspect the latter. As one of the characters says, 'You're never really done-for as long as you have a good story, and someone to tell it to'. Maybe he meant to say, 'someone to SELL it to'."

","No major SPOILERS here.<br/><br/>Starts off as one of those European, ""grand"" (read: pretentious-looking), overly sentimental turn-of-the-century epics, but it gradually, steadily but firmly, starts growing on you. It's a highly idealized bio of a larger-than-life fictional character. I moaned when Roth, as a child, immediately learned to play the piano with great skill the day he first saw it. But, as I said, Roth plays a larger-than-life guy so anything goes; there are practically elements of fantasy here, even though this isn't literally spelled out. One has to accept the otherwise absurd premise that a man who is born on a ship, willingly spends half a century aboard it without once setting foot on land. Yet the movie is shot so well, and combined with the pleasant music (not ""pleasant"" as in ""puts you to sleep"") it pulls you in, especially in the second half. Roth appears too aloof for a while and his character too mysterious and undefined, but his long, very interesting speech to the trumpet player at the end of the movie clarifies a lot in a strange and original way. It's always good to be pleasantly surprised by a movie that starts off not-very promisingly, and then improves so much that it's never boring and even fascinating all the way to the end. It doesn't even matter that 1900 grew up with an American foster parent, but - as Roth - developed a British accent. The movie is good, so I'll leave the nit-picking for some other time..."

","This movie is absolutely everything a music-lover could hope for. OK, so I'll agree with the all the criticism that this movie has gotten. The acting isn't fantastic, the story may be a bit far-fetched... but one has to realize that the movie isn't entirely ABOUT any of those things. It is about the one thing it sets to describe... music.<br/><br/>Music is clearly the centerpiece of this film. Not actually music itself (although there is quite a bit of good music in it) but rather the philosophy behind music. Music as an expressive art. Music as a descriptive tool. Music as a way to relate to life. Tim Roth's character, Nineteen Hundred's perspective on life is exactly his philosophies concerning music: he can make infinite things happen in a limited amount of space. Like in his last monologue... he can make infinite music on a finite keyboard... he cannot make any music on an infinite keyboard.<br/><br/>If you want to see an A-class movie with A-class acting, you may be disappointed. But if you're looking for a beautifully artistic movie about the philosophy of music, this one deserves more than a 10 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to any musician who loves music as more than audio noise; to anyone who sees life in music and music in life."

","1900 is a very good movie, but it was too flawed to be a true classic. It might sound like I didn't enjoyed, but I really did. Tim Roth doesn't have anything to prove, he's a terrific actor and he gave an excellent performance.<br/><br/>However, Pruitt Taylor Vince, his main counterpart, just kinda was there. I think a different actor could've provided quite a boost. Vince lacked presence and was at best ""good."" The polish that you take for granted in classics was very much lacking here.<br/><br/>Tim Roth and a great story are forced to stand alone - with supporting characters and direction failing to make an impact."

","A long long film. In the end, the huge ship bursts into pieces , I felt a light , slight, mild or inconspicuous anguish in my heart, but sudden and short.<br/><br/>The first scene of adult 1900, he walked into the ballroom, followed by the trumpet player. Sitting at the piano, he played beautiful music while the piano dancing on the ground. Startling graceful, this maybe the most accurate adjective to describe the scene, music, piano, dancing, pianist, everyone in that ballroom, even the awkward trumpet player. I think most audience would have the same feeling with me at this scene: 1900 is a different protagonist . With great talent for music , he brought so many amazement to people on that passenger liner as well as the audience, especially he competes with that so-called greatest pianist from shore, completely stunning! However, I feel the theme of this film is of sadness though I totally lost in the main idea people who create it would like to express. 1990 is afraid of the ashore life, maybe just like I am afraid of Hitchcock, Agatha . But it should be different, my fear comes from the thrilling scene ( maybe not thrilling at all in others' opinion) , the suspenseful plot or deep shadowiness of human beingIf I have not read a novel or watched a film like that, I would never know my scare at this, even it haunts me like nightmare when I am alone , I am still curious and willing to accept the ""horrible"" novel or film when it comes to me occasionally.<br/><br/>Unknown fear of ashore life confined 1990 to the ship , in which he was raised up and played tremendously ""magic music"" . To him, land is even more terrible than death. Sometimes people like a fragile rose on a thin golden stem, delicate, exquisite but weak and helpless. Feeling makes human powerful , at the same time, it can destroy human 's outlook, hope and life. More talented, more sensitive; more sensitive, more fragile; more fragile, more touching , it's a perfect description of literature, fine arts, music ,drama and life!"

","I saw this gem on IFC and I was happy to see others enjoyed this movie as much as I have. It's a quirky premise but so well-acted that you fall under its spell in a very short time. It's also beautifully photographed, btw. Roth is a first-rate actor and uses his skills to the fullest here.<br/><br/>The one point I couldn't digest was the lack of loneliness displayed by 1900 (main character's name from his being born in 1900). Through most of the movie, he's obviously in his early 30s but never says a thing about his living in such isolation. Perhaps, as it's the only thing he's ever known, he just doesn't know what could be his in the outside world.., One of the highlights of the movie is the piano duel between the character acting as Jelly Roll Morton and 1900. It's really something to see and I'd love to know whose hands were doing the actual playing, as it was phenomenal.<br/><br/>An excellent movie for a rainy day afternoon or, for that matter, anytime at all!"

","I like this film. This is a lonely movie that tells a lonely story with a lonely man whose name is ""Danny Boodmann T.D Lemon Nineteen Hundred"". The highlight of the movie is that he lived in the ferry Virginia all his life. He never set foot on land. I was thinking about the reason why he didn't want to go ashore when I was watching the movie. That is his choice. He was always alone. When he was on the ferry he was lonely, if he steps on the land he'll be more lonely. At the end of the movie, he finally said why. ""All that city... You just couldn't see an end to it. The end! Please, could you show me where it ends? It was all very fine on that gangway and I was grand, too, in my overcoat. I cut quite a figure and I had no doubts about getting off. Guaranteed. That wasn't a problem. It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max. In all that sprawling city, there was everything except an end. There was everything. But there wasn't an end. What I couldn't see was where all that came to an end. The end of the world. Take a piano. The keys begin, the keys end. You know there are 88 of them and no-one can tell you differently. They are not infinite, you are infinite. And on those 88 keys the music that you can make is infinite. I like that. That I can live by. But you get me up on that gangway and roll out a keyboard with millions of keys, and that's the truth, there's no end to them, that keyboard is infinite. But if that keyboard is infinite there's no music you can play. You're sitting on the wrong bench. That's God's piano. Christ, did you see the streets? There were thousands of them! How do you choose just one? One woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at, one way to die. All that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends. Aren't you scared of just breaking apart just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it? I was born on this ship. The world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time. And there were wishes here, but never more than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern. You played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite. I learned to live that way. Land is a ship too big for me. It's a woman too beautiful. It's a voyage too long. Perfume too strong. It's music I don't know how to make. I can't get off this ship. At best, I can step off my life. After all, it's as though I never existed. You're the exception, Max. You're the only one who knows that I'm here. You're a minority. You'd better get used to it. Forgive me, my friend. But I'm not getting off."" People are always afraid to face the established results or the terminal point and they are always lost. So did 1900. 1900 also said that ""Winter comes, you wish it was summer. Summer comes, you live in dread of winter. That's why we never tire of travel."" People are afraid of the coming of somethings. In other words, they afraid that everything in front of them will disappear. So 1900 would rather stay on the ferry than move to the land. Actually, when he was on the ferry he was on the way to his life without of the end. He was alone and the loneliness was just like the road that stretches in the dark. It was terrible but affordable. So the ocean and the infinite journey were his choices."

","*** Some Slight Spoilers***<br/><br/>The Legend of 1900 is a neglected pearl of a movie.  Behind the sentimental exterior is concealed a profound statement, which is the trademark of Giuseppe Tornatore's style.  Much like in Cinema Paradiso, the director's attention concentrates on the torments, tortures and dilemmas of change.  In our culture the notions of ""growing up"" and ""maturing"" are treated not only as inevitable but also self-evidently positive.  The story of 1900 is only marginally about the fear of entering and dealing with the uncertainties of the big scary world ""out there"" (Danny the sailor warns the little 1900 that the ""sharks on land"" are far more cruel and voracious than the ones swimming in the ocean).  In my opinion, Tornatore dwells here with one of the deepest and painful problems of human life: how do you establish your own significance in the world filled with cold indifference? how do you know who and what you are?  Everybody in the film tries to convince 1900 (masterfully and ironically played by Tim Roth) to take that fateful step and get off the ship in order to ""BECOME SOMETHING.""  They all assume and believe that to be something, to gain significance, one must leave his ""ship"" and prove himself in the eyes of the ""real world"" -- the collection of powerful groups whose opinions and decisions are somehow more important that those of the small milieu of the one's parochial world.  One's recognition, one's validation comes from some powerful forces ""out there,"" on land.  Frequent digressions about the fact that as far the ""world was concerned,""  1900 did not even exist.  In his final monologue, 1900 himself admits with a touch of regret that the world had bypassed him.  But, damn it, why do we all constantly have to care about what the ""world"" thinks of us, makes of us??  Why, in order to live ""fulfilled"" lives, do we seek ""recognition""?  Who are the judges?  1900 perhaps unconsciously fights against having to define himself in terms of what the ""world"" or ""real life"" make of him.  He chooses anonymous death aboard the Virginia cruise ship.  His death is as unknown as was his birth.  The world did not know about his existence, his art, his personal agony.  But 1900 never defined his worth, or the meaning of his life in terms of ""public opinion"" and vain glory.  He left not a trace of his existence to this seemingly all-important world.  All he left to us was his legend.  And that's all that really mattered.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful film.  Fantastic music.  Excellent song at the end! Highly recommended for thinking and open-minded viewership."

","It is a rare thing to have a movie truly touch you.  It is rarer still to be able to watch a movie repeatedly and get the same effect without fail, every single time you watch it.  This, however, is exactly what the film ""The Legend of 1900"" accomplishes.  From its opening depiction of immigrants to America, to the climactic piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton (which has some of the best damned jazz piano I have ever heard in a film), this movie show exactly what should be presented in a drama.  It is not designed to simply be depressing and sappy, but it has a meaning.  That life is just too vast and beautiful for some people to comprehend, and that for those people, living they're life between a bow and stern (hope thats the back and front ;) ) is the only real existence they need, and that every man should do what he needs to in order to have a happy life.  The performances by the principle characters are amazing, truly inspiring, and as an actor I can truly appreciate the depth that Tim Roth gives to his character, especially in his explanation to Max at the end about why it is he could never leave the ship.  I highly recommend this film to every movie buff out there, if not for the wonderful acting, the earth shattering piano duel."

","I cannot believe i didn´t went to see this movie at the theaters ! THE LEGEND OF 1900, is one of the most beautiful and poetic movies in a very long time, (with the exception of Magnolia wich is also fantastic, but in a different style). But this one has one of the most unexpected and original stories i ever saw in a  movie. But what is realy difficult to describe is the feeling which this movie conveys. It has an atmosphere of an haunted fairy tale but in a very poetic way, turning even the most normal events into some kind of enchanted moment. The movie is directed by Giusepe Tornatore the Italian director who created one of the most beautiful movies of all time, Cinema Paradiso. Strangely enough this was one of the reasons i didn´t went to see The Legend of 1900 at the theaters. I thought that after Cinema Paradiso, there was no way, the same director would be able to create another movie like that. Man, was i wrong !<br/><br/>I loved The Legend of 1900 so much, that i don´t know what i like best anymore. I think i only seen a story as poetic as this before and that was in Cinema Paradiso.<br/><br/>I´m not going to talk about the plot of 1900 because you can read it in all the other reviews. What i just want to say is that this movie has just sunk Titanic even deeper, for it has all the emotion and strengh that  James Cameron never did achieve in his movie and being similar movies in atmosphere i think it´s fair to make a comparison and it´s also fair to say that THE LEGEND OF 1900, is far emotionaly superior to TITANIC in every aspect and every detail of its story. This movie is everything i was expecting to find in TITANIC and it was´t there.<br/><br/>I wish i could do justiçe in describing how beautiful The Legend of 1900 is, but this is one of those things you have to see for yourself to really appreciate, because i guess there are no words to describe, the poetry of so many of the scenes in this movie. The moment when 1900 falls in love is truly undiscribable. The way in which music is used in this story is simply a work of genius. And this soundtrack wipes the floor with all the comercial c**p that appears nowadays in the Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>The Legend of 1900 is to Music what Cinema Paradiso was to Cinema. Tornatore has done it again ! And as love stories go, this is one of the best i ever seen. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to have this gift to realy create extraordinary beautiful love stories without making them into  Hollywood soaps and this is very rare this days.<br/><br/>And it´s not only the story that makes this such a good film to watch. Visualy its also trully impressive and glamorous. The production design and photography in this movie creates incredible visuals. Some scenes even look like classic paintings coming to life. And the cast is fantastic. I won´t name anyone in particular because all deliver a truly fantastic ensemble performance. Giuseppe Tornatore has created another unforgettable classic, that i can bet will be truly recognized as the mastepiece it is in years to come.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, because it isn´t an Hollywood product, the movie didn´t had the publicity or distribution, it deserved, and so i guess not many people got the chance to see it at theaters, but hey, it´s now out on DVD and in an incredible high technical quality edition (at least in region2) so please go and rent this movie. Buy it , in fact because you won´t regret it. And if you have a widescreen tv and a surround sound, you´ll go nuts with this film.<br/><br/>It´s movies like this that prove how fake the Oscars are.

","The legend of 1900 is a fairlytale-like story of a man who grew up on a ship and spent his entire life there while playing the piano like no one had ever done before. It is at times funny, tragic and sad. The music is very easy on the ear, especially when 1900 meets the love of his life. But most of all I liked the part of the film when 1900 explains why he never left the ship. 1900 liked the fact that on board of the ship the possibilities are not infinite whereas on land the fact that there so many streets and so many places to go made him feel desperate. I agree with another commentator who said that this story is the story for the next millenium. The fact that with all the new technology the motto seems to be that the sky is the limit one wonders whether this is really an improvement or just an unnecessary complication of life. And before I forget, Tim Roth and his trumpet playing friend Max are- to my opinion- acting their best."
"JimPills","Null","0","0","3 December 1999"," A delicate and authentic magic
","Upon first consideration, ""The Legend of 1900"" seems merely to be a shaggy dog story, albeit a lyrically shot and physically sumptuous shaggy dog story.  The more you consider it, however, the more penetrating the film becomes.  Forget Hollywood action fluff like ""End of Days"".  THIS is a parable for the end of the millennium.<br/><br/>Tim Roth stars as Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900, born in his namesake year aboard a cruise liner called the Virginian and taken in by the ship's crew as a surrogate son.  1900, as everyone calls him, reveals a prodigistic ability on the piano, and over the years, he wins admirers and friends, and becomes a figure of musical legend...all the while never setting foot on dry land.  Even after being given the opportunity to make it big as a recording artist.  Even after besting ""the man who invented jazz"", Jelly Roll Morton (played with fierce pride by Clarence Williams III) in a piano duel.  Even after facing the temptation of a wide-eyed, beatific muse...1900 stays firmly rooted to the sea. <br/><br/>As we watch, we enjoy the skillful performances of Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince, who plays Max, the trumpeter in the ship's jazz band and 1900's closest friend.  We also appreciate the film's visual presentation. Director Giuseppe Tornatore and cinematographer Lajos Koltai give every shot a lush, burnished elegance, and the film is caressed by a lovely score from the legendary Ennio Morricone.  <br/><br/>Eventually, though, it all comes to an end.  The world survives a war, Max returns to dry land, and the Virginian rots away, and still 1900 stays on board the ship.  Finally, Max comes on board, pleading to his friend to leave and come into the world.  And 1900, a man who speaks for the past that he is named for, delivers a speech that renders the fact that this review is being written for the Internet bitterly ironic.  It lays bare the fact that we are all lost in a vast and impersonal sea of endless stimulus, that provides us with all we seemingly need but does not allow us to really put down roots, to take shape, to grow.  The film speaks urgently to a world caught in the stranglehold of sensationalistic mass media and corporate control.  It imparts a simple but essential message.  Better to be the shining star of a small world than to travel through infinite space as a nobody.  <br/><br/>""The Legend of 1900"" is a sleeper, and one of the deepest and most interesting films of the year."
"neaonbhb","1","9","34","21 June 2011"," Worst Movie of All Time? Maybe not, but close.
","Watching the film ""The Legend of 1900"" is by definition a trial of patience. Every aspect of the movie strains believably to its breaking point, to such an extent that you wish to watch a movie like ""Star Wars"", just so you can watch a movie without having to question the silliness of everything that happens.<br/><br/>Like many movies that feature phenomenal music, not-so-bright people mistake that music for a quality movie. That is a shame. The music truly is exceptional, and is one of only two redeeming aspects of the film. The other is the acting of Tim Roth, who desperately attempts to pull this movie out of the depths it is falling into. But unfortunately, all of his acting chops cannot save this movie.<br/><br/>The movie falls apart quickly - the eye-rolling begins at the beginning, with the unlikely discovery of the baby, and quickly turns to out-and- out groans when we find that the child has the magical ability to play the piano at a professional level without ever having touched the instrument or having been given any introduction to music, chord structure, formal training or any other aptitude building of any kind. Since the movie is built on this concept, everything that follows lacks any punch since none of it is in any way believable. By the time 1900 and Max are sliding around on the ballroom floor during a huge storm while deftly playing the piano, you'll likely have realized that this movie is pure silliness. That stuff works in anime movies, but not in films like this where the audience really needs to believe that the events depicted could have happened.<br/><br/>The movie isn't helped by the terrible, terrible acting of much of the supporting cast. The awful Pruitt Taylor Vince hams it up to the best of his (meager) abilities, and every scene he appears is dragged down into boredom, eye-rolling, and laugh-inducing dialogue. I guess its no surprise when the co-star of the films only other notable role was as a patient on ""House"". Other than Clarence Williams III as ""Jelly Roll"" Morton, and Bill Nunn as 1900's adoptive father, there's really no other actors to speak of anyways (and applying that term to anyone in the film other than Roth is a stretch, to say the least).<br/><br/>If you're able to stick this terrible movie out to the ending, you will have progressively been deadened time and again by the schlocky, pointless, unbelievable story to the point that the final ridiculous scene won't even surprise you much. Although when you think back on it, you'll find yourself chuckling to yourself and wondering what you were thinking by not turning it off earlier. And that's really where we get in this movie - Nowhere. Turn it off before it starts and you'll be happier.<br/><br/>So its maybe not the worst movie of all time, there are movies like ""Plan 9"" and ""DeathBed"" which deserve that title more. But when a movie takes itself so seriously and comes off so pretentiously, as ""1900"" is wont to do, you really want to rank it below the movies that are worse, if only to punish it for its excesses. Watch something more believable, like ""Men in Black"", or ""Spy Kids""... or even ""Cars"". The idea of talking cars is so much more believable than this tripe."

","Seems a lot of folk that watch movies, have the mistaken view that if a film looks in anyway whatsoever 'different' it 'must' be good!. I'd imagine that '1900' must have made some members of the Italian fine Arts Council, and all those listed in the credits for pouring tons of money into this fiasco, want to hide themselves in the rest-room after the premiere. They must to this day, still be hiding the investment figures from any government auditors ~ following a massive $9 Million dollars, that returned less than $260,000. <br/><br/>The version my wife and I watched was the international, running a seemingly interminable 123 Min's. To think that some poor souls overseas had to sit through 170 Min's is untenable. As it was, my wife kept asking how much longer can they stretch this ridiculously thin material? Perhaps the original Monologue by Alessandro Baricco (if it was short enough) may have held up, but as an overblown movie, not quite so.<br/><br/>Director: Giuseppe Tornatore (and his bank-rollers) must have thought that after the success of 'Cinema Paradiso' everything he touches will turn to gold. But as this movies huge losses showed...all that glitters is not gold. And 'glitter' this movie does, big time. The sets are HUGE, but overdone to the point of being unintentionally unconvincing. Director of Photography: Hungarian born Lajos Koltai works hard, but the story and situations are simply so outlandishly foolish, that he can only attempt to add some visual saving graces. I would even go so far to say the word 'Fable' was added to the publicity as a last minute bid to salvage a complete wreak, following audience reactions.<br/><br/>As a collector of Ennio Morricone soundtracks, I even found this score uninspired, as if he too knew this one was was doomed to failure.<br/><br/>If you're easily pleased, and love 'Arty' pretensions, then you might enjoy this not entirely successful overindulgence. As with another film of director Tornatore; the very stylish, sex fueled, foul mouthed entry 'Malena'...I hope to never suffer either again. Maybe '1900' is OK for those that like to add their own depth to shallow fiction. It's also possible it might have been better if it had been given a way less excessive treatment ~ or even a better choice of stars (these look as if they're wondering if they've wandered onto the wrong set) it might then have come a little closer to working, but wouldn't hold out too much hope...."

","While the basic idea is thought-provoking, the film simply didn't convince me.  I wanted things to be less perfect, like the seasick piano scene - why not have them smash into a few walls for humor and added believability? Also, why were there no interesting anecdotes about how 1900 managed to stay on the ship his whole life?  It was too brushed-over, I felt.  And if Tim Roth was really in love with the land girl, why go through all of that if he's just gonna stay on the boat?  What was the point?!!  I think Tornatore put a little too much faith into the concept without developing it into a cooler, more believable tale.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen.  I enjoyed the piano duel scene but that was about it.  I think the hokiness that I felt can best be summed up when Pruitt Taylor Vince's character says, ""I never forgot 1900...""  Of course not, he's been the focus of your narration for the past 3/4's of the film!!!  That's my two cents.  Take it or leave it."

","What could have and should have been an absolutely magical tale got all tangled up in poor casting and the inadequacies of the writer/director. I would imagine, that if this movie was pitched to me, recommended to me, what have you, I would have nothing but positive notions. The story seems lovely (and is indeed, the strongest part of the movie), the characters, for the most part, wonderful creations, the setting and the theme and the music, all stellar. The delivery is lacking. Our narrator, Max, responsible for relaying the plot to us, the gentle audience, is supposed to be a likable creation, a chubby, cheerful, New Orleans jazz trumpeter. Instead, he's your drunk math teacher who talked to loud, or the uncle that smells and asks awkward questions and stares too long at your chest. At best, he's a Blues Brother...hardly a compliment in this case, for The Legend of 1900 is hardly a comedy, and Max isn't supposed to be a caricature. And so, this beautiful plot, the story of 1900 gets choked out through Max's double chin, and the beauty and poetry of the story on the boat is rudely interrupted by his spittle flying tirades and cheap Yankee colloquialisms. Further bashing 1900's face into the grit and the gravel is Tornatore's inability to convey to us the genius of 1900's music. Instead of any real emotion, he relies on slapstick dropped cigars and knocked off wigs to show us that the audience is impressed. Instead of allowing great music to speak for itself, he hammers it into our skull with flying sweat and notes so fast they could hardly be played by two hands...OH MY GOODNESS, LOOK AT THOSE EFFECTS, IT LOOKS LIKE 1900 HAS FOUR HANDS! It's as though he expects us to have no appreciation of music, no ear to hear what is beautiful without blatantly spelling out, letter by letter, just how may keys per second this man can play. Tim Roth shines, however. He too, it would seem, saw the magic and beauty of the story before it was spewed out by Tornatore. He is 1900. a complex and mildly insane character with a strong back story and a magnetic presence. His face and hands say far more than Tornatore's sorry words, that often work to disrupt the character's existence and hinder Roth's performance. But any ache in my heart at the end was due to Roth's skill and believability in this role, and his full assumption of the well-crafted character."

Of course, it only makes sense that this child is named 1900 (the year he was born) and raised by a stoker who seems to do an awfully good job for a man who works long hours and keeps the baby in dangerous conditions.  The child turns out to be, of all things, a piano prodigy. <br/><br/>The movie is ridiculous.  I know some people argue that it's a fantasy and the movie requires a leap of faith.  In order for a movie like this to succeed, it must set up a believable foundation before it lets us loose in the world it creates.  Not only is this movie unable to do that, but it is so grounded in the reality of the early 1900s that the plot is laughable.  Finally, why does the movie end with 1900 unable leave the ship and choosing death?  I understand that the ship is the only world 1900 has ever known and he is more afraid of the outside world than death.  Yet, I really don't understand why his friend would let him commit suicide.  So 1900 dies without ever changing.  His character is unable to grow.  He is unable to accept change at all.  Is this supposed to be poetic?  I don't buy it."

After several years on the ship Max leaves, and tells the story of 1900 to the owner of a music store.<br/><br/>Interesting concept, not well used. The idea of a man who has never set foot on land, whose whole world is one ship and cannot relate to the world outside was a very original and promising one. However, the story really doesn't explore any of these themes well. The story is quite superficial, full of empty, devoid of context sentimentality and contrived, implausible situations. It's a simple linear storyline with faux-sentimental, style-over-substance scenes dropped in.<br/><br/>Even the tone is wrong. The movie is often cartoonish in its sub- plots and characters. What was needed was gravitas, not cheap thrills.<br/><br/>The conclusion does provide some insights into 1900's motivations and outlook on life but still isn't that profound.<br/><br/>This all said, the storyline was reasonably interesting and there is some good tension towards the end.<br/><br/>Solid work by Tim Roth in the lead role. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a touch unconvincing and irritating as Max Tooney. The lack of gravitas is almost entirely his, or at least his character's, doing.

If it reminds me of any other film, I suppose it's Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' - it has a similar lush feel and the soundtrack is perhaps occasionally reminiscent of the work of Ennio Morricone - but it's certainly no slavish copy, it has a magical quality all its own. It looks as though quite a lot of money was spent on this project and I feel it's a great shame that it hasn't reached the wider audience it so obviously deserves.

But I think the thing that really reaches and touches the innermost recess of my tender heart, is not just the movie,the art form ,the vehicle that serves to showcase, but rather what's been told, what's been showcased, what's been revealed. In other words,It's the story that does it. I didn't know much about the screenplay and the writer thing,nor that I cared. I just noticed at the beginning of the movie,when the billing came up one by one,the movie is based on a novel ,by a foreign writer.I mean he is a Non-American writer.Perhaps a Spaniard or French.So the immigrant perspective and sentiments pervasive in this story(and movie,thanks to the wonderful director,who is also a Non-American director,by the way) are very much real,and make for a truly cinematic as well as literary success, in terms of how many hearts it touches and moves. For there's always something alien in this story, in the main character 1900,the seafaring pianist who refused to ever set foot on dry land,not even when the ship he was born and spent all his life on,Virginian,was about to be blown up to pieces.Not that only immigrants would be easily associated with such aberrations,it's just that it would feel more right if it occurs with a foreigner, an immigrant who is destined to be at odds with a whole new culture that is seething beyond the board, beyond the beckoning Statue of Liberty.I just fear such a brilliant, such a heart-breaking ,such a once-in-a-lifetime story would not be safe with a seasoned, sophisticated and native American screenwriter and director. There's always something they just can't get, that subtle vibe, that unique angle.Unless they are foreigners, they are immigrants, they see things differently,literally and figuratively. So it's a real good thing, for audience, and for the cinema history as well perhaps, that a foreign squad was assembled to get the story told in cinematic terms. Even The lead role,1900, was played by a ""foreign"" actor, Tim Roth, a Briton. <br/><br/>I keep missing the point.I don't know why.I have no idea why I keep avoiding coming to the point. The point of what's in the story that grabbed my heart and squeezes my tear gland so damn hard.There's no beating around the bush now I guess.<br/><br/>It's just me,I must confess. It's the way 1900 lived his life, viewed his life, chose to end his life that really struck a chord with me.Because I can feel 1900, because in a way I'm him, I'm like living in a ship of life, just like him. I sympathise with him,with what he has gone through;I'm saddened by what he's missed,what he's been denied- life's luxury,great love, a skyrocketing fame,given his stunning piano-playing skills;I truly relate to what he said at the end of the movie to Max, his only bosom friend on board(and assumedly,on land too),the trumpet player, the words he whispered in his characteristically mellow voice,with an air of confidence and ease fit for a Shakespeare play monologue, with a light in the eyes that could still an enraged lion, the words that really tugged at my tender heartstrings. I could only paraphrase.I may not be able to quote verbatim,but the gist is, life beyond the board is like a piano with infinite keys with it. A piano you can make no music on. A talented,nay,gifted player like him could only play(and alas,played so fantastically) on a piano with 88 keys. Once on land,he would find himself stranded, in the endless possibilities, infinite choices, and limitless temptations. He'd felt lost and he'd never be himself. He'd rather blow up with the ship. And he wished there'd be pianos in heaven. All of a sudden,I just got it,why I'm so moved by this movie. I'm 1900 in life.Every word he said has long been whirling in my mind and waiting to be formed.1900 did it for me,before I ever existed."
"teacherlogan","6","2","5","2 March 2007"," An Enchanting Film. A piano lover's dream
","If you love music, you will love The Legend of 1900. If you enjoy enchanting stories, this film fills that need. If you prefer period pieces, the costumes, scenery and music will whisk you back to the turn of the 20th Century. Finally, if you enjoy a movie that leaves you thinking long after the credits have run, this movie does so. It leaves you questioning everything you've just seen, while appreciating everything you've just heard.<br/><br/>The Legend of 1900 is about an orphan boy who is abandoned aboard a luxury ocean liner at the start of the 20th Century. Reared in the underbelly of the ship by one of its workers, he is named Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 after his adopted father, the lemon box he was found it and the year he was born. Nicknamed 1900, he soon discovers his natural talent as a pianist and gains notoriety as the ship's piano player. He befriends a traveling saxophone player. The film is told through the sax player's eyes.<br/><br/>While 1900 has never left the confines of the ship, he is not a hermit. He is widely visible and much beloved. He gains fame by beating renowned Jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton in a duel. But no fame can remove him from his home. As such, we see 1900 as a man of limited experiences; not little experience. He has experienced friendship, if fleeting. He has experienced love, if only for a moment. He has experienced celebrity status, if barely outside the boat. It is a contemporary tale of a confined genius whose home is a ship, the sea and his music. The simplicity with which he lives does not mask his talent, it simply binds it.<br/><br/>There are two things that make this movie better than it should be. The first is the music. While a movie about a piano prodigy should have a great soundtrack, the beauty is that the entire score is the story of 1900's life. We are told early on that 1900 writes what he sees. He writes music to complement the actions of the travelers. At times the soundtrack seems to follow the same pattern. The music is not just a peripheral element. It is part of his character. The music accompanies the movie just as it has accompanied 1900 through his entire life.<br/><br/>The second piece that makes this movie work is the story-telling feel. We truly feel that the only way 1900 will be remembered is if his story continues to be told. We believe that not only will the saxophone player further his story, but so will the countless travelers who have come into contact with him. While 1900 comes across as reserved and timid at times, his talent will make him stand out even more than he would want. Though his only recording may have been destroyed, by word of mouth, his legacy will live on.<br/><br/>Tim Roth has a talent for giving emotional performances with a quiet grace that does not overwhelm the scene. He seems to let the character's actions speak for themselves. In Rob Roy, Roth's character is soft spoken, yet his actions are powerful and revolting. As an audience, we would still despise his character even if he never opened him mouth. And his dark eyes seem to project a character that has something to hide. Whether intentional or unintentional, Roth projects a character that is deeper and more complex than he lets on.<br/><br/>1900 is that type of character. As a piano player, 1900 has always expressed himself through his music. Apart from the piano, his actions seem slow and deliberate. His words are simple and carefully chosen, even rehearsed at times. We go through much of the film not knowing what makes him tick. At times he seems scarred by a life at sea. At times he seems completely at peace. At times we feel sorry for him. Other times we applaud him. Such is The Legend of 1900."

","I stumbled into this film while watching IFC a few months ago. To my surprised, I became glued to the television. ""The Legend Of 1900,"" which is the title that it was given when released in the US, is about a infant found on a ship in 1900. As his friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince)tells his story in a series of flashbacks, we discover that 1900 spent his entire existence on the ship, being raised by Danny (Bill Nunn). 1900 (The underrated Tim Roth)is also a very good piano player, his music inspired by what he sees and feels. Yet for all his talent, he never leaves the ship. We soon find out that the ship is soon to be blown to bits. Max thinks that 1900 may still be on the ship.<br/><br/>This is a great film, and the music is pretty cool. The 2 best parts of the film is the piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). Watching their fingers fly on the ivories is hypnotic! Also when Max and 1900 play the piano during the storm, the piano cruises around the halls of the ship, leaving you feeling like you're on a roller-coaster.<br/><br/>The saddest part is when Max does find 1900 and he explains why he has never left the ship. Part of me could understand his hesitation to leave: His world was the ship, the only place he had ever known and loved. You know that he will die when the ship blows, but his reasons actually sound sane.<br/><br/>Worth checking out."

However, 'Legend of 1900' does not deliver - it is long, melodramatic, and despite many beautiful moments lacks the artistic glue to make of it the big and memorable movie it could be.<br/><br/>I was disappointed.

","After having won the Oscar for ""Cinema Paradiso"", a movie I enjoy very much, watching this one gives me the impression that Tornatore is pulling everything up to repeat that experience. Although the story is original and the score is more than well done, this movie lacks of ""small"" other things. The set sometimes looks fake, like for e.g. when at the beginning the ship is approaching New York, passing close to the statue of liberty. The main actors are not convincing, Pruitt Taylor Vince fits physically as Max, but there are many scenes, where he looks like he'd burst out laughing, although dealing with dramatic issues. Tim Roth, I'm sorry to say this, didn't convince me. At certain points, for e.g. the scene where he does fall in love with the passenger was completely unbelievable in my eyes, not for the story, but for acting. There are also some goofs (I consider the appearance of a black man around 1920s on a Luxus ship being so nice treated and heartly welcome in a first class area like in the movie somehow not being realistic).<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","The Legend of 1900<br/><br/>Ocean liners are the ideal jazz venue because the audience has no means of escaping.<br/><br/>Conversely, the pianist in this drama is attracting passengers to his vessel.<br/><br/>When a ship worker finds a baby aboard the SS Virginian, he raises it as his own. But when he passes, the child - dubbed 1900 (Tim Roth) - must fend for himself. Eventually, he learns the piano and joins the vessel's orchestra - never once stepping foot on dry ground. When word of his talents reaches the mainland, famed pianist Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) boards the Virginian to challenge him to a piano duel.<br/><br/>While the narrative never goes beyond the concept, and 1900's character arc is basically nonexistent, this adaptation of an Italian novel makes up for its shortfalls with dynamic direction and scorching soundtrack.<br/><br/>However, if the ship ever starts sinking it's probably smart to say you play the triangle.

"arthur_tafero","9","1","2","20 November 2018"," One of the Top 100 FIlms of All Time - 1900
","The Legend of 1900 is a special film; it is on my top 100 films of all time, and that is not easy to be listed on. It is the second best film project ever completed by the team of director Tornatore and film score creator, Morricone. It is second only to Cinema Paradiso, the greatest Italian classic film of all time. The lead actors and production values are topnotch and the script is absolutely impeccable.
The story of a baby born and abandoned on top of a piano of a luxury liner on New Year's Day of 1900 is fascinating. He is raised on the ship by a 5th Deck (men who shoveled coal for the liner's energy) seaman for eight years, and then after the seaman's unfortunate demise, lives on his own, in the bowels of the ship. And there is more thing about him
He is the greatest piano player who ever lived.
He is a master of the piano by age eight; and entertains the entire crew and passenger categories, from the poorest to the richest. He becomes part of the luxury liner band and has several adventures during the numerous crossings of the ship. He even meets a beautiful girl, but does not pursue their relationship off the ship after she departs. The sea is his mistress; and he never abandons her.
The primary motifs of this film are the piano and the ocean, as well as a good friend who blows a pretty mean horn. However, the opening motif, which is repeated a few times in various crossings, is also important. There is always one person, who in the early morning mist, while approaching New York Harbor, sees the Statue of Liberty for the first time, like an angel parting the clouds of upcoming democracy. ""AMERICA!"" the excited immigrant yells, and a roar goes up from the large crowd of immigrants on the deck as everyone faces the statue and the ship enters the impressive harbor of New York City.
These scenes are accompanied by outstanding music, as are several other scenes in this classic film. As the protagonist explains, all things have a beginning and end, and being confined to a small piece of land for him would have been a premature end to his existence. So he opts to live and die on the sea. Both the sea and the piano are eternal and unlimited in scope. This film is a must-see for any serious film buff."

After all, for me, it's not about technical wizardry or having all the pieces fall into the right places. I've given 10s to movies that have flaws. Even ones that have problems.<br/><br/>But for me, everything boils down to feel. Everything comes down to how much the movie messed with me, how I went in looking at the world one way, and came out the other side with my brains mixed up. How now there are new colors in the world, thanks to this new perspective that's changed everything forever. <br/><br/>THE LEGEND OF 1900, starting Tim Roth, and written and directed by one of my favorite directors, Giuseppe Tornatore, the man who made CINEMA PARADISO, is my 100th ""10"". I've just watched it, and love is the only word that serves it justice, for me. From the amazing music played (even IF Tim Roth had to fake it) to the absolutely top-notch delivery done by ALL of the cast, right down to the extras in the background and the girl that barely had any lines... I've been touched. I've been moved. I've cried.<br/><br/>I'm in love.<br/><br/>It's the story of a man trying to tell the story of his friend, who was born and left on an ocean liner, and grows up on it. As a bonus, he's a master musician, a prodigy, who picks it up as he goes along.<br/><br/>The story is about his life, and the music he plays. The people he influences, the effects his music has on the world that he touches. It's about the way we look at life, at fame, at living. <br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away. Suffice to say that it was funny, moving, dramatic, touching, heartwarming, absolutely beautiful, and well worth the price of admission. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>I choose to give nothing away.

","This movie was quite simply one of the best that I've seen in a while. The story was original, the narration wistful and engaging, and the acting was absolutely excellent (Tim Roth especially). I have but one qualm with this movie--the ending. The ending for this movie made me quite literally sick to my stomach with anguish. In fact I would compare the emotional distress of this movie to that of the ending of Artificial intelligence-for those who've seen it. It was entirely heart wrenching, and in my opinion, entirely unnecessary (it would have been ridiculously easy to resolve the matter in a different way). The reasoning behind the action of the ending was well fleshed out, but still, was unnecessary. Besides this though, the story was very well done, and the characters were memorable as well as lovable (quite possibly why I had such an adverse reaction to the ending). Still, I would recommend this to pretty much anyone. Though, I'd be sure to prepare myself for impending heartache at the ending."

","A man, Max, walks into a pawn shop to sell his trumpet.  While playing it one last time, the owner puts on a record that sparks memories in Max and is the very reason he has returned to New York.  Max tells the story of a boiler worker on board the cruise ship The Virginian who finds a baby left on New Years day 1900.  He keeps the boy on board and raises him  naming him `Danny Boon TD Lemon 1900'.  When the boilerman is killed, 1900 stays on board and discovers a gift for playing the piano and is famous across the ship.  However, Max insists that 1900 has never, in 40 odd years, left the ship and is desperate to convince the demolition crew (about to demolish the ship out at sea) that 1900 must still be on board.<br/><br/>When I sat to watch this film I had no idea what it was about and had never so much as read a review  I just thought I'd give it a go as I had little else to do.  I am very glad that I did and would urge anyone else with the chance to see this film to do so.  The plot is very unlikely and very slight when it comes to details but it has a real whimsy to it that really keeps things moving alone really well.  Add to this the beauty of the music and it really gives the film a nice flow that stops it dragging.  The device of having Max tell the story and running the two time lines beside each other also really kept the story moving.<br/><br/>The light mood of the film changes later to slightly more serious drama but by then I was sucked in by the lightness and the change was not too heavy and was all the more moving for the light touch that had gone beforehand. True, it all is a bit (very!) unlikely and some bits of it feel like the bigger idea had come first and the details had been sketched in later, but this is a minor flaw as the film is perfectly pitched (excuse the pun) with a light feel that carries everything else.<br/><br/>From the first meeting of Max and 1900 to the emotional but easily foreseen climax the film is a mix of emotion and whimsy that works very well.  Roth is an OK (if not great) actor and only occasionally seems stretched here. For the most part he is good but I do find his squeaky voice annoying the odd time.  Vince was excellent in heavy and I was glad to see him again here  his role is strong and he does well.  Smaller roles such as Nunn and Williams III are good and everyone in support helps the comic yet emotional tone of the piece.  The direction is superb and again sets the mood well. The film suffers once from a poor projection on the ship's hull but other than that sets are great be they the growing city or the ballroom of the ship.<br/><br/>Is this a classic?  no.  Is it a light film that effortlessly sucks you into an emotional story?  yes.  If you're in the mood for something like this then this is the film for you.  The moment I finished watching it I wanted to see it again and go and give the tape to my friends to see, it really is that enjoyable."

","Its hard to believe that the same person who directed the fabulous, Oscar winning film, Cinema Paradiso, directed this film.  While the 1988 Academy Award winning Italian film was a film set in reality, it's effect was magical and captivated me all the way to the very end. Legend of 1900, which in all respects is supposed to be a fable with elements of fantasy (such as Tim Roth playing the piano as if possessing four hands, or a scene where Roth plays the piano as it rolls around on the deck of a ship during a storm), it is firmly grounded in the mundane.  <br/><br/>The cinematography, costume, music and set design in this movie are truly great, and for all intents and purposes, the movie looks and sounds fantastic. However the ham-handed dialogue, uninteresting story, and messy editing really undercut this film.  Everybody in the film is trying in one way or another to let you know that this guy 1900 is truly a magical and unique guy.  They are either crowding around to shower praise upon him, or staring at him dreamy-eyed.  1900's best friend, Max, played by the perpetually twitchy-eyed Pruitt, latches on to 1900 and develops a strange, puppy-dog like idol worship.  He smiles and gazes at Tim Roth's character as if though he were some sort of latter-day Messiah -- but I just don't see it.  1900 is portrayed here as nothing more than a great pianist with a bad case of agoraphobia.  He comes off more as a coward than a hero.  The only reason why we know 1900 is a great man, is because the film bashes you over the head with this knowledge through heavy-handed, cheesy dialogue.<br/><br/>
Speaking of the dialogue, it was way too sappy, and felt extremely unnatural.  This might be due to the fact that this was Giuseppe Tornatore's first English dialogue film, however the speech and dialogue patterns of this film from the main characters to the extras and side-players all felt rather forced and over-the-top.  I was literally laughing at the scene where 1900 was trying to give his ""crush"" a record as she was disembarking (or being pushed-off) the ship.  I also found Pruitt's acting during the emphatic ""piano duel"" scene with Clarence Witherspoon III extremely reminiscent of Chris Farley as he throws a fit and eats paper. I love Chris Farley, but his style of acting doesn't belong in a film like this.<br/><br/>There were times where I found myself bored and actually fast-forwarding through parts of this movie.  All in all, a good try by a great director, but this is a most definitely a miss."

I fell in love to this movie in the first 10 minutes with its unique background of the character. If you have your own life-stories, you can resonate with the conversation.

","I've heard this movie for a long time, but just watched it recently. An old movie, with all the classics, slow pace and deep perception about life, or something even bigger. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a good story. What bothers me a bit is what the Italian farmer said about the voice of the sea. For me, it is a bit pretentious. And later, his daughter mentioned again about chasing the voice of the sea. The scream. What is said is a secret. For me, this is too much! But I loved the music inspired by this girl. <br/><br/>What really enthralled me in meaning is his argument about finite and infinite. He can only create infinite music through finite piano keys.This philosophical part I can always relate with. <br/><br/>But the music that I enjoyed the most is one that played by the Jazz king, the second one, and the one inspired by that girl. <br/><br/>What moved me is the end, when he said to him I'm sorry my friend, but I'm not leaving the ship. I started to cry even for the longitude (I watched the Italian version, 160 + m) So I jumped several details. But I was still moved to tears. I think it's the perfect act of Tim Roth. His eyes, his innocence was perfected illustrated through his empty gaze. <br/><br/>I could not stop crying hearing he joking about his conversation in heaven. How can I play piano with two right arms?"

","The film is about the legend of the man '1900' who was found as an infant on new years day 1900 under the piano in the ball room of a cruise liner. The film tells the tale of a man who spent his whole life on a ship. A man with no country- only sea, who spent his childhood in the bowels of the ship shoveling coal and became the legendary pianist of that same grand ocean liner. Without going into the plot too much- the film is fantasy (why I compare it to Big Fish) but not too crazy that it wouldn't be believable. The music, costuming, and sets are beautiful and although the acting isn't always great, the film as a whole is compelling. There are touching moments (1900 sees a girl) , moments of tension (The challenge by Jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton), and musical magic. My most memorable scene is when Max meets 1900 in the ball room on a stormy night with high rolling seas. The brakes come off the piano and 1900 takes Max on a musical ride. Watch it for this scene alone and stick around for the Jelly Roll battle!"

","I do not have much to say. Just a few of simple opinion after witnessing this fascinating film.

But it is just my first time to watch this movie. I think I need to review it more times and go deeper to this movie. I cannot forget the final scene where Max go straight into the fog and faded there. Just like Max said, ""I don't know where to go when I set my foot on the land."" Neither does Max. He cannot earn a living in the city, but as a matter of fact he was born in the city. How could he lost his ability? How could 1900 keep away from hunger? How could he keep himself tidy in such a massing ship? It is just Max's own imagination. I have to say so."
"peterp-450-298716","9","1","3","27 September 2014"," Brilliant, excellent movie !
","There are some films that,despite having such a miserable long playing time, won't bore you quickly.However,there are films which have a regular playing time and still bore you to death.In the first category I include ""The Lord of the Rings"",""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"".You can add this one,which takes about 165 minutes,to this list,because this is a breathtaking and fascinating masterpiece.A musical journey told in the form of a fairy tale,that grabs you by the throat in the beginning and releases you when the credits start.I'm not really a jazz enthusiast or a piano recitals specialist,but it aroused my musical curiosity.Sometimes it feels as if you are getting musical education and you're actually continuously looking at some virtuosic piano playing like in ""Grand Piano"".There is however a big difference with the latter.And that's the fact that you stay intrigued and want to watch further so you can see how it unfolds.And you don't need toothpicks so your eyes stay open.It's not a recent film, but there was somebody who was praising this movie on some web page and I had to see it.<br/><br/>The whole story is told from the perspective of Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who played brass trumpet along with a legendary pianist in an orchestra on a cruise ship called ""The Virginian"".This legendary pianist once was abandoned by some poor immigrants and was left to be found in the class of the wealthier passengers, probably to ensure his future,but was eventually discovered and adopted by Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn),a coal-man in the engine room.The young boy was named Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred.Or just plain simply 1900, his year of birth.To avoid problems with certain instances 1900 lived deep in the hull of the cruise ship, until the day Danny died.Then he suddenly disappears.Until he reappears one night,sitting behind a piano and playing it in a wonderful way.He'll become the most virtuoso fabulous pianist in the world who doesn't have the courage to set foot on shore.<br/><br/>It's directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and is based on the monologue Novecento of the writer Alessandro Baricco.Overall,I thought there were three major chapters in this film.The first part can be described as ""Oliver Twist on The Titanic"".The same atmosphere and guidance as in Titanic,but without an iceberg anywhere so the crossing to America was completed without a hitch and one could behold the Statue of Liberty after arrival. A kind of Walt Disney part where the first years of 1900 were told in an amusing way. The second part is the largest and most musical part. A series of musical interludes, including the piano duel against Jelly Roll,""The man who invented jazz"" as people said,and 1900.Ennio Morricone provided the musical frame.So you know that this is a guarantee for masterful pieces of music.The third part is the most philosophical and tragicomic area.The attempt that Max is doing to get 1900 to leave the old cruise ship before it gets demolished.Three chapters which flow into each other fluently.In the beginning it alternates between the past and the present by means of flashbacks.An engaging,comical and touching film that continues to fascinate and amaze.<br/><br/>Tim Roth,who I recently saw starring in ""Broken"" and also has an impressive resume on his name,takes care of the lead role as the adult 1900.I think he's a wonderful actor who just has an innate calmness, interspersed with a truly sad, melancholic posture and gaze.The childish amazement about everyday things and the otherworldliness are expressed by him in a simple,unaffected way.He seems like a humble, timid and kind person,until he uses a heartfelt ""asshole"".A pianist who uses his emotions and the observed characteristics of people in his piano playing and only lives for his music. During a recording that was made by a music company,which would make him world famous and very rich,you can hear the tone and atmosphere of his piano performance slowly turn into a very intimate timbres merely by the appearance of a lovely lady.Even the deep philosophical reasoning in the end sounded acceptable, although 1900 didn't enjoy academic education.He gave a simplistic though rational explication about his state of mind and fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Pruitt Taylor Vince takes on the role of Max,the lone musician who is forced to sell his instrument.He wasn't really known to me.When I read his biography,he seemed to have made quite a furore in the years 80-90. He has won an Emmy for his role in ""Murder One"".It looks as if he has been forgotten a bit and only played small parts in some other films.Probably those parts were so small that I can't even remember them.All in all I found him fitting for this part although there was sometimes a case of overacting and he wasn't really in sync with the rudderless ship during the storm as he was wobbling all over the place.This stormy scene was for me rather too dramatic and slapstick-like.Pretending to be seasick,swaying back and forth and doing the waltzing dance while sitting behind the piano.<br/><br/>Although this film is appropriate for it,it still didn't become an overly grand Hollywood spectacle.It was sometimes overwhelming and impressive.The moment someone sees the Statue of Liberty and the whole ship starts waving with handkerchiefs and everybody is shouting out of intense joy (while the upper class sticks to a polite subdued applause) was the first goosebumps moment. After the umpteenth time however,despite the successful comedic approach in the end,it was a bit too much.Also the piano duel was a highlight where it was indisputable that 1900 played in such a way that it looked like he was playing with four hands (and the highlight of the smoldering cigarette of course).Yet at one time I had reached a saturation point.A superb duel and brilliant expressions,but still it was excessively long.But these tiny remarks don't outweigh the greatness of this film. Brilliant, excellent movie !<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"
"pruthvishrathod","8","1","3","14 November 2013"," hats off to Morricone
","The Legend of 1900, the first English language film of Tornatore is an unbelievable story set in its own world. It is about a pianist born with gifted talent. Known as 1900, he never step his feet outside the ship where he was discovered first. Just like all the films of Tornatore, story is treated with special care. It begins just like a normal affair and then all the events one by one makes it stepping out of the reality. But even after being unrealistic at times, it never looses its virtue. Tim Roth brilliantly played his part with his stylish expressions and was supported nicely by Pruitt Taylor Vince. Overall it may seem little stretched but the film is filled with lots of beautiful moments. Cinematography is wonderful at times. And Ennio Morricone deserves the highest praise. His music plays a major part behind film's titillation. It simply stunned me at times. Piano duel between Clarence Williams III & Tim Roth's characters alone makes this film a must watch."
"rooprect","7","1","3","5 October 2012"," Good movie, but it doesn't give the audience enough credit
","Ever heard someone tell a great joke, then ruin it by explaining the punch line even though you got it the first time? That's the feeling I kept getting throughout this film. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie well worth watching. But the director's habit of over-explaining things kept making me wonder if he thinks we're all idiots.<br/><br/>For example, there's a really cool scene where 2 pianists have a duel. Pianist #1 plays something amazing. Pianist #2 duplicates it note-for-note. It was almost a perfect scene except the director felt the need to have some extras in the audience yelling, ""He's playing the same thing! The exact same thing!""<br/><br/>Another example would be during the same scene when one pianist breaks into a taunting version of ""Silent Night"". It was a funny moment, but again those stupid extras start yelling, ""Haha, he's playing 'Silent Night'!!""<br/><br/>Whenever anyone plays something impressive we get those same unnecessary commentaries from peripheral characters, essentially telling the audience, ""Ok, you're supposed to be impressed here."" In that vein, the whole production struck me as being very operatic... meaning characters exaggerate reactions and emotions for the sake of giving the audience cues. Reminded me of a Kenneth Branaugh film. If you like em that way, then no problem. But if you prefer films on the subtle side (Kubrick, Bergman, Kieslowski), you might start to get distracted by this film's overtness.<br/><br/>THE FILM'S SAVING GRACE... is the incomparable Tim Roth. He offsets the melodrama of the characters around him with his calm, sober portrayal of the guy who knows it all yet has seen nothing. Roth plays the central character, a man who has lived his entire life within the bowels of a boat. And he pulls it off with amazing authenticity.<br/><br/>The film's final 15 minutes are where Roth really shines, and the director gives him every opportunity to do so with no distractions (no music, dark set with only faces illuminated, nice slow pacing so the dialogue can breathe). When it was all over, I could forgive the minor flaws mentioned above, and I came away impressed and fulfilled.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend ""1900"" if you liked the films ""Copying Beethoven"", ""Shine"" and of course ""Cinema Paradiso""... It has the same polished style. In many ways it also reminded me of the Herzog film ""Invincible"", a movie that similarly comes across as a little overdone, but as soon as Roth appears everything falls into place."
"samkan","8","1","3","11 June 2008"," Could Have Been So Much More
","This flick is enthralling and makes you both laugh and cry. The original and risk-taking ""plot"" (maybe ""premise"" would be a better word) immediately engage the viewer. The photography is lush, the script jaunty and punchy and the acting superb. Either the rolling piano or duel scenes alone are worth more than many movies in their entirety. But the flaw of 1900 is that we are not given enough to justify 1900's decision to remain on the Virginian. This might have been accomplished by having more scenes with 1900 interacting with the the crew and passengers (instead of just espousing his unexplained insight regarding them). It would have helped immensely too if we could have learned why 1900 developed such passion for the piano, which could have been better developed as an allegory to his life. Please don't get me wrong. If this film had contained the features I desire, it may stand as one of the all time greats. But as it is its merely a wonderful, excellent film."
"abkornegay","10","1","3","16 July 2007"," A movie that needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate
","What a great ""small"" movie. (Small only in the compactness of the story, the presentation and the performances) This movie has a wonderful authentic look...like stepping back into the heyday of the beginnings of jazz as an accepted art form and being one of the participants.<br/><br/>The casting is superb. Tim Roth is so believable as this complex and talented character. Isn't it interesting that - in the end - we only exist in the memories of those who knew us? We are born without a name, we are molded by our environment and those closest to us, succeed (or fail) through our own efforts and strive to die on our own terms.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that 1900 has a moral or a message - but - it does have lessons for all of us. Our life is our ""ship"". Where we sail, how we sail and with whom we sail will define us.<br/><br/>The use of music in this movie is unique. When 1900 plays Silent Night after Jelly Roll Morton's first turn at the piano is the ultimate ""put down"". 1900 has just said: ""Beautiful - but oh so SIMPLE!) The duplication of the second number is the glove to the face.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie was not given proper promotion in the U. S..<br/><br/>I can't wait to use the line: Here, you smoke it, I don't know how!"

"Vincentiu","9","1","3","24 December 2006"," The inside world and his running
","It is not a movie, it is only a slice of life. A Christmas tale with classical honey-cinnamon mixture, with the colors of fall and voices of angels. A legend of a simply travel around the life. But, in monologue and in movie remain the smoke of a nostalgic shadow. A symbol of ashes, a question of another time, a smile of a lost moment. The hero and his travel , his art end his fall, his love and his fear are only pages of the book who lives in each existence. It is a form of fight and a look in the miracle bones. It is the childhood happy in a very old winter. At first view, the director presents same story like in ""Malena"" or ""Paradiso"". The colors, the gestures, the music are pieces of a game with same rules. Tornatore, like everyone, has a personal truth. He said what he believes in the words and images but that truth has roots in every soul. Not a musician is the character, not a form of contemplation is the subject, not a time is the stage. Like Coelho, Giuseppe Tornatore presents, with grace, a world of basic ideas. Pianista may be Kafka or Kavafis, Shakespeare or Mahler. A human shadow who knows that this world is the result of his imagination. It is his dream and his way. His victim and his toy. The inside world and his running."

"jackjack-2","8","1","3","18 August 2002"," Very entertaining
","If one is willing to give great liberties because the movie is  a fairy tale with a message, then it is entertaining though overly long. One of the things I liked about the movie was that there was no nudity or sex or foul language only to discover that it was rated ""R"" for language. I watched it on the Bravo channel so I must have watched a cleaned up version. That was fortunate because if foul language had been used, it would have destroyed the fairy tale quality of the movie. During the period from 1900 to 1940 when the movie took place, foul language was rarely used and it would have detracted from the aurora of authenticity that made the movie go. Had I seen the foul language version I would have rated it much lower.<br/><br/>But it is only an aurora and not reality. The ship, which was built before 1900, would have been out of service by 1920. Coal burning passenger liners were too inefficient to compete with the more modern oil burners, both in cost and speed, and the luxury lounge which was the center of the movie, would have been empty since anyone who could afford to travel luxury class would have travelled on the more modern ships.<br/><br/>The movie needed to be shortened. One scene that could have been left out was the scene when Max and 1900 were careening around the ballroom while playing a piano during a storm. I don't think the scene added anything to the movie and it was too realistic. Anyone who has been on a ship in a storm would find the scene too unbelievable. In the first place Max and 1900 were sitting on a piano bench and the bench and the piano moved in synchronization as if they both connected, which is never going to happen. The much heavier piano is going to leave the bench quickly. Secondly, the piano gracefully swings around pillars. In reality that piano is going to go in a straight line until it crashes. Eventually it does but instead of traveling from side to side of the ball room it goes straight down the center of the ship. That would happen only if the ship made a 90 degree turn into the wind. But the whole point of the scene was to set up a conversation that Max and 1900 have shoveling coal as punishment. The movie did not have to go through that much of a contortion to set up the conversation.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in the movie is near the end when 1900 tells Max why he never left the ship. It was the highlight of the movie but took too long to get there.<br/><br/>The scenes with Jelly Roll Morton were comedic and really part of a fairy tale because no black musician no matter how famous he was would have been allowed to mingle with the luxury class on either an American or British passenger liner."
"leandroff","9","1","3","13 May 2002"," One simple story
","This movie is not great. It's a simple movie, with a simple story and a simple main character - and thats what makes this film so good. It wasn't made to be great and big; it just want to tell the story of a man who was left behind and raised in the Ocean. He never set foot on land and that's the only  thing that makes him special. That and all its consequences. Visually the movie is beautiful and its a proof that special effects have nothing to do with a beautiful image - they are beautiful because you feel it. And it's a story that will make you want to meet the main character in person. The ending is wonderful and it's very well put (so hard to find a good ending these days). Tim Roth is excellent as 1900, but the two biggest actors in this movie are the ""ship"" and the ""ocean"". Both seem to have a life of their own. This is not only a movie that is worth to watch, it's a movie everybody should watch - it's the living proof that a movie doesn't have to be great to be good. In fact, it can be excellent. One last thing - the title in English is not quite beautiful as the original Italian one."
"halvorj","9","1","3","16 February 2002"," A stunning tribute to the imagination
","Director Guiseppe Tornatore and composer Ennio Morricone are the true ""stars"" of this movie. It is not often one is allowed the exquisite pleasure of two geniuses working in tandem. Anyone who knows the true meaning of creative power, or anyone with at least an inkling of curiosity as to the true meaning and potential of the human imagination should feast on this smorgasbord of inspiration. Tim Roth is unforgettable. MÃ©lanie Thierry's enigmatic beauty, I'm sure, is also not easily forgotten. But I do think Pruitt Taylor Vince is miscast in this film.  He does an earnest piece of craftsmanship, but his interpretation of the character Max seems to me to create a dissonance in the movie that I could do without."

I guess it's just the principle of it. I still don't think his reasoning for not getting off the boat was good enough. He was saying ""How could you pick just one girl, one house, one way to die?"" Well it was obvious he had already picked one girl. He also chose his one way to die. So it's obviously not too hard for him to choose with so many infinite possibilities.

","Although it is overly long and drags at times, I found the movie very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the music. The cast is made up of no names who previously played only bit roles. It is a low budget movie but the scenery is usually authentic. Because the story is a fantasy, viewers have to overlook the unrealities. Such is how did 1900 learn to play the piano as well as he did without leaving the ship. My mother was a concert pianist and a music teacher and I learned to play the piano. To play a piano as well as 1900 required some extensive music lessons in order to master the keyboard as well as he did.<br/><br/>
I have to hand it to Tim Roth. He did a marvelous job of playing the piano although it is unlikely that he actually played the music.<br/><br/>

","For myself, I've read every single comment on this film - took me a while (208 to date). Some have made me think deeper about it. Still, I find it one of the most pathos-infused stories-put-to-celluloid I've had the privilege of viewing (please read the book...). If your spirit can't find the uplifting benefit in this film, I'd have to question your personal character, your outlook on life - or your moral turpitude. What's not to like about a ship-born infant whose, ultimately, self-imposed life at sea fosters his world-class musical talent - but which bungles the one, single, opportunity to requite the land-based love of his life?<br/><br/>Beautifully crafted, exquisitely shot, immaculately directed. If you have no ear for the extreme craftsmanship of (Tim Roth's or Clarence William III's) piano, or (Vincent Taylor Pruitt's) trumpet, I'm sorry for you. If you have no eye for divine camera-work, go play a video war-game. And if you can't recognize great acting when you see it then attend a rally for your local politician. But, if you have a sense for the ethereal within real life, an imagination to go with it, and your body still has the ability to produce real tears, then watch this film. It will cleanse you.

"lizdog","6","1","5","3 July 2005"," a strange tale
","This offering from director Giuseppe Tornatore was billed as ""an epic story of a man who could do anything... except be ordinary."" Tim Roth stars as the title character - the spastic, moody pianist who was born and raised on a ship, and named after the year in which he was found. He encounters many unique personages on his travels, most notably the story's narrator, Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The two become fast friends: 1900 teaches Max to find his sea-legs, and Max becomes his most devoted fan. For 1900 is a piano prodigy. He plays beautiful music that no one has ever heard before, inspired by the faces of passengers that he sees. Appropriately, his most gorgeous piece is written when he catches sight of the woman he is destined to love. There's only one problem: he refuses to set foot on dry land.<br/><br/>The film is, basically, a fantasy. A grown-up's fairy tale. Not for a moment do I believe that any of this could ever happen, and neither did all the critics who gave it negative reviews. This kind of movie is acceptable, perhaps, in Europe. Not in America. Our critics demand realism, and their usual beef with any given film is the ""unrealistic"" happenings, or ""plot holes"". But it's The Legend of 1900 for a reason...it isn't real, and we're not meant to believe that it is. In order for this type of story to work, the characters must be compelling enough to carry a fantastical tale. Films like Goldfinger and Ocean's 11 have banked on this before, and we've become used to such hijinks in the action/adventure genre. But an unbelievable drama? There's no question that Roth's 1900 is fascinating. Charmingly neurotic, he endures the ribbing of his friends and enemies with Bogartesque grace. The character of Max Tooney is meant to be the duller companion to his genius: the Watson to his Holmes, the Robin to his Batman. Unfortunately Vince's performance leaves something to be desired, and his character is given little to do. He plays the trumpet well and (reportedly) tells a great story, but he lacks the charisma needed in a sidekick. When 1900's home ship, The Virginian, is destined to be destroyed, Max embarks on a quest to find 1900 and save him from the explosion. This search spans the whole film, intercut with flashbacks to the many voyages of Max and 1900. The ending is predictable. In fact, each moment in the film is predictable, with one exception. Almost every single plot point is shamelessly foreshadowed at least once, and I found myself wondering wearily how long it would take to reveal each ""twist"". Maybe it's the American in me. I just wanted to see stuff get blown up.<br/><br/>The one truly interesting scene is the ""piano duel"" between 1900 and jazz sensation Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). You find yourself as bewildered by 1900's behavior as are the passengers...what is he doing? Why? When will he finally show Jelly Roll who's boss? In spite of yourself, you really want this strange young sea-bound man to win. You like him. What's not to like? But liking a character isn't always enough to carry a film. Such is the case here. In the end, you realize that you never really had any vested interest in 1900 or his fate. He's interesting to look at, but his magic lasts only as long as his fingers play."
"Jeffreybar","7","1","5","10 March 2005"," Incredibly Uneven...
","In some respects, I found this movie to be highly frustrating. There are a couple of stunningly beautiful scenes in this movie (such as the stormy-piano scene) and the duel between Jelly Roll Morton and 1900 is great. Tim Roth plays his character with pathos and charm, and whenever he has a speaking part, he dominates the screen (particularly notable is the discussion he and Max have near the end of the movie). Finally, the piano music is just wonderful, start to finish.<br/><br/>But, some of this movie is highly clichÃ©d, particularly some of the dialog -- which is surprising, considering just how philosophical and wonderful some of the other dialog is. There are some pretty gaping plot holes (and I don't consider myself to be a plothole-seeking pedant by any stretch of the imagination...they're just really hard to miss). And honestly, the acting by pretty much everyone *but* Tim Roth is pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>What to say? It's hard to reconcile all this. This is both of one the most beautiful and most irritating films I've seen in a long time. I give it an 7/10 because the beautiful parts are so beautiful, but I could easily have given it a 4/10 because the flawed parts are so flawed. It's no Cinema Paradiso, but I'd say it's worth watching in spite of its flaws."

","The basic idea of this film, someone who is born on a ship and never leaves it during his entire life seems interesting.  However, the film, to me at least turned out to be a crashing bore, through which I fidgeted, fell asleep once, and turned on the display several times on the DVD player to see how much time was left.<br/><br/>The main character, the ship's pianist (just where he learned to play the piano, as well as how he got whatever education he had while never leaving the ship is unexplained) is evidently quite adept at jazz and cocktail music - viewers fond of these musical styles will have a lot to hold their attention through most of the film.  As for me, the heavy-handed dialog, ""meaningful"" pauses and ""deep meanings"" made this one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The replica of a World War I vintage ocean liner was very good, however.<br/><br/>One point, the initial timing of 160 minutes as contrasted with the actual time of 125 minutes, and the fact that the notes on the DVD box caution parents that the film shows a woman's breasts, while I did not see any, leads me to believe that the film was cut.

To say the truth, there's some problems along the way; some scenes are a bit too long, like the duel between 1900 and Jelly Morton and Roth gives a cold and undeveloped performance in the lead role. Otherwise, the movie is a original view over some primal questions like the meaning of life, the substance of the being and the destiny of a man in a world too much complicated and unfriendly, but never in a Bergman amplitude.

","This is a whimsical yet poignant portrait of a man who has spent his entire life aboard a steamship traversing the Atlantic, earning his stay as one of the ship's musicians after he was raised by a crewman on board and left with no place else to go after his benefactor died in an unfortunate accident. It's at times fanciful and capricious, and at other times emotionally wrenching. Much of the story is told through the recollection of Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a trumpet player with the steamer Virginian, who formed a friendship and bond with the pianist who came to be known as 1900, having been born on the first day of that year. In hindsight and a series of flashbacks, Max recalls his association with 1900 (Tim Roth) and their adventures at sea, and how the enigmatic pianist maintained his resolve to remain captive to the Virginian's spell over the many years. A couple of noteworthy scenes entertained this viewer, the first being the playful sequence in which 1900 plays the piano in a grand ballroom during a storm, during which the careening piano eventually crashes through a huge wall of glass and into a passenger's stateroom. The other was the apparently intense competition between 1900 and jazz great Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) for musical supremacy among the ship's passengers. Wonderfully filmed , I was particularly taken with a scene in which 1900 wistfully stares out of one of the ship's windows after he tries to disembark but is unable to, due to his attachment to the Virginian. Using a truly original and clever technique, the rain outside the ship creates a slight stream of water to run along 1900's face simulating a tear from his right eye. The effect was very evocative of the way 1900 was feeling at the time, and a credit to the cinematographer for coming up with such a unique device. In it's own way, the scene foretold that there would be no happy ending to this tale of lost love and friendship, being more a character study defining the way someone has chosen to live their life with no attachments and no place to call home."

What's more, I got lost in thoughts such as ""land represents for a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end"", ""does it really meaningful for us to chase the world not belong to our own?"" To be frank, that's a matter of debate. As to me, I will choose the same way as 1900. Also there are some words impressed me deeply. For instance, ""in all sprawling city there was everything except an end ""<br/><br/>As my honest speaking, there is no boring moment from the beginning till the very end. It's the greatest feast of emotions!"

","This quirky and memorable journey is not so much a story as a sensual experience, exquisitely filmed with several unbelievable but joyous musical sequences. The Legend of 1900 is a strange tale, for sure, of a piano prodigy who has never had a lesson, a man born and left on a luxury liner and, as the years pass, who fears leaving the safety of his safe haven. How much better to stay safely on the sea than venture out into what some might call The Real World! <br/><br/>Many of the formal critics cringed at the film's immersion into sentiment, but that's part and parcel of this glorious evocation of the magic of music, an immersion in a never-was-but-wish- there-was--past. Several long talky sequences go on far too long for the film to be a unalloyed joy from start to finish, but this distinctive floating world is still a wonder if you don't expect guns and sex and rock and roll."

","When you consider this was, I believe, made in the same year as Titanic but only on a budget of nine million dollars as opposed to 200 million, what stunning achievement. What a great story, a man who didn't exist and in the end a sad ending. I think one of the greatest surprises was Tim Roth actually playing. I used to be a pianist on three cruise ships and faking playing like that is impossible. The music is wonderful, Morricone never fails for me and the scenes were lush and truly grand. In a lot of ways I think this movie is far superior to Titanic. Due to the sometimes salty language it can only be for adults, that said I would recommend it to anyone, good solid entertainment."
"tianqiluo49","10","0","3","30 March 2013"," The most underrated on IMDb I can think of..
","It seemed that this movie is rather inconspicuous in America. However, in my country, China, it received its due credit. It's somehow very much appreciated by Chinese fans, even more than the Godfather. A friend of mine was a pianist, he was recommending this movie to me all along. I watch the beginning and found it interesting, but my schedule hindered me from watching the whole movie. Yesterday I caught a glimpse at the TV show Lie to me and found the exact actor on that show: Tim Roth. The show really reminded me of this movie so I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did, and I regret leaving the DVD aside for so many years.<br/><br/>The movie was about a child/prodigy, left on a ship by an supposed immigrant family, was adopted by a stoker. From the stoker, the boy established the notion that the ship was everything to him{(everything outside the Virginian is bad). Tragically, the stoker was later killed in an accident, leaving the boy an orphan. Being on the ship long enough, the boy fostered a great interest on piano. By watching the pianists play, he became spontaneously proficient at playing the instrument. The night the stoker was buried(thrown overboard), he sneaked into the ball room and played an improvised sad piece, a piece which attracted passengers all over the ship(including the captain)to listen. Later, the boy grew up, playing the piano on the ship all his life. It was not until he was 27 that he met his lifelong friend: a trumpeter named Max Tooney. Although he became a legend on the ship because of his music, he never set foot on land, let alone starting a life there. <br/><br/>Watching this movie, I never bothered to check the clock even though it was close to midnight. My eyes were glued to every scene. The direction was perfect. I loved the idea of having Max on the voice-over, it increased the sense of epic and enhanced the consistency of the movie. Of course, the lovely piano pieces help to shed light on the scenes as well. Whenever you have exhausted your attention span, the music emerges, snapping you back into the movie. There are scenes that are still memorable even 15 years today. I.e., the scene which 1990 took Max on a fantastic piano ride in order to rid him of his seasickness. The piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton. The scene which 1900 saw a beautiful lady and played a beautiful piano piece for him. Oh God, those scenes were so lovely. I could watch them again and again without getting bored. You really should give the composers credit for writing such beautiful music. <br/><br/>As for the acting, this movie was also top-notch. Tim Roth gave possibly the best performance in his career. Before I saw him on the DVD cover, I gave my doubts. I doubted if he could handle a character so elegant and noble, as he was used to playing villains and lowlifes all the time. His debut in the film erased all my doubts. He was charismatic and esoteric. His eyes showed you his crave for music and his sense of belonging to the ship. His emotion showed his willingness to connect with other people off the ship even though it was a lost cause. Finally, his performance peaked at the scenes with the girl. He really showed his passion for the girl although he was a shy person in nature. At times, I resonated with him. I was also a shy boy once and the always stalk the girls I desire and watch them from afar. In the end, it was his performance in the last scene that really stunned me. Originally, I thought it was kinda lame for him not to go overboard(no pun intended). However, his explanation to Max in the later scene allowed me not only to resonate with him, but also share a few tears for him. My emotion can only be manipulated by Tim's perfect performance.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think Pruitt Vince Taylor gave a crappy performance. His emotion was so stiff..No wonder no one's hiring him anymore. In the last scene when he was supposed to be sad by 1900, I think his face expressed disdain instead of sadness. The guy's surely gotten his facial expressions all messed up. <br/><br/>For those who haven't seen this movie, I strongly recommend you to watch it. This is simply an amazing movie and Top 10 on my list on par with movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you, have some backbone for you own opinion. If it's any consolation, on Douban(a Chinese movie website equivalent to IMDb), it received a high score of 9.1 and currently ranks 8 on Douban Top 250."

"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","1","27 March 2008"," A visually rich, thematically unique, but ultimately flawed piece of work
","Although no one would argue that the plot here isn't completely original, the actual film is still incredibly flawed, even to the extent that by the time film reaches the halfway mark the story had become dull and the pacing laborious. Clearly, Tim Roth is a fine actor who has impressed in the likes Made in Britain (1980), Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and it is to his credit somewhat that the film survives as long as it does, but I have to honestly admit that the best parts of the film are the earlier sequences that revolve around the child version of Novecento (the character that Roth plays), who's wide-eyed sense of wonder and mystique leads him up into the ship and to the grand piano so central to the plot.<br/><br/>Alongside the interesting plot and unconventional character there are some fine performances from the supporting cast, as well as some particularly strong emotional themes, such as the ideas of loneliness and the class divide, but for me, the film really struggled to keep itself going with the short scope of the running time or the rushed, unfinished feeling found in many of the individual scenes. Admittedly, I have not seen any other Tornatore films, despite the amount of critical praise that his Cinema Pardiso (1988) has been given, but it seems that with this film he's either compromised his vision in order to appeal to a more mainstream American audience or simply, I've seen some horribly truncated, studio re-cut (which could be the case, as it would seem that Tornatore has been badly treated by US/UK distributors in the past, who insist on cutting his films down to more easily digestible running times). If this is the case, then I sincerely apologise, but even so; I'm not sure I can imagine a film of this scope working at anything less than a suitably epic four-hour running time, akin to something like Bernardo Bertolucci's similarly set historical piece, 1900 (1976).<br/><br/>As you could expect, the cinematography throughout is impeccably beautiful, employing haunting shots of the ocean liner drifting out of the fog like a ghost to create an entirely alien world reminiscent of Fellini's great work And the Ships Sails On (1982). The production design is also remarkable, and the attention to detail that Tornatore and his crew have put into the film is second to none, but for me, the film just failed to maintain that sense of momentum over such a short duration. The Legend of 1900 (1998) is still an interesting, remarkable beautiful looking film, but one that I feel fails to deliver on its epic potential. It is elevated somewhat by the aforementioned photography, the haunting score from Enio Moerricone and the commendable performances from Roth, Bill Nunn and the underrated Pruitt Taylor Vince."

","It's no wonder about the story character: T.D. bored in an improper way again. Improper boring place and time let such genius to be in inevitable destiny.<br/><br/>As there was a period of US imagination from Europe, most of the people had a mind set that the dream to New York indicated a pathway for wealth. However, it's make a strong contrast of such infinity desire, seems no one revealed that it let them to fall in a nightmare rather than a sweet dream. Only those elites (actually T.D. was named as 1900, also implied the Caucasians were so superstitious even after the period of enlightenment) were sober enough and not be chanted.<br/><br/>What T.D. experienced and then achieved to be a legend, was about how to overcome those temptations, in which there were 2 life crossovers, determining he would be an ordinary or extraordinary.<br/><br/>First, he was so calm to regard reputation and wealth, knew that success was not be measured by such a way. It was a memorable competition with the Musician: Father of Jazz, who was noted and rich, while compared with T.D. and Max (no one knew such hidden guy, and Max was so poor who sold his trumpet later), people should regard the anterior to have a recognizable identification. However, a Black suffered the impact so shocking, after being defeated, was due to his previous ""success. Without an extreme attention on the power and reputation, he knew ""no one will be number one all the time"", and hence got a positive feedback from the interflow with T.D, rather than treating it as a competition.<br/><br/>The other incident was am barrier that everyone fails in it: Love. Many philosophers have mentioned before that Love could not be explained reasonably when someone falls in it. The involver will be very confused and does various silly thing until they have been escaped. In the case of T.D. he was definitely fell in love, but he could still defense for his personal living principle. Only passing such hard tests can be promoted to a holy level in the life. (notice that in ""Cinema Paradiso"", Love was highly admirable and it was worth scarifying a lot by accomplishing it, such contrast made in ""The legend of 1900"", probably being intended arranged by the director and producer.<br/><br/>Although the destiny of T.D. was so unfortunate, it was colorful and meaningful to others. His last joke told to Max, clearly concluded a ridiculous world: he said if he was broken after the ship explored, can let his right arm connected back, but may mis-attached on left shoulder, made him to be abnormal. Such indication about the mis-match of his born and growth on the marine and abnormal (even as a genius) was not valuable, he would rather to be ordinary and live on land, like normal people: marriage, organizing a family with children, no surprise of such live but worth living..<br/><br/>Finally, I want to point out those scenes' that impressed me most. The initial one was the performance of T.D. versed the Jazz Musician. The magic playing of T.D. was presented in various cut-in between his face, the piano keys, chord, and his multi-hands. His sweating was also be charm in such a way. With the aid of the semi-dissolving transition, as well as the cut-away shots of the response, gestures of those audiences (include the musician), such excellent magic was shocked by twice in our eyes.<br/><br/>The other scene was about T.D. landing. When he got ready ashore, the freeze medium close up was stable, peaceful, without any background music. Such silence let T.D. made a crucial decision. Then he threw away his hat implied abandoning those mind set (i.e. human desire when facing such a highlight city), he would be chanted by a material world, and what he hardly got: love with girl. The director tried to minimize any effects on that scene, whilst was unforgettable for most of the audiences, like me."

It had beautiful characters, elegant and inspiring music, and a story that was a psychological and musical thriller. Woody Allen would call it weird city, but it might as well have been written by him. It has the same melancholy tint and strange attitudes that make a Woody Allen film a classic. But to me this was better than all but a few of his movies. <br/><br/>So all I ask is that you give this movie a chance.

Everyone chooses how big a world to live in, what archways to pass through. Some people never leave their home town, others travel the globe. The protagonist of this story chooses to live out his life aboard the ship he was born on, traveling the world, albeit inside an iron shell. His reasons for refusing to leave are eloquently articulated in one of the final scenes of the film. ""1900"" is a sort of Holden Caulfield, his sensitivity seemingly too refined, too delicate to venture out among the trammeling horde. Aesthetically, this film has it all, great music, decor, imaginative staging, fine acting.

","With ""The Legend of 1900"" Giuseppe Tornatore is presenting one most imaginative, poetic, expressive and intriguing piece of great art work about music, talent, friendship, love, compassion but also fears. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, set at the turn of the 20th century, the director creates with love and admiration the scenes of thousands of people who come on ship to America, full of hope, courage and sense of adventure. They get hastily from the ship to step on the long awaited land. It is hard to forget the face of the boy in whose irises the silhouette of New York was reflecting. I do not recall seeing more powerful image of anticipation in person's eyes in films. <br/><br/>Then trough flashback  the contrast to that excitement of the unknown is presented.<br/><br/>The large transatlantic liner ""The Virginian "" has a secret: there is a boy born and hidden on board. The boy becomes a man, a brilliant piano player, involved deeply in the beautiful music he creates for the entertainment of the guest - rich and poor. His emotional understanding of people expands beyond the ordinary. He creates musical vignettes on the piano about men and women who surround him, and his music reflects amazingly the person character or thoughts at the moment. While this extraordinary musician is blessed with the gift to create unheard beautiful music for the pleasure of his audience as the world comes to him, his life is very uneventful and solitary. Most of the time he is pensive or appears longing, but not sad, as his music is usually very uplifting. However, he is bound to the sheep as a child to his mother and cannot overcome the fear of leaving it. Even the prospect of visiting the girl who sweeps him with her beauty and kindness is not motivating enough to make him step on the mainland. This most creative and extraordinary man is frozen in some fears of the unexpected that change can bring. He runs frantically and hides from the people who came to ask him to a piano duel. Perhaps of his unusual upbringing  forced to hide from everyone in the bottom of the ship during the first eight years of his life his vision about ordinary events is distorted, and he rather hide than face real life, as we know it. Whatever the interpretation may be  literal or symbolic, he is a fascinating character whose image will stay with me forever. At the end he is explaining his wish for a status quo and about being afraid of not what he sees but what he doesn't see. Unfortunately, his inability or refusal to face reality leads to his destruction.<br/><br/>The story, told by his friend, the trumpet player through series of flashbacks is challenging the viewer with the unexpected turns. The highly imaginative scenes about playing the rolling piano (with the brakes off) in the ballroom, while the ship is rocked by the stormy waters, and the tension and exuberance at the piano duel are unforgettable - make me wish I had a chance to be present during their shooting. <br/><br/>Film making has the potential to be the most powerful art of our time and Giuseppe Tornatore has proved again that he can reach these heights and beyond. <br/><br/>Never seen better Tom Roth. The cinematography of Lajos Koltai is breathtaking and the music of Ennio Morricone is amazing, makes you believe the legend. Bravo to all participants. Ten stars of course! <br/><br/>Sorry, I do not relate to the song at the end."

A tragedy could not be avoided. In the end 1900 sank to the sea along with the ship.<br/><br/>Although the storyline was weak, the great piano music was good enough to make it uncommon. I particularly like the following scene. When 1900 played the piano for Max, he created different music for different people with different action and expression.

I can't find proper words to describe it: fantastic, awesome, gripping or even better than those three together, written by Ennio Morricone, the guru of film music! Pay attention to how aptly it matches the scenes in the film. In fact, the music is one of the main characters in the story too.<br/><br/>As for the story itself: well, it can call forth different feelings and interpretations. The story of a man of genius who prefers to confine himself to the small world of a cruise ship and the ocean can induce many a Freudian-like rationales from psychoanalysis aficionados. But it won't leave you feeling indifferent for Tim Roth's fascinating character who combines talent and unpretentiousness, passion and insight into people's souls - the qualities that are the marks of true brilliance.<br/><br/>The directing holds you captivated for more than two hours, letting you savour quite a number of memorable finely orchestrated scenes. My favourite is the piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton. In this episode small nuances help masterfully create the growing suspense, which is one of the best I've ever seen in the movies. <br/><br/>The acting is superb! You can't help but appreciate perfect casting and a slew of outstanding performances. The actors don't act, they live on screen. Now Tim Roth completes the trio of my favourite actors along with Sean Penn and Al Pacino.<br/><br/>This film and Tornatore's second best ""Cinema Paradiso"" are my personal favourites and I highly recommend them to you: <br/><br/>Don't miss the feast of emotions! You won't regret it!"

","My wife and myself are delighted to have seen the film the other evening. Some parts stand out in my memory: the piano sequence in the ballroom; 1900 as a child playing the piano (and his abrupt reply when discovered!); the orchestra conductor's facial expressions ... and so much else. It is certainly one of the highlights of our movie watching.<br/><br/>Tim Roth, in particular, gave so much to this film: he was truly believable in an almost unbelievable role: one could see the possibility of such a character being able to exist in the world in which he found himself. The music was sublime; it could have gone on forever!<br/><br/>It really just goes to show that the Hollywood idea of a great movie simply allows one such as this to be completely overlooked. This happens so often that one can only marvel at the brashness of such an industry...."

","for anyone who has access to this movie i strongly suggest you see it. The music is written and composed by Ennio Morricone, it is remarkable and jaw dropping. Tim Roth plays Nineteen Hundred and is an absolutely stunning performance, one of his very best (and on the contrary to the famous Mr.Orange he played in Reservoir Dogs). This movie is a must see. It is touching, beautiful, moving, and amazing. It is just amazing. It is pure art. It's fairly long but well worth every moment. It's relatively hard to find, but it is well worth purchase. I strongly suggest this movie for those who enjoy musicals, can appreciate a great movie and those who have discovered Tim Roth (who I might say is an extremely good actor). Also,and again, I strongly suggest this movie to any one who has access to it."

","The premise of this movie intrigued me. A man born on an ocean going vessel who lived there all his life? And became a piano virtuoso as well? A bit far fetched, but worth investigating. Tim Roth's character (1900) is enough to keep your interest alone, but the setting of a luxury cruise ship and the early jazz era time period only intensify it. While no scene is without merit, there are several which will move you or make you stand still, as with the Jelly Roll Morton sequence. I am only sorry that this movie came out about the time of ""Titanic"" as it would have taken a few of the awards that year itself. When watching this movie, keep in mind that legends are only that if they are bigger than life and there is no one around to verify the facts."

","I enjoyed this movie so much, I will likely buy it, and I rent, not buy, most DVDs I see. The concept was unique, the story captivating, the acting flawless, the score was haunting, the ship was glorious and hideous all at the same time, as you were carried through. I am half Italian by heritage, so I got pleasure out of reading more about how the film was made, finding stories about it on dedicated websites. Apparently the ship was a Russian vessel pretty much in a salvage state, used for training Russian seamen, when the Italian filmmakers found it, sailed it to Italy, docked it near Rome, and prepared it for the film. I loved that ! It was modeled after the Lusitania and the Mauritania...the ballroom was MARVELOUS,,,and the engine room was frightening ! Like in the Titanic, the classes are neatly divided,,,the richly rich and the very poor, living their lives as they sailed from one continent to the other, according to their state in life...with one exception...""1900"" himself..who lived his own life in his own way from beginning to,,,, There are scenes in the movie that took my breath away...and,no, I won't do spoilers here. You will just have to find the beauty, the joy, the poignancy, and the pathos in this film for yourself. You just don't see this kind of film every day. Personally, I gave it a 10 ! edit: 1) my daughter did give me this film on DVD for Christmas !! 2) I viewed it with a very creative friend of ours, an artist. He was so moved that when the film was over, he breathed a heavy breath and said, ""That may very well be the best movie I've ever seen."" How sweet it is !"

","This is an excellent film I first watched on the STARZ satellite network (via DIRECTV) a few years ago. At the time it was not available on VHS or DVD. Now it is.<br/><br/>It's a gentle film, but often sad, about a child left by a First Class passenger aboard an ocean liner in 1900. The child is found in the ballroom by an engine worker and aptly named ""1900"". He grows up with the delicious ability to play music by ear (without sheet music). (I have never seen anyone play the piano this well before! I wonder who is really playing if it is not him?) He also has his ""sea legs"" and is OK in rough seas when everyone else gets ill. He is befriended by the ship's trumpet player and they become best friends. The scene with jazz great, ""Jelly Roll"" Morton is especially notable.<br/><br/>I don't want to say more about this film because it will spoil it for you; - suffice to say it is one of the best films I have ever viewed.

For one thing, I used to play the trumpet and still play piano a bit and the way the characters play is amazing. The piano duel is about on par with the famous guitar duel from ""Crossroads"" (Steve Vai and Ry Cooder). There are a number of good laughs in this too. Particularly the famous gaining the sea legs scene with Max and 1900. That just about had me on the floor laughing. The cigarette on the piano scene was also memorable. The ending was a big tear-jerker though. This is a good film for couples to watch together, just have a box of tissues on standby at the end. I give this one a perfect 10/10 a must rent movie."

First, and most important is you have to get right mood to see it.The movie is not like usual Hollywood movie, it is actually a sort of European movie style, delicate but a little bit slow. So, you got to have a peaceful mood, and seeing it at night alone will be better. Second, enjoy the music, the jazz in the movie as much as you can, they are great and touching. Third, do not think the logic during seeing the movie. Take the movie as a story, make yourself sunk into the essence of it. During looking at the movie, I found Max got some disease on his eyes.

Layoffs after 25 years at the same job. Loss of a spouse after decades of marriage.  Yet we move on.

In the period in between (3 years) we were surprised that it didn't get a more notable reception on the independent film circuit.  The skillful cinematography made some of the scenes-- with the workers in the belly of the ship, the narrator's ""getting his sea legs"" scene with the piano in the ballroom, the dual between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton, and others-- so memorable that seeing it again was like homecoming.  Although the narrator was a less than stellar choice and the ""romance"" was eye-rolling bad, I recommend this for any collector."
"musikundfilm","Null","0","1","9 August 2002"," Magical but Overlong
","It was interesting to see the range of responses to this film. I liked the first 60 % of it, then became increasingly restless, because the director failed to sustain the often magical tone of his ""fable."" As some other viewers noted, the best scenes revolve around the child 1900 as he is adopted by the crew of the Virginian; the scene in which 1900 as a young man careens giddily around the ballroom, seated at his piano during a storm at sea, is also really inspired. And I also agree with those who praised the openly sentimental, over-the-top emotional expressivity of this Italian director. Plus, he shares Fellini's skill at choosing wonderful faces for momentary closeups in a crowd.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly when I began to lose interest. It may have been during the piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton. There is always a danger when a fabulist pulls in actual historical figures: the real person may have been more interesting than the screen character as presented. This is definitely the case with Morton, who was indeed a braggart and musical bully -- but also a man of enormous humor and savoir-faire. Clarence Williams III isn't given much to work with, and the whole scene reeks of one more white-guys-actually-CAN-jump moment in Hollywood films. Also, bravo to those who pointed out that the deference with which Morton is treated by passengers, barkeep, etc., is jarringly at odds with actual attitudes toward American blacks during the time -- even if you were a famous jazz musician.<br/><br/>Once 1900 tries to make himself leave the ship, and fails, the movie gets very tedious. The director simply cannot match the whimsy and overall imaginative quality of the preceding scenes. We get way too much of the trumpet player's rueful efforts, too much self-explanation at the very end by 1900 himself, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Tornatore has recently released a ""director's cut"" version of his Cinema Paradiso that adds over a half hour of time to that movie -- it's putting people to sleep in a theater near you! So maybe The Legend of 1900 would have benefitted from having a ""suit"" hanging around during the editing process telling him Giuseppe, you made the film too long."

","How does one explain what his soul feels ? how does one explain the feeling you get when waking up from a beautiful dream ? The one who could do that could also explain this experience that is called The Legend of 1900, I lack the words but I will try ...<br/><br/>The movie in a nutshell is extremely simple, it tells a story about a child who was abandoned on a liner, the Virginian, that sails between Europe and America, and how he grew up in the bowels of this steel giant he called home, it tells the story how he found music, it tells the story how he embraced the music so much that he in all practical sense became one with it. It tells a story about a man who never left this ship he called home, who saw the world pass him by 2000 passengers at the time. You could call this movie a fable, an extremely beautiful insight to someones soul. The execution of this movie is flawless, Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince give excellent performances and Clarence Williams III is most glorious in his portrayal of Jelly Roll Morton, a pianist who supposedly invented jazz and comes to challenge 1900 to a piano duel. Director Giuseppe Tornatore and cinematographer Lajos Koltai weave an utterly beautiful world where the story takes place, the visual beauty is unmatched, it's just astonishing. One way to enjoy The legend of 1900 is to turn the picture off and just listen, Ennio Morricone's music is an essential part of this movie and is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in it's own rights. The director does what very few have done before, all the pieces fit, perfect visuals, stunning music, superb cast, infact I would go so far that I would say I cant find anything wrong about this movie, except it ends.<br/><br/>Granted that this is not a movie for persons who enjoy action and big explosions above anything else, but anyone who can watch this piece of cinematic genius with an open mind will encounter something really special.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of 1990's if not the best."

","I love music; I admire the work of Ennio Morricone. I love good cinematography and the Hungarian films of cinematographer Lajos Koltai have long appealed to me. It is perhaps natural that the first film I have seen of Guiseppe Tornatore that involves Morricone and Koltai should appeal to me.<br/><br/>But in retrospect, the film grabbed me because the appeal of the film went beyond Morricone and Koltai. The performances of Tim Roth, Vince, Williams and Nunn were arresting. Roth's British accent at the end was annoying (who could have contributed that to 1900 when the character grew up on the ship?) but otherwise both Roth and Vince played very convincing roles. The casting is commendable--especially when some of the players are not very famous.<br/><br/>There were certain sequences that Koltai and Tornatore can be truly proud of: playing the rolling piano on a ship swaying to choppy seas and the engine room sequence with Nunn and the child.  <br/><br/>Most of all, the marketing of the film as a fable, which it is, has its own charm. I particularly loved the song at the end of the film ""written"" by Morricone --or is it wrongly credited?-- and sung by Pink Floyd's ex-lead singer. Don't miss it as it captures the story in the song as the credits roll by. <br/><br/>This is a very European film, which is probably the reason it has not been given the recognition that it deserves in the US. I strongly recommend this film to many of my friends who have not seen it. Tornatore, Koltai and Morricone weave magic together."

","Giuseppe Tornatore has given us a stunning masterpiece.  Only beauty deserves to last; that is both my comment about what the film is about and a comment on the film itself.  Words fail me to even begin to describe what I felt while watching this film on DVD.  Tim Roth was the ideal choice. What a great actor!<br/><br/>Even if you don't agree with my enthusiasm, you will surely agree that the music alone is worth it.<br/><br/>I have one negative comment however.  The version we are given on DVD 'only' has 125 minutes, whereas the original film's duration was 160 minutes. How come ?  Never did 125 minutes go by so quickly..."

","The Legend of 1900 is an epic story of a man who lives his entire life within a ship, but also a story about music, hope, friendship, passion, and despair, and about the fear of facing the unknown.<br/><br/>The story takes place mostly on board of The Virginian, a luxurious ocean-steamer used to take Italian immigrants to New York, and is told through the memories of a trumpet player who is the main character's best friend.<br/><br/>On the first day of 1900, while carefully searching the first class after anything of value, Danny (Bill Nunn), an employee of the ship, finds a newborn baby in a box on the piano. He keeps the boy secretly hidden, and calls him `Danny Boodman TD Lemon Nineteen Hundred', 1900 for short. Eight years later, after Danny's, death, the boy finds the piano and plays incredibly well, much to everyone's amazement, becoming the pianist of the ship.<br/><br/>Several years later Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) joins the ship's orchestra. On his first night there is a storm and he becomes terribly seasick. 1900 (Tim Roth in a great performance) approaches him and invites him to sit by his side at the piano while he plays. As the waves rock the ship and the piano slides around the ball room, 1900 doesn't even seem to notice and continues to play. They end up crashing into a glass wall and into the Captain's cabin. This is on of the best scenes of the movie, and the beginning of a strong friendship.<br/><br/>Once, while playing the Tarantella for the Italian immigrants, someone spots the Statue of Liberty and they all run to see, leaving 1900 alone. More than once does Max try to convince him to get out of the ship and feel the new experience, but 1900 seems to fear the unknown, and stays inside.<br/><br/>Nineteen Hundred shows an amazing skill in the piano, being able to play any kind of music. His music truly comes from his heart, considering that he has never learnt how to play. While playing in a ball, 1900 suddenly changes the rhythm of the music, according to his impressions on each passenger. He appears to understand everyone's soul.<br/><br/>His fame quickly spreads, and even the father of Jazz, a proud man called Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), goes on board to challenge him on the piano. 1900 does not take the challenge seriously at first, but after a while he finally plays with passion, so brilliantly that everyone listens in absolute silence, almost paralyzed, and even the Jazz whiz becomes astonished. It is Max's best scene, as he (who has bet a whole year's salary on his friend 1900) goes from despair to ecstasy.<br/><br/>Because of 1900's refusal in leaving the ship, a recording is planned to take place there. As he plays, he notices a young woman observing him. Inspired by her youth and beauty, he composes the sweetest song ever made, but when told of the success and fame he will surely achieve, 1900 fears the possibility of leaving the ship and decides to keep the record from the world.<br/><br/>Finding himself in love, 1900 becomes determined to offer the record to the girl who inspired it, but fails as she disembarks, leaving him behind. After a long period of loneliness, 1900 announces his decision of leaving the ship, surprising the whole crew, but changes his mind and returns before even touching the ground.<br/><br/>Years pass by. Max leaves the ship and they lose contact. Several years later Max goes into a second hand music store to sell his old trumpet and runs into 1900's record. He becomes aware of the ship's fate: it is ready to be blown up. Max narrates 1900's story as an attempt to save him, for he has no doubt of him still being on the ship. He is finally allowed to search inside The Virginian, and finds his lonely friend there, but is unable to convince him to leave the condemned ship.<br/><br/>The last dialogue is very touching. 1900 tells Max the reason why he never set forth to leave the ship. Opposing the piano, which is a concrete element with a definite size, the land is never-ending. 1900 is afraid of the abstract, of whatever he cannot control. While on the ship there are few options, on the streets there are infinite possibilities, and 1900 finds this insane. Land is a ship too big for him to control. He finally states that, as he doesn't exist to the world, the world will not exist for him. Deeply sad, Max leaves the ship without his friend.<br/><br/>1900 is portrayed by Tim Roth, who fits so well in the character that it is impossible to imagine someone else in his place. 1900 is an enigmatic pianist whose world is the ship where he has always lived. He has a natural and extraordinary talent for music, but is refrained from leaving the ship by an unconscious fear of exploring new horizons. We learn about 1900's legend from his best friend Max, a chubby trumpet player who refuses to accept his reluctance to step in dry land. He constantly brings up the subject, but does not succeed in changing 1900's mind.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes reveal a meticulous reproduction of the beginning of the twentieth century. The music is delightful, and without a doubt the highlight of the movie. The sound effects are perfect, particularly the wind and the waves, sounding like a real ship. The direction also contributed for the great quality of the film: the scenes are harmoniously presented, and it is almost possible to imagine ourselves as one of the immigrants as they see the Statue of Liberty for the first time. In fact, the first scene is a masterpiece, setting the mood for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The Legend of 1900 has certainly surpassed my expectations, turning to be an interesting and captivating movie, for what I truly recommend it."

","Once upon a time a wonderful film was beautifully crafted and the most exquisite music lovingly composed and perfectly played. How sad it was so sparsely seen on the big screens of the world, perhaps as it makes the cable circuit on our smaller screen more people will be able to see it and love it as I do. Many who are lucky enough to see it will certainly want to add it to their collection on VHS or DVD. Suspend your rational thinking, turn up the sound and let this film take you away to grand time on a grand ship full of unforgettable scenes and endearing characters. The amazing Tim Roth gives a fine performance as 1900, with the naivety and innocence one would expect of a person who has spent his life on a ship and has no real life experiences other than by observance of ever changing passengers who he grandly entertains. Pruitt Taylor Vince is perfect in his role as 1900's friend and the narrator of the story. Every actor seems perfectly chosen for their roles. If you would like to really enjoy a movie this is the one. Made to be exactly as advertise "" a Fable"" on a grand scale and a most unforgettable one."

We cared so deeply for the character 1900, in spite of his flaws, or perhaps because of them and by the end, we were moved to tears.<br/><br/>We rarely watch today's movies...I, in particular, am devoted to the old movies...so I was glad to see that someone still makes a film with multi-level characters you can care about and an interesting storyline."

","Giuseppe Tornatore's ""The Legend Of 1900"" is truly one of the best films to be released during the 1990's.  It's the story about a piano player who has an endless freedom of expression, and that freedom he has is such a force - but it has boundaries.  The boundaries of the life that 1900 (Tim Roth) has only can be reached by those who come aboard the ship he is on.  It's an extraordinary film about how some people have such a meaningful life, yet there are boundaries on how far their freedom of expression can be reached. This is truly one of Giuseppe Tornatore's best films.  Right up there with ""Cinema Paradiso""."

","I didn't know what to expect when I rented this one, but wow, what a film! To me it's a modern tale about a man (1900) who wants to be ordinary, but just can't be ordinary. Production design, photography are all first grade and Tim Roth's character is perfectly played by him. <br/><br/>My favourite scene is the one with the contest and the cigarette lightened on the strings of the piano. Also a terrific scene is the one where 1900 plays the piano during a storm a 'drives' through the ballroom. It's so unbelievable, but so incredibly shot!<br/><br/>1900's final monologue... Just two thumbs up for Tim Roth, who grabs the viewer at the throat at that moment. It's just so dramatic. In drama, this one overrules Cameron's Titanic (another film which is set on a ship in the beginning of this century).<br/><br/>I give this one 9 out of 10."

Although there were some titanicly weepy scenes I didn't like, I could forget about them, because of the others. I think, the film's power is in small things. In little parts(for example the sleighing piano and the duel), pictures, solutions, ideas, and of course, the music. Tim Roth does well again, not to mention the photographer, Koltai Lajos.

","This magnificent metaphoric film is not for everyone.  It is poetic and symbolic and therefore not to be seen in the usual literal narrative terms...which may confound some. For me it was a lyrical and profound cinematic experience, by far the best film of 1998.  An infant is found on a ship (already a mythic theme) and lives his entire life aboard this ocean liner, named ""1900"" after the year he was born.  As an adult he has a prodigious talent as a pianist...a natural...performing in the ship's dining saloon for passengers (in the 20s and 30s...marvelous authentic costuming). Tornatore's writing and direction, its imaginative images, the development of the character of the artist as a visionary, an outsider are remarkable and courageously innovative, never a trite or easy depiction.In general terms (though without the humor) ""The Horse's Mouth"" comes to mind, another brilliant evocation of the outsider artist (more direct and less philosophic than""The Legend"").  If you haven't seen it, and love this sort of film, by all means, rent it!!!"

","This film is a very original story about a piano prodigy, who is born on a ship, and will never in his life set foot on the mainland. In a crucial (and very emotional) key scene, he explains that the reason that he will never disembark, is that he can fully grasp the life on the ship, but he is very much afraid of the vastness of the outside world. The idea of all the streets in New York out there, and all the unknown possibilities and many new facets of life just terrify him, and he is willing to die instead of confronting potentially immense and incalculable consequences he isn't prepared (and most importantly, doesn't WANT) to get involved with.<br/><br/>I strongly felt there was a clear parallel with the contemporary developments in technology and science, which proceed in a horrific pace. The enormous amount of information and data in our present world, the head-spinning inundation of bits and bytes makes life all the more complicated. It is truly dazzling, and more importantly, it could drive human beings with a sensitive nature insane.<br/><br/>But apart from the rather pessimistic undertone this brilliant story renders, let's not forget that parts of the film are hilarious, like the surprisingly slapstick-like scene of the main character, yet again an impressive role of Tim Roth by the way, and the trumpettist played by Pruitt Taylor Vince, sitting together at the ""wave-stricken"" piano...<br/><br/>Also, last but not least, the jazz-contest bit is haunting, thrilling, and in some weird way quite emotive.<br/><br/>A magical, epic, and above all, AUTHENTIC masterpiece."

","It would be wonderful if this movie eventually finds its way into the multiplexes, the way Life Is Beautiful did last year.  But somehow I doubt it....the studio seems to have little hope for it because of its overseas reputation.  A shame because it's yet another fine addition to 1999's list of thoughtful, challenging movies.  It is inevitably being compared to Titanic, if only because of its setting (ocean liner in the early part of the century).  The film has more in common with Fellini than Cameron (viewers who have been disgusted with the film's visuals and sentiments seem to have forgotten why we go to movies in the first place).  The scenes are slightly surreal and always fascinating.  The delivery of the dialogue is a bit stilted, especially by the actor who played Max, but Tim Roth is a talented actor and makes the most of it (especially during his final, impassioned speech at the end).  No surprise that this was made by the director of Cinema Paradiso.  Both films are presented primarily in flashbacks, both have a romantic feel, and both deal with an amazing, unexpected friendship.  Definitely worth checking out."
