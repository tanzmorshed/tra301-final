","Recently a friend of mine watched ""The Beach"" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. ""Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome""). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie."
"ecwjedi","8","255","321","14 June 2005"," The Beach WILL NOT DIE TODAY
","The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today."

","American back packer Richard is one of millions of travellers all looking for an unique experience.  When in Bangkok he meets the slightly deranged Daffy who leaves him with stories and a map to a beach on a remote island that can't be seen from the sea.  Taking with him 2 French travellers, Richard sets out to reach the island and finds it inhabited by a mix of people living as a small ideallic community.  However internal conflicts rise up with their arrival and a copy of the map that he gave to some friends threaten to expose the paradise community for it's darker roots.<br/><br/>While I know that the critics were a little hard on this film when it came out, my main reason for not going to see it was a feeling of total apathy towards it.  I wasn't interested in the story, have never read the book and didn't feel I had to see it because of either the big name star or the famous British team behind it.  On television (for free) though, is a different matter and I gave it a go.  Firstly the film does look great; I know there are tales of environmental damage to the area but it does look like paradise and is very lush.  Director Boyle's direction is visually good too  whether it be drawing style from scenes or contrasting the city with the island or doing imaginative things like computer game style images, he does work well.<br/><br/>The plot is good on paper but isn't as well brought through.  Richard's journey and initial settling into the island is involving and interesting but the main plot is really in the second half which is also where it becomes a weaker film. The film clearly is building into a teenage Hearts of Darkness type story where the DIY civilisation leads to cruelty and madness  this aim can be seen in an early scene where tourists sit watching Apocalypse Now in a waiting area.  However his descent into madness is less well done and less convincing than Brando's.  It all happens to quickly and, although with brutal consequences, it really needed to be seen to be more of a gradual distancing from the norm rather than a sudden leap into an abyss.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is not an actor that I particularly like or enjoy to watch but he is pretty good here.  The fact that this film did as well as it did (in terms of box office) is probably mostly down to his star power, but he also gives a good performance.  His madness is well portrayed and it's not his fault the film requires him to suddenly switch the way he does.  Swinton is better as Sal, her `madness' is more subtle and is continual rather than sudden.  The mix of multinational unknowns in the support roles are all good  even if, with so many good looking young people, it does feel a little like a music video shoot at times.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the film even if it never got as involving as I hoped it would.  The story lacks punch and point  a fact that can be seen in a very weak ending which was a real wash out in my opinion  but it is still good enough to watch once.  The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him, it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the tourist-film location does."

","Here is another of those films that got panned by critics all over the place, but I liked the movie and thought it was unfairly criticized.<br/><br/>Two things are not up for debate: the film is entertaining and the cinematography is gorgeous.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him. He's good at playing the boyish, cocky immature type. He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films. In fact, I wish there were more of it in here.<br/><br/>French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me, and a pretty one. I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.<br/><br/>The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way, ""the beach"" that's in this film really exists, just as it's seen here. The story is interesting, too, for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.<br/><br/>Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this. I think you'll be entertained."
"stamper","7","142","209","4 June 2000"," Pretty good, despite all the bad reviews I've read
","I went to this one, knowing that it could be crap, but hey, I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.<br/><br/>This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.<br/><br/>After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.<br/><br/>This is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.<br/><br/>Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.<br/><br/>NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>7 out of 10<br/><br/>P.S.

","When you travel, you are surrounded by people. Amidst all that foreign intrigue, you are truly alone - an opportunity to be truthful to your instincts.<br/><br/>When you are young and you travel, recklessness and the need to experience drive almost all your decision, well other than budgetary constraints.<br/><br/>It is therefore quite truthful at times to relate to the character who is in search of this ultimate freedom, a place where all your worldly obligations are suspended and irrelevant.<br/><br/>The movie is an irony. Not only externally, that though it depicts the end purity of nature when fox's being sued for environmental damage, but also that any man-found paradise is not free, but with a price and in this case, could be the ultimate price.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed the movie especially at times the sparks of life's insight and moments of traveller's consciousness that when you are there, in that destination, IT becomes reality and no longer are you foreign and problems arise regardless.<br/><br/>Though the romance is distracting, Etienne, Canet's portrayal is quite the eye candy.<br/><br/>Definitely a watch, but may not appeal to all tastes."
"MossMan","8","14","17","4 December 2001"," Why did it get such bad reviews here?
","This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good ""soft"" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).<br/><br/>What a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.<br/><br/>And I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style...

"Michael Carruthers","Null","55","83","6 April 2001"," Intense and interesting, but contains it's share of flaws.
","On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave The Beach a score of 72.<br/><br/>Many people have stopped themselves from seeing The Beach because of bad reviews from critics and the story of the crew wrecking an entire island to make the movie. One of those things, in my book, is a fact. They did wreck an island, and for pure entertainment, it's not worth it. Still, the bad reviews from the critics I disagree with, I found this quite a little gem, and if you agree with some of my other reviews, I recommend you don't hesitate when you see The Beach sitting on the drama shelf of your video store.<br/><br/>The wonders of modern technology, like computers, video games, cell phones, pagers and the internet, were designed to make our lives more enjoyable and facilitate communications. Yet for many, the complexity of the digital world is overwhelming, leading to a feeling of unrealityof being discconected. The desire to find something real  to connect with something or someone  is what drives Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American backpacker who arrives in Thailand with adventure on his mind. Travel, he asserts, is the search for experience, the quest for something different. Richard and two friends (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) he meets in Thailand risk their lives travelling secret that is dubbed the beach resort for those who don't like beach resorts. At their destination, Richard and friends are welcomed into a community that lives on the beach. However, they soon discover that beneath this surface, this heaven on earth is less than perfect.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio declared he was not anti-Titanic when he did this film. And he isn't. DiCaprio shows on his face how successful he is when he did the film, and he is a show-off. But, darn it all, DiCaprio is good because we know he has the potential. He went a long length to do this movie, even director's favourite Ewan McGregor was passed over for DiCaprio, and rightfully so. I just can't picture anyone else playing the role. The acting hotline is also boiling with such talents as Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen and the masterful Robert Carlyle. Danny Boyle's direction is solid and he paces the film nicely, and the script is adapted well from Alex Garland's better-than-movie book. The film certainly has flaws, some scenes  particularly the ones with the dope growers  are just plain stupid and the film really loses it's feet towards the end, going completely out of control.<br/><br/>Still, The Beach is a film that is ripe for discussion. It features alluring scenery from the small island of Phuket, it has some striking visuals and an absorbing and intense message about finding your own paradise. It's not the best film of 2000, but The Beach remains a worthy attempt."
"badmotivator","Null","36","53","26 January 2001"," Not the book, but possibly something more
","!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Warning! Contains spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>
The Beach is a Danny Boyle film. In it's first week of release, enough people paid to see The Beach to cover over ¾  of Leonardo DiCaprio's paycheque for his first major role since 1997's Titanic, and it would be safe to say that the majority of those paying customers were disappointed. I believe this is a safe guess because I was one of those people. I have yet to read a positive review of the film and the best my friends could come up with was `It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be'. Sadly, I had to agree.<br/><br/>The thing is, I wanted so badly to love this film. I had read the book and loved it, I had seen Boyle's previous work and loved it (Yes, I even loved A Life Less Ordinary), and I wanted nothing more than to prove to all the nay-sayers that The Beach would rise above the stench of the usual February release crowd and be remembered as one of the best films of the year. I went to see The Beach for a second time. The film may not appear on any year-end top ten lists to vindicate my faith, but on second viewing The Beach became a Danny Boyle film. Those who are familiar with 1994's Trainspotting will understand that this is a compliment of the highest regard. Adapted from Alex Garland's 1997 first novel of the same name, The Beach follows Richard (DiCaprio) an admittedly brash, young American back-packer who escapes to Thailand to find something. Richard is a fairly vague guy. In fact, all he gives us is his name: `what else do you need to know?'. Is he looking for himself? For Love? What he does find is Daffy (a manic Robert Carlyle). He finds him on the floor of the neighboring hostel room, with his wrists slit  the blood covering the walls and bed in such a fashion as to leave no doubt that the act was committed with purpose (and joy?). The previous evening, Daffy tells Richard about a beach  a real paradise of mythical beauty. The following morning, Richard finds a map on his door. What is most immediately jarring to anyone who has read the book is the decision to make Richard an American instead of a Brit. This does change a couple of things: for one, we miss the joy of Zeph and Sammy  the two American tourists whom Richard unfortunately (or fortunately) invites to `paradise'.With Richard as an American, we Canadians are deprived of a well-needed slap in the face: In the film, Sammy and Zeph are our stereotypical, arrogant American surf dudes. In the book, the surf act was just that: `It's a protest against bigotry,' Zeph explained. `Europeans think all Americans are stupid, so we act stupid to confirm your prejudices. Then we reveal ourselves as  intelligent and by doing so, subvert the prejudice more effectively than an immediate barrage of intellect  which only causes confusion and, ultimately, resentment.' (45) How pleasant it might have been to sit in a Canadian audience and listen as the trap is sprung. Still, the most important thing about Richard, Zeph and Sammy is intact. They are not the only things that lead to the end of paradise, but they are a symbol for all that shows us that paradise is not possible. They are Americans and they are a plague. In fact, the film is telling us that we all are, but for some it may be easier to keep the blame centered on our favourite target. The Beach is not an anti-American film. It is an anti-Consumerism film. And we are all targets.  We see this in many telling scenes, not the least of which involves Richard preparing to leave the island for food , taking orders from the entire multi-cultural beach community of what to bring back from civilization to their `paradise'. Here's what's brought into `paradise': Bleach, for an Australian girl who doesn't like her dark hair; rubber gloves, for the Eastern European cook who is tired of smelling like fish and requests soap (`something toxic, something industrial') to solve the problem; and batteries, for those on the island (including Richard) who won't accept a paradise without Nintendo. `Paradise' has its problems. `Paradise' will not survive, because once it is found, it is lost.<br/><br/>As Richard's time on the beach passes, he finds something again. The only thing he ever finds - he finds twice. Daffy begins to appear to Richard in the latter part of the film. Daffy knows why he left the beach and he tells Richard. He doesn't tell us. But we soon understand. Perhaps the most common complaint I've heard about The Beach includes some comment on the studio system and how it destroys the independent genius of someone like Danny Boyle. Maybe it does. It's quite possible that 20th Century Fox wanted Leo, they wanted Leo to be an American, they wanted Leo's character to sleep with no fewer than two beautiful female characters and they wanted a `happy ending'. It's possible that Boyle consented. It's possible that he subverted the whole process. On the recommendation of a friend, I went to see The Beach for a second time and what I saw was brave. What I saw was Danny Boyle winking at me from behind the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard sits in an internet café, looking at a photo from `paradise' - I saw Boyle's version of Zeph and Sammy. He sprung the trap on us. Upon first viewing, the ending is a cop-out: a flippantly stupid wrap-up that says `it's okay to fall to the absolute depths of self-imposed degridation, because we'll always have a few happy memories to cover the fall'. Richard's words tell us that he `still believes in paradise', but his eyes tell us something else. This is Boyle's triumph: Richard's eyes tell us what they now know that there is no such thing.  `God knows we're lonely souls' begin the lyrics to the song that plays over the closing credits, and we know that Richard is now the loneliest of them all. Danny Boyle's The Beach follows last year's The Matrix and Fight Club, showing us what we don't want to see: that there is no use looking for paradise because there is no paradise left  - it's left us  we've repelled it. It is too late for Richard to save his beach because he believes it can be saved from Zeph and Sammy, he doesn't know that the reason it can't be saved is because he's already there  the poison has already begun to spread. But he learns, and we learn as The Beach reminds us of what we all too often are: `Cancers, parasites eating-up the whole ****ing world'."

","Danny Boyle did an exquisite job on this film. When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his ""original"" cast members... the people that he always works with. When I learned that Robert Carlyle was in this, I was ecstatic. This film has so many wonderful points, I can't list them all. I'm just going to say that ""enjoy your dinner Richard"" was a classic cinematic moment. A great thing about this film is that it's a wonderful representation of a microcosm of todays society. It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to. This film doesn't go from beginning to end. It circles. There is no ending because their lives didn't end. Truly a supreme film. It is what one should expect from a man like Danny Boyle. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance. It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully!"

It would take a long time to pick my way through the debris of this particular shambles so I shall narrow it down to what I see as the main critical flaws that sank Leo's latest water borne epic 1. The movie has been aimed squarely at a teen market hence you get style over content - The beautiful people in paradise hanging out with a highly commercial soundtrack and a Top Shop tie in on the fashion side<br/><br/>2. The removal of the deep cynicism evident in Garlands novel - Read the book  - you will find it very hard to find a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>3. Richards(Leo) fascination with the whole 'Nam pop culture - this is throw in as an afterthought in the last 25 minutes of the film(apart from a fleeting glimpse of Apocalypse Now in the opening reel)and falls completely flat - what we get is comical( check out Leo as he does his best Cat. Willard impressions - hilarious!<br/><br/>4. The love interest. Okay - this I can understand purely for its commercial reasons - it has a bums on seats factor. But it damages a vital part of the book - Richard never gets it together with Francois let alone Sal hence there is an unspoken tension in the air which adds to Richards isolation and his descent into 'Nam paranoia. Enough! If you want the real experience read the book - if you want a very cheap facsimile go see Leo and the gang...3/10"
"masonmorgan-92917","4","14","21","29 November 2016"," An unpleasant and frustrating experience
","Danny Boyle's The Beach was an awful viewing experience for me and thinking back on it is just as unpleasant, so naturally I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about it.<br/><br/>The reason that The Beach is so awful is because it is so pretentious and full of itself. It gives a painfully obvious and blatant expression on a social commentary that feels so forced. <br/><br/>The Beach is also extremely boring. I was patiently waiting for the movie to pick up, but after an hour of pure nothing, I gave up hope and assumed that the rest of the film would be just as uneventful. Sadly, I was right. <br/><br/>The Beach feels like a 2-hour long Expedia commercial. The music is cheap and terribly cheesy and the cinematography is sometimes interesting, but mostly just dull.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did give an entertaining performance even though he did overact quite a bit. Tilda Swinton wasn't bad either, but the rest of the cast is just so forgettable and boring that it even weighs down these two characters. Robert Carlyle was one of the few redeemable aspects of The Beach. His character was utterly mad and it seemed that he loved playing this character, which made him a blast to watch.<br/><br/>The story is painfully slow. We have to endure long stretches of Leo's character expressing his obsession for a girl he barely knows, then we are suddenly treated to a horrifically graphic shark attack scene. The tone of The Beach is never established. Most of the movie is extremely depressing and generally uncomfortable to watch, but then the movie ends on a gleefully happy note as if nothing bad even happened.<br/><br/>The best way I can explain The Beach is that it is a confused, hyper mess of a film that tackles a social commentary so blatantly obvious that it comes off grossly pretentious. And any time Danny Boyle tries to have fun, it comes off as just awkward. <br/><br/>While The Beach does have a passionate cult following, I simply cannot find enjoyment in the film myself. It's dull, pretentious and just messy. I respect Danny Boyle as a film maker but I really don't know what he was hoping to achieve with this one. I'm just grateful that the whole experience was completely forgettable. Another trip to this mind- numbing ""paradise"" wouldn't be good for my sanity."

The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments.

"carloshache","1","43","78","15 April 2006"," Horrible stuff..
","Entertaining in parts, but as a whole it's pure manure.<br/><br/>This movie is generally about the sociopath Richard( DiCaprio),in his elitist pursuit of pleasure, sex and holiday paradise. He goes to great length in pursuing this, using lies, deceit and violence to get what he wants. He gets to know about a secluded Thai beach, and makes friends with a french guy and his girlfriend in order to steal the girlfriend from the guy.. The trio finds their ""paradise"" on an island that's part occupied by some armed and crazy Thai marijuana farmers, and the other part; a crazy hippie collective . The hippies are driven by a collective fear of getting their tropical paradise discovered, so they use fascistic methods when silencing members of the society to not reveal the secrets of the whereabouts of their beautiful beach/self made tropical paradise ""community"".<br/><br/>The hippie commune, is still a slave to consumerism society, and not the alternative society that it is set out to be. Just like Richard, the members of the community goes to great length in defending their right to ""fun"" and ""pleasure"", taking a blind fold to the ones that get hurt and killed in their pursuit. The goal of the commune is elitist and fascist, the means of using violence is motivated by keeping out other tourists and people the commune doesn't want out of this beach-resort. Richard makes everything he can to do the same things. He is everything that goes bad with the commune inpersonated.. He's not able to feel any empathy or understanding for anyone, the only time he openly questions the fascism of the commune is when his own life is on the line in order to save it. In other cases he walks away, and still ""feels good being in paradise"". <br/><br/>Well the movies meaning wasn't supposed to be about this. The director somehow thought that we should see any kind of sympathy and actually care about what happens to Richard, and forgive him for his actions, instead he is the only guy in this movie that is actually disgustingly inhumane. Maybe he thought we should have been blazed by the star quality of Di Caprio. But truthfully, He is nothing more than a stupid parody of idiotic travellers who think they can behave anyhow they like in any foreign exotic location. The unintentional satire is exaggerating this, making him a total psychopath. He is not just a someone who quietly takes orders, the nazi-like leader of the commune; Sal is his peer. The same person, but with power.<br/><br/>DiCaprios character is somebody you would want the director to have shot off early in the movie. Even if it was the meaning of the director to show DiCaprio as a total a-hole, this a-hole definitely isn't good company for the two hours. This is not the only bad thing about the movie. It's slow scenes, extremely bad computer animations and the horribly outdated brit-pop soundtrack makes it an equally painful experience to watch.<br/><br/>The movies ending is nothing but Richard being nostalgic about his beach adventures in his normal-life setting, not having learned any lesson or gained any emotional strength. The viewer is also encouraged to join his nostalgia for his blood stained paradise. <br/><br/>Why go to such great lengths anyway to get away from the mass tourists? Go to the Philipines or any place that isn't as crowded as Thailand. Stupid movie."
"ryleythsmith","6","3","3","25 October 2019"," Intrigueing concept but equally as forgettable
","Despite glimpses of incredible photography and powerful dialogue this movie lacks potency and meaning. I failed to identify with this movie on several levels despite its intentions at aiming at a younger audience, a crowd inwhich I am part of. The movie started off with drive and momenten, hooking you in through the incaptulating monologue of Leonardo Di Caprio and the intriguing death of a man who mentions a entrancing iskand. However this is as interesting as it gets as once Leonardo is placed on this island the story becomes scewed and disorintating. Leobardos character comes off as way to protentious and the movie attempts at using unique cinematography to seperate itself from all the other nuanced abstract films so popular of today's geberation. However it simply does not work and the film's overall message that humanity cannot get caught up in a romantacised reality comes off as dull and forced. The last half hour of the movie is ultimately it's downfall as the story transitions into a strange and disturbing ending. Overall the movie is enjoyable at moments however the end result comes off as forgettable and washed."
"Dockelektro","8","8","11","1 February 2002"," Cult movie potential
","Like the many times referenced ""Apocalypse Now"", this one could really reach the status of cult movie among the nature lovers and hippy heirs. The movie its all the perfect spots during the first half. The beach, the people, the rhythm, the actors, the music... all is stunning. They even sing Bob Marley by the fire. But the film's second half is strange, erratic, scattered, it leaves the awe-inspiring journey sense and centers in a strange and sudden ""mood"" by DiCaprio's Richard. This is where the letdown is fully, although the ending doesn't feel disappointing. As for the cult movie potential, I think the next generations must judge it, but it has a great deal of bitterness to it and if two years later the film isn't a ""word of mouth"" phenomenon, maybe it won't have such a cult afterall. Anyway, I thought it was a great work by the scottish team of ""Trainspotting"", the script is an asset, and I say it again, DiCaprio is not just a pretty face. Recomend it to all people from 18 up. Live it and think about it. I sure liked it anyway..."

","The Beach was a novel I originally read by Alex Garland - the movie was watched not long after. My tendency for movies not living up to the books they were based on were accounted for in the writing and rating of this review.<br/><br/>The main character is a short tempered, deluded, murderous, integrity-lacking wimp. It is hard to empathise with someone who loses their cool over minuscule things. In fact, the reactions from all the characters to situations they are exposed too seem highly unwarranted and excessive, aka ""over-acting"".<br/><br/>Secondly, did they really have to turn Richard - who was a somewhat intellectual character in the book - to an ignorant bimbo? This movie seems like it was targeted to brainless sixteen year olds.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you don't really relate to nor care much for someone who cheats on the woman he loves so easily right after helping her cheat on her boyfriend who was your friend.

","I didn't want to see this movie in the first place; I just went because of two things. One is for my love of movies, and the other is because my girlfriend really wanted to see it. By the end of this movie, we both agreed that it was the crappiest movie we'd seen (at least in theaters) in a long time. THE BEACH lacked all the elements that I look for in a movie and that I think makes a movie important. I was really tempted to sneak out of that stupid movie and go see THE TIGGER STORY!<br/><br/>Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young dope-addicted traveler who is trying to forget his past, meets a psycho named Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a beautiful island/beach paradise before committing suicide. Richard, along with two more dope-addicts, Sal (Tilda Swinton) and Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), set out to find this beach. What they find is a community living together without the evils of the world, struggling to keep their existence a secret so the rest of the world doesn't spoil it. It turns out Richard is the biggest danger to the secret of the community.<br/><br/>Sound like it might have a plot. Think again. This movie is completely plotless. At first, you may think it's a love story between Leonardo and Tilda, but that stop quickly. Then it seems like it is about Leonardo losing his sanity, but that quickly comes to an end as well. Then it seems a may be a fight between the community and another group living on the island, but that's not the case either. You will wait from the start to the end of this movie for the plot to start, but it will never come.<br/><br/>Another element this movie lacks, in fact probably the only element that is left for a movie with no plot, is character development. Leonardo's character in the beginning refuses to talk at all about his past. Godforbid we might actually get to know his character. You'll feel just the same about him in the beginning as you do in the end, with no development at all. The rest of the characters are also boring and don't get much better. The acting is nothing special. Leonardo does a fair job, but the horrible script prevents me from calling his performance anything great.<br/><br/>Unless you're a dedicated Leonardo fan, skip THE BEACH. I found it very long, boring, pointless and not entertaining."

","... and I thought it was a pretty good film. When it first came out it was DiCaprio's presence that caused me not to watch it, and after watching him grow as an actor over the last 15 years, DiCaprio is what got me curious enough to give it a try.<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays Richard, a tourist who hates the tourist traps he can afford in Thailand. A guy in Richard's hotel named Daffy -for appropriate reasons - kills himself, but first draws a map to an island that he claims is nirvana. Richard convinces two French tourists to come with him and they actually do find a colony of people living outside of any civilization other than the one they have built for their own survival and pleasure. The leader is Sal (Tilda Swinton) who tells the three that the drug dealers who control the island allow them to stay there but have said there can be no more people joining them - it hurts their chances at having their thriving cannabis business remain undiscovered. Sal says that they can stay, but is bothered by the map, burns it, and asks if they gave a copy to anyone else. Richard lies and says no - he gave it to a group of stoners he met before they got there. Whether they are on their way there or are too drug addled to make the trip, Richard does not know. So he figures the lie will hurt nobody.<br/><br/>This is basically an adult ""Lord of the Flies"". The lesson it teaches is that no matter where you go, unfortunately your human nature and all that comes with it hitches a ride. That is why Richard could easily see the evils of the city but it took some time for problems to arise at ""the beach"". It's just a matter of more humans in one place than another.<br/><br/>And who would figure on a story in which armed drug dealers actually turn out to be the good guys, probably because they know the truth about human nature better than their nirvana seeking neighbors. To see what I mean, watch and find out."

","When I was travelling in Thailand, everyone was talking about the ""Beach"" and all backpackers aimed for its filming location, Koh Phi Phi. Although I watched a lot of good movies in the touristic cafes on Khao San Road in Bangkok and in Penang, Malaysia, I missed the ""Beach"" and came home wondering what it was all about. I finally saw it yesterday and in spite of a couple of flaws, I genuinely enjoyed it! First of all, it really shows the atmosphere of Thailand - the golden Buddha, the tiny rooms with thin partitions in the guesthouses, the markets, the internet cafes, the tourists' clothes and their very behavior... Second, the landscape is amazing, Leonardo is quite good, although he's had better movies in his career, but he's definitely very convincing in this role, and the girl playing Francois is quite charming. Also, the movie is funny! Third, this movie has a great moral message. Following the tradition of ""Lord of the Flies"" and others, it shows the dangers of separated communities, the disappearance of rules, regrets, the little value human life has in extreme situations, the dangers of a despotic ruler. It shows that the longed-for paradise might not actually be that easy to live in."
"JamesHitchcock","7","21","37","17 August 2005"," Travel Narrows the Mind Wonderfully
","Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the ""noble savage"", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as ""The Blue Lagoon"" or the various versions of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of ""Lord of the Flies"", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" has certain similarities to ""Lord of the Flies"". The main character is Richard, an American backpacker travelling round Thailand, who has heard tales of a co-operative multi-national community of idealistic young people living on a beach on an island off the coast. Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends, but changes his mind when another backpacker, Daffy, gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found. Undeterred by the fact that Daffy commits suicide shortly afterwards, Richard sets out to go there accompanied by Etienne and Francoise, a young French couple whom he has befriended.<br/><br/>After a number of adventures, the three succeed in reaching the island and discover that the fabled community is no urban myth but a reality. At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle, consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket, lazing about smoking pot, or (for some obscure reason) translating various English phrases into Serbo-Croat. As with all films of this type, however, we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems. Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him. More seriously, there are flaws in the basic concept of the community.<br/><br/>The main flaw is that travel narrows the mind wonderfully. The community, mostly Westerners, have dropped out of their own societies and travelled halfway around the world to Thailand, but find Thai society no more congenial than those they have left behind. Their solution is to drop out of that too and to set up a ""beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts"" where they can live their own hedonistic idea of the hippie life. The community is not, however self-sufficient; they produce little for themselves, apart from fish, and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland, which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis. The island, in fact, is owned by a group of Thai farmers, themselves involved in a much larger cannabis-producing operation, who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.<br/><br/>As in many anti-Utopian parables, the community is dominated by a sinister dictator-figure. ""Lord of the Flies"" had the choirboy Jack, ""Animal Farm"" had Napoleon and ""The Beach"" has Sal, an upper-class Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community (although it is never clear how she attained this position). Sal is obsessed with protecting the community's privacy and secrecy, and in order to achieve this end she is prepared to resort to violence, even murderous violence. (She is deeply suspicious of Richard, who she suspects may have distributed further copies of Daffy's map). One of the film's most chilling incidents comes after Christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community's existence being revealed to outsiders, Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.<br/><br/>There is some good acting in the film, especially from Tilda Swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as Sal, a woman with steely eyes and a cut-glass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. This increases the impact of the scene at the end where Sal finally does lose her cool. The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise, and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne. Originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard, Etienne later emerges as the community's voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.<br/><br/>It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in ""Titanic"", tends to overact. The film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable. The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric. Despite its potentially interesting themes, ""The Beach"" falls just short of being a very good film. 7/10"
"Buddy-51","Null","21","37","30 September 2000"," not very gritty story of survival
","Is this merely `Survivor' without the million-dollar payoff?  Or is it a modern vision of James Hilton's most famous novel?  For those too young to have any memories of `Lost Horizon,' `The Beach' may seem like a wildly new and original work.  And, as this is, essentially, a narcissistic youth fantasy starring teen-idol Leonardo Di Caprio, chances are that most of the film's audience will indeed be hovering somewhere near the puberty mark. Since the cast of characters is so youthful to begin with, the film is able to dispense with  or, at the most, treat obliquely  one of the major themes that runs through `Lost Horizon,' that of the universal lure of Eternal Youth.<br/><br/>Di Caprio stars as Richard, a young man so bored with the mundane rituals of modern civilized life that he journeys alone to Bangkok to partake of the exotic experiences a more primitive life has to offer.  While there, he encounters a seeming madman who, right before his suicide, draws a map for Richard revealing the whereabouts of a small tropical island, guaranteed to be a Shangri-la for any person clever and daring enough to get there. Recruiting two of his hotel neighbors  a young French couple  to accompany him, Richard sets out to find his own private place in the sun.  But life is never quite that simple and the three soon discover that the island is already inhabited by other jaded tourists who have set up a carefree, thriving community far away from both the amenities and problems of the modern world.<br/><br/>This concept of discovering a secret, pristine and uncorrupted paradise has a timeless appeal and pull.  And, as long as `The Beach' hews closely to this theme, it remains a reasonably interesting film, for who cannot identify at least partially with the lure of this idea?  The tricky part for the filmmakers tackling this theme is to make this unlikely situation seem real and believable.   Unfortunately, in the case of `The Beach,' the people who comprise this out-of-the-way community seem, for the most part, way too agreeable and cooperative.  This is like a Club Med resort without the room service.  Survival here doesn't seem like much of a struggle and there rarely ever seems to be much in the way of intense disagreements and arguments amongst the group's members.  We wonder, for instance, why, without monetary compensation or incentives of any kind for that matter, one man does all the cooking while another man does all the building.  As far as we can tell, they do virtually all the work on the island while the others frolic on the beach playing volleyball all day.  `Lost Horizon' was a certified fantasy  `The Beach' aspires to realism yet it needs a bit more grit to really achieve the truth it is after.  Yes, grim reality does occasionally poke its ugly head into this insulated world from time to time in the form of man-eating sharks and gun-toting pot harvesters - but the characters themselves lack psychological depth and clarity.  With rare exceptions, the people on the island seem to exist in a state of unlikely harmony, exhibiting little or none of the human conflict, personal jealousy or power politics one would reasonably expect to find in such a situation. Then when, late in the game, the film develops grand illusions of becoming a meaningful and grim look into the dark heart of madness, `The Beach' becomes both pretentious and laughable.   This is particularly the case because Richard seems to drift in and out of madness with a dexterity that would leave Sigmund Freud himself speechless and dumbfounded. <br/><br/>
`The Beach' may well appeal to all those viewers who found the phony, pseudo-adventure theatrics of `Survivor' realistic and compelling.  Indeed, the best part of the film is the ending when all these pathetic, craven softies from civilization, who fancy themselves rugged individualists, get their final comeuppance.  Those of us who have long ago freely capitulated to the lure of all our assorted modern amenities happily get the last laugh."

","Ah backpacking across the world . What an exciting thing it is - but only if you're a rare and remarkable person . Travelling all over the world isn't all it's cracked up to be . You might get a one night stand , you might get stoned but to be honest couldn't you have got that at home ? Did you really need to go the ends of the earth for that ? If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness , suffer dysentery , catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare . You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease <br/><br/>THE BEACH is very similar in many ways . It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation <br/><br/>Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart . Did anyone like the characters in this movie ? Neither did I . I haven't read Garland's novel but I'm led to believe there's a scene where a giant squid is washed up on the beach and the characters eat it only to end up with food poisoning . I would have enjoyed this movie much more if all the characters had died from food poisoning . When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problem <br/><br/>Another thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz . Something similar happens in another Boyle movie 28 DAYS LATER but at least in that movie you're aware of the character's motive even if it is fairly unconvincing . Here you do find yourself wondering the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor or even if it was excluded at draft stage . Not only that but you find that the characters remain unchanged by events at the end therefore there is zero character development <br/><br/>Danny Boyle has said that he makes quintessential British films and it's difficult to disagree with him . TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s . THE BEACH with its exotic foreign location and its American star definitely feels like it's made for an American audience and Boyle tries too hard to pander to their taste . That's why THE BEACH is probably Boyle's weakest film to date"

Or did he have some tropical fever??????<br/><br/>The whole thing was so unrealistic that is was just pathetic. Leo can act, but it seems that all the budget was spent on him, and that they just pulled some backpackers off the street of Bangcok and said ""Do you wanna be in a movie?"".

","HERE BE SPOILERS The Silver Screen adaptation of the popular dystopian backpacker's novel, 'The Beach' is perhaps not the most accurate adaptation of the cult book, which has become required reading for a whole generation of travellers. Parts of the original book are hardly mentioned in the film, while whole sections are completely skipped, such as pseudo soldier Jed, whose massive role in the book is written out of the screenplay completely. Just as plot parts are removed, others are added in their place. Richard's unrequited love of Francoise is replaced by a rapid relationship, ending with an all too strange sex scene on between Sal and Richard. Good natured Sal who only wants to preserve village life, becomes a sexual predator, approaching the level of Sharon Stone, as she entraps Richard in her Black Widow clutches. Etienne takes a minor role upon reaching the beach, swiftly giving up Francoise, and becoming a hermit in the forest with the injured Swede. Many of the more powerful (or more controversial) scenes from the book are cut from the movie, giving the feel that the director was reined in by his funders. References to Vietnam are abbreviated to a single shot of a fan, while Richard's re-accuring dreams about Daffy are replaced by a brief sequence toward the end. Perhaps most shockingly of all, the books surprise ending, truly dystopian in it's screaming climax, is replaced by the rather weaker idea of the inhabitants of the beach sailing away on a homemade raft, and joining modern society for Cyber Cafes and coffee. Perhaps if this film can be seen as a separate entity altogether from it's written counterpart, then it would be a pretty good film. Certainly the CGI beach looks pretty good, the acting is of decent quality and the film is not without it's charms. However if even the director Danny Boyle (of 'Trainspotting' legend) is disappointed with what he made, then perhaps this one is best given a miss, and relying on the book to do the talking."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","8","12","4 March 2008"," Getting away from it all may not be perfection paradise after all?
","I first viewed this film upon its release and felt that the final third did the film down - and that the voice-over took away from the essence of the story, thus it's average. My subsequent viewings over the years would see me lament about an arcade game sequence and bemoaning that Robert Carlyle wasn't given a more extended role, yet it has become a film that sees me totally on board with director Danny Boyle's production and it's now that I think it puts the story together with poignant precision.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a backpacker searching for a bit more in life, after a meeting with pot smoking loony Daffy (the wonderful Robert Carlyle), he learns of an island paradise that is everything he has yearned for in his life. Getting there will give him the adventure and danger he craves, because once there it apparently will be the thing of dreams, the perfect paradise cut off from civilisation...<br/><br/>The film is very much split in two, the first half introduces us to Richard and the people he would convince to travel with him to this island paradise, we then follow their journey that is perfect in fleshing out the characters, they come up against obstacles and learn about each other on the way. The second half is well worth waiting for because it's here that the story kicks in to make the viewer think, it's idyllic, it's gorgeous, it's near perfect, but wherever there is a community, there will be personal hang ups, jealousies, power seekers and etc, in short, the surroundings may be perfect but the human condition is far from flawless.<br/><br/>I love this film now, I love DiCaprio's performance, a cocky smart- arse thrill seeker about to get a wake up call is tailor made for him, and he delivers it with a skillful array of emotions. Director Danny Boyle does a great job of juggling the joys of paradise with the uneasy distortion of the various characters in the community, and the cinematography from Darius Khondji is truly beautiful (Thailand locales). The film suffers with the inevitable comparisons to Lord Of The Flies & Hearts Of Darkness, and yes these are fair comparisons, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's a fine film for the modern generation in its own right, with the core point of the story relevant to all and sundry.<br/><br/>Fans of the novel would prove to be very ambivalent towards this filmic adaptation, but in my book it gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10"

","In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie ""the beach"", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of ""Titanic"". But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.<br/><br/> As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually, my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community, I think the movie could have ended there. The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie. Moreover, Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.<br/><br/>Otherwise, to put it mildly is that the dialogs of ""the beach"" are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them. And, inevitably, it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed: DiCaprio' voice-off doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in ""Fight Club"".<br/><br/>Then, let's admit it: the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the ""paradise keepers"" will do anything to protect their territory, even to kill...<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide."

McGregor was upset he wasn't cast in the film, and now refuses to film the sequel to ""Trainspotting,"" which is named ""Porno."" Considering that ""The Beach"" is quite easily one of Danny Boyle's worst films and one of the most disappointing pictures of the last decade... why the fuss, Ewan?

Perhaps the intention is to show a group of middle-class pleasure-seekers as they really are: selfish, narcissistic and cruel, and that their retreat from the world is really an attempt to escape their own petty nastiness.<br/><br/>This is an interesting idea, but director Danny Boyle's technique is not up to the task. Neither is the script. For most of the film, we seem to be watching a travelogue combined with a MTV music video. The self-consciously 'cool' soundtrack detracts rather than enhances the experience. Some cack-handed attempts at drama involve unconvincing arguments which spring out of nowhere, such as the waterfall altercation. The story improves when Di Caprio starts to lose his marbles. This is undermined by Boyle's gimmicky effects, such as the annoying video game sequence.<br/><br/>Of the actors, only Paterson Johnson emerges well. He brings a good deal of likability to the role, something of a relief among the Islanders, and I wish the whole story had revolved around his much more interesting and human character.<br/><br/>In the end,we are left with unanswered questions and a great feeling of dissatisfaction."

","This film seriously falls short of the great novel by Alex Garland and I was very disappointed. I can't believe after watching this film that Garland signed away a beautiful, gripping and thought-provoking novel, which operated on so many levels, to this dumbed-down Hollywood trash movie. This movie is pretty much a huge insult to the narrative ability of Garland. In fact, the film butchers some of the most important themes. The book is much deeper, and more thorough. Some of the main themes, were in fact lost on the film. This film is certainly a classic mass entertainment no-brainer, which could be pleasant to watch, without the knowledge of what an insult it is to a great piece of fiction. To discover and understand the meaning of The Beach please take a little longer and read the book, it is well worth it."

","What a dissapointment.  Even after hearing the poor reviews, I was hoping for the best.  What we have here is a movie that has a fantasy island soap opera type story centering around neo flower children and anti establishment hippy types, born to surf and smoke dope, where nobody can find them.  Plot continues with a pretentious romp through the jungles of said ""secret"" island by a few daringly foolish kids.  Character development is weak; the film uses the ploy of introducing characters by very staged and phony scenes, where one by one, the characters mumble a few lines about themselves, sort of reminiscent of Armageddon and Drop Dead Gorgeous, and move on.<br/><br/>I never really identified or felt sympathy with most of the characters. I didn't enjoy the films little hat tip to its scenes vaguely similar to Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the scenery, but even that did not seem to be captured very well, as many scenes seemed dark and blurry or unfocused and poorly lit, I guess in an attempt to develop mood.<br/><br/>This movie had great potential, but in retrospect, it just tried to"

There is no logic in why this person does what he does unless he's a complete idiot. They walk into a field of marijuana like they are taking a leisurely stroll through Busch Gardens. Parts of Jamaica is like this and the tourist boards knows that. You can't go into certain parts of the island because there are marijuana fields under armed control.

","The press screening in Germany became a nightmare like some visit at the dentist's. Having been to Thailand six times in my life, I wondered how Danny Boyle would catch one of it's most beautiful sights, the island Phi Phi Leh. Not only did Boyle mix reminiscence to APOCALYPSE NOW (not even managing to quote it's moody fans correctly) and THE DEER HUNTER (the ""Russian Roulette"" scene, but this time with a childish and frightened DiCaprio), he also intertwined a video game with the protagonist running through a virtual jungle. This mix of styles was as empty as the whole plot. No Thai would allow dozens of foreigners to stay on their island for such a long time the way those dope-addicted hippies did. No shark would appear to bite them. No marijuana farmers would shoot them. The only restricted areas in Thailand that equal paradises are on military ground. All the suspense in THE BEACH is based on lies. So it comes as no surprise that the Thais are now blaming the film crew for having destroyed some natural surroundings of the island. Clear as one can see that neither the writer of the novel nor the filmmaker have any understanding of Thailand' true soul, they probably didn't even respect it's natural beauty. So this might be the only parallel to the filming of the masterpiece APOCALYPSE NOW: Wherever an American filmcrew invades, the place is changed to their needs. And they are mostly commercial.<br/><br/>Look for some characters (the French tourist, Swinton's boyfriend) and see their figures stuck in the story. Nothing develops.

DiCaprio gives his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and though I have never been much of a fan of DiCaprio's (AT ALL) I found his teaming up with Trainspotting director Boyle was a good bet.

","The Beach is my all time favorite movie. Ironically, the first time I saw it, I was disappointed. The problem was that the studios were marketing this film like an action movie, which in many ways it can be, but it's so much more than that. This is the reason why this probably should've been an indie film rather than a major studio one. But anyways, here's what I think of the film:<br/><br/>To me this is not far from a Kubrik or Terry Gilliam film in the sense that it's more than just a movie, it's an experience. A journey into the human soul, into the human condition. And sometimes, this is a dark place. And sometimes it hurts. And sometimes you're running around in the jungle aimlessly, imagining yourself right in the midst of a video game. This is truly a movie that holds up after the years and gets better and better with each viewing. You start to slowly pick up on all the subtle nuances and begin to understand how complex and sophisticated this movie actually is despite all its flaws. And even when it's flawed, it's flawed in the most seductive of ways. Leo is spectacular. Far from the sweet, iconic, almost surreal Jack Dawson, Richard is a real person. He's dark, he's selfish, he's cocky, at times we hate him, at times we love him, he's tortured, tormented, he's a lonely soul in search of redemption. He's the ultimate antihero. I admire Leo DiCaprio for taking on that sort of role right after the madness that was Titanic (the best movie of all times). The film also heavily references Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, Rambo and Lord of The Flies in a really intelligent way. Like our brains have become so fried from television, films and video games that no matter where we go and what we do, this is who we are: a media hazed generation. <br/><br/>Watch this film and remember to ""just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if it hurts, It's probably worth it"", ""there is so much here to inspire us..."""

","Last night, after a 9 hour day at work and another 4 hours studying and cleaning I decided to check out the On-Demand list of free movies. Nothing excited me, but I saw the title of ""The Beach"" and remember hearing some good reviews from friends. I also remember the critics ripping this movie to shreds, so I decided it would be appropriate for me to find out for myself. I was astonished at how great ""the Beach"" is, but I'm definitely not surprised at the discrepancy of opinions from person to person. This movie is not for everyone; it takes a certain type of mindset to get into the movie. For any ambitious person working hard to achieve the ""American dream"" this movie can come off as nonsensical, confusing, unrealistic, and meaningless. But any person with ambition for life, and exotic, unpredictable raw passion and pleasure this movie can serve chills and strike that person close to the roots. This movie is certainly made to enhance the viewers pleasure if under the influence of marijuana, but it is much more than a ""stoner"" movie. ""The Beach"" is an examination of the pull people feel from their more primitive side. As technology is vastly increasing and becoming more complex; people in the ""real world"" have a tendency to become submerged in the drive to succeed. The beach is the ultimate paradise, and one critique of the movie is that ultimately the paradise doesn't work in the end, I only wish somehow it could. This movie isn't perfect by any stretch, but overall as a movie I give it a B- grade. However, there are a few scenes in this movie that are as powerful as I've ever seen in cinema. The scene when the three newbies first see the beach, for example, is a very awesome sight. Another obvious strong scene is the night swimming sex scene. This scene was not only aesthetically incredible, but absolutely ripe with passion; so much that the viewer can almost feel ""the haze of infatuation.""<br/><br/>Overall the acting is both good and bad. Leo does a great job, which is to be expected from him, but some of the other actors fall short in a few scenes. A few parts of the movie are also rather corny, when Richard pretends to be in a video game, for example. The soundtrack literally could not be better, it's incredible."

","For a movie directed by Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting,etc.) that stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton... this was pretty bad. It starts off pretty good with a shady guy coming up to Leo's character (Richard) and saying that he knows of a ""perfect paradise"". This crazy guy (Bugs) gives Richard a map that leads him to this perfect place Bugs then proceeds to kill himself. Of course, Richard goes to the beach (along with his romantic interest and her French boyfriend).<br/><br/>I mean, we've seen this storyline before... what do you think will happen? Tilda Swinton gives a decent performance as the island leader, Sal, but besides that there isn't really anything special about this movie. It's not that bad up until this certain sequence involving a video game world... then it turns to complete crap! The musical ""score"" is bland, and when it tries to be original it does not go very well with the film being presented. The ending is sudden and completely breaks off from the entire movie... we've been watching this movie this whole time knowing one thing for certain... and then they take that certain thing away... what are we left with? Yes, I realize taking security away is a way of portraying chaos but it does not work for this movie. Honestly, this probably could have been great. All it needed was a decent editor.

","For some reason I thought ""The Beach"" was about nuclear disasters or something... not sure why. In reality, the film is about an island where a group of people live away from the world (to an extent, though they hypocritically rely on civilization for supplies)... for some unknown reason undiscovered by mainlanders or airplanes, though they are only a few miles from other people.<br/><br/>While the film had some flaws, overall it was really good, I guess. Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, under-rated by many people, I think. His ""survival mode"" where he learns to become one with nature was really cool and reminded me of ""First Blood"", only with a better-looking actor.<br/><br/>The infamous video game sequence was not exactly what I expected, and was actually far more cheesy than I assumed. But funny, really funny. Whoever had the idea to put this in the film really had a stroke of genius that day.<br/><br/>The makeup and special effects department deserved an Oscar for their work. I have seen plenty of horror films and love ""Jaws""... but the shark attack wounds in this film were so believable I could hardly breathe. Amazing work.<br/><br/>All the scenes with Daffy were great. Somewhat gritty and very morbid, I was sucked into this film after the first gruesome scene with him. Excellent visuals. And when we return to this scene a few more times later, it is absolutely excellent. Unlike ""Catch-22"", these returns to the same scene really drive the point home of Leo's state of mind.<br/><br/>The beach scenes were also excellent as far as getting across the point of this being a place that was pure, clean and untouched by man. White sands, clear water... don't know if this was special effects or just a great location, but well played.<br/><br/>My only two complaints are concerning the sex scene and the over-acting. I was rather confused by the scene between Richard and Sal... if he has a girlfriend, why is he sleeping with the nastiest woman on the island? I just don't get it. That was a poor idea and I found it hard to believe Richard was that stupid... but maybe he was.<br/><br/>Also, the over-acting was atrocious. When they first encounter the beach, everyone gets super-pumped. Um, okay... it's a beach. Yeah, it's a really nice beach, but they've been living on islands covered in beaches. It's not a miracle. And when Richard tells of his shark adventure. everyone thinks it's the greatest thing since rye bread and he even tells it in an epic manner. Yeah, alright, it was pretty exciting, but not that exciting. These people need to lay off the crack pipe.<br/><br/>But I liked the movie, and if you like Leo you should like this movie.

First of all, a worse casting than diCaprio as Richard can not be possible. I have nothing against diCaprio, but his prettyface is as misplaced as a black actor would have been starring Schindler's List. It doesn't work at all, especially since he still looks as he just came from a stylist after 2 months on the beach where even soap is a luxury item. But even in the beginning he doesn't come off as a seasoned backpacker at all - rather more like one of the tourist scum he claims to despise. Further, the change of personality that Richard goes through during the time on the beach do not come to life. How the director visualizes Richards madness in the end borders on parody. And the spots where the scripts deviates from the book tears apart the logic - basically a lot of details plus some romance and sex that seems to have been inserted because such a film needs romance and sex, but instead rids the plot of logic and coherence. And finally, turning Richard into an American is not a great idea either. Read the book - it is great. Or go travel. Or both. But don't rent the film, it is awful."

","First thing to write at the start: don't be influenced by critics bad review on this one. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors and it's true that The Beach is different that anything he's done before, many would say too commercial. The idea was to put together Boyle's talent with Hollywood budget and keep best from both.<br/><br/>Perhaps Boyle did loose a bit of his harsh style, but not so much you couldn't recognize it's Boyle - especially in the Duffy's monologues and wacky part where Richard is loosing himself. Actors gave good performances, Richard's ( Leonardo Di Caprio) cocky style and Francoise's elegance (played by Virginie Ledoyen) work good together for romance part. Screenplay is good, supporting Boyle's way of directing with sometimes raw, ""youth way"" monologues and conversations that fit good.<br/><br/>The biggest lack, in my opinion, is a ""ideal society"" part. In Alex Garland's story, on which is film based, it's one of the main questions and occupations of the writer. Boyle should have gone deeper on this subject, this way I had feeling that the end is a bit incomplete.<br/><br/>And here is the best part - cinematography with heavenly beautiful landscape (I couldn't resist to move my rating from 7/10 to 8/10 just because of it). Yes, for all those who thought (including me, I admit) it was digitally supported - the beach and the island are real - it's Phi Phi Leha island in Thailand. It's probably the best landscape I've ever seen in any film. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by tsunami in 2004., so this is the only way to discover its beauties if you haven't seen this paradise personally."

","""Dork Beach"" wold have been the perfect title for this movie. A dork, by definition is a polar opposite of a nerd, someone so afraid of being uncool that every decision is based upon what other people think, which of course makes them the most uncool of characters. This movie centers on characters that would fit right in with Barney Fife and Ted Baxter. A young guy, who we learn later is the dork of dorks, has a map to a supposed Paradise on an Asian island, and he goes there with a Frenchman and the Frenchman's girlfriend. The Frenchmand, by the way is one of the only two characters with an IQ over 10. The other one is an unsavory sort who warns the dorks (an unheeded warning) that just because the super dork killed a five foot shark, don't take his goofy babble, about being one with nature and commanding all sharkdom, seriously. The three young people take a high dive into water they don't know the depth of. In real life a best case scenario would be instant death, but more likely hitting a rock, being paralyzed, and dying in anguish. This reason alone would make this movie unwatchable. Before that, they go bananas over a marijuana field in such a way that you see many people do, the kind of people who worship Cheeck and Chong, the kind you never really believe are that excited, but merely hide their true emotions with goofy babble. Then they find the field is guarded by gun toting locals. After the dive they come across some of the ugliest people you ever saw. Just physically repulsive. Island life does not show well on most Caucasians. The ugliest woman in the world is the leader. She's almost as mean as she is ugly. She has no leadership qualities, no charisma, nothing. Yet people attack on her command. The trio isn't there twenty seconds before the rut gut ugly woman tells them they can't leave. Of course, that is kidnapping, and an older guy would immediately slit her throat and the throats of everyone else who kept him from leaving, because this place is clearly some kind of Hell, and there is no saving grace to it. None! No appeal at all, unless you were to run off the dorks. Its hard to imagine even kids accepting this, but maybe that's the way the filthy rich spoiled types think. And these are all filthy rich spoiled types, richer than anyone you probably ever met. (They had the money to gallivant across the globe nonchalantly.) One of the trio thinks he is forced to make love to Miss Super Ugly, and you'd feel sorry for him if it wasn't for the fact that her blackmail didn't make sense. Add to this the fact that the marijuana growers know this group of pompous pot smokers is there smoking up their profits, and are undoubtedly thinking of a way to control the business for themselves, and you have a laughable scenario. They might let some vagabonds stay there, or some poor locals, or some retired people, or anyone who has no interest in the marijuana. But to believe they'd let the people most likely to snitch, crowd them out, and take over their business, is impossible to believe under any circumstances. These dorks would have been eliminated from the game of life two seconds after they were discovered. The only saving grace is that the movie does show that the kids are dorks, and the place is a Hell. Still, the plot lacks any semblance of credibility, even in the world of Fantasy."

Moreover I'm not used to being moved by blood or violence in movies but here it was really unhealthy and made me feel sick and uneasy because they were completely gratuitous. I really watch lots of different films and even when they are not very interesting I never feel like leaving . That time I had to cling to my seat not to run away. Anyway I have at least had the great joy of hearing the most wonderful quote of this new millenium. Just picture yourself as a French boy swimming across the sea with your girlfriend and a new American pal.There's about one mile behind you, and one before. Of course, you suddenly feel like making a good joke. You pretend  a shark is attacking the girl. Of course, when he realizes you're just teasing him he's furious.Of course, he yells and tells you that's if that is French humour it's not a wonder French cinema can not be exported (?!!). Can you imagine the scene ? What would you answer if you were that French boy ? No idea ? Here it is : `What about Molière ?'. I couldn't stop laughing and I still would if I wasn't so disappointed. I like Guillaume Canet very much and I promise he's a very good actor. It is  so bad he should start his international career in such a bad movie. If you go and see the film be sure you're carrying  your sense of humour with you. If not, stay at home and watch TV."
"Crispy_Quartz","5","3","5","2 April 2015"," First half is tolerable, then DiCaprio jumps the shark
","The Beach (Fox, 2000, UK/USA) is a Danny Boyle drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard, a backpacking college student who gets lost in Thai ""paradise,"" after following the map of a wild-eyed man, Daffy (Robert Carlyle).<br/><br/>The film is nicely framed throughout, emphasizing the natural cycles of activity in Thailand proper and on the island. The dynamism of Thai urban nightlife is captured, the revelry, the stampeding of western tourists clad with backpacks and Birkenstocks. They chase adventure and experience before it's time to settle down into responsible, civilized Euro-American life. Boyle achieves a stylish look for the film mostly with night shots of the tourist hordes and in the shaded, alley-like bazaars in the urban Thai locations.<br/><br/>The initial scenes of the film follow Richard through these bazaars and shacks, before entering the last hostel he crashes at. Even when Richard is surrounded by locals, the environment feels despoiled by the unseen presence of more tourists. You almost get a sense that shots are alternating every so often between large Thai insects, snakes, monkeys, and sharks on one hand and tourists on the other. These first scenes are still a lot of fun, they're fresh. The dynamism of DiCaprio here might've been a boon to the Thai tourism industry.<br/><br/>Tourism's presented as something that overruns the local cultural ecology and is regarded as a type of spoiling and infestation. It destroys the beauty and authenticity of anything actually worth exploring. The allure of the Beach is it's hidden, this fact makes the place legendary, everyone's heard about it but nobody's been there, until Richard meets Daffy. Daffy, whose been to the Beach, gives Richard the map, but tells him to keep it to himself, this turns out to be Daffy's last command.<br/><br/>Richard hits the town, comes back, he can't open his door, and the beautiful Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) comes right on time to show Richard how to use his key. Just when Richard is ready to celebrate his prospects with Francoise, her smooth talking man Etienne (Guillaume Canet) shows up like a cold shower. Eventually, Richard tells them about the Beach and invites them to go with him. Before they take off, Richard makes a copy of the map and gives it to the people who'd invited him in from a storm when he'd lost the key to his cabin.<br/><br/>Richard, Fraincoise and Etienne finally get to the island with the Beach and it isn't easy. Once they make it through the mountains enveloping the island, they're enamored with a vast field of marijuana plants. Then they see it's being patrolled by rough-looking guards rocking bandannas, AK-47s and cute little leashed monkeys. They escape by getting low, snaking through the field and jumping past a waterfall into a lake.<br/><br/>Now they're in paradise and there's a small, diverse colony of people there. Tilda Swinton is Sal, who shines as the no bull***t president of paradise. This is a proverbial ""is it heaven? or is it hell?"" story. Everything starts out pleasant and unravels with time. Unfortunately, the film itself unravels the same way. They ""jump the shark,"" or more accurately knife the shark. The movie haphazardly refers to ""Heart of Darkness,"" and mentions group dynamics in the dialog without really letting them play out on screen, at best we get pair dynamics. Characters inexplicably fall off the map, especially Etienne who seems like a decent stand up guy.<br/><br/>The Beach doesn't seem to have any allure or hidden treasures behind what we see when we're first introduced to it. It's not because it turns out to be a hell instead of a paradise, the hell dimension isn't achieved in this film. When one character's suffering gets to be too much for the group, they put him out. There are scares and close calls, a few characters get hell, but the main characters manage to pack up and leave before total hellish misery shows itself. Without that element of total misery, it's hard to understand why they make their unanimous decision at the end.<br/><br/>The movie tries to convince us that Richard is the one who's descended into madness, when it's really Sal who we need to be watching out for. It's understandable why DiCaprio is the focal point of the film, he's just about in every scene, but allowing Sal some more time would've made more sense given the climax. The climax, by the way, was a major disappointment, Richard vacillates from psychosis to altruism in short order. Anyway if there are lessons, they're in why we can't have nice things... The treasured things in life are lost when we can't share them, and we easily forget about the nice things people did for us."

"nlytnd_1","4","3","5","8 December 2013"," I can't believe Leonard Dicaprio took this role! Perhaps it was better on paper, because this is a dreadful movie!!!
","I never watched this movie until now, because of the negative reviews it received. Recently I came across this movie again and noticed that there were several peeps out there who feel as though this movie is some sort of lost gem, so I decided to watch it, to my utmost regret. I honestly don't know how anyone could have liked this movie. This movie is extremely overrated for it to be a 6.5. Anywho, I have a feeling that Dicaprio put his faith in the director Danny Boyle (who directed trainspotting), when he accepted this role. There's just no way this could have been a good script, because the movie is absolutely dreadful. It has no direction, no point and is very boring, just like the beach they find. To sum up some elements of the film that were lame to the point of insanity. Richard (Dicaprio) comes across a crazy dude who gives him a map. He speaks of this tropical beach paradise, never mind the small society who occupies it or the marijuana fields guarded by dudes with machine guns. It couldn't be too great, it drove this dude crazy. Perhaps he too had to stand guard for a period of time in solitude, which is what will later drive Richard crazy for a selective period of time on the beach. Which leads us to another significant point of nonsense. So Richard gives a copy of the map to some surfer tourist dudes he meets while in Bangkok prior to himself knowing for sure if the place exists (not a problem). So why doesn't Richard just say to the psycho chick; ""witch, I gave them the copy of the map prior to knowing as to whether or not this place existed. How the hell was I supposed to know that their would be a small secret society who wanted it to keep the beach a secret?"" Anyways, for whatever reason the surfer dudes sit on the map for approx several months before they decide to seek out the beach. When they eventually seek out the beach and are at the approx. 1 mile swim away to get their, they are spotted by the nasty cult leader chick, who then makes Richard keep watch until they arrive on the beach. The period of time that Richard has to keep watch is unknown, but leads one to believe that it's several days to weeks. Why would the surfer dudes camp out for days to weeks across from their beach destination? They can't possibly be afraid of the swim they have surfboards for Fk sake. Anywho, there is so much ridiculousness in the movie I realize that it would be extremely lengthy to point it all out. But yes, it fails on every level. It's has no direction/pointless and it's just plain silly. All of which I could overlook if it wasn't also extremely boring. Even the beach paradise seems boring. This movie is so bad that it's almost worth watching, just to laugh at how awful and nonsensical it is. It's not quite Troll 2 or The Room, but it's not far from it."
"dielederhosen","2","3","5","19 July 2010"," A terrible adaptation of a great book.
","Everyone knows that the book is always better than the movie (there are exceptions...Fight Club comes to mind). The Beach is the BEST example of how Hollywood royally screws up a fantastic story.<br/><br/>Alex Garland's late 90s novel so perfectly captured the zeitgeist of 20-somethings looking for some adventure in their lives, but only finding the same kind of drama and social pressures that drove them to globe trot in the first place. The Beach is a very sure-handedly written work, both literate and full of action. I was a 20-something myself when I read it, just before I headed to Southeast Asia for a backpacking adventure of my own. In my circle of friends, everyone seemed to have read the book; my copy is long lost, one friend borrowed mine and never gave it back! Fast forward a few years and here comes Danny Boyle's adaptation. I can't decide if Leo DiCaprio was bad casting, but he's a decent actor anyway. Boyle is a very overrated director, but he manages to adapt some moments from the novel pretty well on screen--the fluorescent algae swim at night, the German who gets bit by a shark.<br/><br/>Slowly but surely, though, it's clear that the SCRIPT ADAPTATION for this film is God awful. Just terrible. And Alex Garland helped out with it, which I can't wrap my head around at all. Just to pick a few examples, Sal's boyfriend Bugs is deleted from the movie, so Leo has an affair with her (!). The tension between Richard and Bugs was a crucial part of the novel. And the book's downright apocalyptic finale is done in shorthand for the movie, and it's melodramatic and absurd; it's like a junior high school play.<br/><br/>The movie starts out fine, but by the end I almost threw my TV out the window. Terrible, terrible adaptation.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie OR read the book, read carefully: do NOT watch the movie, forget it exists. I suppose if you will never read the book, the movie might be OK, but if you read the book first, the movie will disappoint. READ THE BOOK INSTEAD."

This is exactly the culture of so many backpackers to Thailand - find the best remotest coolest place to get stoned and party.<br/><br/>I loved the part where DiCaprio acts out Apocalypse Now, smug in his superiority in actually messing with the working farmers, rather than sitting in a theatre watching the movie, completely uncaring about the consequences to anyone but himself.<br/><br/>But the best part is at the end, when he is back home and is completely unchanged from the people who never experienced what he has, except for a picture of his group partying.

A decade ago Leonardo Decaprio still had a lot to prove despite finding teen pin up status as the doomed peasant in Titanic and as one of the star crossed lovers in Romeo and Juliet. He proved he was capable of making a film that wasn't really any good at all.<br/><br/>Watching Tilda Swindon rave to Yeke Yeke was downright embarrassing. The scene where Leo's character Richard runs through the jungle in computer game style animation almost destroys the effort to keep taking the film seriously.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle gets to do an impression of a Glaswegian Junkie/alcoholic screaming his head off in a Thailand hotel corridor, smokes a joint with Leo boy and is seen later in a really stupid dream sequence (in the trailer, that said sequence is sold to the audience as an action segment with Carlyle waving a gun around and shouting at a scared Richard, so its a bit of a cheat)then he is never seen again.<br/><br/>The french actress was pretty and her in the ocean 'sex' scene had all the glamour of a Bounty advert.

"pfgpowell-1","3","3","5","8 July 2009"," Two-dimensional at best and at worst . . .
","First question: what's missing? Because something most certainly is, but it is rather hard to pin down quite what that might be. The mystery is that Danny Boyle knows how to make films and then some, but put aside the actual film itself — the acting, the direction, the locations, the action — and instead simply consider the story he tells and the themes he attempts to deal with and The Beach is, to put it mildly, a bit of a mess. Most of the ingredients are there — most, but not all — but mixed in such a way that, sad to say, the moral of The Beach doesn't add up to a row of beans. So why not? What was missing? I suspect that it made a better novel than it does a film. Novels allows the writer more freedom in many crucial ways (I imagine). Films rather tie you down and you run the risk of being far too literal. Every character in The Beach is, at best two-dimensional, and as far as characterisation and motivation are concerned we end up watching something which is closer to a cartoon than a film. Most of the characters are less than two-dimensional, they are one-dimensional, and that is a shame, because treated more sensitively and intelligently, and if it were perhaps less subject to commercial constraints — i.e. with 'heartthrob' Leonard DiCaprio as your main star, making money at the box office will have been very close to the top of the list of the producers' aspirations — there is a very good, very engaging and very thought-provoking film to be made from the material to hand. But The Beach simply isn't it and that by a long chalk. It needed subtlety and it has no subtlety, the central theme (reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies) needs space and time to develop. It is given none. I have no idea what leeway Danny Boyle had, and if he had a lot, the ultimate failure is his, given that he obviously intended to make several 'deep' points'. The story simply does not develop. Crucial scenes are simply presented and the viewer can take it or leave it. Characters do things, but their actions have no basis in their personality. Why did Daffy, the mad Scotsman played with relish by Robert Carlyle, feel the need to escape an apparent paradise and kill himself? There is not even the hint of an explanation. Sal, the apparent leader of those live in the commune, a strong woman with obvious fascist tendencies, should have been far more fleshed out. Who was she, why does this hippie behave so ruthlessly? And there are the members of the commune themselves, faceless to a man and woman: what happened to them that they can apparently with no scruples whatsoever banish one of their own after he becomes badly injured and starts dying of gagrene and they are unable to deal with the noise he makes. Such behaviour deserves at least to be analysed and explored, but Boyle does nothing of the kind. He simply presents it as fact and that is it. Then there is the apparent descent into madness of Richard: what is going on? It happens very fast, he does extraordinary things and finally even kills one of the commune — a murderous act which is ludicrously presented as a mercy killing — but there is neither rhyme nor reason to any of it. These are fatal flaws for a film with obvious pretensions to being 'deep' and which purports to deal with 'deep' ethical and moral quesitons. There are those, of course, who think that there is memorable significance in the lyrics of pop songs and for them The Beach is a reasonable actioner. At the end of the day it all depends what you want. All I can say is that given it's central theme of the ultimate corruptibility of man (and, most pertinently, woman) I was nowhere near getting what I wanted. Sorry. If a film sets itself up to deliver, it sure as hell must deliver, but The Beach delivers nothing but a potpurri of apparent significance. And that's not good enough."
"dead47548","8","3","5","10 January 2008"," Has it's flaws but I was pleasantly surprised.
","It's a fascinating film that delves into a whole bounty of themes (though this sometimes comes across as the film not really knowing what it wants to be, to me at least) and features a sensational performance from DiCaprio. I saw Richard as naive and selfish and really sitting on the border between man and boy, and I think this comes across wonderfully in Leo's performance. He has instances of extreme maturity (like saving the French couple from the drug farmers when they first arrive on the island) and then moments of extreme immaturity, like talking about Daffy being incinerated while laughing.<br/><br/>Some of the choices in the style were really tasteless from my perspective (the scene with Richard and Francoise making love in the water and the scene with Richard inside the video game being the two best examples) but these instances were rare. It does drag a little bit in the middle and the relationship between Richard and Sal seemed really soap opera-esquire but once he was forced into isolation it really picked up into my favorite part of the entire film. This extremely unique study of the isolation of someone who's not quite a man driving him insane was exceptional. His ability to adapt to the jungle while also playing immature little games is just another example of this boy/man battle that was constant throughout.<br/><br/>The main story of the film is a bit contrived (I never really bought into the ""hidden island paradise"" thing) and the ending was a bit ridiculous as well. The dialogue was pretty poor sometimes to the point of being cringe-worthy but DiCaprio's exceptional performance really helps to hold together some of the sub-par elements of the film; Tilda Swinton was also pretty great. Overall, I nit-picked at a lot of little things but I found it to be quite good."

","Shallow Grave was great, Trainspotting genius, The Beach, uhh mediocre.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILERS OK, the positives. The Beach has a totally original idea, some convincing performances, a reliable director and absolutely stunning visuals.<br/><br/>So why did I come away unconvinced? With those positives I should be raving about this film as I was of Boyle classics 'Trainspotting' and 'Shallow Grave'. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe it was the absence of Ewan. Or maybe The Baech is just not as good<br/><br/>The stage where Di Caprio (who did, despite what some will have you think, put in a solid performance) goes mad in the woods happens far too rapidly. After being so deliberate and  careful with the hour prior to this Boyle is careless here, as it appears Di caprio's character just suddenly snaps over one night alone in the woods. Boyle is better than that, as Christopher Eccleston's descent into madness in 'Shallow Grave' proves.<br/><br/>The film from this point seems to lose what it was aiming towards and is messy and ridculous leading to the final confrontation. The best bits seemed to originate from the fear and vicious attack of the sharks. The consequences for the wounded make for compelling viewing but are not central enough in the narrative and are therefore only brief. Inparticular when they are first swimming over to the 'paradise' island and the prank the couple play on Di Caprio about seeing 'a fin'. It is a superb example of paranoia and was well acted<br/><br/>The first half of this film is far better than the second.

","""The Beach"" is blessed with magnificent scenery and outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Darius Kronji. The cast are all up to the job, including many who are unknown to North American audiences. It is a shame that their talents are wasted on a script which is riddled with so many glaring loopholes:<br/><br/>1) The idyllic beach community, which the Leonardo daCaprio character and his two French friends discover, has apparently been in existence on this isolated island for 6 years. So how do they obtain their money for the periodic shopping trips to the Thai mainland for the little luxuries such as deoderants, batteries and Tampaxes which they cannot grow in Paradise?<br/><br/>2) The government of Paradise is always a problem. The Tilda Swinton character has apparently been accepted as the leader, but whether this was arranged by group consensus or sheer force of personality is never explained. It is never made clear how the various tiresome chores (housebuilding, gardening, fishing) are allocated and work enforced. As there are no unifying ideals in the community apart from the aimless pursuit of pleasure, it is hard to see how it could hold together for long.<br/><br/>3) There is a major problem when one of the fishermen who help support the community is badly injured. He is left to die in horrible agony in the jungle - out of sight, out of mind. The loathsome Swinton character fears that, if he was allowed to go to a mainland hospital, the ""secret"" of the island might leak out. The aimless community beach life carries on regardless. Most of the community raises no serious objection to this act of near-murder. Has no one else fallen sick or been injured in 6 years? Does no one consider what will happen to them if they fall sick?<br/><br/>4) The Tilda Swinton character is one of the dumbest, as well as one of the vilest, group leaders ever portrayed on film. She sleeps with the Leonardo character when they go to the Thai mainland for supplies - despite the fact that both have partners back on the island. She seemingly knows nothing about group dynamics and cares nothing about creating divisive jealousy in such a small and isolated community.<br/><br/>5) Although the group has apparently existed for 6 years, with cheerfully casual indulgence in sex all round, there are no children in the community. Also, none of the characters seems to have any family outside the island - or none they want to keep in touch with. If they care nothing for their biological families, how attached are they going to be to one other?<br/><br/>6) When more unwelcome newcomers discover the island, the leader orders the hapless Leonardo to recover their map and send them away. Does she think they are going to forget the location or fail to tell more outsiders about its existence?<br/><br/>I could go on all night about this crassly adolescent vision of an isolated model community, but no sane adult would want to live there or to pay good money to see this ludicrous movie."

"domiman","3","3","5","13 March 2000"," A movie only for die-hard Leo fans
","The last time most moviegoers saw Leonardo DiCaprio, he was Jack, frozen to death next to a sinking Titanic and a shivering Rose. It took the currents two years to carry him to Thailand and wash him ashore on ""The Beach,"" which supposedly represents heaven or paradise. At the end of this film, two realizations dawn on the audience: Paradise doesn't exist. And the currents didn't do anyone a favor when defrosting DiCaprio and returning him to the screen.<br/><br/>This time, ""Leo"" returns as Richard, an American who cuts all ties to explore the world and find adventure. Thailand seems the perfect place for him, with bustling streets, exotic beaches, and like-minded adventurous people. Initially, the film seems to pose the question of the purpose of traveling: Are we open-minded explorers, or just tourists looking for the familiar? And it comes up with an answer surprisingly critical of the nation that, thanks to McDonald's and Coke, has made it easy to settle for the familiar abroad. The adventurers in this movie come from England, France, or Scandinavia, rather than from America. Unfortunately, this challenge of the usual expectations of traveling already presents the only truly provoking thought.<br/><br/>In Thailand, Richard dives into the life of the street and meets fellow adventurers. One of them, Daffy, worn out by drugs and sun, tells him a story about a mysterious beach on an unpopulated island. Robert Carlyle, as Daffy, is a perfect cast; his role appears hardly different from the villain in the last James Bond movie. Before he commits suicide, he provides Richard with a map of this secret island. After convincing a French couple, Etienne and Francoise, to join him, the three set out on a dangerous journey to the hidden place. Upon their arrival, they find a small community of adventurers fulfilling their own dreams of paradise. A set of rules regulate their everyday life, mainly stressing the importance of the secret of its existence; overpopulation would endanger their small world. Predictably, rules are broken, and the realization that heaven doesn't exist, and paradise can turn into a nightmare, is so trivial that it's hard to believe this provides the only message of ""The Beach.""<br/><br/>The characters' preoccupation with the bright side of life stands out in the film. Beautiful nature (Thailand can expect a rise in tourists next summer), beautiful women (Virginie Ledoyen convinces as Kate Winslet's successor), and drug use make up the main part of the movie. At least the latter doesn't come as a surprise: director Danny Boyle is best known for his film ""Trainspotting."" The director's influence on ""The Beach"" remains, however, almost invisible, because it's ""Leo time"": DiCaprio's handprint is all over the movie. With confidential and superfluous addresses to the viewer, he draws him on his side, makes him a companion. Stealing a girlfriend, cheating, breaking the rules of the community, lying, and ultimately being responsible for the death of about half a dozen people makes for an impressive list of immoral achievements. Yet DiCaprio is cast as hero from beginning to end. The producers seemed to think that, just by being ""Leo,"" he would get away with it.<br/><br/>Maybe the concept works for the huge teen fan base he has attracted since Titanic. A more mature audience, however, has to question the morality presented in ""The Beach,"" and wonder what else DiCaprio will try to get away with . Wherever he will be washed ashore in his next movie -  after ""The Beach,"" he won't be able to rely on past credits anymore."

Visually the film is breathtaking, with the beach itself looking every bit as idyllic as it should, and the acting is excellent throughout.  Unfortunately there is a problem - everything else.  The plot is as gripping as lard, the characters, while excellently portrayed, are all miserable lowlifes.  DeCaprio's character particularly is a sniveling uncompassionate backstabber, which was a shame because it's the first time I've actually been impressed with his performance. All in all - Tragic."

","""Now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" That's practically the only interesting line from THE BEACH, an incredibly unconvincing and suspense-less film about a bunch of rich backpackers who stumble onto the ""perfect"" beach in Thailand.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to be the boy who goes wild in the jungle -- kind of like casting Hugh Grant to play Rambo. I don't want to say that Leo is a total girly-man -- I mean, I know he dates super models and he used to hang with a tough bunch of skateboarders who called themselves the p**sy posse -- but somehow watching him run up and down the jungle trails waving his big knife I just wanted to giggle. For about ten seconds. Then I got bored. For about two hours.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in all this darkness is shapely, statuesque and thoroughly charismatic Tilda Swinton. She plays Sal, the leader of the secluded beach community, who will do anything to protect her home. There's nothing giggly about her performance. She's utterly right. Tilda makes you buy that this woman is strong, smart, sensible, and utterly in control. That goes for her bedroom scenes with Leo, too. Though her motives for sleeping with him are somewhat cloudy, it's clear that she's the one making the decisions and that he responds almost against his will. There's something quite provocative about the way she takes him to bed, tires him out, and then says, ""now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" It's unsettling and unexpected and very, very sexy.<br/><br/>Now if only that scene could have lasted for two hours!"

","The Beach seems to be striving to tell us something about an era. Our heroes go to an island in SE Asia where rather heavily armed native farmers are growing a boatload of pot. Once they get past that danger, they encounter something we're led to think is like paradise.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>The farmers turn out to be capable of killing to protect their crop. They rationalize their aggression by pointing out that the profits feed their families. OK that's probably like the drug lords in SE Asia. And the paradise is full of sort-of-hippy types (a generation removed), so maybe the film is alluding to the Vietnam era? DiCaprio does a video-game-like scene where he goes crazy, which features some sort of tongue-in-cheek dialog from bad movies about Vietnam.<br/><br/>Phew. Hard to tell with this director, who seems to relish the disconnected sensations and dreamy mentations of multi-drug tripping.<br/><br/>Another interpretation might be this: America is like the pseudo-paradise, and the rest of the world, particularly the third world, is like the farmers, who agree to let the islanders have a paradise on their island world if they don't invite any more people.<br/><br/>Either the writers were grossly incompetent or they just wanted to point at a whole lot of things without resolving into any one thing. Or maybe the director just needed a vehicle to flash around some flesh and some dreamy scenery.<br/><br/>And then there's this third theory: the director is a Coen brothers wannabe. Yeah, I think that's it. Throw in a couple ideas from a Meatballs summer camp movie. And a scene quite a bit like one in Y Tu Mama Tambien. And a tribute to Jaws.<br/><br/>Like, maybe if we throw enough stuff at the audience, like Donnie Darko did, they'll dig it, they'll walk out dazed and confused.<br/><br/>This would be like a great drive-in movie by Ed Wood ... if there were any drive-ins left.<br/><br/>Oh heck, Dude, let's just go bowling."

","I really don't know what to say about this movie. I mean, I watched it with as much attention as possible. It just seemed like one of those movies you can forget about within days. Leo DiCaprio has some skill, and his performance in this movie is about on par with his Titanic role. He's not my favorite actor, but I don't judge actors by favoritism. I think I basically watched this movie because at the time, I was interested in finding out more about Virginie Ledoyen, the french actress who stars in this movie alongside DiCaprio and the rest of a relatively no-name cast.<br/><br/>There were some action-like scenes, but nothing to really make a fuss about.

","Another film that took a beating from the critics but wasn't really all that bad. It has gorgeous cinematography of exotic locations and has what is probably the best soundtrack for a film that I have ever owned. What it has going against it is a cast of sniveling little teenagers who think that acting like hippies and smoking reefer on a beach that never ends is the equivalent to living a free-spirited life away from the concerns of a terrifying modern world. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young twenty-something with nowhere to go in life who while on vacation in Thailand hooks up with two French tourists (Guillaume Canet, Virginie Ledoyen) and together they follow a treasure map given to him by the crazed man in the next hotel room (cameo by Robert Carlyle). Where the map takes them is a pure, gorgeous stretch of beach inhabited by the aforementioned hedonists who watched too many Brady Bunch episodes as children and just can't let them go. Since the destruction of this paradise is obvious from the beginning, every cast member's surprise at how things turn out is really annoying. Leo does alright though, and Virginie Ledoyen is quite lovely, but the standout in the cast is British actress Tilda Swinton, here starring in one of her first major studio films. Unfortunately for this film's box-office failure, it will be a while before mainstream American audiences get to know her, but I'm sure with her immense talent and beauty it will happen soon."

","Alex Garlands book was first published in 1995, the same year I set out with my future husband on a 2 year round the world backpacking trip, which was a profound & not altogether pleasent expierence. I got ameobic dysentry in Kathmandu, slipped & smashed my head open on a wet toilet floor in Bombay (now Mumbi) & on a bus journey, had a head on collision with a 10 ton truck on the side of a mountain near the Tibetan border, where I literally saw the words ""Game Over"" pop up in my eyes! But I also learned that backpackers of my era & the time frame of the Beach (1990's) were not very nice people.. This (by accident or by design) certainly comes across in The Beach!<br/><br/>The characters in the Beach (in particular Richard) are the most obnoxious, self centered, ego driven bunch of oddballs ever to grace any film. However Tilda Swinton as creepily unhinged leader Sal, gives an amazing performance, making this movie worth a watch. Di Caprio, on the other hand, is wooden, & very unrelatable as Richard. His occasional over acting is also irritating. The basic screenplay is equally unconvincing (I have seen it done it & bought the t shirt) as backpackers would never congregate with other backpackers in a secret commune. The reason is that each backpacker of my time liked to think their own expierence is unique, special, & never been done before. Real backpackers are ""travel snobs"" who are loath to admit that they cannot live without their western creature comforts, which is only breifly explored in the Beach. Backpackers will congregate in places where those western creature comforts are catered for, like Kho San Road in Bangkok. Their food is chips (fries) burgers & hot dogs, their entertainment is Hollywood movies, yet they dress in outlandish ""local"" clothes like Thai fishermans pants, badly tied sarongs & often looked like whacky clowns in tie dye! They have a parchent to eat their evening meals dressed only in beachwear & women sunbath topless with absolute no regard that this activity in Asia is considered offensive to the local culture. So I can well understand just why the Beach has such obnoxious characters, as it's not far from the truth. But a lot of this film remains unconvincing, like swimming in the open ocean in a straight line? No you would be carried by the current & miss the island entirely! Anyway the Beach ticks on quite nicely until it literally looses the plot in the second half of the film where Richard goes loopy & becomes Rambo & Super Mario at the same time. It is at this point, I quite frankly loose interest in this movie. It makes no sense, adds nothing to the plot & appears to be simply inserted to flesh out the film to an acceptable length of a movie.<br/><br/>Well i anyone is looking for a taste into what backpacking was like in the 90's, this movie almost takes you there...almost. But us backpackers did not live in communes & never would!"

","Review: The Beach (movie)<br/><br/>In nutshell The Beach is a random Hollywood movie, which could be worthwhile to pass the time if you don't have anything better to do, as my friends and I didn't. The yummy popcorn was far more gripping than the storyline (but don't give up on my review now. there is good stuff at the end!).<br/><br/>And why I got such letdown by it? Manly cause most of the story is I meanshallow and also too easily predictable. I also reckon that the author focused too much on Leonardo (who I think is a good actor), remaining too little space to the other good guys.<br/><br/>However, what I found really really breathtaking was the incredible set. The pristine island in Thailand was a stunning and perfect place for the hippie community, being this by far the best characteristic of the movie, therefore strongly inspiring myself to visit this paradise.<br/><br/>So, you should also have a go and see if you agree with me. It could be as well a good inspiration for those who are fed up with their lifestyles and are craving a bit of adventure! Cheers."

I think the only problem was Leo over acting a little in some scenes, and sounding like he had recorded the narration at 3 in the morning after he had been throwing up all night.<br/><br/>
***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The pace of the film was just right - it starts out calm, just showing a young man enjoying the freedom of travelling alone, and then it goes a bit deeper when his new 'friend' Daffy kills himself, leaving him a map to 'paradise'. At first, the island does seem like paradise - everyone loves it there, and they don't really have a care in the world. The first actual clue that this place wasn't all it's cracked up to be was when the guys get attacked by the shark. And is it just me, or does that music they play on that bit totally freak you out...?<br/><br/>***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I think this was beautifully filmed, and Leo looked great in it - despite being sometimes annoying.

","The Beach is an anti-tourism movie seen through the eyes of a tourist.<br/><br/>Both the film and the book follow the experiences of Richard, a young traveler looking to explore something outside the beaten roads most tourists follow. He catches wind of a secret, idyllic, untouched beach from ""Daffy Duck"" who kills himself shortly after. Richard then goes on to find this mystical beach but finds that paradise isn't all that it seems to be.<br/><br/>Some differences remain between the film and the book. Director Danny Boyle takes some artistic liberties that make the plot a bit different than Alex Garland's book. With this, Boyle is still able to build on Garland's initial points laid out in the book. Most changes are believable and the film can be enjoyed as a standalone. The artistic liberties Boyle takes also help drive the plot a bit faster than the book.<br/><br/>The casting of young Leonardo DiCaprio is genius as he seems to encapsulate the character of Richard well. The world-building of a dirty, rotten tourist hell that Richard wants to avoid is also well created. Audiences can see why residents at the beach want to keep it hidden from the outside world. Watching this movie also captures the ""tourist vs traveler"" mindsets perfectly well.<br/><br/>Outside all the positives that this film has to offer, this film has some flaws. Namely, the film itself isn't that exciting. It seems to miss the ""awe"" moment that Richard feels when he comes to the island. It also seems to force some plot points for the sake of moving the story. Some events seem forced and not believable.<br/><br/>Though there were some scenic moments, the film seems to be a collection of events from the book rather than a cohesive collection. And I find that this film's biggest flaw.<br/><br/>But I wouldn't blame this on Boyle's directing or DiCaprio's acting. Sometimes it's hard to create a book-to-film adaptation.<br/><br/>3/5.

","It's just ok. Not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but no masterpiece either. DiCaprio is as strong as ever (and manages to look younger than he does in Titanic despite it being 3 years after) and the classic Danny Boyle trippyness makes its way through. The upbeat ending clashes with the rest of the film and in general it's rather tonally confused."
"Floated2","5","1","1","6 April 2017"," Doesn't reach the heights it could
","Having not read or being familiar with the novel of which this film is based upon, I had a clear view and non-bias judgment based upon the film in a viewing. The Beach is somewhat looked upon as a forgettable or lesser known film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and a lesser Danny Boyle film. This is for obvious reasons. The film did poorly in the domestic box office but was able to make up its budget due to the foreign market (perhaps due to DiCaprio's starpower, since the Beach was his first film after Titanic). <br/><br/>The film has an interesting premise and somewhat decent plot, but it doesn't reach the proper levels that it could have. Not knowing how much is adapted based on the novel, it is more difficult in judging. However, the film is quite bland when watching despite its scenery. It felt more so like an early MTV based film than and actual mature Danny Boyle film. Leo plays an interesting character but besides him, we don't seem to care about the rest, and that hurts the film. The final 30 minutes or so fall downhill as it becomes tiresome and tedious in a bad way."
"Semisonic","5","1","1","21 August 2016"," Not your average trainspotting
","If we get to think about it, Danny Boyle's highest point as of 2000 was definitely the year 1996. Trainspotting was such a smash hit and a defining moment of the whole generation that it was just too tempting to try recreating its success. And, with a new emerging star of Leo DiCaprio, whose pretty face has been looking at us from the posters on the girl room walls ever since his Titanic days, the task seemed like a piece of cake: add some palms, beaches, spice it up with a French hottie and add some Robert Carlyle's brilliance as a cherry on top and a guarantee of the old-school spirit. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Or so they thought...<br/><br/>Some spirit you can't deny this film indeed. Boyle's signature upbeat techno soundtrack, lush imagery and the whole sense of an acid trip do make this film look like its director's older child. And even though DiCaprio of 2000 is more of his annoying adolescent self than of that solid and mature figure he's become later, he is natural enough that you don't have to wish Ewan McGregor was back at his place.<br/><br/>However, this time something's missing, some invisible but crucial glue that holds the story together and makes it evenly paced. Trainspotting was so amazing because it never dragged for a second. The Beach, on the other hand, feels much more jerky, combining the intensity-packed moments with outright droning or unnecessary filler. And while that depressing Scottish scenery could make even a filler look refreshingly novel, beaches of Thailand, although beautiful and calling, are more fulfilling for a tourist brochure than for a movie with a certain pretence of cultural weight.<br/><br/>Still, it's not the patches of horrible dialogue and ridiculous continuity that bring this film down. Apparently Danny Boyle is better at building a story than dismantling it. And since The Beach' plot reaches its paradisaical climax only halfway through the movie, desecrating this paradise and bringing us back to the mortal world was a paramount task. And that's where it all went haywire, with lack of logic, consistency and sometimes even basic sanity. When an organic utopia falls apart it's never pretty, but one doesn't have to turn it into a travesty.<br/><br/>All in all, The Beach is good at being a story of a spoilt kid's dream adventure going slightly sour. As for anything behind that pretty but shallow facade, like strong characters or a gritty story of their struggle for their ideals, don't hold your hopes too high."
"KnightsofNi11","6","1","1","28 November 2011"," Not a disaster, but low for Boyle
","Many people call The Beach Danny Boyle's weakest and most disappointing films. To those people I say, ""Hey... they can't all be perfect."" The Beach stars Leonardo DiCaprio, infamously snatching the role from Boyle favorite Ewan McGregor causing a dramatic fallout between the two, as Richard, a young guy who, while visiting Thailand, gets his hands on a map that leads to a mysterious island rumored to be a paradise. Richard meets two French tourists in his hotel and asks them to set out with him to find this elusive paradise. From here the film branches out into part romance, part adventure, part psychological thriller. It never really catches its footing and it never steers in a clear direction. It's not a disaster but it isn't an excellent film either.<br/><br/>There isn't much about The Beach that is noteworthy or memorable. It isn't terrible in any one department, it's just lacking in all departments. Visually it isn't anything terribly special. This may be because of the high expectations I have from eccentric visual mastermind, Danny Boyle. The Beach lacks his nuanced flare and incredibly unique quality to the style. The music selection for the film is admittedly neat, but the visuals are sub par in comparison.<br/><br/>But where The Beach really lacks is its poor script and uninteresting characters. There's nothing very compelling about this story and the characters don't engage your mind and nothing special really happens. The dialogue is often silly and unnatural and there are too many unrealistic changes of character tone. There are amateur mistakes being made here, such as when a character is fine one second but then gets overly angry just so that something irrational will happen in order to move the story along. The Beach doesn't flow naturally and a lot of what happens feels very forced. The acting is nothing special either. Tilda Swinton's role is really the only one worth mentioning, considering DiCaprio isn't much more than a pretty face in this movie. All of these faulty elements to The Beach certainly could have been much worse, but they don't make this film anything special.<br/><br/>To see a film of this low calibre from an auteur like Danny Boyle is always shocking, but it's simply what happens. They can't all be winners and The Beach is proof of that. But I can only rejoice in the fact that I can so easily forget about this dull little film by watching 28 Days Later..., 127 Hours, or Slumdog Millionaire instead."

But he slowly goes insane and the story culminates in the realization that there is no perfect Utopia and nothing good can last. It is not that this is a bad movie, but half of the time is spent drilling into the viewers mind how great it would be to have sex and smoke pot all the time. The movie could have and should have been shortened about 50 minutes and at a brisker pace would have been great. Instead we are left with a movie that starts out promising, the middle will make you scratch your head, and the ending will make you burn the disc.

The scenery was breathtaking...(although I can't award much credit to the director of photography on that one, considering any idiot in that region could just pic up a camera and roll...and it would turn out pretty) Don't get me wrong though..the D.O.P did a wonderful job!! The acting was really well done too, and some of you may not like the narrative voice over, but I enjoyed it. It allows the audience to read deeper into the thoughts of the characters, which if used correctly, can really push a plot line.  There were quite a few humorous sequences in the film (Video games anyone) that I thought were kinda interesting.<br/><br/>But enough about that!! I enjoyed this film, and if you are one of those guys who hates Leo, then I think you should see it anyway...because it's not fair to spite someone who's image is molded by the media (notice why he is NEVER at celebrity events...because HE hates all that c**p too...well, i'm assuming)"

","I have read some reviews about this movie which bashed the movie for being just about dopeheads on island.  Frankly, that is just not the case (though it did cause me to wait a few more days before I actually saw it.)  The movie is fairly good and deserves a rating a lot higher than the 4.2 it was at.  DiCaprio as ""Richard"" was perfect for his role, I mean who could forget the scene in the jungle where his insanity culminated in him freaking out the running girl by staring at her and making a sound like a snake. Another great shot was the video game sequence, occurring as Richard got bored and began running through the jungle was just priceless.  Anyways the thing that made the movie for me was Richard's descent into madness and his strange friendship with daffy. Now I must admit there was some cheesiness in the movie, but it seemed all to fit into place and was put there on purpose. I don't think this movie was as good as Trainspotting however it definitely in my books deserves a 8/10, if you don't believe me, then just rent it when it comes out either way its worth the money in my opinion."
"bladerunnerdek","8","1","1","14 February 2000"," Good but some lost potential
","Because Leonardo Di Caprio is such a huge star and cult figure, some people have begun to dismiss his work and underrate his abilities. Naturally films like "" Iron Mask "" don't help, but there is definately something in him that gives him the classic "" watchable "" attributes made famous by legends such as Jimmy Stewart and Clint Eastwood. No I am not comparing Leo to them , it's just an example. This movie by Danny Boyle (if you haven't seen his best effort Shallow Grave you should) is curiously uneasy from the start as we see Di Caprio arriving in Thailand alone and looking for adventure. The plot keeps moving along well enough, although it does take a little too long to get to the island. Also, nitpicking here, the island seems to me to be a little too convenient to get to.....I mean it's visible by binoculars from a tourist beach ( come on ! ) Once there the characters that have lived on the island, peaceably we learn with some ruthless drug-farmers, for six years , simply welcome the three newcomers with open arms. Another slightly annoying trait among the ""dwellers"" is they all seem<br/><br/>to be refugees from the eighties, smurky, mid thirty types fed up with the corporate world and universally yearning for nature. Aside from this though, Leonardo and the gorgeous Virginie Ledoyen hold our interest. The sense of comradeship only begins to deal with it's dark side, which would have really made the sense of danger and mystery more alluring, but we do see our hero descend into a self-imposed nightmare when he is strangely exiled by the leader of the group. In the end he comes to terms with what's going on when more strangers arrive and meet their fate at the hands of the farmers..... but the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfying . Director Boyle could have made the finale much more gripping and tense but instead lets us down easily, diminishing the initial menace the concept of the Beach wants to emit. Overall though, I would recommend this movie. If you wonder at Di Caprio and what all the fuss is about ........see him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape . Js"
"karma98","8","1","1","14 February 2000"," Give this film a chance
","This is probably a case where reading the book first is a distinct advantage in understanding some of what has been harshly described as ""incomprehensible"" events. This story is a parable, on many levels, and as such, is ripe with thought provoking, not to mention conversation provoking, material.  Isn't this one of the pleasures of seeing a film - the discussion it can foster?  I think many factors have influenced the critics: The desire for iconoclasm where Leo is concerned (many reviews editorialize with subjective comments about him);  the disappointment that the film is ""dark"" and not noble enough; and the fact that screenwriters have to make difficult choices; e.g., if the Vietnam/video game fascination had been more of a thread running throughout the film, as in the book, then perhaps some of Richard's behaviors would not have been perceived as ""incomprehensible"". In short, I think many things in this film were misunderstood.  I enjoyed this film on many levels, but maybe more so because I had read the book.  My husband thought it was ""great"".  I enjoyed the prerequisite ""Danny Boyle"" inventions which added an element of quirkiness.  (I also resent the sense that we have to practically apologize for liking this film!)  Richard's character is complex - needy, selfish, sensitive, sometimes cold...this translates as interesting and Leo portrayed him artfully.  Also, in a stroke of genius, the character of Sal was made even more interesting than in the book."

He plays a very stubborn, ignorant, and gutsy guy named Richard who searches for paradise on earth.  Soon he realizes that no matter how perfect a situation is, human error will always corrupt it.  Danny Boyle's intense camera sequences really help to project the appropriate feeling for certain parts in the movie.  I loved it.  It really made me realize how crazy our lifestyle is."

","Quite a good story but I must say that I am quite disappointed. That's mainly because I have read the book and there were many changes made in the screenplay.<br/><br/>I simply could NOT believe they left out Jed's character (a central character from the book) from the movie. Only the first hour of the movie follow closely to the book,  everything strayed away after the first hour. Right up to the end.<br/><br/>But as John Hodge (the screenwriter) had mentioned, ""Novels are subtle, screenplays blunt"". As in most adaptations, characters had  to be combined and many MAJOR changes were made (I wished the Richard-Francoise-Etienne triangle didn't turn out like what they did in the movie).<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good movie.. but I would strongly suggest to those who have not read the book go see the movie first, then read it.. or else you just might be a WEE BIT disappointed like yours truly."
"dierregi","5","3","6","8 October 2012"," Handsome and shallow
","""The Beach"" is a Di Caprio vehicle gone south. This is even more obvious 12 years after its original release. Di Caprio, then a baby-faced, attractive star, fresh from the success of Titanic, plays Richard a handsome backpacker in a postcard-pretty Thailand (minus the shabby hotel) populated by many other attractive youngsters.<br/><br/>Given the premises, this could have easily turned into an over-bloated ad for fizzy drinks, but luckily some darkness is infused into the story,via several bizarre plot twists. The first one involves Robert Carlyle, who worked already with Boyle in the glorious Trainspotting.<br/><br/>Carlyle's cameo is dark and disturbing. It takes place right at the beginning and it is a sign that all will not be well. The middle part is light-hearted. Richard gets acquainted with a couple of stunning-looking French models (I mean, tourists) and they travel searching for paradise on earth.<br/><br/>What they find is a sort of hippie community, living on a hidden beach, next door to a marijuana plantation guarded by armed thugs. Not my idea of paradise, but stillIf we forgot about the ominous signs, now it is time to get our memory refreshed.<br/><br/>The hippie colony is run by a weird Tilda Swinton (not a big stretch for her playing weirdo) and her iron fist will bring nothing but misfortune to everybody. Anyway, the hippies are not painted as altruistic and kind. They are more selfish, lazy people running away from responsibilities and their demise is welcomed with a feeling of retribution. The end feels abrupt and much over the top, compared with the relative mildness of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Di Caprio already showed strong acting skills, but the whole – thin – plot revolves too much around him and eventually collapses in its shallowness"

","Director Danny Boyle has since admitted this wasn't a very good film. It takes strong character to own up to one's mistakes, so for this he must be applauded. Anfortunately, myself and many other people had the misfortune to see it before we knew even the director didn't believe in it. The beach was marketed as some sort of conventional thriller/drama which would be the next showcase for heart-throb Leonardo Dicaprio following his huge success with Titanic. Had its makers gone ahead and made a conventional thriller, it might have at least been a box office success. But the finished product is a confused, fantasy-ridden film that tries to be much more introspective than it needs to be. That it is narrated by a character that is neither interesting nor believable only adds to the problem.<br/><br/>Leo plays an American tourist who finds himself alone and bored in a grimy Thailand hotel. A nutty guy from the room next door gives him a map to an island supposedly home to a new-age community with an endless supply of pot at their disposal. Leo is immediately intrigued by this map. Especially once this nut-job commits suicide. He and a young French couple follow the map and end up swimming out to this island and joining the community which really does exist. Personally, I would have turned around and swam back to the mainland after meeting the insufferable Euro-types that make up this community. They are led by Tilda Swinton who plays the same character she always does. An icy, witchy woman. At least she almost looks attractive in this film for a change. She has a strong-armed boyfriend who is a complete jerk. The rest of the island is patrolled by armed marijuana farmers who allow the community to exist as long is it doesn't allow too many new members or gives away their secret. Leo ends up sleeping with the young French woman. Her boyfriend doesn't seem too broken up about it. Not much of interest really happens after that. A couple guys who look like ABBA rejects are attacked by a shark. Probably revenge for Leo killing another shark. We've all seen the Jaws films, and apparently sharks DO take things personally.<br/><br/>Ughh. Since the film is so unfocused, its hard to write anything other than a rambling review. By the last 45 minutes, director Boyle has grown pretty desperate. He throws in animated sequences, fantasy killing sprees, you name it. Nothing any of the characters does by this point makes any sense. Sure, the film looks great, but how could it not with these locations to shoot in? Decaprio has never really impressed as an actor, and he certainly didn't have what it took back then to make us believe in his character. Maybe it helps to smoke pot, and then any true meaning in this film would become clear. Or at least its lack of focus wouldn't matter so much. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","I just read Alex Garland's highly readable and entertaining novel, and immediately went out and rented the film version. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was quite possibly the worst film adaptation I've ever seen. I became concerned after 15 minutes, pretty much gave up hope at 40 minutes, and stopped watching 2/3 of the way through in sheer disgust. They missed so many opportunities to make this a good film that I found myself clenching my teeth and my fists every time they f*cked it up. Which they did with astonishing frequency. The best parts of the novel, the most beautifully imagined, surreal, powerful, essential scenes are *nonexistent* in the film version, and the rest is needlessly changed around and incompetently adapted. Things that would have made sense in the book make no sense in the movie, because the scriptwriter apparently thought ""This would be cool!"" and changed around things that are essential for understanding later developments. Other times, they try to show extreme emotions and character flaws way too early in the film without any background to explain why these feelings or conditions exist in the characters. Instead of showing how the characters change over the course of their experiences, the filmmakers apparently thought they could save some time and effort by making them that way in the first place! There is none of the wonderfully subtle character development and gradual revelations that exist in the book. The result is a confused and totally mismanaged mess. I don't agree with the general maxim that voice-over always covers for bad writing, but that is completely obviously true in this particular film.<br/><br/>I really hope this gets remade in the future, by people who have some clue about what they're doing. The two partially redeeming qualities of the film are some moments of genuine humor and a few beautifully shot scenes. The rest is garbage. Completely inappropriate soundtrack, mangled script, an astonishingly bad performance by Leonardo DiCaprio... Save yourself 2 hours of torture and read the book instead."

I think that a lot of the negative feeling must arise from people hoping that Leonardo DiCaprio would make a bad movie because of his success with Titanic.  I think the problem is simply that this is not a mainstream movie, and it's just not going to appeal to a lot of people who have no taste for movies that require you to think. I think that Leo made quite a brave choice in doing this movie as he could have done anything he wanted.  If it wasn't for Leo being in it and the consequential hype surrounding this movie at the time of release, etc, it probably would have become a cult favorite.  Even now, I think there is a chance that it will be rediscovered in a few years."

","The Beach is a movie I saw and has grown on me. There are many aspects of the movie that seem to be an analogy to our real life. And many aspects that make you think about how we view things. I also see it as chasing Moby Dick, in this case paradise.<br/><br/>Short summary: A young man finds an island that is ""paradise"", which is a community living on a hidden beach. No rules, just fun. <br/><br/>The problem with paradise is kind of like asking someone if they would like to be happy all of the time. It is a paradox. Yes, you want to be happy all the time, but you can't because you would not know happiness if you were happy all of the time. <br/><br/>Do you want to live in a paradise? Yes, but it is a paradox. You can't have a paradise just like you can't be happy all of the time.<br/><br/>Richard finds this island through someone he met named Daffy. Daffy commits suicide after kind of going crazy from realizing the paradox of paradise. <br/><br/>Eventually Richard realizes this and becomes crazy, and then ""grows up"" and accepts the reality of things.<br/><br/>I found many thought provoking issues in this. The one that really stayed with me is the when the two members get attacked by the shark. One dies and the other lives but moans and groans in the community until they drag them outside the community and leave him to die. Richard narrates that ""as soon as he was out of sight and out of mind, the problem was solved"". I think about this with disabled people, mentally insane people, and especially the elders. If they are out of sight then we have no problems. Put the old folks in a home and be done with it.<br/><br/>Another issue I find interesting is the classic case of paradise is when you have no rules and you live however you want. But Richard finds this to not really be paradise after all. Kind of like a teenager that rebels and then finds out later in life that they were really correct on things. Not so simple.<br/><br/>In the end, I think Richard grows up and realizes paradise is not really paradise. He also finds his true self and accepts it.<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting and entertaining movie. Not award winning but worth the view. Enjoy!"
"tedg","Null","3","7","27 June 2011"," Exotic Adventures
","For me, when a film fails to engage me by itself, I jump up a level, in this case making it a chapter in the movie of the life of Danny Boyle. I like the guy. I like his instincts. He envisions worlds that resemble reality but which can only exist in cinema, and then he allows the world to emerge in cinematic constructions as if it were its own character.<br/><br/>This is an enticing way to invite us into a film, because it comes to us one with the means by which it comes to us. But this film failed, even by his measure. I think one reason is the heavy-handed control the producers asserted. Key elements of the cast, story and art design were beyond his control.<br/><br/>But still, you can see some missteps, and they become more obvious when you see how Boyle handled similar challenges in subsequent movies.<br/><br/>The exotic here simply does not impress as exotic. He fixed that in 'Slumdog.' There is the dramatic device of encounter with merciless nature as purifying. This is a questionable dynamic for a viewer to accept because accommodating it for living is expensive. Nonetheless, Boyle mastered this in 'Hours.' And then there is the more interesting and powerful notion of the 'inner movie' as it folds into the larger events. In this film, we have the idea of computer games. The writer makes an awkward conflation of desktop computers and hand-held gaming, and also email with gaming. But long before that, there are difficulties. The inner game Richard experiences when in his heart of darkness does not comply with what I will call Ted's law: that the difference between the viewer's comfortable world and the normal world of the film (here the community on the beach) should be the same as the difference between that world and the hallucinated one.<br/><br/>Boyle solved this amazingly effectively with his 'Sunshine,' which very much impressed me in this regard. But there is an inner hallucination in 'Hours' that works and the more contrived TeeVee show in 'Slumdog' that works as well. Both adjust to this rule, which seems to be a hard limit on our ability to comprehend narrative.<br/><br/>So I see this, not so much as Richard's story, but the story of Danny's disastrous encounter, and what he learned.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","I first saw this movie in Cinemas when it came out, and was originally very disappointed in it. However, after having the misfortune to see it again recently, I realise I was overly generous with my initial feelings about it.<br/><br/>The film is awful. The acting is uniformly bad, though the actors aren't helped by a dreadful script. It spends too much time pretending to be cool and admiring how supposedly hip it is, rather than telling an engaging story. The characters are cardboard, and thoroughly dislikable, though that description might be too flattering for Di Caprio's character of Richard. <br/><br/>At the start of the film we here a brief bored sounding voice-over by Di Caprio, where he states, 'My name is Richard. That's all you need to know.' It's possibly the most redundant and laughable use of voice-over I have ever heard. And the movie gradually gets worse from here on in.<br/><br/>Embarrassing 'fantasy' moments, such as when Richard abruptly goes insane, and the film turns into a bizarre computer game for a minute or so, drags the film down to new levels of cringeworthyness.<br/><br/>The ending is also terrible. Di Caprio is sitting in a fancy internet café somewhere, and downloads a picture he has been emailed - it is of all his old 'friends' from the island, in a group smiling at the camera. Di Caprio smiles at this, with a hint of nostalgia, as if to say it was great fun after all, and that perhaps the experience was even worthwhile. This, even though several of the people in the photograph died gruesome deaths, he killed one of them, was shunned by his mates, and had a gun pointed at his head by another (a disgusting character played by Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>I really can't stop thinking of enough bad things to say about this film, so I'll be generous and stop there.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle, why did you not retire after making this atrocity?"

It gave us just what Boyle said it would give us - the tension and suspense excluding the blood and gore.<br/><br/>I loved the followup ending because it was so true to the book. It gave us exactly the scene that we see in the last paragraph of the novel by Garland - he still hears from Keaty, he still thinks of Francoise, but Richard's expression told the story -  you could see his ""memory"" of the lessons he learned...the innocence he lost...are still vivid in his mind.<br/><br/>I thought the middle was edited poorly, and had no flow. The love triangle was not developed enough to make it worth while, but the fantastic first and last acts more than made up for it's middle act flaws! I thought the video sequence was a blast - it went along so well with the reasons why Richard's brain was so muddled: brought home the idea that Richard has no experience to draw on but his video game tactics when confronted with problems - it is his only background when making tough decisions about the problems he is now encountering....<br/><br/>The acting was fabulous from the supporting cast to Leonardo's brilliant performance. I loved Patterson Joseph as Keaty, and Guillame was so sweet as Etienne, Virginie has a natural screen presence and beauty that is so refreshing next to so many of those ""fake"" Hollywood actresses we are subjected to now, and Carlysle as usual was perfect in his madness. Tilda Swinton's Sal was everything I had imagined in the book, and I felt the twist in the relationship between she and Rich really did add something to the story that was missing in the book.....it gave Bugs a substantial reason to hate Rich, something the book never did.<br/><br/>Leonardo took us through this journey with amazing ease and honesty. Seeing him meeting challenge after challenge in this role with such accurate and precise brilliance makes me realise again what a gift he is. Paradise really only exists inside of one's soul..a soul at peace. Richard discovered that through his experience on The Beach, and boy, was it a trip!<br/><br/>I give the movie 4 of 5 stars."

","I did not have high hopes for this film. Coming off of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio was typecast as a teen heartthrob and everything about this film's marketing screamed that. I must have been watching something on HBO like a TV show and decided to watch this just to see how long I could put up with it. The first thing you realize, around the scene with Daffy, is that this definitely wasn't a teen movie. It's a very deep, complex film with a great story, a coming of age film that's...very realistic. I think after some years in college, I started to understand exactly the type of people who were on the island, because I went to college with a lot of people like that. The movie basically is a gigantic criticism of the sort of affluent trustafarians who backpack and go around the world frolicking and partying. The trustafarians are living in a bubble away from the natives, who are struggling to support their families. One scene in particular points out who the real bad guys in the movie were, and it's probably one of the most depressing in the history of film. <br/><br/>It's hard for me to get people to take me seriously to watch this film. Many saw the marketing for the film when it was released, the movie posters and won't give it a chance. It probably is one of my Top Ten movies, simply because of the many messages of the film. Many of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's early works are exceptional like this movie. Highly recommended."

","The Beach (2000)<br/><br/>You want to like this movie, for sure. It's about a dream come true, if if you've ever travelled even a little in this backpacker Gringo trail kind of way, you'll feel like you're there.<br/><br/>But then, it's also just a movie, and it shows an indulgence now and then, an implausibility not in the big idea (which is absurd--and digitally invented, by the way, the beach part), but in certain interactions. The people are implausible, the situation, the feel good idealism. When it goes bad, it's only in a ridiculous way (the first hint is when our star, Leonardo DiCaprio, defends himself from a shark and he gets blamed for making the shark angry).<br/><br/>The beach itself is a kind of tropical trope (I never thought I'd get the chance to say that--tropical trope, tropical trope). That is, it is only what perfect beaches are--protected sands, aqua waters, no bugs, no snakes, no poor natives trolling for alms. It's a kind of Club Med without the corporation. So naturally it's appealing, but only in a superficial way. And the whole movie echoes this obviousness, this shallowness. Even the big conflicts are kind storybook simplistic, and a bit silly, or overly sad (near the end, with the shootings). <br/><br/>DiCaprio is terrific, really likable. The other famous star is Tilda Swinton who does her best in a role that maybe didn't have room for much depth--she's the ruler queen of sorts. The others I didn't know (a couple are director Danny Boyle regulars, it seems). Oh, did I say Danny Boyle? Yes, this is a film by the guy who did Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting, both throbbing, excessive, and amazing movies in their own ways. And probably equally insensitive (to the poor in India, the anti-drug forces), so it's no surprise that he stepped on the toes of the locals when filming ""The Beach"" by bulldozing the beach and ignoring protests. (The big tsunami reshaped it back to what it was, a small consolation for that disaster.)<br/><br/>So, if you don't mind a lot of niggling issues and downright meaninglessness, and just want to fantasize a bit, you might enjoy a lot of this movie. You might settle for Cape Cod, though, if that's your second choice."

","Watching the Beach is like looking at a postcard from a tropical island: it is a pretty picture, but it is also paper thin, and nothing happens in it. <br/><br/>This motion picture left me disappointed. It starts off promisingly, but with each passing chapter (sometimes pair of chapters) the story grows more dull. The editing is clunky, the script is underwritten, the acting is more wooden than the trunk of a palm tree, and the ending is rushed and anti-climactic. The only thing this motion picture really has to sell are a handful of nice shots and a good score. <br/><br/>Judging by the sloppiness of the story telling, it is clear that The Beach is definitely one of those book adapted movies that butchered its source material. It is a story that could've amounted to so much more. There is too much narration and not enough intelligent dialogue, and every now and then, just when you think the film is becoming something good, it changes again. Individual scenes work well on their own, but not in the context of the whole story. Take for instance a love scene between Leo Dicaprio and the french girl he invites on his trip to a lost paradise in the South Pacific. It's a well directed charming little sequence, but unfortunately, that particular character relationship ends with the scene. <br/><br/>Another problem with the Beach is that it requires a strong compelling lead, which it does not have. Perhaps Leo was just too inexperienced as an actor at the time. The character feels like a nobody, and his persona is sold to us almost entirely through his narrative monologues which feature pretty scrappy lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>In the end, the Beach sets out with ambition but the trip is unsatisfying. It is weak and ineffective, and if it does nothing else, at least it will remind you of how far both Leo and director Danny Boyle have come since this."

","""The Beach"" has Danny Boyles signature and that is why I trustingly picked up this film at the DVD store to watch it. It was a big disappointment. Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting! What happened to him? In ""The Beach"" the characters are portrayed superficially. The story runs like this. Leonardo DiCaprio and two friends with the aid of a map go to an island (located somewhere in Thailand) and there find a beach in which there is community of people who ran away from civilization and are trying to live a new kind of life, without restraint and hypocrisy. The film shows the problems and conflicts of this community and the inner struggle going inside Leonardo DiCaprio(his thoughts and reflections are revealed by a voice in off). But the characters in this film have no depth at all. It is in reality a Hollywood movie. If you compare it with ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" this film really sinks in the sand.<br/><br/>""L'Auberge Espagnol"" and ""The Beach"" have some plot similarities. Both portray young people who try to live in a different way. In ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" the characters have a face and a name and we care about them. Now in ""The Beach"" the characters are cardboard people. The deep changes going inside Leonardo DiCaprio remain almost incomprehensible.<br/><br/>For those that want some adventure film with exotic locations ""The Beach"" is all right. You'll have your fun. But if you're looking for something more avoid ""The Beach""."

","Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing? Who cares as long as sexy Leo is shirtless. That alone probably sold this movie. Sad, but true. The fact that Mathew Perry's younger better looking lost brother takes off his shirt is enough to get a studio to waste millions of dollars.<br/><br/>Yeah sure Leo can act. But not here. Here he is playing himself. A big dull jerk. He should stop partying and get back to sharpening those acting chops.<br/><br/>The movie: It blows. It starts out good. But lots of movies start out good. It's easy to start a movie in the right direction. But this one beaches itself early and sits there flopping like a dying fish for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Do we want to be Fight Club? Lord of the Flies? Apocolypse Now? Midnight Express? What do we want to be cause we sure aren't original. The premise is too old to be original so it would of been better to pick an angle and go all the way with it.<br/><br/>If you want to go do the paradise turns to hell thing then do it. Don't stop halfway and decide to throw in a whole bunch of other junk.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle is a good director, I like most all of his other stuff. I even like A Life Less Ordinary. Which leads me to believe most of it can be blamed on Leo. Once Leo is involved you got unneeded clout and pressure. Will it be something the 14 girls can watch? Will they like it? Will they see it over and over? Danny Boyle and Leo seem to be such and odd pair. Leo used to be Danny Boyle material until Titanic (What's Eating gilbert Grape, Basketball Diaries). Then he was big studio property. He's no longer edgy just cocky.<br/><br/>Anyways. I wonder if this would of been better with Ewan Macgregor in the lead. Probably since Ewan is infinitely more likeable. There were some parts I liked. Like him killing the shark. Only because I hate sharks and I would love to be able to kill one if I was attacked. The music is good. The scenery is good but not incredible enough to spawn that type of devotion the characters have towards it.<br/><br/>Major problem was nobody was likeable. Except the French Guy. The only one who was a decent human being. The rest were arrogant obnoxious selfish cruel hipsters hiding from their yuppy fates.<br/><br/>Yet another reminder we are all flawed and bad people.<br/><br/>My response to this annoying trend in films: I watch movies to escape. I don't need to be reminded that people suck. I know they suck. Show me idealized heroes. So me people with character, integrity. So me tragedies. But make the hero have at least one really good quality please. These qualities don't need to be limited to Disney oversimplified portrayals.<br/><br/>This is a terrible review. It's all over the place.<br/><br/>
Kinda like the movie.<br/><br/>Skip this movie unless you're a 14 year old girl (who probabaly has already seen it) Rent Lord of the Flies instead. Either version; the old B+W is better though."
"dfranzen70","3","2","4","25 July 2000"," Beach plays like a fish out of water
","When Leonardo DiCaprio was riding the wave of Titanic's seemingly endless cashflow, he considered carefully which screen roles to pursue next. Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.<br/><br/>So what does the so-called ""King of the World"" choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.<br/><br/>This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.<br/><br/>As for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.<br/><br/>I won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.<br/><br/>Your best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic."

The idea that people sneek in, that the society is all fun and games (and not killing, hence different/take-off of lord of the flies), that people cannot leave (they are in or out of the society to stay), make this a skulls/lord of the flies hybrid, with almost limitless possibilities.<br/><br/>However, as the location can go nowhere, neither does the story. Apparently, the love interest, the friends who came with the map, and the funny shopping trips are supposed to add to the story.

"David Fick","6","2","4","21 February 2000"," (6/10) Pretty pictures - but little substance in this adaptation
","The Beach, Danny Boyle's new film, is a philosophical exploration of the concept of Paradise.  A postmodernist slice of life is served up with splendid cinematography, stunning locations and a cast that tries very hard. But the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel is underdeveloped, not allowing much scope - or script - with which the actors can work.<br/><br/>The basic plot follows Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his quest for finding something different.  When a raving lunatic (Robert Carlyle) provides a map to a paradisiacal island, Richard sets off to find the place, with two French tourists (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) in tow.  They find the beach, which indeed seems to be a heaven on earth, and are inducted into the multi-national community under the instruction of its matriarch, Sal (Tilda Swinton).  The question is: how long can this paradise last before it is lost?<br/><br/>DiCaprio does as much as he can with the rather shallow character of Richard - this actor is developing his skills quite admirably, although none of the anti-DiCaprians would care to admit this.  He layers his performance with a nice dash of cynicism - just enough to balance the idealistic world which is presented to the audience.  Swinton is impressive as Sal, in a very Apocalypse Now-type character and neatly captures the conflicting values of what it takes to preserve their paradise.  Ledoyen has little to do but look alluring and Canet, as her husband, is wasted in what could have been developed into a solid subplot.  Carlyle is perfect in his cameo as the man who provides the means for finding the island.<br/><br/>Boyle has set a credible standard with Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, but does not provide a similar film ""experience"" with The Beach.  Much of the fault lies with John Hodge's superficial screenplay, which skims over Garland's book and tries to soften the blows which are dealt in that text. Although there are very good sequences within the film, the piece jars as a whole and really drags through the middle of the story.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie, falling short as a result of the lack in balance between story and pictures.  The pictures are nice, but a substantial story is what should be provided as a solid basis for any film - we are after all adult audiences watching a film about grown up issues."

","Two great performances in this movie, by Leonardo DeCaprio and Robert Carlyle, and it has an interesting plot that could have worked better. In the commentary Boyle explains that he generally avoids back-story, which is undoubtedly a sound approach, especially in thrillers. But the drawback in this movie is that everything ends up in the same dimension. Nothing is in relief, nothing in the plot casts shadow or throws light. This happens and then that happens and for what reason and anticipating what end aren't very important. Basic storytelling starts with character X wanting something. Boyle's first movie, Shallow Grave, is such a fine movie because of how well that principle is put into effect. In that case, the thing wanted, i.e., the money, is basic and self-explanatory as a motivation.<br/><br/>The characters in The Beach are drifters and pleasure-seekers to whom nothing seems like such a big deal. I have no idea how you can build a thriller around that, but one thing I know would have helped would have been to give the actors better-drawn characters to work with. Some pretty terrific actors, including Virginie Ledoyen, Patterson Joseph and above all Tilda Swinton, are wasted in underwritten roles here. They do interesting things from time to time, but they always fade almost immediately until they are brought forward again to serve the plot. The movie feels like a showpiece for DiCaprio (and, briefly, Carlyle), and his acting is remarkable, especially considering that the writing of his character is pretty unfocused too. I recommend this movie for his performance."

","The original book of ""The Beach"" was an original work which when written in the late 90's was set in a slightly fictional world aimed at contrasting the filthy vibrancy of Bangkok with the peace and unspoilt tranquillity of the Islands of Thailand Surat Thani Province. What a shame the latter no longer exists having been overrun by commercialism and high-cost tourism!<br/><br/>Casting is very competent, most notably Carlile as ""Mickey Mouse"" who combines quirky with disturbed in exactly the right proportions. Less able, however is Di Caprio himself - his novice truly shows, and it is fortunate that his performances have improved steadily since the making of this film.<br/><br/>What a shame the film goes all ""Hollywood"" on us in introducing an intimate relationship between Richard (Di Caprio) and Francoise. Although an integral part of the film, nothing of this sort happened in the book, and the original story was a lot richer for it.<br/><br/>However, the book was ruined by arguably the most pitiful ending Garland has ever penned. Indeed, the most implausible and ridiculous ending of any book I think I've ever read.

","No matter what you think of it, Danny Boyle's ""The Beach"" deserves credit for not being forgotten, for still provoking discussion so many years after its release. I've never met anyone who has seen it who didn't have a clearly-formed opinion on it, nor anyone who had seen it but forgotten it. It has its defenders, but its reputation is still quite bad, and it's probably regarded as a turkey more often than it is defended as a misunderstood great.<br/><br/>Truth is, it's neither a complete disaster (although I haven't read the supposedly great book it's based on, which might affect my opinion) nor a great or even particularly good film. It's about half a watchable movie, mostly thanks to the first hour or so, which sets up the events of the final hour, and where DiCaprio is doing just fine with his role. The film starts entering turkey mode about an hour in, and reaches a climax of absurdity when DiCaprio, now morphed into Tarzan, is put in a stylized video game sequence. Come on Danny, we know you're better than that.<br/><br/>I actually like DiCaprio as an actor, but I'm not sure what the hell he's doing in about half of this movie, though he's hardly completely to blame, considering the half-baked, bizarre, screwed up freak of a script here. It seems like a good enough idea on paper: adapt cult novel using the same team that made ""Trainspotting"", also adapted from a cult novel, such a big hit (same producer, screenwriter, and director). Perhaps ""The Beach"" just shouldn't have been adapted, because the 'philosophy' here, and any supposed 'depth' ends up being absolutely ludicrous, and much of the latter half of the film is just plain bad. Still, I've seen too many truly bad films, ones where gouging my eyes out became an option half-way through, to hate this film. The first half is too watchable and it just looks too good to really be the complete disaster many say it is. It's a missed opportunity, but visually gorgeous and probably worth a curiosity viewing."

","I first saw The Beach maybe six years ago, and at the time thought it was a good enough film. It still is. However, I agree with most of the people who've posted comments about the movie that have also read the novel by Alex Garland.<br/><br/>After telling my friend about the movie, he said he'd read the novel a couple of years before, and he couldn't stop banging on about the severely altered and missing parts.<br/><br/>Now, let me say, I am quite accepting of movie versions of novels making one or two minor changes to the novel and leaving lesser incidents out, but this film took it to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Lead character Richard's nationality has been swapped from British to American and vice versa for Sal, the commune's leader-of-sorts. There is no inclusion at all in the movie of, for me, one of the novel's defining characters: Jed. Also, in the novel, Richard has no sexual relations with either Francoise or Sal(except for in his head). These are only a couple of the issues I had.<br/><br/>My final gripe is the alteration of the ending. There is no reason to change the finale of the novel. Sure it's depiction is rather graphic but if film classification boards allow films like Goodfellas and Fight Club (which is also based on a novel) to be released, then there is no valid reason at all to dramatically alter a superb ending in favour of a mundane, happy one that we've all seen a million times.<br/><br/>If you particularly love the film, I'd say don't read the book. You'd probably end up with an opinion similar to mine. If you love the book, you'll probably have seen the film, and will have many of the same issues that I do.<br/><br/>The novel is screaming out for a faithful adaptation."

The scriptwriters for some reason decided to only loosely base the events of the novel into the film and as a result this comes across as a rushed and poorly directed piece of work.<br/><br/>What immediately springs to mind is the main character Richard, who is portrayed not as the stereotypical English traveller that is intended by Alex Garland but by the fresh faced American Leonardo Di Caprio who it seems never has a hair out of place in the entire course of the film. But what most annoys me about this movie is the complete omission of Jed, a pivotal character in the novel who is for some bizarre reason expelled from the script.<br/><br/>So many aspects of the film lack the novels breathtaking tempo, and the detailed descriptions that can only be put across in a book fail to come through in the screenplay. All in all this film is exactly what Alex Garland was looking to avoid when writing in the sense that it is pure Hollywood, with none of the characters coming through as believable people in the context of the situation they find themselves."

It is about a group of youngsters fleeing from a frenzy society to form one of their own, and is good material leading to a profound narration, and Boyle uses his knowledge over the sublimation of messages and subtleties to accomplish it's goal: Society at it's most crude form develops, over a study of spatial behavior and human mentality, leadership and a poignant portrait of the Society's hierarchy and it's components.<br/><br/>This film is not conventional. It's about a form of discovery, when in the beach, a calm beach; we stay in contact with Nature and rediscover our most basic needs and desires. Boyle straps every character into the magnifying glass and delivers an unorthodox masterpiece."

","Let's start with the good points of the movie: -Leonardo DiCaprio (duh) -Beautiful island, waterfall, beach, longhouse.<br/><br/>But I do hate this movie for ruining the book. They changed the plot too much, and all-in-all I don't really mind that too much. But they completely missed the point of the book, and the filming didn't show any of the mystery atmosphere that I felt when I read the book. The only good idea in the filming department that I saw was how they showed Richard's game of picking dope as a computer game. But I was disappointed about how Mr. Duck played a very small role in the movie, and his accent stopped me from actually understanding a single word he was saying (DVD had no subtitles). And another big disappointment- they completely missed out Jed, one of the main characters! But, I guess, this movie would seem better to me if I hadn't read the book first. I kept comparing the two which distracted me from enjoying it. Conclusion: The movie is watchable, but the book is so much better. The film-makers wanted to make the movie more 'Hollywood' (love affairs, overdramatised action scenes, etc.) and ended up twisting the plot too much and missed the actual point and atmosphere of the book."

","The beach is a story about the search for paradise and perfection, and what it takes to sustain it. I've never read the book, so I watched the film with no preconceptions.<br/><br/>A completely mad 'daffy' excellently portrayed by Carlyle tells fellow tourist 'Richard' played by DiCaprio of a fabled island, where the sky is always blue, pure white untouched sand lies on the beach, and where there's as much marijuana as you could ever smoke.  Seduced by Daffy's to-good-to-be-true description, Richard nevertheless takes along two fellow tourists, Francoise and Etienne to help him find the island.<br/><br/>Once the film has slickly arrived at it's basic premise; all the protagonists have been fully developed, and they're safely ensconced upon the island and settled within the community, the shadow from the opium farmers who share the island has been cast, and Richard's infatuation for Francois has been established, then the end game starts, and the film actually shifts down a gear. A film of two halfs; the second half seems to just run out of ideas and out of steam, introducing tacky elements like Richard becoming part of the computer game that he's always playing.  The music while being good seemed to be compensating for the poor narrative. For all it's large budget ($50m) towards the end of the film, to me it came across as a particularly well-rehearsed end of term school play. Everything seemed that obvious.<br/><br/>That's not to say I didn't like the film.  It had much merit. I couldn't fault the acting, especially DiCaprio. I liked the camera work(Darius Khondji). Some of the film of Thailand was so enticing - it almost made me want to find such an island.<br/><br/>The one scene that seemed to sum the whole film up for me though, was when Richard and Francoise are looking up at the stars through a telescope. Richard starts talking about the infinity of space and the possibility of parallel universes.  He describes how the chances must be quite high that someone out there could be looking back down at us in the same way as we're looking up at them.  And she floors his chat-up and romantic idealism with the words, 'Richard, this is just the kind of pretentious bull**** that Americans always say to French girls so they can sleep with them.'<br/><br/>
Ouch!<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'The Beach' is film that pretentiously tries so hard to be a great film,  yet that romantic idealism comes crashing down because it doesn't truly recognise what's necessary to make it work."

","Hi all. I saw The Beach a few years ago and really enjoyed it. Reading your remarks on the book versus the movie, I must agree that I enjoyed the book but I also enjoyed the movie (partly because I saw the movie and then read the book). In order for a book to be adapted to screen certian things need to be filtered out, and I think the Richard+Francoise coupling was more to do with commercial than artistic reasons. The target audience are teens, Leo fans (I am thinking girls here) and also affionados of the book, but if you have a big name star attached, you are more than willing to bend the adaptation to pull in the crowds...which is a pity because I liked the dark wit of the book which I think could have been converted to film without detracting too much from the tale of paradise found and lost. Now, a few years later, I have bought the DVD and much to my delight, there were included deleted scenes straight out of the pages of the book. It was a real pity to see that these scenes were not included because they are gems. The opening sequence and closing sequence are quite and slightly unsettling, giving one the impression straight from the outset and ending that this is going to be an edgy movie. The ending sees the islanders being picked up at sea by a cruise liner with Richard's voice over echoeing the 'scars' monologue. There is also a tribal scene where the whole community takes simple instruments and start to play a wicked tune. It really must be seen to be believed. Other deleted scenes of interest are when the trio arrive on the island and get passed the Thai guards on the dope field. You don't see it in the movie but you do see it in the book. The trio argue, Franciose and Ettiene expressing a real sense of fear, as one would if chased by Thais with AK47s. An explanation into the dementia of Daffy Duck is given by Sal on the rice run with Richard, a scene I think really could have been in the movie. The extras are available on Region 2 DVD but I think that they can also be found on Region 1 DVD. The movie was fun, and for all those who felt short changed by the movie, the DVD extras should allow you some solace."

","The first thing I have to say is that I haven't read Alex Garland's cult novel of the same name.  The second thing to say is that, on the film's merit alone, this is an entertaining movie. Much was expected of this movie, based upon the popularity of the novel, the talent of director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) and the adverse publicity attracted about the supposed destruction of  Thailand's natural habitat.  The movie starts off as a travel story - the wide-eyed and idealistic backpacker Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) discovering the wild and untamed Thailand.  Practically as soon as he arrives, he is confronted by the drugged-out Daffy (Robert Carlyle) - who we soon learn was one of the founder members of the Beach.  He gives Richard a map to this isolated paradise island, which he duly follows - apparently unperturbed by Daffy's violent suicide. Richard manages to rope in a lusted-after, pretty French girl (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend (Guillaume Canet) to accompany him on his adventure.  But after making the obligatory treacherous journey, they find that the paradise they arrive to is very different to what they imagined. From the start, there is a hint of imperfection.  Soon this escalates, as they notice that the island's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton), has a rather dictatorial rule over them. However, the plot isn't much to write home about, and from what I've heard, not a patch on the book either.  For instance, the chapter when Richard descends into madness is poorly scripted and gives the impression that Boyle is trying to be too surreal for his own good.  DiCaprio's narrative is also uninspired and therefore rather ineffective. However, this is not what I gave the film 8/10 for.  As a 'rehash' of a very cliched story - a false perfection - The Beach tells it quite well. The setting and scenery is beautiful, including one of the best long zoom-out shot I have ever seen.  I was disappointed to see that the film did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.  Leonardo DiCaprio also acts very well in this movie, proving that he is not just there to satisfy the hormonal rages of adolescent girls.  In my opinion, DiCaprio is probably one of the most talented actors of his generation around today. He is also well supported by the French duo, previously practically unheard of in the UK. This film is also very funny - although some jokes tend to be too obviously for comic relief - if not witty.  The Beach gives good entertainment value for money, despite being a bit too slow paced, and the image of the paradise shown will linger on in your minds.  Boyle's direction, as for so many of his films, is style over substance - and this time, it just about succeeds."

","Bit of a disappointment here I'm afraid. The book was riveting, but the film attempts to get away with Blu-Tack. ...(?)... As usual Leonardo Di Craprio is nauseatingly.....nauseating (why do people ever give him parts which require him to look happy?? He just looks so utterly stupid!). The plot is not very gripping, hardly any of the characters are fleshed out at all (because there are so many of them? the book certainly managed to include a lot more detail), and certain parts of the story are played upon too much at the expense of others (e.g. Daffy, who is dead, at the expense of Richard's relationships with Francoise, Sal, Keaty, etc). Watching it, I felt rather more analytical than usual, which probably demonstrates my lack of immersion in the film. The main problem for someone who has read the book is that so much is left out. Then I think of the people who haven't read it, and realise all that they are missing out on, because in just 2 hours they have seen something which may ruin their enjoyment of an excellent and thrilling novel.

","As an avid, British movie fan, the prospect of Figment's fourth movie outing, an adaptation of Alex Garland's stunning debut novel, excited me greatly.  Despite all the negative publicity, things seemed promising. Trainspotting, Figment's finest work, was also an adaptation of a cult novel, so I felt convinced that John Hodge (screenplay writer) would do a great job.  And I also felt that Leonardo was right for the role of Richard; and let's not forget, a great actor.  The trailers were wonderful: the cinematography appeared stunning, and the soundtrack sounded awesome.<br/><br/>So, on the opening night, there I was, expecting something wonderful.  And sadly, I was disappointed.  The film starts well, there's no denying it. For the first ten minutes or so I thought I was safe.  But after that, it just went downhill.  Yes, the cinematography, and indeed the cast, were as beautiful as the trailer promised.  And yes, the soundtrack was superb - Porcelain, noteably.  However, all the subtleties of character and complicated group dynamics which rendered the book so fascinating were totally removed.  Rather than opting for an intelligent adaptation of the book, Figment had gone for a grossly over-simplistic sex-on-the-beach story.<br/><br/>I don't blame Danny Boyle (director).  He does a fairly good job, and there are moments in the film which undeniably capture the spirit of the novel. I blame John Hodge, who I know is capable of so much more.  But Trainspotting was written for a British audience for reasons of artistic merit.  The Beach was written to keep Fox and Leonardo DiCaprio happy.  Their target audience was not cynical British fans of the book, such as myself, but for a worldwide market, and Leo's fans.  But I still feel they should have struck more of a balance.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film.  From the interviews with Leo that I read, he seemed to understand his character in the book very well.  And the first and last handful of scenes are just right.  Maybe I was wrong to expect Figment to be able to condense everything in the book into a film that wouldn't last about two and a half hours, with rambling voiceovers and the like, but I think if Figment were still making films for a small audience, and not trying to please the masses, this is what they would have done.  But having said that, if they were doing that, it's unlikely they could have afforded to do what they have.  So it's a no-win situation.  So it would appear that the process of making the film better reflects the impossibility of achieving perfection than the film itself."

He's a traveller who takes off for Thailand in search of something a little extra, the sort of experience you don't find on package holidays.<br/><br/>What he does find is a raving Scotsman called Daffy who tells him of a secluded island paradise with perfect waters and gorgeous sand. The next morning he is found dead having slashed his wrists. But Daffy's demise has not gone without purpose in this heady, intoxicating tale. Before he topped himself, the raving Scot left a map of how to get to the eponymous paradise on Leo's door.<br/><br/>So before you can say Wish you were here, Leo and a couple of neighbouring lovers (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) have taken off on a 500 mile journey in search of paradise.<br/><br/>Naturally they find the beach and after overcoming many obstacles such as surviving a death defying swim to the island, a perilous jump into a lagoon and a field full of cliched dope farmers with rifles, our trio of gorgeous young things happens across the idyllic utopia run by Sal (Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>She runs this community with a mixture of admirable precision and head girl bossiness. The deal is that those who live there have a taste of paradise and can play cricket, swim in the crystal waters and enjoy all that it has to offer as long as they don't tell anyone about the location.<br/><br/>Alas, poor old Dicky decided to leave a copy of the map with a bunch of dope head travellers who naturally decide to see for themselves.<br/><br/>Inevitably, they are gunned down by the hackneyed dope farmers and it soon becomes apparent that this paradise is guarded with an iron fist.<br/><br/>It's during the third act that John Hodge's screenplay goes off the rails and although it was inevitable that paradise would turn out to be a rather sour experience, the means with which Richard descends into an Apocalypse Now like madness and then finds things resolved with a Deer Hunter style game of Russian roulette smacks of been there, done that bought the Tee Shirt.<br/><br/>There's also an embarrassing moment in which our hero with well defined thumbs - he likes to play video games - goes native in the jungle and Danny Boyle delivers a cringe-making scene of a computerised Leo running around like some sort of Lara Croft character.<br/><br/>A pity that he would resort to such obvious analogies as Danny Boyle is one of the brightest hopes for British cinema - Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary have to be three of the finest home grown offerings of the last six years.<br/><br/>On the production side, the soundtrack is fine and All Saints' contribution, Pure Shores, is a likeable love theme. Darius Khondji, the genius who lit Se7en and Alien Resurrection, opts for his usual grainy style, but there's little sign of the inky blacks which made AR such a glorious cinematic experience.<br/><br/>By the finale, you won't feel short changed and there is a happy ending of sorts so the danger which went before makes this a sort of burger and fries movie where any real danger is severely compromised by a very black and white solution.<br/><br/>However, it's very easy on the eyes, Leo gives a good performance and the ensemble cast brings very little baggage to the production so much needed credibility is maintained for as long as possible before this paradise is lost for good in a mix of happy endings and all too comfy resolution."

","When I went to see ""The Beach"" I did so rather curiously than with high expectations, though it was the latest work of Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald. There were so many negative headlines surrounding the picture (the -according to the press- disastrous shootings in Thailand and Ewan McGregor going public with his disappointment about his friends jumping ship on him when they decided to give Leo the leading role), that I was just wondering if the film would reflect all this. First of all is the story basically interesting: the protagonists look for new excitement in their life and try to redeem themselves from the boredom of life in a society, which can't offer them new perspectives (a story element which had been described in Finchers ""Fight Club"" before). In the first half, ""The Beach"" is a decent film: you really get a sense for this alternative society and lifestyle thanks to Boyles understatement. Darius Khondjis cinematography is -as always- most impressive. The crux is the sudden change in the second part of the film: Since we haven't been given any clues before about the dark side of Richards character, this change in his personality and therefore the change in the tone of the picture comes the more unexpected and not plausible. There's a reference to ""Apocalypse Now"" but since the film leaves it to that, this storytwist simply doesn't work at all. I haven't read Garlands novel but since Hodge admitted to have shortened the plot (running time and so on..)I just suppose that the novel goes far more into details about Richard's innerlife and gives you a better preparation for what is to come. Moreover Boyles stylistic methods are inappropriate for the climax of the story: the video game references are ludicrous as basically the second part as a whole is strangely uninvolving. The result is a film, which -as ""Fight Club""- starts off in style but then derails terribly in the end. Truly, you recognize it as Danny Boyles film and not as Fox's picture, but despite that I hope that the trio comes back to Britain and make again the good films they became famous for (""Shallow Grave"" and in parts ""Trainspotting"")."

The creative team (esp. DP Darius Khondji) do a kick-ass job of translating a unique and timely story to the screen--only the surreal central section flags a bit--and Leo is extremely well cast as the boy whose seemingly innocent lies get him in deeper than he ever imagined.  Enough with the world-weary and the jealous who pick on the world's most harrassed star because he's an easy target.  What did you expect this movie to be?  Perhaps you'd be happier if Di Caprio had chosen to follow up Titanic with some safe movie like ""Hunt for Red October,"" or perhaps a teeny bopper flick like ""Down to You.""

During the ""idyllic paradise"" section, there wasn't much action, just the establishment of the beach community and the characters; I kept waiting for something to happen, and when it did (ie: Richard's breakdown), it seemed to come right out of leftfield-there had been no previous evidence to indicate that he would have a breakdown like that.  I read a little bit of the book in a bookstore, and right from the start it establishes the fascination Richard has with the Vietnam war and how his fantasies will eventually become reality, and I think the movie could have benefitted from a little foreshadowing. 	Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was good, not his best, but still good. Danny Boyle's direction seemed nonexistent until Richard's breakdown.  Up until then, there was nothing of Boyle's style to indicate that he was indeed directing the film, it looked like it could have been done by any director.  Somewhat disappointing. 	As far as Leo's return to the big screen goes, ""The Beach"" is just kind of mediocre....although he does look good without a shirt--sorry, just my hormones creeping in there, I'm actually a mature, intelligent adult.  Go see it for the Leo eye candy, otherwise, wait for video."

","Being a big Danny Boyle fan, I was a little disappoiinted by ""The Beach."" However, I must say the first 1/2 hour was as good as any work he has done in the past. The beginning let's you get to know and identify with Richard (Leonardo Dicaprio) a lost, uncomfortable American traveler, who, like so many is anxious to try something ""new."" The script by the always dependable John Hodge captures Richard's mood perfectly. Another fantastic element of ""The Beach"" is Robert Carlyle's appearence as Daffy, a spontaneous and exciting character who remains the real center of Richard's state of mind throughout his wild stay on the beach. <br/><br/>     After the first hour, however, the film begins to stumble as Richard's mood begins to shift and this transition simply feels too rushed. Dicaprio turns in a good performance, however the other characters remain rather flat. Even though the film is strictly about Richard and what he represents, they could have built more on his relationship with Etienne (Guillame Canet) and especially Francoise, (Virginie Ledoyen) not to mention the others on the beach. The film is also tremendously visual, as Boyle continues to make the settings just as large a part of the story as his characters.<br/><br/>
   By the end the themes feel complete,(They are reminiscent of some in ""Fight Club"" in an odd way) however the story comes up short."

I just don't understand why. For those read the book, and are reading this, don't you feel that there were great parts completly ommited?<br/><br/>For those who haven't, you saw a good film with a good-looking lead.

In the book, Etienne is someone you like and enjoy hearing in your head. In the film, Etienne seems to disapear after the first half-hour.<br/><br/>
There are dozens of other big problems, but to be honest, to me, it's just a shame. ""The Beach"" was brilliant as a book and just okay as a film---<br/><br/>p.s: LEONARDO DiCAPRIO is a great actor. But remember, when something is great, people knock it."

It says a lot about pop culture and Western influence spreading to every remote corner of the world.

Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous ""Trainspotting"". Then my teenage daughter came home from a party where she and her friends had watched it, and she said, ""It's brilliant! You HAVE to see it, Mum!""<br/><br/>So, we rented the video, and I'm glad we did. The Beach is an interesting and solid film that tells an intriguing, if somewhat episodic, story in a stylish way. DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for. This is a loss-of-innocence story, a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the musical The Fantastics. Director Danny Boyle leads us on Richard's journey to the Heart of Darkness in an energetic, stylish way--filming is interesting and beautiful--and he gets excellent results from his actors. The use of Richard's voice-over as narrative--often a distraction in films--here offers a certain amount of adolescent profundity and acuteness of observation, and it works.<br/><br/>I've been a traveller in Thailand. Although Richard's quest and Richard's scene wasn't mine, I've seen it...the beaches, the bars, the snake blood, the dope, the parties. I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover ""the real world"", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto. Many from New Zealand head off in their late teens/early twenties on ""The Great OE"" (Overseas Experience). The same is undoubtedly true for many Australians and Brits, if not so commonly for American youth. So there's a strong element of ""truth"" in this story.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the critics.

I cannot seriously think of a more beautiful woman in the world. With all the usual, stereotypical hollywood actresses with their 'fake' beauty, she brings something refreshing, exciting and quite frankly, 2000000 times more beautiful to the movie scene. If there is only one reason you watch this movie, let it be for her. Believe me the man who gets this woman (hopefully me) is the luckiest in the world. Her smile is that of an angel. As for the rest of the film, the beach is absolutely fantastic and could well be the ultimate paradise. Etienne has a wonderful part to play. But the one thing that did disappoint me about the film is the lack of screening the development of the relationship between Richard (Di Caprio) and Francoise (Ledoyen), there could have been so much more. And the fact that Richard even thought about having sex with Sal when he could have Francoise is beyond me. He could have been forgiven for telling anyone if he had gone back, instead he broke what could have been something great with the (i say<br/><br/>again) gorgeous beyond belief Francoise.

However it is as a result of this, that I do have one piece of advice which is if you value either's reputation in your regard or imagination, I implore you not to waste your time on this film, for both will be tarnished beyond recognition. Incidentally as a parting note I feel I must mention just how desperate I was prior to seeing the film, to enjoy it. Until this film Boyle was one of my all time favourite directors.

","DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If ""Lord of the Flies"" is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his ""Trainspotting"" insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes. If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try."

","""The Beach"" plays like a thousand and one vignettes from alternate, better versions of itself. Maybe Boyle meant something by the use of fragmented tone and plot, but the end result comes across as a messy and uninspired retread of Lord of the Flies and Apocalypse Now. <br/><br/>The technical credits are great and the performances are interesting, but neither the script nor the direction is able to convey any kind of significant tension, meaning, or tone. Individual sequences work (Robert Carlyle's bit, when the stoners are in the grass, Leo's shark monologue), but there's far too much silliness and incoherence in the air for anything to properly gel. I haven't read the book on which this is based, to be sure, but I can hardly imagine given the reviews I've read of it that it was anywhere near as overly sympathetic to Leo's character as this film is. And the ending - say what? Email my heart, indeed. I still think Boyle's got a lot of talent. Trainspotting rocked and A Life Less Ordinary was fun. This movie has my faith shaken, however. There are some stabs at good filmmaking here, but overall the direction seems confused and unwilling to give insight on its material. The incompetence seems preternaturally high for a big studio project with a talented director, writer, and cast - were there studio problems with this release? For Boyle's sake, I hope so. This is a true bomb."

It is in Boyle's style but it isn't suited to the film, if you have read the book then I'm sure you will agree that it could have been much better - the viewer should watch the film and then fail to understand how they could ever leave such a place.

True she was In last year's steamy Cruel intentions, but u never really saw anything.

","The Beach, from the makers of Trainspotting, is a film that possesses the magic quality in that it actually takes you to that idyllic and secluded island on which it was filmed. An enjoyable and exciting film, it is especially impactful on young people who are likely to connect with it's themes of leaving home, travelling and doing something you have never done before like drink snake's blood (in the film). The acting by lead Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as is that of beautiful newcomer to Hollywood (however a seasoned French actor) Virginie Ledoyen. These two are supported by an excellent cast that includes Robert Carlisle and Guillaume Canet. The directing by Danny Boyle reminds us that is one of the most exciting directors currently at work. The storyline is suspenseful and the end is definitely not what many expected. The cinematography captures the scenery amazingly and this is matched by a soundtrack that has to be one of the best this year including tracks by Underworld and Leftfield. The Beach shows the viewer what paradise is, how quickly it can be lost and to what lengths some people will go to find it and defend it from others. The Beach is an excellent film, definitely worth watching, 9/10."

","The Beach isn't one of the most impressive films I have seen in 2000, but it is easy to call The Beach a very good film. And a great one wouldn't be exaggerating either.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is backpacker Richard, who thinks he's worldly-wise, but is so ""the young American abroad"" when he seeks adventure and danger in Thailand. A strange encounter with crazed Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rants of a perfect, secret beach, seems the travel tip for him. And he recruits a French girl he fancies rotten (Virginie Ledoyen) and her amiable boyfriend (Guillaume Canet) to join him on a mysterious, funny, scary journey to the spectacularly beautiful haven. There Sal (Swinton) holds sway over a community of drop-outs who are kind of a cross between the Swiss Family Robinson and an apocalyptic water sport cult. <br/><br/>Although not one of the best films of 2000, The Beach is still an exotically engaging piece of work that results in the `Very, very good' column of filmmaking. Leonardo DiCaprio is electrifying as Richard, his performance lives long in the memory. DiCaprio is well supported by a largely unknown cast, Ledoyen, Swinton and Canet are all just as impressive. Danny Boyle once again gives us masterful directing effort, and the adaption from Alex Garland's novel wasn't bad, although it somehow loses its way towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, The Beach is a very recommendable Friday-nighter.<br/><br/>I rate The Beach 7 out of 10."

","I really enjoyed the first 40 or so minutes of ""The Beach."" Richard, Francoise and Etienne's journey to The Beach is full of fun, adventure and romance. Unfortunately, guess what happens about a third of the way into this movie? They find The Beach! And we quickly realize that, as is often the case, the journey was far more exciting than the destination.<br/><br/>Once at The Beach we find too many characters with too little to do. And while the movie focuses heavily upon Richard (Leo, of course) the other characters are largely forgotten. Even Francoise (played by the lovely Virginie Ledoyen), who is so vital to the first half of this movie, is largely forgotten in the second half.<br/><br/>The main failing of ""The Beach"" can be summed up by the character of Sal, the leader of The Beach. Without giving away the climatic moment of the movie, Sal becomes the pivotal character in that climax. However, we have learned so little about her up to that point that we simply have no emotional attachment to her character. The climax which should have been a ""Wow!"" is instead a ""Ho-hum.""<br/><br/>I suppose there are attempts here to make some political and social comments in regard to this utopia the characters have found, but I'm afraid this ain't no ""Lord of the Flies."" I wish the makers of this movie would start over from the top again. This time, have Richard and his friends keep searching, maybe come close, but never actually find The Beach."

","Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)- <br/><br/> - The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example). It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.<br/><br/> - One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions.

The actual film is confusing from the start, with no obvious direction until you get about half way into it. There's a sense up to that point that you want something -- ANYTHING -- to happen, and when it doesn't you want to give up on it. But, if you sit through it... it just seems to get worse. Leonardo DiCaprio's monotonous narrative quickly gets annoying. And, without giving anything away, Leo's character seems to cause an awful lot of problems for the people around him without ever accepting any responsibility for being a lame, whining, loser!

","DiCaprio is over exposed in this difficult movie dedicated to the psychology of the advanced backpacker. Some Backpackers do their time and go back to start their careers while some want to drag out the process. The constant search for better drugs, a better beach, a better party...  The locale is well researched. Dope growing in that area is a viable alternative to fishing. The ""Beach"" does exist but you don't need a secret map to find it. The problem with the film is that we get too much Leonardo. The film would have benefited from a more egalitarian distribution of screen time. Less star power and more characterization. Other characters are barely traced. To create the ""alternative universe"" we needed to get to know its members. The shark attack and aftermath would have had greater impact had we cared more for the unfortunates attacked. With DiCaprio recruited for the project it must have been too much to ask of the makers not to milk him for what it was worth despite the effect this had on the finished flick. Not having read the book I cannot comment on the adaptation, however I suspect that it is an individual's odyssey, which may be a problem for any film adaptation."

","The Beach is a good movie but it could have been better. The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise.

McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role. While DiCaprio is not a bad actor, he is not a good one either. He can't ruin a movie by himself, but he can't make it better. He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma. And that lack of charisma is made even more evident in the scenes between him and Robert Carlyle, which gives an awesome performance in a small role. When both actors are on screen, DiCaprio disappears. Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent. Her performance as FranÃ§oise is barely okay. The rest of the cast is good. Tilda Swinton shows the obsession of her character very well. There is, as in any Boyle movie, an excellent soundtrack which includes such artists as Moby, Blur, The Chemical Brothers, UNKLE, Asian Dub Foundation, Underworld and New Order. Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet). The photography is Oscar-worthy. As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one. Also, the love story is not very well done and too predictable. But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie.

","First things first:  Many of you will approach this movie with much trepidation - or not approach at all - because of the star.  But, he's really not as bad as you might think.  Di Caprio is swept up in a tale of a breathtaking paradise found and subsequently violently lost (a la ""Lord of The Flies"").<br/><br/>The first mention goes to Alex Garland and John Hodge.  Garland, who wrote an excellent novel (and actually worked as the cartographer for the map you see in the film) has been followed by a script which manages to maintain the major plot-points and keeps the shock impact of particular events.  In fact, some of the more interesting little touches (e.g. drinking ""Snakeblood"", and the lists of necessities given to Di Caprio's Richard before he leaves for the dreaded mainland) are absent in the original and solely invented by Hodge.  The dialogue is also a revelation, with many quotable standouts (e.g. ""And as for travelling alone, f**k it.  If that's the way it has to be, then that's the way it is).<br/><br/>My sole criticism (before I get to the praise) would be the final third of the movie when Richard turns his stint in the jungle into a hallucinatory and adrenalin-fuelled commando game. This is not properly signposted and therefore happens too soon, leaving those who have not read the novel rather bemused.  As we have lost the character of Jed (the general 'security guard') Richard's fixation with 'Nam movies needs to spelled out more clearly at the beginning of the movie (a one-second glimpse of ""Apocalypse Now"" is not enough), and his heady thrill of the action should be more enthusiastically and obviously portrayed.<br/><br/>OK, the overall experience is one of beauty, mystery and pure entertainment.  The cinematography is wonderful, as Darius Khondji (who couldn't be further from the dark and malevolent ""Se7en"") captures the idyllic splendour of the island perfectly and awe-inspiringly - don't miss the end credits either, where the photography is given time to breathe over the backing of UNKLE's ""Lonely Soul"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack is again outstanding, comprising Moby's tearful Porcelain with exclusives from Dario G, Faithless and Underworld.  The Boyle/Macdonald/Hodge team have always produced sensational soundtracks and here they score again.<br/><br/>The fresh cast are again pitch-perfect, with newcomers Virginie Ledoyen (as the object of Richard's affection) and Guillaume Canet standouts, while Tilda Swinton is intruiging as Sal (the community's obsessive leader).  In hindsight, Di Caprio suits the role more and gives a performance of considerably more aplomb than Titanic's Jack and Romeo and Juliet's, er, Romeo.<br/><br/>Go in with minimal expectations (as I did) and you will enjoy this; but if you really hate Di Caprio that much, just don't bother..."

","I have travelled. I am one of those who claim to be a traveller and not a tourist. When I was travelling around the Southern Hemisphere, my favourite companion was a famous book called The Beach. It really hit the nail on the head about what back-packing was like. A thoroughly enjoyable book that was famous among the travelling community. So as you can imagine, when I heard they were making a film version, I was looking forward to seeing it. However, I had heard a lot of things about how the film didn't stay true to the original story of the book, making me dread seeing it and wondering if that the magic will be lost forever. Another reason to be fearful was the fact that Richard is now an American. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it just didn't seem right. Having now seen the film, I am glad it got made. The photography is second-to-none and even though some of the characters (mainly Jed) were missing, and some of the story changed, it still works as a good adaption. After all, you can't fit everything into a two hour maximum screening.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is a competent actor, no matter how many people slag him off for his pretty-boy looks. He grasps the character of Richard with great vigour and is sufficently helped along by the strong support cast. It hardly matters that Richard is American, even though purists are bound to see this differntly. Overall a good, beautiful looking film with a story that holds your attention to the very end. There are a few downfalls, which I won't point out, because they are obvious and purists of the book will probably hate it, but don't they always."

The actual scenario was underplayed in the book and it bothers me when movies miss things in the book or add things in that didn't happen.  The Beach did both of those things.

","Less than sixty-seconds into Danny Boyle's paradise-lost story The Beach, and we already know we're in dangerously shallow water. ""My name is Richard,"" announces the tedious voice of our protagonist. ""So what else do you want to know?"" Presumably the question is rhetorical, but it surely doesn't make our souls feel less tested two hours down the road. Based on a mildly acclaimed 1997 novel by Alex Garland, The Beach has absolutely nothing to say, not a sentence, not two words, not a cough of profundity in its entire length--but it's going to talk away anyway.<br/><br/>But the movie is nothing more than harmless junk.  Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first major movie role in two years, does have his moments and, while none of them are perfect, this film ultimately proved that his supposed mighty post-Titanic power over Hollywood was wildly overestimated."

","3 words - Biggest Letdown Ever!<br/><br/>After seeing the beautiful trailers and listening to ""Pure Shores"" by All Saints I was so geared up to see this movie! And for the first 30 minutes I still had hope, that this might just turn out to be a movie close to my heart. After that nothing spectacular seemed to happen and then in the last 40 minutes the movie got sooooo screwed up it was hard to believe. It's like the writers said ""Oh what the hell, we aren't making anything really good so let's just really make it suck, that might work!!"" Leonardo is portrayed an as unethical sleazebag bummed-out liar, one gets the feeling that this actor can get only as good as his director - too bad there was no James Cameron to make him shine this time. Ledoyen barely has 12 lines to her credit and is so under-used we really can't pass judgement on her. The other performances are all very average. We don't really get to know any characters really well either. The only character who gets you to care about him is Etienne, played very well by Guillaume Canet, who too was by the way, under-used. Add some really unpleasant scenes of fresh shark chewed legs and stale gangrenous legs and you have something that you don't exactly want to encounter in your hunt for paradise. The dialog is simply juvenile and pathetic. It tries in a half-hearted and copy-cat way to be cool but fails MISERABLY! The location is question is undoubtably beautiful, the huge waterfall takes your breath away and so does the moonlit beach. One thing that put me off was that this beach was totally enclosed by huge rocky hills giving it a somewhat claustro feel. It was more a lake than a sea. An an eerie lake of death judging by it's man-eating inhabitants. Maybe they could shoot the next Jaws here. . . seriously! There are 2 kinds of people who'll want to see this movie, those interested in the concept of a sea-paradise and those crazed by Leo. I know the former will be let down. As for the latter, well it depends how crazed they are!"

When I finally got around to seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Sure enough, it was flawed, but the scenery was breathtaking, and the action was exciting. I never liked Leo, but I thought he was great in the role, and the same can be said for his French companions and most of the cast. I found the story particularly intriguing, and it was excellent most of the way. Towards the end it kind of derailed a little. I questioned the relevance of the entire part when Richard was isolated, because it wasn't done with enough subtlety and depth. Luckily the movie got back on track in time for the finale. But the strange transitions of the central character in between should have been done better. Overall, I thought it was worthwhile, enough for 4 out of 5."

"Oro-Indiano","Null","0","0","21 April 2000"," ""Parts of Darkness""
","The pedigree behind ""The Beach"" is such that by all accounts it should be a great film.  It should be, but somehow isn't, and the disappointment is bigger as a result of the expectation.  I'm not one of those people that whinges forever when books undergo changes on their way to the screen, but it seems that John Hodge has over-simplified an already relatively simple novel.  Others have detailed the changes and vented their spleens in that direction so I won't go into it, suffice it to say that there are several moments in the film where, as a direct result of those changes, things just don't make sense, and that weakens the movie.<br/><br/>That said, I didn't think the changes were as numerous as some people are claiming.  Significant yes, but not that many.  The problem I think lies in the fact that, bizarrely, it seems more realistic when you have to visualise it yourself as you do when reading the book.  Seeing it onscreen it all suddenly becomes so desperately and ridiculously melodramatic that it's harder to suspend disbelief.  Sure, the cinematography is great, but after a while it all becomes too much.  Half the fun of the book is that the beach is a state of mind, and that's just impossible to put on film.<br/><br/>The acting honours go to Robert Carlyle, whose ranting madman can't have been onscreen more than five minutes; but next to him every other character seemed paper-thin.  DiCaprio did a serviceable job, given the material. It doesn't so much matter that he is American here (and McGregor is too old for Richard anyway.) The problem was simply that Richard comes across as a total git; maybe that's the point, but in the book he was the one telling you everything, which made him sympathetic.<br/><br/>On the upside, there's soundtrack: new tracks from Leftfield, Underworld, Orbital and New Order all one CD?!  Boyle has always had a good ear, give or take the odd bum note (Ash, anyone?)  It's surprising, then, that in the film it seems so wishy-washy.  The squeaky drivel of All Saints' ""Pure Snores"" (sic) was layered prominently over the cheesy moonlight love swim, whilst a couple of the aforementioned great artists are relegated to a few seconds of background, coming out of someone's stereo.  Which is a shame. The best musical moment in the film comes when Richard revisits the mainland on the rice run and the tourist-trap neon nightmare is accompanied by The Chemicals' ""Out of Control"".<br/><br/>The least one could expect of Boyle is the odd flash of brilliance, and sure enough there is some striking imagery on hand to oblige, such as the trail of blood across the white sand.  And there are a couple of great surreal moments; the video game sequence was amusing - it would have been better if it had been set up more carefully.  The madness arc was for me the most interesting part, sadly it just came out of nowhere and was totally at odds with the lyrical, languid pace and style of the preceding 80-odd minutes. [And the endless ""Apocalypse Now"" gags wore thin.]  Again, they would have been better had Richard's 'Nam obsession been given even a passing mention beforehand; in fact, this is one area where making him an American could have helped.  Instead it was wasted. <br/><br/>The kindest word to describe this movie is ""uneven"".  When it's good it's okay, but when it's bad it's boring.  I'd love to know how much is down to the director and how much the studio interfered.  On reflection, I think they adapted the wrong Alex Garland book.  Just imagine what the ""Trainspotting"" team could have made of the multi-faceted philosophical gem ""The Tesseract""!  Maybe next time..."
"Sunny*","Null","0","0","17 April 2000"," A selfish paradise
","When I think of this movie, I remember a line at the end, where Richard talks about having been part of something amazing and perfect, or something to that effect. By that point in the movie, I was half-asleep and completely ready to leave. The beach inhabited by the characters doesn't represent any sort of utopian society, it's just a haven for selfish post-adolescents who have no interest in assuming social responsibility. Cavorting on a beach isn't really a valid way of life. The characters are poorly drawn and the plot is flimsy at best. The movie descends into nonsense by the time we reach Richard's animated Nintendo romp through the jungle. The end grinds to a painful halt and wraps itself up quickly by trying to affect a tense ending. At that point, you honestly don't care. Despite the occurrences on the beach, Richard remembers parts of it fondly at the end. I remember this movie fondly, similar to the way I might remember a tetanus shot or a root canal."
"braddass34","Null","0","0","14 April 2000"," Where is paradise?
","Where do you begin?  Where is paradise?  How do we get there?  What pushes us to strive for it, and what makes us fear it?  Danny Boyle tackles all of these questions in the tragically underrated ""The Beach.""<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic) undertakes the role of Richard, a lost soul searching for something among the hustle and bustle of Bankok's busy streets.  He finds a clue that might lead him to what he is searching for when he encounters Daffy, a madman played by Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty), who leaves him a map to a 'mythical' tropical island where paradise can be found.<br/><br/>Richard embarks on the journey to this place with two French confidants. The cinematography is outstanding, the paradise found feels like a paradise as the camera creates an IMAX view of God's natural beauty.<br/><br/>Richard undergoes many changes as he lives on this island and soon the changes he takes begin to make us wonder.  Where is the line between sanity and insanity?  Between game and life?  Between death and survival?  Power and struggle?  All of these questions are examined, but not all are answered.  The questions remain with us even after we leave the theater and we consider the symbolism and jokery of the film.<br/><br/>There is a scene in which Richard morphs into a Nintendo-esque version of himself as he hunts for something, isolated from the others.  It is wonderfully humorous and equally powerful.<br/><br/>Richard begins to take on a Hamlet persona as we question whether or not he has actually gone mad.<br/><br/>We wonder where paradise lies, and how do we get there.  But we also wonder, is it possible to keep?  Will evil follow?<br/><br/>I recommend ""The Beach"" highly and suggest you view it a second time to follow the meaning behind it if the mere beauty of the film leaves you in an awestruck state.  I admit the film is not perfect, as there is a hokey scene in which DiCaprio snares like a tiger.  It is difficult to pull off and I don't know if an actual tiger could do it.  The acting is terrific otherwise and it's an outstanding film that echoes the likes of ""Apocalypse Now."""

","I ignored the critics lukewarm reviews warnings and went to see this film, because I was a fan of Dicaprio, whose talents I greatly admired for some of his previous work.  Unfortunately, I don't predict this film will do well at the box office once word of mouth gets around.<br/><br/> The first half  to two-thirds of the film is tolerable, and Dicaprio's golden-boy charisma is is still evident.  There were some light moments and the story was moving forward, with Dicaprio's character `Richard' and his two friends joining a secret, secluded beach community.  However, at one point Dicaprio's character is effectively cast out from the group and reduced to isolated sentry duty.  It is at this point the movie takes an abrupt turn, with  the  character, `Richard' having hallucinations and generally acting weird.  The sudden change in the film's tone is confusing to the viewer.  There is no real tension or sense of danger, and the character's odd behavior is never really explained.  Then, just as suddenly, `Richard' snaps out of it and comes to his senses, and this leads to the films rather anti-climactic resolution.  (I was just relieved the weirdness was over).<br/><br/> Overall, the film's failure is primarily due to a weak script and poor direction, and unfortunately I cannot recommend this movie.   Although I could see glimmers of Dicaprio's talent in a few emotional scenes, at other moments in the film he seemed to be overacting.  I don't know if this was the due to the director's instructions or the actor's own interpretation.  Die-hard Leo fans:  save your money and wait for the video, where you can at least fast-forward through the boring parts.   Sorry Leo, better luck next time, and in the future be sure to choose your scripts and directors wisely."

","I had to force myself to go and see the film after reading all the bad reviews like ""it wasn't as good as the book"", ""Boyle doesn't live up to his Trainspotting potential"" etc. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This is actually a good film. it depicts what it is like out there, as anyone who has travelled through South-East Asia would have noticed. What did make me laugh was the way it depicted the thai resorts as new Sodom and gomorrahs. I did find this kind of snobbery out there and Di Caprio and his friends captured the so-called ""real travellers"" well. Searching for paradise and scorning anybody who goes the well trodden trail, but ending up their own arses and creating their own hell. Give me a beach party on Koh pang gan and a few months sharing the same life as Di Caprio and cohorts I'm not sure which I'd choose. The leader seemed a nightmare, Thatcher in a bikini, and she is the type of person I left England to escape from!!!<br/><br/>It was a very true depiction of what eventually happens in so called paradisical communities. Eventually the idiosynchrasies surface and groups self destruct due to personalities clashing. It doesn't matter if it's on a beach in Thailand or downtown London. paradise is not a place it's a state of mind!<br/><br/>One thing I think the film lacked is the way it only touched on the drug culture that goes on out there. I would have liked to have seen a few scenes on how much a part of the illusion is enhanced by the mushrooms. Which I can tell you are something else! I'm certain they influenced Alex garland who wrote the book. The film totally avoided the in-your-face sex-culture out there. But I suppose that's another film.<br/><br/>All in all, a beautifully filmed, well acted parable, that could have gone further, but was enough to satisfy. it certainly made me feel like dropping out and going on my travels again. Only this time I wouldn't waste my energy searching out Utopia. Basically, you have to accept that Thailand is commercialised, and will be more so after this film, just enjoy the beauty that is there and try not to be so cynical about the blatant exploitation of the tourist industry.

","What initially grabbed me about this film was its message.  It spoke to and for a generation that is so desensitized from anything visceral and real in this digitally enhanced world that it doesn't really have anywhere to turn but to adventure.  If they weren't going to find paradise within themselves, they would go and find it in material form.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio heads a mostly international cast in this wild adaptation of Alex Garland's critically acclaimed and, in my opinion, just plain brilliant novel of the same title.  For the script given, the actors do a tremendous job and the cinematography is simply breathtaking.  It could have been a silent film and the photography of Thailand's pristine Maya Bay would have been enough to hold most viewers' attention.<br/><br/>Some of the most enjoyable moments are made possible by characters who although do not have many lines, make a lasting impression on the audience and prove catalysts that set in motion the rest of the film.  Most notable are Daffy (Robert Carlyle), Sammy (Jerry Swindall), and Zeph (Peter Youngblood-Hills).<br/><br/>If you have read Alex Garland's book, you may be a bit disappointed in this film as I was upon first glance.  It is alarming that the film leaves out one of the books most influential and mysteriously engaging characters, Jed. Also, the insertion of romantic interludes between Richard and a few of the women on the island may throw the novel's fans for a loop.  And of course, the ending -- toned down beyond recognition.  <br/><br/>However, if you can get past these changes in the adaptation, and can see the underlying message that remains as true as it did in Garland's novel, you will enjoy the Beach thoroughly.  My advice is to view it with an open mind and take in the beauty of it.  It could have been improved in many ways, but it is still a gorgeous film with wonderful talent from not only the leads but also from the supporting actors, actresses and Beach Community Members without whom there would be no film."

","After Leonardo DiCaprio's very ordinary and in my opinion senseless academy nomination for his role in `Titanic', it took some time, till the rumours about his new film `The Beach' spread around. I mostly heard things like, they want to bring it into this years academy awards, or this whole environment stuff that went on because off the set building on the island. Next thing were the critics, when the film was released and their opinions about how worse `The Beach' was. Seeing the first trailer actually raised memories on `Lord of the flies' and quite weak stories about bad guys and good guys. Then the different opinions of my own friends and the belief in Leonardo as a quite good actor, as films before `Titanic' reflected, lead me into the cinema a few days ago.<br/><br/>And I was surprised how good this film actually was. The first few minutes showed an American Boy in a state of life, where we all want to travel around the world, escape from reality, school or university life. Just have fun and see what the world has to offer, if there is the possibility for a better life. The film had some interesting and realistic scenes from Asiatic city life, which partly reminded me, of Hong Kong. Then the idea was raised, that there might be an island, just perfect, incredible and unique. It is the reflection of a picture taken from a dream. And that's actually what the life on this island seems to be. People try to live a dream because they are sick of the hectically way our own society offers. I loved the camera images when Richard and Sal came back into the city. It was like entering a sick, wrong world. But the beach is peaceful and they try to keep it that way as long as possible. But as it is very natural, everything turns into chaos and nothing lasts forever. This maybe is cliché, but looking at the fact that even planet earth, won't be there anymore in the far future, gives a realistic, thrilling touch. The perfect dream is nothing more than a soap bubble. So reality bites in form of a shark, in form of Richard who gave the map of the island away. People were killed, the harmony totally destroyed and the dream is gone.<br/><br/>Richard himself is an interesting developing actor. Typical American kid, which is shown in his computer imaging mind, of the shark attack and the war game in the jungle. That's an interesting part of the film when Richard is supposed to get the map back. In his state of boredom, while not knowing what to do, he fades back into a computer society kid, that has nothing else to do when bored, than playing war games and stuff. He mixes this with the aim to get the card back and develops some kind of `fixed idea', that he might have learned so much strategy and hero images in computer games to reconstruct them which turns him nearly into a maniac.<br/><br/>The great camera work in the film, the acting and the plot are underlined by a wonderful soundtrack. And against most opinions I think this film is worth watching. At least to built an own opinion. I haven't read the book yet. But I'll put it on my `To-Do'-List."

Richard takes him up on the offer asking a young French couple, played by Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet, who also accept the offer.<br/><br/>The young travelers go on their journey and find the beach, which is inhabited by a whole village of 20 somethings.  Richard and company think they are in paradise but as the tagline says ""innocence never lasts forever"".<br/><br/>I'll leave the rest shot in the air because Richard goes on his own little surreal journey into madness, trying to fight what's real with what's not.<br/><br/>The film was well directed by Trainspotting alumni Danny Boyle but the story itself is simply lacking.  The film as a whole was put together well with beautiful cinematography, courtesy of the Thailand filming locations, but unfortunately it just wasn't written or told very well.  Sometimes that just happens. I do have to say that I did enjoy the ""videogame"" scene with Richard tramping through the woods.<br/><br/>All in all a well made film but lacking in story and plot.  ""The Beach"" just became very uninteresting once everybody stopped having fun because then neither do you.<br/><br/>6/10"

","What unutterable tosh.  The relationship to the book doesn't matter - though that was an undoubted page-turner, it was really just ""Lord Of The Flies"" meets ""Animal Farm"" and didn't deserve all its garlands - it's complete rubbish in its own right.<br/><br/>Di Caprio staked a bold claim to be the worst actor of his generation in ""Titanic"".  Here he delivers on that claim.  As stated before, the two lead women are good but can't rescue the film from the laughable performances of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The Keaty character is particularly cringeworthy.  Far from being the sympathetic friend, in the pursuit of trendiness they've tried to turn him into a witless ""know wha'I mean"" street boy.  It don't work, not least because you need to be really stupid to deliver this line with any conviction; you have to believe that the rest of us really might not understand your banalities.  From the first delivery of this unintentionally hilarious line, it was downhill all the way.<br/><br/>The ""computer game"" sequence makes no sense at all if you haven't read the book, as the film doesn't develop these aspects of the character at all.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this."

","With talented Director Danny Boyle calling the shots, with a best selling novel as material, and with arguably Hollywood's biggest star Leonardo Di Caprio as the lead, you'd be forgiven for expecting The Beach to be something a bit special.<br/><br/>I expected one of the films of the year. I left disappointed.<br/><br/>I should point out right away that I did read Garland's novel months earlier, and being a huge fan, it's quite hard to judge Boyle's film merely as a film. Making comparisons between film and book was almost impossible, so if faced with the choice between the two, I would recommend watching the film first.<br/><br/>To be fair, those experiencing the story for the first time through Boyle's film will probably find it quite entertaining. Certainly no classic, but watchable nonetheless, with some decent performances headed by Di Caprio, and some beautiful filming.<br/><br/>Fans of the novel though should prepare to be disappointed. The story is no where near as intriguing, several good supporting characters are left to just fade into the tropical background, and the actions of those who do hog all the camera time aren't true to Garland's excellent novel.<br/><br/>The most annoying example of this is Richard's eventual madness. While the novel has Richard's fears and suspicions of his apparent paradise developed gradually, Boyle has Richard seemingly fine and content one minute, and raving mad the next.<br/><br/>In addition, Richard's unrequited love for Francoise, the cause of some interesting, silent, sexual tension in the novel, is replaced by a passionate love triangle. Not content, with just this, Boyle decides to completely change Garland's story by adding a slight change to the ending.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, those unfamiliar with the story will probably enjoy the Beach, with it offering some simple, escapist entertainment with some sex appeal.<br/><br/>Garland fans won't be able to help feeling a little disappointed. This is a lazily constructed, loosely based adaptation, saved only by some half decent performances, some wonderful cinematography, and the obvious appeal of a bikini clad Virginie Ledoyen.<br/><br/>Not terrible, but a sad case of wasted potential."

The first hour is almost great,right from the very first shot. It's all very stylish, colourful,with an excellent cinematography.The  Carlyle cameo is very good, the female lead is pretty wonderful, Tilda Swinton plays Sal in exactly the way I expected the character to be, and DiCaprio is not everywhere. There are flaws here and there, of course:the screenplay doesn't follows the original story too much,Leo almost gets the girl-or should I say girls?-but all in all everything's shaping up quite nicely. Then everything goes wrong,and the last 30-40 minutes are almost embarrassing, from a gung-ho Leo to the confrontation with the drug dealers-completely different to what happens in the movie-to the final escape. Here,the movie loses its balance, It's Leo,Leo,Leo everywhere, and it all goes downhill. Too bad. Still, there are some beautiful moments, the cast is pretty nice, the soundtrack is fabulous,but it could have been much much better. Rating:6 Oh, and DiCaprio is not THAT great an actor, ok?"

","Let me preface this by saying ""DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE BEFORE YOU READ THE BOOK."" Luckily i read the book first.<br/><br/>First, it is totally unbelievable that they created the ""relationship"" between Richard and Francoise. The unrequited love for Francoise that Richard has in the book makes his descent into insanity that much more believable. Leo must have put in his contract that he had to have some ""love scenes"" His little fling with Sal would prove this theory. Both of these relationships are nowhere in the book.<br/><br/>What ever happened to Daffy? Almost every time Richard goes to sleep he sees visions of Daffy with his wrists slit. Daffy is the narrator of Richard's increasing madness. I know Boyle didn't want it to be as graphic as the book, but leaving out Daffy made Richards craziness even more unbelievable.<br/><br/>What about the chores too? One of the great conflicts in the Beach is the chores. The people who do the gardening hate it. They strive to be fishers. This conflict is heightened because Richard, Etienne, and Francoise start out fishing. When Richard has to lookout for the ""new arrivals"" everyone gets p***ed because he is not doing a chore. Not because they really want to know what he's doing. Logically people care more about themselves than what others are doing.<br/><br/>The list is longer than my patience. Inconsistency after inconsistency. I say again, read the book do not see the movie.<br/><br/>On a different note, the cinematography was not bad. Khondji has always delivered some good eye-candy and the Beach is no exception. Lots of candlelit scenes and of course sunny Thailand.<br/><br/>In summation, if you would like to see a good adaptation of beach Utopia gone awry watch the original B+W version of ""Lord of the Flies"" but whatever you do don't expect the Beach to be anything but Leo without his shirt on."

The ending was also poor, however the start was faultless, and well portrayed.<br/><br/>The film overall was okay, it had some interesting scenes, like DiCaprio, as a computer character, which added something most films lack.

It is under two hours, which is a nice change and it's rated R so it is not meant for a young audience.  The film itself shows a beautiful beach and many strange people living on it.  Unfortunately, the second half made me feel like I was watching a different movie.  Many movies have that effect these days.  It got really way out there.  I may as well have watched Apocalypse Now.  I think most of the hype on destroying the island is just to promote the movie as I have not seen any real proof anything was destroyed.

Sort of reminds me of William Golding's Lord of the Flies, or even Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Always this idea of an Island, a paradise, a false sense of loneliness, of independence.<br/><br/>I must confess I overall liked the movie. I particularly enjoyed that conjunction of sometimes poetic, sometimes violent music and image. Congratulations to Moby, to Underworld, for such gorgeous themes, and to Danny Boyle, for putting it all together, even though sometimes we wish the movie had been more than just a nice pop video.<br/><br/>I'm sure all the Yanni's and Vangelis' out there will love The Beach.

","There are a few spoilers ahead. You are now warned!<br/><br/>I read the book a while back and was impressed out of my pants! I have never read a book which appeared so real. What was the most amazing was his style of writing. I could just picture Richard, someone in my age group with similar back ground and similar values, talking to me about his experience over a couple of beer. So I reckoned that it would be a really difficult book to turn into a book and do as well. And here it was. I was disappointed with the film. It was very half way. It followed the book for some of the plots, but changed quite a lot of things. The book had events developing, leading us to some place. The film had many random events which seemed to go nowhere. Like the shark attack. That changed a lot of things in the book. In the movie, that seemed to do very little. It would have made no difference to the film if that was there or not. And Richard's involvement with Sal and Francois. That seemed to do nothing as well. In the book, his infatuation with Francois was interesting because nothing developed. Once they become a couple, it had no impact on the film. The ending of the film was very Hollywood. Richard screaming out philosophy of the beach did nothing for me. The ending in the book gave me nightmares. In the book, things went horribly wrong, so wrong, and was left like that. There was no big speal on justice.<br/><br/>All together, I think this film had a potential. Someone could have made a good love story, a good beach adventure/action, a very alternative or experimental film, or stick to the book and see if one could create the atmosphere of the book on film. But the movie was little bit of all of that, causing it to be half way at everything. It is a shame. It really should have been one thing, not pieces of many."

The story twists when this society breaks on the usual problems of mankind: power, love, weapons, physical injuries, etc.<br/><br/>The movie has wonderful nature shots of the island and the beach, a very good soundtrack (which i hear in my car from time to time), good act and brings the feeling of the story to life.

"freemantle_uk","4","2","5","29 June 2010"," Read the novel, it's a lot better then the film
","What could have gone wrong with The Beach? It was based on a popular, critically acclaimed novel, starred Leonardo Di Caprio, who was considered one of the world's biggest stars after Romeo + Juliet and Titanic and was directed by Danny Boyle who had won plaudits for Shallow Grave and the excellent Trainspotting. Well, many things, but at least Di Caprio and Boyle were able to bound back with great success.<br/><br/>Richard (Di Caprio) was an American traveller, landing in Bangkok, the starting point for many travellers going to South-East Asia. He goes to Thailand because he wants adventure and tries to avoid the usual tourist route. On his first day a mad Scotsman, Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), kills himself and leaves him a map to a small island with a legendary beach and lagoon. Richard befriends a young French couple, FranÃ§oise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Ã‰tienne (Guillaume Canet) and the two make their way onto the island. After a dangerous journey the three discover a commune of travellers, including the leader Sal (Tilda Swinton), her boyfriend Bugs (Lars Arentz-Hansen) and Keaty (Paterson Joseph), a Christian and a cricket fanatic. Life on the beach seems perfect, there is work to do but plenty of time to relax and to Richard it was what he wanted, a place away from the usual traveller crowd. But there are threats, the cannabis farmers who control the rest of the island, shark attacks whilst fishing and Richard's secret of giving the map to two surfers, Sammy and Zeph (Jerry Swindall and Peter Youngblood Hills). But Richard got what he wanted: adventure.<br/><br/>The main problem was that The Beach was too disloyal to original novel. There are minor things that were agreeable, like changing Richard's and Sal's appearance, maybe changing Sal from American to British. But most others did not work. One of the main things that affected the film was changing Richard from being English into an American and well the film suffers because of it. Some scenes like when Richard meets the surfers loose their impact, mainly because in the book the surfers pretend to be a stupid clichÃ© and both are actually very smart, but in the film they are both well, a stupid clichÃ©. We don't get to see how Richard's mind ticks, like his obsession with Vietnam war movies, he personal reasons for travelling and his dreams with Daffy. Other elements that ruined the film include cutting the character Jed from the novel, who was an important character, befriending Richard and acts at the beach's protector and an outsider to the community. Even if the character had to be cut his characteristics could have been implanted into someone else like Keaty. The film also skips over other story elements that drive the plot, like the food poisoning and how that led to a conflict between two camps within the community.<br/><br/>Acting wise the film does have some decent performances, like from the French actors Canat and Ledoyen and Swinton (who is normally a good actress). But it was Joseph who was the best of the cast, having excellent comic timing, even if his character was changed. But for Di Caprio this was one of his weakest performances. He was sadly quite wooden in the role and he just shouted a lot. We did not get to truly see why Richard was so excited about the prospect of adventure and it just felt hollowing, going through the motions. The actors who played the surfers were also noteworthy for weak performances.<br/><br/>The novel was very organic in its plotting, feeling real, even at times it did feel a little slow. But in the screenplay and the director the film felt like it wanted to rush through everything, taking away some of the natural nature of the book. A great example of this was how Richard invited Ã‰tienne and FranÃ§oise on the trips and their basic plans: there was no realism behind it.<br/><br/>There are some positives to the film. Boyle was able to add a little style into the film with some camera and editing tricks, like the camera going back quickly to reveal the waterfall and there are moments of tension and action with the cannabis farmers. Boyle also got the sense of the beach's hypnotic affects, making people forget about the outside word. There are also moments of comedy like when Keaty explains the rules of cricket. Boyle get the sense of what makes some travellers think, wanting to explore, party and partake in the local culture. It shows that Thailand has become very Westernised and that travellers are looking for the next big place before it is discovered and flooded by Westerners. I feel the same, I go on holiday to avoid English-people and I want to experience the local culture. Plus there is a good soundtrack, with the only good song by Moby as the signature track of the film. And there is some excellent cinematography and beautiful scenery throughout the film.<br/><br/>At Di Caprio was able to make Catch Me if You Can and Gangs of New York to kickstart his career after two flops (The Beach and The Man in the Iron Man). Boyle also somehow made friends with Alex Garland, the author of The Beach (which is very surprising) and two were able make 28 Days Later and Sunshine. So The Beach was not all doom and groom."

Maybe so on SOME islands, but Thailand so just happens to have EXTREMELY strict laws on drugs.<br/><br/>Taking so lightly on murder as they did in this one, and for that matter, drug abuse, is seriously way wrong.

I read the book in less than 2 days (it's 400+ pages long). Every time I stopped reading, I couldn't think of anything but what was going to happen next. So, after I finished the book, I watched the movie again.<br/><br/>Ugh. The movie is so much worse than I remember and completely different from the book.<br/><br/>***LOTS OF SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT*** Now, Leo isn't bad as Richard, but his character is supposed to be British!! And after checking IMDb, Ewan McGregor (who was supposed to play Richard) would have made a much better Richard.<br/><br/>In the book, there are a lot references to insanity and Apocalypse Now. Richard going insane in paradise is a great aspect of the story, but it's practically skipped over in the movie! In the book, Richard does a lot commando missions and spends a lot of time in the jungle, stealing weed from the dope farmers and talking to the ghost of Daffy (not booby traps). This is a great part of the book but the movie horribly butchers it. The homages to Apocalypse Now are sooo bad. The movie skips the details and plot build-up only to have Richard eating poisonous slugs and running around the jungle like he's in a video game?! And Banjo-Kazooie at that?! TERRIBLE! Prehaps the biggest offense is the character named Jed (or the lack thereof), who is one of the book's best characters but completely missing in the movie. In the book, Jed is a mysterious loner (Colonel Kurtz?). Richard is assigned to work with Jed and they do all sorts of commando missions, swim into underwater caves, and make the rice run together (not Richard and Sal -- poor excuse for a bad sex scene). Jed is a great character with a lot of good scenes and quotes -- WHY WOULD YOU CUT HIM OUT OF THE MOVIE!? The American surfers who get killed are also extremely messed up. They are not supposed to be retarded stoners, but Harvard kids who pretend to be stupid only to mess with snobby Europeans. Their stay on the nearby island is a huge part of the book and builds up to the climax SMOOTHLY. When they do make it to the island -- they aren't gunned down in the marijuana field. Instead, their fate is much MUCH MUCH more gruesome and theatrical (very Hitchcock like).<br/><br/>In fact, the ending of the movie is soo lame compared to the book. I won't go into great detail, but in the book, the ending features: a marijuana laced feast, discovering the fate of the American surfers, the death of a main character, the dope farmers don't kick everyone off the island, and a sum up of what happened to everyone after leaving the Beach.<br/><br/>In general, the movie is a terrible adaptation. It is made up of a lot of the more boring parts of the story and cuts out some of the best scenes. The plot was butchered by John Hodge and Danny Boyle for seemingly no reason. It really angers me to think that such a good book was so poorly translated onto the screen.<br/><br/>A much better version of The Beach must be made."

","While attempting to be a dark and thoughtful film, The Beach simply struggles to find a voice and to be taken seriously. There are some good ideas about disasters in paradise (or paradise at a cost), but these ideas have similarly been done before. The film makes an effort, but it struggles to capture the characters and overall meaning. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography. If they had put more emphasis on the characters and used the cinematography to capture the characters' feelings more appropriately, then this would have been worth watching. Instead, it just loses itself in paradise and in the pretty cheesy events."

But after all this strong points of the movie, I wondered - what's the point of ""The Beach"". It is obviously not ""just for fun"" and I really tried to figure its message. But I didn't find any. People go to a secret beach, live happily, than with shark attacks and drug farmers the dream becomes nightmare. Few of them die, they leave the beach. This is the film. A beautiful, well made, original, but... pointless. Still I recommend it and maybe you will find something I didn't."

Boyles' attempt to blend the film with his style (think video game scene for example) was completely unnecessary. Which, by the way, made DiCparo's character even less believable.

"San Franciscan","Null","2","5","19 September 2002"," It isn't as good as the book, but it's a great film nevertheless.
","I saw this movie on its opening day since its trailers and their overall premise fascinated me so much. The idea of a modern-day hippie adventure on an exotic island with psychedelic techno music blaring in the background somehow fascinated me (if you've seen my own artwork, you'd understand why. ;) ).<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed, and later I rushed out to devour the novel. I'm forced to admit that the film is nowhere near as gripping as Alex Garland's original material--that's because Hollywood decided to tamper with certain elements in an attempt to protect its own investment. But ""The Beach"" nevertheless remains a gripping film that still convincingly delivers its universal message.<br/><br/>WARNING: spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives another spellbinding performance as Richard, the young man who represents so much of today's generations, including my own, who feel that all the world has already been predesigned and mapped out for them with no room to carve their own personal niche; he wants to experience something truly different. So, after spending the typical modern life of being saturated with pop culture, videogames, cartoons, favourite rock bands and movies, he sets off on a quest with a young couple from Paris, Etienne and Francoise, to find a rumoured beautiful island which is supposed to be a perfect paradise untouched by modern life.<br/><br/>Now, certain elements from the original book are understandable in their being changed--for example, everybody underwent severe food poisoning after eating tainted food in one chapter, and the grotesque situation would have simply been too unworkable in a motion picture. But other elements have been changed simply due to the hope of luring in audiences: in this film, Richard is pretty selfish, Etienne and Richard bicker almost constantly, and Richard finally ends up with Etienne's girlfriend Francoise. This is the typical Hollywood formula. But the original book does it much better--Richard, who is English, is more sensitive to others' personal feelings, he and Etienne become genuine friends, and while Richard finds himself involuntarily attracted to Francoise, he does everything he can to keep said problem under control simply because he cares about her, and especially the personal feelings of his friend Etienne, to let any libido get in the way of anything and get anyone hurt. This situation causes far more tension and genuine concern, and would have worked so much more beautifully on film.<br/><br/>Such goofy misjudgements on behalf of Hollywood aside, the strengths of the movie outweigh its obvious flaws. Danny Boyle's direction is absolutely gorgeous, with magnificent photography and a beautiful score to match. The soundtrack's songs are a lot of fun (I can't begin to recommend both CDs to this film enough). Tilda Swinton threatens to steal the show with a powerful potrayal of Sal, and despite one bedroom scene which doesn't belong in the story she still captures the spirit of the original novel perfectly in her obsessive desire to keep everything ""perfect"" at all costs. Lars Artenz-Hansen is all too convincing as the obnoxious Bugs, and Guillaume Canet as Etienne gives a performance which shows that he would have really been fantastic if allowed to portray the character as Garland had originally envisioned.<br/><br/>In short, the movie serves mostly as an excellent introduction to the book and win it score of new readers. The movie stands great on its own, but after reading the book you'll enjoy ""piecing"" the two together as companion pieces so you can really appreciate it all as a whole.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I also want to note that the deleted scenes on this DVD are genuinely fascinating and not mere ""throwaways""--especially the tense scene featuring Etienne in a tent. If you like the movie, check these out!"

","Leonardo DiCaprio successfully sheds his ""Titanic"" image in this account of a young American tourist who stumbles upon an idyllic island paradise while on vacation in Thailand, only to discover that paradise ain't all that it's supposed to be. Unfortunately, the same can be said for this movie. It's terrible in almost every respect.<br/><br/>The premise is hardly unique. For years the idea of discovering paradise only to be disappointed with what you find has been the theme of novels, stage plays, movies. The closest analogy for this movie might be that it's kind of a ""Lord Of The Flies"" with adult characters. But the really surprising thing is that such a well-worked plot could be burdened with such an absolutely incoherent story line, which repeatedly falls into ridiculous and juvenile silliness. And the ending makes no sense at all. Why in the world would the ""dope farmers,"" who have already demonstrated that they are willing to kill to prevent more people from coming to their island, then simply pack the inhabitants of the village up and send them back to civilization? Now there's a good way to keep the island a secret! Certainly one wouldn't expect originality in this kind of story, perhaps, but it should still be interesting! Trust me, it's not!<br/><br/>The movie features some good photography and beautiful scenery - which barely manages to raise it from a 1 to a 2 in my books. Aside from that, ""The Beach"" is a monotonous disaster all the way through. Do not waste your time on it. You will regret your decision."

"TxMike","Null","2","6","29 November 2000"," ""The Beach"" is a really fine film, examines human motives in the search for ""paradise.""
","Some things will always remain a mystery, like why so many reviewers give ""The Beach"" a poor review and low ratings. My wife and I (grandparents) both think it is a very good film, and I rate it ""8"" of 10.  Here's why...<br/><br/>A young American man, played by Leo DeCaprio, having grown up on a heavy diet of TV and video games, wants to get away and find some adventure for his dull life. He goes to Thailand, meets up with a crazy man, gets a map to ""paradise"", the most beautiful beach on an island, where boulders shield the beach from the ocean. He convinces a young French couple to go along, having to swim the last mile or so.<br/><br/>One half of the island is being used for drug cultivation, and those farmers have allowed a community of paradise-seekers to settle on the other end, as long as they don't interfere, and NO ONE ELSE enters the community. Leo and his two friends manage to evade the farmers, and are accepted into the community.<br/><br/>Soon after, when rain makes fishing difficult, Leo grabs a spear and goes out, only to be confronted by a shark. He ends up not only killing the shark and providing food for the community, he establishes himself as a rival for ""dominant male"".  That is the high point of his ""paradise"" and it is all downhill from there.<br/><br/>There certainly is a parallel here to the Adam and Eve story and eventual expulsion from paradise. Also a reminder of ""The Lord of the Flies."" Even though these 20 or 30 men and women all went to the island for ""pleasure seeking"", ultimately roles need to be taken, duties accepted, not everyone agrees, jealousy starts to erode relationships, certain people seek power, and when some get seriously injured, ""out of sight, out of mind"" is the remedy so as not to upset ""paradise."" In other words, they end up creating on a smaller scale the same world that they sought to escape from. Eventually this ""house of cards"" starts to fall down, and ultimately everyone realizes paradise is internal, not some idyllic place.<br/><br/>CAUTION - SPOILERS -- ""Sal"", the female leader, takes Leo to town for supplies, seduces him, gains power over him.  Leo gets ""exiled"" to fend off the unwelcome visitors who received his map, goes half-crazy, the island and the farmers become one big game to him.  Until the 4 visitors get shot and killed, and this wakes him up to the reality - this is no video game. He tries to get off the island, the farmers capture them and read them the riot act, order them off the island, Sal objects, is given a gun and one bullet, shoot Leo to stay on the island. She pulls the trigger, no bullet, farmer tricked her, but all trust was now destroyed, everyone else gets on raft and leaves, only Sal remains, probably does not live much longer. Last scene, Leo in terminal with computers, checks email, gets photo of group on island, taken by French girl, ""Parallel Universe, Love Francoise."" He smiles, but will be forever changed and haunted by his experience on the island."

","Although The Beach isn't a terrible film by any means, it still remains uneven, and often times, poorly written."
"VikiLauda","5","1","2","8 February 2020"," A real backpackers POV...
","Alex Garlands book was first published in 1995, the same year I set out with my future husband on a 2 year round the world backpacking trip, which was a profound & not altogether pleasent expierence. I got ameobic dysentry in Kathmandu, slipped & smashed my head open on a wet toilet floor in Bombay (now Mumbi) & on a bus journey, had a head on collision with a 10 ton truck on the side of a mountain near the Tibetan border, where I literally saw the words ""Game Over"" pop up in my eyes! But I also learned that backpackers of my era & the time frame of the Beach (1990's) were not very nice people.. This (by accident or by design) certainly comes across in The Beach!<br/><br/>The characters in the Beach (in particular Richard) are the most obnoxious, self centered, ego driven bunch of oddballs ever to grace any film. However Tilda Swinton (a real life raving Marxist but an incredibly talented actress) as creepily unhinged leader Sal, gives an amazing performance, making this movie worth a watch. Di Caprio, on the other hand, is wooden, & very unrelatable as Richard. His occasional over acting is also irritating. The basic screenplay is equally unconvincing (I have seen it done it & bought the t shirt) as backpackers would never congregate with other backpackers in a secret commune. The reason is that each backpacker of my time liked to think their own expierence is unique, special, & never been done before. Real backpackers are ""travel snobs"" who are loath to admit that they cannot live without their western creature comforts, which is only breifly explored in the Beach. Backpackers will congregate in places where those western creature comforts are catered for, like Kho San Road in Bangkok. Their food is chips (fries) burgers & hot dogs, their entertainment is Hollywood movies, yet they dress in outlandish ""local"" clothes like Thai fishermans pants, badly tied sarongs & often looked like whacky clowns in tie dye! They have a parchent to eat their evening meals dressed only in beachwear & women sunbath topless with absolute no regard that this activity in Asia is considered offensive to the local culture. So I can well understand just why the Beach has such obnoxious characters, as it's not far from the truth. But a lot of this film remains unconvincing, like swimming in the open ocean in a straight line? No you would be carried by the current & miss the island entirely! Anyway the Beach ticks on quite nicely until it literally looses the plot in the second half of the film where Richard goes loopy & becomes Rambo & Super Mario at the same time. It is at this point, I quite frankly loose interest in this movie. It makes no sense, adds nothing to the plot & appears to be simply inserted to flesh out the film to an acceptable length of a movie.<br/><br/>Well if anyone is looking for a taste into what backpacking was like in the 90's, this movie almost takes you there...almost. But us backpackers did not live in communes & never would! 5 stars for Tilda Swinton though. I might not agree with her politically (too many actors today forget that their job is to ACT & entertain us, NOT lecture us on Global Governance, climate change & how evil white men are) but Ms Swinton, you rock! x"

Apart from that: oh my god where to even begin.<br/><br/>The story is missing depth, a plot and don't even get me started on the manuscript.<br/><br/>So, Leo and his two newfound friends decide to go through serious lengths, even risking their lives, for NO REASON AT ALL? I can't help but feel I'm missing something here. Sure, a guy tells them about a paradise beach which doesn't sound too bad but I mean? What exactly were they expecting to find there? Where does this insanely strong dedication spire from?? What about this place, which they know nothing about, do they feel is worth giving up everything for? After all they leave without any food, no apparent way back and sign up for a lifetime with some hippie sect without thinking twice. The producers must've left out a serious part of the story here because it doesn't add up.<br/><br/>A few scenes later some random backpackers decide to share the legend about the beach. ""The whitest sand you've every seen"" (what's even a ""legend"" about that??) okay yes it sounds all good, but spending days and nights, swimming across the ocean for it? Nah mate, I think I'd do with another one of Thailand's 100000 beaches. With white sand, duh.<br/><br/>Anyway they get there and maybe just maybe it's finally time for the plot to kick off. It may seem like we're getting a love triangle between Leo, Francoise and Etienne. But nah, Francoise is equally much in love and Etienne just wants her to be happy. What a nice guy.<br/><br/>Anyway, the tribe starts showing ugly sides by valuing their secret even over the death of a friend. Hmm okay, so will this turn out to a sectarian psychological thriller? But nah, next thing we know Leo's left the tribe and that's not the case.<br/><br/>Next option, Leo goes out in the woods and we watch him slowly lose his mind. Okay so perhaps we are getting a psychological thriller after all. Will we watch Leo slowly go crazy? Will he turn on the tribe? Actually lose his mind and be forever lost in the woods? Nah, a few minutes later he's fine again and realized perhaps it's time to leave this place.<br/><br/>At last, the tribe is driven away by the Thais farming the island. Moral sense of story? Paradise exists in your heart? Everything is not what it seems? People will do weird crap for what matters the most? I don't know. I really don't. Perhaps I would've if the manuscript would've explained the character's unreasonable devotion, but for now I'm left wondering.<br/><br/>Either way, the scenes are beautiful and it's quite an enjoyable film."

","The Beach (2000): Dir: Danny Boyle / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyan, Guillaume Canet: Intriguing film until one sees through its phony advertizing and dreary writing. Title regards opportunity and freedom, which is something the characters believe they've found until the fine print reveals unexpected dangers. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who is given a map to a paradise island. He ventures to the island and encounters people who made it their home. Lame subplots include shark attacks, romantic elements, and a dope crop. Director Danny Boyle cannot sort out the mess and hardly capitalizes on his success with Trainspotting. Ravishing production and photography are an asset. DiCaprio goes half way with his performance. He gains possession of this map and then inhabits another culture or lifestyle as well as romance two women but he goes through unexplained personality lapses in the third act that make little sense. Tilda Swinton is intriguing as an islander until she basically becomes a romantic prop. Robert Carlyle appears briefly with the map before he kills himself in a drunken state. Virginie Ledoyan and her boyfriend, played by Guillaume Canet accompany DiCaprio before also becoming a romantic prop situation. It addresses the perfect fantasy but as a film it is no fantasy and certainly no day at the beach. Score: 5 ½ / 10"
"Rosser94","9","1","2","13 March 2012"," Painfully underrated; an entertaining, engrossing movie
","I see many negative reviews for ""The Beach"" and I really struggle to identify a justification for such an underrating. <br/><br/>When I watched this film for the first time, I considered it to be an entertaining and original movie that, although retained a sense of solidity throughout, never truly shone; what puzzled me was the fact that I was glued to the screen throughout.<br/><br/>However, upon my second viewing, I realised that this film carries a subtle depth that contributes strongly to its engrossing manner. Aside the strong acting and great script, a deep focus on characterisation ensures that the movie's protagonist and the changes he undergoes are incredibly engaging; in accordance with the fact that DiCaprio takes this lead, we are left with a character study as much as a movie. Furthermore, without giving anything away, the various parallels and paradoxes, both positive and negative, as well as the sense of underlying realism, ensure that, as a viewer, you feel compelled to truly take an interest in the ""The Beach"".<br/><br/>Despite the strength of this film, what prevents it from being a true masterpiece is the fact that the pacing and atmospheric focus of ""The Beach"" is slightly too inconsistent and it can make the experience an overly peculiar one at times. <br/><br/>Overall, it is difficult to explain why ""The Beach"" is such a compelling, intelligent and engrossing movie (especially without adding spoilers), however you just have to give it a go. It is a movie that can be watched multiple times and has a subtle depth to it that many viewers will not spot during the first viewing; I highly recommend you experience ""The Beach""."

It was filmed on the Thai island Koh Phi Phi.<br/><br/>Richard is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck. Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors.<br/><br/>The Beach is unfocused and muddled.It was also a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on.

"leplatypus","7","1","2","10 July 2011"," I don't like Paradise (dvd)
","This movie illustrates brilliantly the idea that i came with my spiritual reading: while revealed books speak about paradise as ultimate reward, with gold, women, my concern was about the one I love down there and who could be sentenced to hell! How could i be happy to be in Paradise if they weren't? <br/><br/>Here the dilemma may be different but the anguish is the same: Heaven can turn into Hell, and as the movie intelligently points out, where do you go then if you want to leave Paradise? <br/><br/>Another good testimony here is the numbness and delusion of modern life: actually, we experience a lot of virtual pleasure (as reading this web screen now) and we have lost touch with what is real! Thus, we have all inside us this yearning for a simpler life, communicating with people that we can actually touch! The global village is just a mirage because our body is attached to one location at one time.<br/><br/>At last, the movie offers another great truth about ultimate freedom and doing whatever we want. This isn't paradise because it's indeed the pathway to hell, the right journey to madness! <br/><br/>With all those subversive ideas, Boyle delivers a great movie, a modern parable that he explains with his commentary. The Leo we see here is the Leo i don't like: conquering, arrogant, liar, cheater and worse. But it's a intelligent trick to pose him as the hero, all the more he is not more the ""King of the world"".

","I'm a Danny Boyle fan. Not the biggest fan in the world, but I certainly enjoy his style. However, I had heard that this movie was a stinker, so I decided to give it a pass for a while. When I did get around to seeing it, I was blown away. <br/><br/>1. The acting. The acting was superb. Robert Carlyle was excellent as Daffy. Both french actors (Virginie Ledoyen and Guilliaume Canet) were solid. DiCaprio was great. One review I read accuses him of playing a ""nobody"" but I assure you that this is exactly why he was so brilliantly cast. He's an American twenty-something on vacation in Thailand. He is unsure of himself and he is capable. He doesn't know what he wants or why he's here. DiCaprio plays this part perfectly, acting both unsure and overconfident. Tilda Swin is perfect as the leader of a small island community. <br/><br/>2. Storytelling. This movie is really hard to place. It starts out as a ""finding oneself"" type film with some thriller elements. It ends up... somewhere I did not expect it to go. THe story follows a windy road full of twists and turns, and takes the viewer to places he had no intention of going. It should also be mentioned that this film is fairly similar to Apocalypse Now (Boyle's Favorite Film). This movie is also funny. I wasn't expecting that either. There are moments (very few, actually) of fun and play in this overall rather dark story. <br/><br/>3. Score, editing, cinematography, etc. When I watch a Danny Boyle film, I am always reminded of the other films he's made, both stylistically and thematically. Despite using different cinematographers, his films invariably have a specific visual style (much more apparent in his later films) with angled camera, and rich blues, yellows and greens. In many ways, this film reminded me a little of Trainspotting crossed with 127 Hours. It's less flashy than one, and more than the other, and deals with some similar elements of trial that are present 127 Hours, as well as an interesting cast of characters, like Trainspotting. Both films have at least one hallucination/insanity moment, but I will not go too far down that road for fear of uncovering spoilers. The score was fine, I felt it fit the film rather well, giving it the flashy wildness of the 2000 without going overboard. Most of the soundtrack has a kind of retro synth feel combined with a more modern beat. Not the best music on the planet, but nothing to lose sleep over. <br/><br/>Anyways, I could go more in depth about specific story elements, plot devices and scene structures, but I won't for brevity's sake. But, to sum up my review: I loved it. At many points during the film I found myself thinking: this is such a good movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews. this is completely worth watching."
"yarnell-797-79215","6","1","2","22 July 2010"," Good, but read the book!
","""This is vastly different from the Richard that Alex Garland wrote in the source material. Garland's Richard is a polite, borderline selfless British traveler with dark hair. In other words, he's the polar opposite of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-involved adulterer. This isn't a drawback. Too many people draw novel-to-film comparisons, when the two mediums are far too different to be doing so. The Beach is a brilliant novel, and justifiably a cult classic. The film adaptation is compelling in its own respect.""<br/><br/>As a separate film to the book, the movie was good, great locations, brilliant actors, and decaprio's solid acting. But, the movie didn't express the full toll on Richard (who was British) the extended time on the island did to him. <br/><br/>Your find yourself agreeing with the character, and feel as if your going mad yourself. <br/><br/>The film just didn't grasp that."
"Geronimo2900","7","1","2","13 May 2010"," Good, but more could have been done with it.
","The first half an hour of 'The Beach' gave the impression that it was a film about extremes. Whether it's the completely foreign world of horrible hotel rooms and snake blood DiCaprio's 'Richard' finds himself in, or the suicidal madness of Carlyle's 'Daffy', or the pursuit of absolute perfection in the beach itself, all these things seemed to be presenting the film as either highly dramatic or deeply philosophical. With such a set up, I personally hoped for this film to stay with me for a while for one of these reasons. However, neither one seemed to materialise, or at least not strongly. Screenings to background tourists of 'Apocalypse Now' at the beginning of the film resonates with the theme of the madness of solitude, but Richard's madness seems all too sudden to be convincing. Dramatically, whilst the plot moved along at a reasonable pace, the ending seemed weak, with the release of the island people back to their own lives being fairly anti-climactic. Maybe it was some sort of metaphor how paradise will always let you down, but I was fairly underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The acting was strong throughout, but the characters were fairly two dimensional except for the core three, which isn't ideal when the story is focused on a small community and the tensions within it. I also found that the soundtrack ruined parts of it for me. Whilst I love Moby's 'Porcelain' as a song, I felt it completely removed the exotic beauty of the moment they see the beach. I would have much rather had something more anonymous playing. That's fairly trivial, but was quite a poignant let down for me.<br/><br/>Whilst this seems heavily critical, I'm only writing the review in such a manner because I am generally a big fan of Boyle's, and thus rate him highly, so looked for a lot in this film. It is still clever, thought provoking and the cinematography is beautiful. Richard is, on the most part, well crafted and consistent, and moments of this film really did stay with me afterwards."

","The Beach (2000) has a bad name of some sort, not all seem to like it and many think it's a poor film based on a great novel. I disagree, I liked it. No, it's not perfect and the glorifying approach towards ""backpackers"" what once might've been the coolest thing ever feels cheesy and awkward a decade later, but the film still has some great things to offer.<br/><br/>The film manages to convey the relaxing though occasionally threatening atmosphere of the life in ""paradise"" quite nicely, Leonardo DiCaprio (Richard) does a good role in the lead, the film looks visually great and has some imaginative tricks in it's sleeve and the soundtrack fits the mood of the film very well.<br/><br/>That's the good, then the bad: the story isn't as engaging as you'd expect or hope - the story doesn't feel consistent and has some misteps along the way and doesn't seem to go anywhere in the end. The film starts out promisingly and constantly hints that something great is waiting around the corner but that never comes true; you feel mostly disappointed in the end. Not every performance from the cast convince either, especially Virginie Ledoyen (Francoise) and Guillaume Canet (Ètienne) were poor.<br/><br/>The Beach is best served during the icy cold winter days when the sun barely rises above the horizon - it takes your mind to somewhere warm and beautiful for a couple of hours, though it's story might not really charm you. 3/4"

","Danny Boyle has flown from B list director to household name in recent months after the runaway success of his latest movie, Slumdog Millionaire, but a lot of his earlier work received little or no recognition. The Beach is a perfect example of this, but it is interesting to see the development of his directorial skills. The seeds were obviously sown long before they flourished to Oscar winning standards, and the cinematography is glorious.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why IMDb has a low average rating for this movie. It is a little scatterbrain and certain plot points are left unexplained, leaving it feeling a little incoherent. Also, there is one particular sequence to do with the main character Richard, superbly portrayed by a comfortable DiCaprio, is isolated and begins to lose his marbles. This is very odd few minutes, baring very little relevance to the overall plot and it somewhat breaks flow.<br/><br/>These gripes aside, the movie is an extremely interesting watch, for several reasons. Despite having all the hallmarks of a Boyle film, the cinematography is unique. It bares a similarity to Trainspotting, in that the main character is our narrator, but the strange mixture of intrigue, romance and adventure is certainly refreshing. Where the movie really excels however is its exploration of some little explored concepts.<br/><br/>The idea of isolation in paradise, and the selfishness of human kind is explored in detail, with the private colony's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton) being the personification of this concept. Robert Carlyle makes fleeting appearances as Daffy, a crazed former resident, disgusted by the ""cancerous"" human race. Are there elements of environmentalism in to be picked up on? Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The roots of Boyle's recent genius show sparks of the brilliance to come and the sheer uniqueness on show will be endearing to any regular film watcher. Sure it has its problems but what films don't? With a little patience and trust in the director you may just find yourself enthralled."

"Hagwag","Null","1","2","9 August 2003"," A competent film version of an excellent book
","After the runaway success of Alex Garland's novel on which this film is based, it was only to be expected that people would come away disappointed. A few years on, though, it deserves a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>This is a film for the MTV generation - quick cuts, frantic camerawork, unnatural lighting and camera angles, and a soundtrack from the likes of Leftfield, Moby, Underworld, Faithless and others. This makes it a very watchable film, but prevents the film's moral having any genuine weight in the 'Lord Of The Flies' or 'Apocalypse Now' sense.<br/><br/>And comparisons to 'Lord Of The Flies' are justified. Not just in the superficial sense that a group of humans are on an island, shut off from the outside world; this is a story about the way people would behave in a state of nature (i.e. away from civilisation and the political institutions that accompany it), and as such reveals a great deal about our collective psyche. Sadly, a film of this length is inadequate for the purpose of fully exploring human nature to the extent that Garland did, but Danny Boyle relays the book's central messages without being overly heavy-handed.<br/><br/>The central performances are solid, if nothing particularly memorable (with the exception of Robert Carlyle, who is always memorable), though I'm not too sure about Tilda Swinton and Lars Arentz-Hansen (Sal and Bugs), especially Arentz-Hansen. In his defense, his character is poorly written - a pale imitation of his counterpart in the novel. Virginie Ledoyen is great; we should see more of her. Please?<br/><br/>Like 'Lord Of The Flies', this is a story in which the characters represent different aspects of human nature. Part of the reason that I like this film, despite its flaws, is that I can see bits of myself in each of the characters, and bits of them in me. In particular, I feel like I can identify with Richard, and I suspect a lot of people feel the same. He represents the man who rejects civilisation and its values without realising how much he depends on them; even when he finds paradise, he finds himself pretending that he's in a Vietnam film, or that he is the central character in a videogame. The irony is that by trying to show us that adventure isn't as glamourous as it seems, 'The Beach' makes adventure seem glamourous, just like all the 'war is hell' movies like Full Metal Jacket glamourize war.<br/><br/>I guess escapism is in our nature, and stories like 'The Beach' only strengthen our desire to escape. Somewhere, maybe..."

","There is a lot to like here, even though there are some major flaws, too. At first I thought it starred Matt Damon, who is great, but in the lobby of the theater on the way in I saw it starred Leonardo DeWatchimacallit, who I dislike and distrust. So I was prepared to hate ""The Beach,"" but was surprised at how very good it was. I was particularly impressed with Leonardo, who I had previously thought of as nothing more than a giggling trifle. He can act! And he can come off as a actual man, too, not just the foppish object of teeny-bopper desire. Good job, bud!<br/><br/>The first hour is powerful, mysterious, beautiful, and very engaging. The second hour is probably where the detractors were turned off. Admittedly, the conceptual material becomes really corny-- the type of obvious, belabored ideas about hedonism, love, character, etc. that one would expect from a precocious 19 year-old. I imagine that 35 years ago ""The Beach"" would have been a stunner-- and it would have been hailed as a gripping, bold view into the darker parts of the human heart. Now, the moral lessons and conclusions seem naive to the point of silliness. But wait! In spite of that, there is something about this movie that is immensely rewarding and entertaining. A vibe of pure power, and a vibrant life emanate from every scene. I can't explain it beyond that-- this movie has LIFE. And it is technically perfect, too. Visually amazing, well acted, well edited, etc.  It's kind of the opposite of the recent movie ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" in which the scenery was rare and imposing (lots of snow on lots of cedars), but it was empty and sterile. As a movie it struck many folks as lifeless and dreary. ""The Beach,"" by contrast, looks like a masterpiece, and feels like a great movie-- even though the story kind of falls apart towards the end. Often times flawed movies piss one off, but this movie won me over and had me appreciating it even as I was seeing the conclusion as amateurishly juvenile. Go figure?<br/><br/>I gave this flick an ""8."""

","What a disappointment. Danny Boyle had recently directed one of my favorite films of the last few years, Trainspotting, and although Leonardo DiCaprio has never been between the actors I liked, I had somewhat high expectations for The Beach. It turned out that DiCaprio's acting is actually the best thing about this clunker.<br/><br/>To say that The Beach didn't have the space to develop its ideas would be wrong. The movie is based on a book by Alex Garland, and while I never read the book, I must say that the concept the movie seems based on could be interesting. The search for a new way of living outside our society and considerations on the impossibility to find the perfect Paradise on Earth are captivating, and as a nature lover I must say that it is really rare that pro-ecology undertones don't appeal me. However, these themes were treated in such a vapid, superficial and often hypocritical way in The Beach that when the movie was over I was not just bored, I was irritated.<br/><br/>I am not blaming the author of the book. In fact, it could be that the novel is a good read. But if the movie is a good adaptation of it, then I am sure I will skip on the book for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>The Beach opens in Bangkok; Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American man, is here on vacation. In the hotel he meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking lunatic who shows him the map to an island where, it seems, it's possible to find the most beautiful place on Earth. Richard doesn't pay much attention to him, but when the next morning he finds that Daffy had killed himself, he steals the map and wonders if this beach really exists. Finally he decides to take a chance and, along with a young French couple, he takes a trip to the fabled island.<br/><br/>To this point, the film is not particularly good, but it is at least interesting. But as soon as the movie gets to the beach, everything starts going downhill and it never stops, reaching the worst with the awful finale.<br/><br/>When the three young tourists get to the beach, they get to know that they are not alone. A small village of young men and women already lives here, and although it seems like a disappointment at first (at least judging from DiCaprio's voice-over), when Richard and the French couple get to know them and their way of living, they begin to be very fascinated. The small village, it is said (more on this later), is self-sufficient and they can live without any contact with the outside. The problem is, if anything happens, they are on their own.<br/><br/>The movie puts in some romance between the French girl, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and Richard, and some time is spent on the consequent grief of Françoise's boyfriend. The romance however, fails to generate any sparks, and the focus on Françoise's boyfriend anger is shifted off so abruptly he practically disappears from the movie. However, as uninteresting as the romance is, it is not nearly as bad as most of the rest.<br/><br/>First of all, there is not one likable character. Most of them are either paper-thin, irritating, spoiled, and usually all things together. There is much talk about how these young people are self-sufficient, and yet we see that they are not: they hardly do anything all day. Richard himself has to go on the outside world to buy goods for the island community, and most of these goods are the typical unnecessary comforts many tourists look for when going on vacation. The people on the island play video games and buy beer; it's never shown where they put their trash. In many scenes the movie looks like a Club Med commercial, and it is a pity since the problems of a small society truly living on its own never get the possibility of being delved into.<br/><br/>During the course of the movie, two characters are attacked by a shark. One dies in a brief time, the other is left dying in the woods because, it seems, the island community doesn't want people on the outside to know about them. Deus ex machina anyone? How does ""bringing a man to the hospital"" immediately connect to ""revealing where the community is""? And when the members of the community go to play volleyball while their friend is left dying, one would at least expect that it is a starting point to show how they will be unable to cope with their own sense of guilt. It never happens.<br/><br/>In a completely different scene, Richard suddenly loses his mind without apparent motivation, and one has to wonder what it is all about. And after some nonsense that leads to the killing of four tourists who reached the island, he snaps perfectly awake again. Absurd.<br/><br/>And when Richard finally gets back to 'normal' society, we see him thinking about the island with nostalgia. That's right. Puh-lease.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this movie is a huge step back from Trainspotting for Boyle. The music is barely tolerable, the cinematography relies on the beautiful scenery but puts in some inappropriately silly scenes, such as Richard transforming into a video game hero while walking in the forest. The performances, apart from DiCaprio's (pretty good, but not very good) range from average to bad. But what's most disappointing is the treatment of the subject matter. Trainspotting had ideas, characters and story. The Beach has ideas that never get developed, irritating characters, and a story that barely stays together.<br/><br/>4/10"

Leonardo DiCaprio, as irritating as I find him, is actually quite a good actor. Anyone who doesn't believe that should rent ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". He did a creditable job here, and you have to give him credit for taking this role, a rather unlikeable character, right after ""Titanic"". I would have found the lifestyle on the island awfully appealing in my 20's, a life of leisure, unlimited dope to smoke, etc. That wasn't enough for Richard (DiCaprio) however, and he falls into the category of adrenaline junkie. One thing, though, with all of those twentysomethings living on that island, it's hard to believe there were no children. I thought the direction was quite good throughout with the exception of the video game sequence. Dumb. I suppose it was meant to appeal to a demographic group which doesn't include me.

","Although The Beach was an interesting and well acted film, it ended up contradicting what it was trying to say at the beginning. The scenery in incredible with the beautiful white sand beach that is completely isolated from the modern world, and the transition between the two when Richard and Sal traveled back for supplies was startling and very well presented.<br/><br/>
The unlikely premise of the film, a young traveling boy searching for the meaning of his life runs into a seemingly insane man in a third world motel room who decides to give him the map to paradise and then kill himself is a little hard to believe, but Robert Carlyle was wonderful as that man, and he easily stole every one of the few scenes he was in. After that, it was a fascinating adventure watching Richard and his two friends journey in search of that paradise. However, the unlikely events that led to the formation of that friendship is another thing that took away from the story.<br/><br/>
After the shark attack (not the laughable one where Richard actually wrestled with and killed the shark, taking it home for dinner, but the one where people were hurt and killed), the concept of paradise was a lot more realistic. It is true that a utopian society is not possible without some element of misery, and the man who was badly injured by the shark represented that misery. You cannot have absolute happiness without absolute misery. To put it in the classy and sophisticated words of Beavis and Butt-Head, ""If nothing sucked, and like, everything was cool all the time, then it's like, how would you know it was cool?"" <br/><br/>Richard's descent into temporary madness was a very creative and well done part of the film, in my opinion. The video game cinematography was not only original but it also cleverly represented his innocence and inexperience in the world. The acting in the film was very good, I think it should be noted that Leonardo DiCaprio delivered a brilliant and amazingly convincing performance, despite his terrible acting in Titanic. Besides that, the settings and camera work were excellent as well. Unfortunately, I just think that the story was contradictory and not thought out very well. The film stressed the importance of close friends and loyalty, but it seemed like it ended up emphasizing the importance of e-mail and iMac computers. Or maybe that was just a bit of clumsy and awkward product placement, maybe they were having problems getting people to bank-roll the film. Are they trying to say that a paradise such as the one in the film, if ever found, is impossible to keep? As a whole, I think that the film is trying to portray the destructive power of greed, but the message is so clouded with other distractive elements that it ends up looking and sounding confused and contradictory."

In the film Richard was just plain nasty and when he begun to loose it, he lost it big time. However in the book he was just an ordinary bloke who gradually goes insane due to the mad situation he is presented with. I can understand why in the film Richard s***s Francoise, which did not happen in the book, because there is a lot of sexual tension between them; but there is no way Richard would have had sex with Sal. There are so many faults with the script and direction that left me so unsatisfied. Whilst I can understand some of the difficulties the director, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) was faced with, for example the scripting of the character, Bugs who haunts Richard throughout the film as a ghostly figure, I believe the film lacked the depth and intrigue which made the book so addictive.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this film was the cinematography.

","The beach is a beautiful movie. You could almost watch it with the sound off, much in the vein of the ""Endless Summer"" surfing movies...because outside of scenery, it's hard for me to see anything else to waste time on.<br/><br/>
The movie starts out interestingly enough. Robert Carlyle gives such an energetic performance in his small roll it almost suggests of great things to come. This expectation lasts up until our heroes find their island paradise, and then the entire thing down-shifts into neutral. As reviewers have stated, few of the characters in this movie are likeable; they are pretentious, naive and treacherous. Their loyalties lie to themselves and their pleasures alone. Dicaprio gives an uninspired performance as perhaps the most despicable of the lot...his selfishness and childish behavior destroying any sympathy or empathy when his Kurtz-like descent into madness arrives. By the time the movie reaches its dramatic peak, I was too bored with the entire thing to care. <br/><br/>I picked this up because of Danny Boyle's involvement. He does a nice job with the movie, but throws in way too many bells and whistles in attempt to make a bad story interesting. I've never read the book, but if it's anything like this adaption...I'll never understand how it sold like it did. This is a complete yawner. It presents a obvious and tired examination of that certain clique-ish side of human nature that pervades the island camp. The conclusion is anti-climactic and predictable. The characters are not developed at all; it's like watching an episode of ""The Real World"". The acting (with the exception of Carlyle and Tilda Swinton) is weak. As other reviewers have stated, another actor in DiCaprio's place may have improved this movie significantly, as he is very unconvincing to say the least.<br/><br/>

"Dkish","6","1","2","12 February 2000"," Why does paradise always have to destroy man?
","The Beach	 By Dean Kish<br/><br/>	When Hollywood is faced with idea or image of paradise, why does it always become so bloody? 	`The Beach' marks the return of Leonardo DiCaprio to the silver screen after his frozen corpse disappeared off the edge of the Titanic. DiCaprio joins with `Trainspotting' director Danny Boyle as a twenty something year old, Richard, exploring the allure of the Far East. He takes a room in a seedy motel where he comes in contact with a psychotic drug-user Daffy (played by Robert Carlyle). Daffy shares a joint with DiCaprio and tells him of a paradise that no man should mistake is there. He tells an urban legend about a mythical beach incased in cliffs and cut off from the world. DiCaprio shrugs it off as a wild story until the next morning where he finds a map tacked to his door. 	`The Beach' could have been a beautiful romance set against an epic adventure as Leo's character teams up with a young French couple to find the mythical `Beach'. But when we are introduced to what makes the mythical island tick the movie takes a strange `Lord of the Flies' direction as the island's world will do what ever it takes to preserve their paradise.<br/><br/>	The scenery and imagery director Boyle conveys brings you in and captivates your attention. The beginning's scope and deliverance reminded me a lot of `The Blue Lagoon' and `Castaway'. Both of these films had great potential but ran out of story before reaching fruition. `The Beach' instead mixes the potential seen in `The Blue Lagoon' with an acid trip from `Lord of the Flies'. The end result is heavily flawed hero that you either hate or you are extremely confused about. This is no way to paint an adventure hero. 	As a critic I will pity the masses hoping for another epic romance from DiCaprio. So exactly where does the `Beach' fit into Leo's acting career. I would have to say it proves undeniably the melding and molding his career is taking. The first half of the film we have the Hollywood star but as the film enters its second half we see the heavily flawed characters he treasured earlier in his career. The films I am referring to are `Total Eclipse' and `Basketball Diaries'. 	`The Beach' does deliver a lot of allure which made me want to see a really good island adventure movie. Which did make me wonder did this film ever want to really explore that avenue. Coupled with that allure, I found myself feeling more for the heroine Françoise (played by beautiful French newcomer Virginie Ledoyen) then for Leo's Richard. Why does paradise always have to destroy man? Well it destroyed the Beach. (3.5 of 5) So says the Soothsayer."

","My opinion of the film is not very positive. It is not realistic at all,it starts very romantically and later turns into a contradiction of a utopian world. It is like an insight-experience of a child. (Aha-Erlebnis) Therefore it will be more successful for younger people. The humor is not very original, and the horror-effects are very simple.(My heart wasn't beating 2 or 3 times ,so it DID work!) It feels like a summary of effects, more then an emotional-logical web of events. The best aspect, I think, is the array of cinematografical (?) solutions, use of the film-hardware, camera-angles. The quality of images ( stills ) are very high. So it is more the ""How""  i.s.o. the ""What"" of cinema. For me it has very little to do with real-life-experiences. I get very curious about ""Train spotting"" (Next time I will try writing Dutch, this is too hard )"
"mercury-26","3","1","2","1 March 2000"," Bad choice for Leo
","Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant work in Titanic (though not his best) and the unexpected explosion of popularity that ensued, opened wide the floodgates of his career. He now earns a Tom Cruise-sized paycheck for any old project he chooses to attach himself to. We all hoped he would choose his projects wisely (from what I have heard about American Psycho, he was wise to turn it down).<br/><br/>If hindsight were 20/20, one could argue for his passing on The Beach as well, the film adaptation of wonder boy Alex Garland's novel, which I have not read. The source material notwithstanding, this is a grim tale that goes everywhere you don't expect. Usually this would be a good thing, but this project meanders endlessly as we take a trip through the slowly fragmenting mind of Richard (Leo), an adventurous twentysomething just looking for a little excitement in his life.<br/><br/>Richard's journey begins in Thailand, where he stays in the world's worst motel and ends up living next to Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking psychotic raving about a hidden beach on an island paradise. Because Richard doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life and he's real bored, he buys the story, takes Daffy's map, and sets out to find the island. He even finds two more suckers willing to be stupid with him, the lovely Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), French lovers traveling together (but of course, it's Leo and poor Etienne never stands a chance).<br/><br/>When they finally find the island, the film becomes a bit humorous (intentionally, I think) as we meet its inhabitants, basically a bohemian mini-culture living in complete seclusion from the world, calling themselves Parallel Universe. The group's founder, chairperson, and den mother, Sal (Tilda Swinton), is obsessively protective of their culture. The fun ends like it always does, and the film gets increasingly trippy, ugly, and violent: In a word, `disturbing.'<br/><br/>In the end we're supposed to realize that paradise is something to be earned, not claimed: You can run from the world, but eventually it will find you. One humorous scene features the members of the group, one by one, giving Richard their long lists of items needed from civilization. He and Sal (who naturally can't resist Leo's charms either) are to make a trip back into Thailand (for extra rice or something). It occurs to you, even as you're watching this scene, that the crew and passengers of the U.S.S. Minnow were so much cooler and more resourceful than these losers!<br/><br/>
Beach, of course, was made by the writing/directing team who brought us the far superior Trainspotting, John Hodge and Danny Boyle. Their creative stamp is most definitely visible here and they do create some memorable visual imagery. This is due in large part to the masterful photography by the distinguished, versatile Darius Khondji, the man responsible for Se7en, Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, and Evita. I can't recommend The Beach, but I'd still run out and see the next Boyle/Hodge collaboration. Come to think of it, I've seen every one of them since 1994's Shallow Grave.<br/><br/>Grade: D+"

","Surprisingly decent flick and it's always interesting if a little confusing. another one of the films i found laying around the house. There were quite a few things to like about this film the beautiful scenery and that island looked awesome and also looked like a wonderful place to stay the performances were great and it was never boring but i thought the finale got too muddled and silly in the finale also a bit too chaotic as well. Nevertheless it's nowhere near as bad as people have made it out to be Yes the script is very uneven but at least it never bored me and actually managed to be suspenseful in sequences until it got a bit too silly but that's a minor thing. there isn't much gore but quite a bit of violence we get a few people riddled with bullets and it's pretty bloody we also get a chewed up leg that was cringe inducing and some other VERY minor stuff. The Acting is actually VERY good Leonardo DiCaprio is EXCELLENT in the lead role showing vulnerability and he is also on top of things great job!. Tilda Swinton in my opinion over acted in this and didn't perform that well. at least she was bearable. Virginie Ledoyen is BEAUTIFUL and does very well here i thought she did a great job and i liked her lots. Guillame Canet also does very well here he has a thick french accent and does quite well.

The Beach is based on a book of the same name and has some stunning picturesque locations(Thailand) but there are no redeeming qualities among any of the characters and the film just sort of...trudges along.

","I think this film is rather poor. I didn't like the soundtrack, it wasn't suitable and far too noticeable. I found the plot to be mediocre at best, but by far the worst part of the movie is the total lack of likeable characters. Except for the French guy I guess, all characters are utterly despicable with near to no redeeming qualities and they haven't been fleshed out that well. I can handle a film with unlikable characters and even love it sometimes, however in this film the other elements (plot, themes, fun) didn't counter this lack in well-developed or likeable characters.
The cinematography was ok I guess and the acting was actually really good, as can be expected from Leonardo di Caprio and Tilda Swinton. But they couldn't save the film in my opinion."

I think if you see this film alone and just try to enjoy it; it will take you on a suspenseful ride where you look forward with tension to what will happen next. I did not get bored. The film is so well done that I didn't get distracted at all, it just kind of flows naturally and you are really attached to the characters. You might feel excitement, anger, fear, sadness. There have been a few places where I thought the characters should have done something else - but that is me, someone would probably have acted the way they did. Overall, this movie touched me though not in a sad way; it just felt really convincing and makes you think about it. Good actors, obviously good crew, interesting setting. Well done and recommended.

","I just recently rewatched the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio, and it was great! I have become a very big fan of DiCaprio over the years, and a lot of people seem to think that this film wasn't one of his stronger points. I grant you, it wasn't one of his best movies, but his performance in it is mesmerising as usual. With Danny Boyle directing, we see the more exotic side to Di Caprio with him topless on the beach. It reminded me more of a James Bond style to the film (Casino Royale) with Di Caprio being Bond. DiCaprio gives a very powerful performance as Richard in the film, and shows off his skills as an Actor. The same year as this, Di Caprio was offered the role of Patrick Bateman in 'American Psycho' which after turning down, then went to Christian Bale. Di Caprio took this role on instead. This film I don't think would have given as good of a performance as American Psycho would for Leo, but Leo sure gives his best, as he is very captivating every second he is on screen, with full commitment to the role!"

","My love for Leonardio Dicaprio made me watch this film. However nothing had prepared me for what i watched. ""The beach"", is one one of the most adventurous films i have seen in a long while. An ideal film to those who feel like they need to escape. To those who feel the urge for adrenaline. To those who feel the need to belong somewhere. Without a doubt Leo gave the best performance of his young carrier in this film and truly managed to amaze me with his acting throughout. This film will excite you, it will terrify you, and most importantly it will connect with you as well as give you a motivation to live. I honestly feel like my life has changed after viewing this film, even 14 years after its release, ans it is certainly not to be missed. The directing was pretty solid throughout and accomplished what it was aiming for. The director could make you cringe, laugh and love whenever he wanted, and the protagonists fooled you by their impeccable performances. Notable performance: Tilda Swinton was magnificent in showing emotion, and compelling drama."

He ends up hooking up with a French couple and they travel to the island together.<br/><br/>The reason ""The Beach"" leaves people a little puzzled is because it's so many thing. It's an adventure, a drama, a romantic triangle and an art house film with existential commentary. But somehow it all comes together and works as a whole, sort of.<br/><br/>The beach community is somewhat of a modern hippie commune. Even the most equalitarian communities have a leader or leaders. In this case it's Sal (Tilda Swinton). Richard realizes he'll have to maintain her favor in order to remain in the paradise, even if her subtle demands are disrespectful and ultimately authoritarian. Since The Beach community is a paradise, anything that takes away from their sense of bliss must be removed. As they say, out of sight out of mind.<br/><br/>Shot in Thailand, the film runs 2 hours.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""The Beach"" is an unusual film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. There's really nothing else like it. And it's worthy of repeat viewings.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","I am really shocked at the negative reviews this film has gotten over the years. I believe this movie initially got a bad rap primarily because it was the next big budget DiCaprio flick following ""Titanic"" People like me who had seen earlier DiCaprio films like ""The Basketball Diaries"" were pleased to see him return to a similar style role while the mass public (mostly women) were merely looking for a Titanic sequel.<br/><br/>The Beach is a coming of age classic about one man's journey through Thailand. His pursuit of paradise leads him to an island where he discovers the perfect utopian society.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a quick pace and is interwoven with some great internal monologues. The cinematography is amazing. The music soundtrack alone is reason enough to watch this movie.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" depicts the ultimate fantasy of finding a private island paradise while enjoying the hedonistic lifestyle.

The performances are delivered with acceptability, the scenery is incredible, and the story, well, close you mind for a few minutes and it is believable. Leonardo gave a consistent performance, I found it better than the performances he receives critical recognition for these (Blood Diamond, Departed).

","When I first saw ""The Beach"" it was like I was watching my dream vacation.

This detail is most notable in his immaculate character devopement of ""Richard"" (Leonardo DiCaprio,) which is an art that seems to be lost in film today.  It also is apparent in Richards' affair with Virginie Ledoyens' character ""Francoise. The way their relationship unfolds was so real yet so romantically ""Hollywood"" at the same time, like a dream.  I must say, the casting of Virginie Ledoyen made the movie much more exotic and mysterious as she is such a beautiful and talented female actress that has been virtually untouched my American cinema.

So the result is crap, every character has been changed in a way you get a different story at all. What has remained, is the names - not much. Just one thing to point out: The director leaves out Jed, one of the most important characters of Garland´s book and tries to disperse this person over a bunch of others. Those ""others"" again, then of course can´t stick to their original characters/plots and so on. The storyline ends in an ultimate mess, inescapable.

","I really enjoyed The Beach. After Titanic, I was sceptical of DiCaprio movies, but here he's clearly trying to show he's a serious actor and he does a great job. <br/><br/>Considering himself to be superior in some way to the usual backpacking crowd, Richard (DiCaprio) is looking for something different that'll take him away from the tourists and give him a 'real' experience. He's given a map of an Island from a deranged man called Daffy (brilliantly played by Robert Carlyle) and in an intense conversation, is told of a beach on the Island that is completely hidden and offers paradise.<br/><br/>The next day he finds Daffy dead in his hotel room - he's committed suicide. Richard joins up with two French backpackers - Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and sets out to find the Island...<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is great throughout with DiCaprio showing he's not just a pretty face. It's shot beautifully - this is one of the best films to show off your new DVD player as the vibrant scenery is breathtaking. The soundtrack fits perfectly and gives it the feeling of a modern movie - the ambient sounding music fits with the post rave tourist culture depicted in the film.<br/><br/>Without going into too much plot detail, things end up not being what they seem and Richard finds out a lot about himself, the way the world works and the frailty of the human condition when people are under stress. The ending is pessimistic as it tells us that there is no paradise - no promised land. Paradise is our normal lives at home with friends and family, with a job and a mundane life. Perhaps this is a truism - the grass is always greener right? I'm yet to decide.<br/><br/>The bad things about the movie were few but noticeable. It can be a little confusing at times and could have done with more explanation of certain happenings. Viewing the cut scenes on the DVD helps and it's a shame they weren't included in the film as they helped. For example there's a scene were Richard is acting out the role of a computer game character. Although you see him playing computer games earlier in the movie, it would have been nice to have this part of his personality emphasized more so that the later scene had greater continuity. The director's commentary is highly enjoyable though - one of the best I've seen. <br/><br/>Overall - a great movie that I'd recommend if you like your films with brains. A flawed classic."

","Well, I feel like a freak of nature but I really like this film. Despite overwhelmingly bad reviews from most, this film just takes me away to another place and I really did enjoy it. Some people just really need to lighten up.<br/><br/>This film brought out a deep sense of longing in me about my travels and about that search for the ultimate paradise. I found the young people in the backpacker colony on the Beach to actually very similar in looks and attitude to many young backpackers abroad. I also found the sharp contrasts between the Beach and the town on the mainland to be very well done and very true about young westerners in Thailand.<br/><br/>The Beach was different, it was exotic. The film didn't end neatly, and that brings up all sorts of ideas about whether or not such a utopia could exist without human greed destroying it. Tilda Swinton did a superb job as Sal, the colony's leader. And Leo Di Caprio was good too as a cocky young American guy looking for a good time but getting in over his head. By the end of the movie, when he's back in the West looking back at that secret place, it was really sad. The constrasts were such so well done...<br/><br/>I liked The Beach a lot, and I'll say it proud!"

"sundevil-pictures","9","1","3","7 February 2001"," One of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000...
","In the spirit of Taoism and savage human transcendentalism comes one of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000. <br/><br/>The Beach is a visceral, elegant, and visually perfect adaptation of the critically acclaimed Alex Garland novel. Filmed on location in Thailand, The Beach places the final piece in Garland's nearly completed jigsaw: eye candy.<br/><br/>The flawless settings of Thai surf and sand are undoubtedly one of the world's few treasures, and the vivid colors and sheer majesty of its pure paradise are amazingly captured by the filmmakers. Moreover, the beach in question is quite possibly one of the greatest settings ever used in a film. I still get chills just thinking about that tropic jewel of crystalline waterhow each tiny wave softly spills over white, powdery sand, all nestled underneath sundrenched palms and moss-covered rock.  Still, as a fair juxtaposition, the film also takes a concentrated look at the misery of urbanity, offering up clever images of mechanization, population, and capitalization. Great work by the crew, especially Darius Khonji, whose style you may recall from, and will see in future, David Fincher movies.<br/><br/>
It is at this point that The Beach marks its true power as a notable event in modern cinema. The movie, under the brilliant direction of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), allows the audience to navigate between the vision of utopian paradise and the automated social lockbox in which most of us are destined to exist. <br/><br/>As such, a true Taoist journey for personal freedom couples notions of anti-materialism at the core of this story. However, the picture also focuses on ruthless idealism, youthful curiosity, man's tragic quest for the unattainable, the moral sacrifice allotted to a hedonistic lifestyle, and man versus nature. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed Fight Club, Lord of the Flies, Heart of Darkness, or Apocalypse Now, then watch this film tonight! It is an impressive blend of thrills, comedy, and adventure...seasoned with a discreet and gradual event that will catch you off-guard. I personally recommend the Special Edition DVD, as it is another treat delivered by Fox Home Video: aesthetic in design, bustling with deleted scenes, commentary, and other special features. 9/10"

With those directing and writing, respectively, marvelous things happen. This isn't the best(so far, of what I've seen, that's 28 Days Later..., though I haven't watched Sunshine), but it's a nice start. While this never completely grabs you the way it seems like it meant to, it is still an interesting enough piece. Leonardo stars as Richard, a youth who hears about a mythical place and goes to seek it out. The script reveals a degree of naiveté, and there are a couple of obvious holes in the concept. If you do stick with it, this comments convincingly on human nature. Some of the voice-overs are a tad pretentious. This has great editing and cinematography. The acting tends to be pretty solid, and, in order from most to least, Swinton, Carlyle and DiCaprio do impeccable work. Pacing is good. The plot develops throughout, though it doesn't all hold up to close scrutiny. This holds strong language, brief nudity, a bit of sexuality, disturbing content and instances of graphic violence. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and of this type of film. 7/10"
"zardoz-13","10","1","4","20 March 2008"," ""The Beach"" Is Nothing Short of Sensational!
","""The Beach,"" an exotic, symbol-laden saga about the elusive quest for paradise, qualifies as Leonardo DiCaprio's first serious movie since the controversial ""Basketball Diaries."" The talented ""Trainspotting"" trio of director Danny Boyle, scenarist John Hodge, and producer Andrew MacDonald have surpassed themselves again with another marvelously staged, provocatively plotted, and opulently produced film. Based on English author Alex Garland's bestseller, this lofty romantic thriller pays homage to ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""The Mosquito Coast,"" and ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" in its abrasive yarn about three, adventure seeking, twentysomethings that gate crash a secret society on a forbidden island in Thailand where a fabled beach unblemished by civilization shimmers in the sunlight.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" begins sluggishly with our protagonist, Richard (Leonard DiCaprio) restlessly prowling Bangkok, a glitzy decadent tourist trap, before he checks into a shabby but suitable bug-infested hotel. Richard yearns for something dangerous, something to test the bounds of reality as he knows it and attain a state of nirvana. Essentially, ""The Beach"" concerns a young man's rites of passage, an end of innocence and illusions, and a descent into the chaos of maturity. At his seedy hotel, where everybody uses a communal bathroom, Richard emerges from the shower, naked except for a towel athwart his waist, and discovers to his embarrassment that he cannot unlock his door. An alluring French babe, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen of ""A Single Girl""), spots him and help him with his door. She blinds him with a smile as her boyfriend Etienne (French heartthrob Guillaume Canet), joins her. Later, a lonely Richard lies awake in bed at night while his French neighbors bang away in the room next door.<br/><br/>Enter Robert Carlyle as Daffy. He energizes ""The Beach"" as Richard's demented, suicidal lodger from the other side who has fled the island paradise. Daffy provides the necessary exposition, or background information, that sets up the story. While they smoke a joint, Daffy rhapsodizes about the island. Later, before he slashes his wrists and dies, Daffy leaves Richard a map to this mythical place. Richard persuades Francoise, with Etienne, of course, to accompany him on his trip to this topical Shangri-La. Eventually, they arrive on the coast, brave the shark-infested waters around the island, and find themselves standing at the edge of a sprawling field of marihuana.<br/><br/>Their bliss is ephemeral. Richard spots an adorable tree monkey and then realizes the cute little simian serves as a guard dog. Suddenly, a grim-looking bunch of ganja growers armed with AK-47 assault rifles are scouring the fields for intruders. Director Danny Boyle keeps you guessing throughout ""The Beach,"" and this quirky scene exemplifies his bizarre sense of irony. Boyle alternates the good with the bad, so you never see what is coming until it occurs. As the farmers comb the fields, our heroes grovel in horror. Just as they have reached the end of the rainbow, a small monkey stands between them and their pot of gold! The image of a monkey as their nemesis enhances the humor of this scene, too.<br/><br/>After our heroes evade the farmers, they stumble onto a hidden sanctuary of an ideology-free commune, ""a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts,"" where everybody lives in apparent harmony. This lost tribe of twentysomethings has erected a bamboo society not entirely unlike the one that the castaways created in ""Gilligan's Island."" Some couples are straight, while other are gay. Boyle glosses over most of the commune members. He fleshes out some characters, like the cook who is obsessed with cleanliness, but he restricts them to the background unless they exert a major role in a scene. Anyway, they grow their own crops; marihuana included, and survive on fish caught from the lagoon. The shortage of feminine hygiene products and batteries for the Game Boys are virtually the only reason that these mod squatters dispatch trading emissaries to the mainland. Basically, they grow enough dope not only to keep themselves blitzed but also to sell to pay for their needs.<br/><br/>An uneasy truce exists between these lotus eaters and the pot farmers. The farmers let the hippies live on the other side of the island as long as nobody joins them. They fear that hordes of tourists would bring the law down on them. In one scene, they appeal to the sympathy of the commune with the story that their marihuana crop enables them to provide financially for their own families. Clearly, Richard and company have shattered the calm. While she doesn't warm to them immediately, Sal (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton), the leader of this make-shift society, welcomes them. The late, lamented Daffyshe explainshelped found their colony, but he suffered from depression and went AWOL. While our heroes assure Sal that they have the only existing map, Richard refuses to mention the copy that he entrusted to another group of stoners. Later, Richard's secret comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>The first part of ""The Beach"" bristles with adventure, but the second half is more downbeat and depressing. Paradise may not be all it is cracked up to be. Richard's stoner friends becomes his worst nightmare as they paddle to the island and run afoul of the pot farmers. A shark attack plunges the commune into despair until they banish the survivor, who refuses to check into a hospital on the mainland. Everybody else tires of his whining and wants only to catch up on their suntans, casual sex, and volleyball without hearing him cry in agony.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""The Beach"" is not mindless juvenile pabulum, but an ambitious, serious-minded epic that exposes the dark side of paradise. Those who enjoyed ""Shallow Grave: and ""Trainspotting"" will find that ""The Beach"" addressed the same themes that Boyle and his collaborators have dealt with before in different settings. Nothing predictable stagnates the storyline, and the main characters are more than horny, one-dimensional pawns."

Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a movie about the pursuit of 'paradise' in contrast to the supposed advancement of human society.

","'The Beach' is an adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel. The film is terrific to look at, and has some genuinely suspenseful moments, but ends up being a glossy showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong - Leo is actually very good as the film's central protagonist, a hyper-cocky and brash Yankee tourist who discovers 'Paradise', only to ruin it. (But does he? And was it paradise to begin with?) Let's just say, he's along way from the box-office B.S. that was 'Titanic' (note for those who've been following my reviews: I am NOT touching that film - even I wouldn't stoop so low as to give time to that rubbish)<br/><br/>However, the problem is that it's all about Leo. The rest of the cast fades to the background - and that includes Tilda Swinton, a brilliant performer who tries hard in the underdeveloped role of the island's icy leader. And Robert Carlyle, whose appearance is reduced to a mere cameo. They are there to make Leo angry, make Leo laugh, make Leo horny, make Leo afraid, etc, etc<br/><br/>And, after a while ... well, one wonders whether it's worth it. Especially when Leo's character goes bonkers. It's very hard to feel pity for such a naive cretin (though one wonders whether they are supposed to). And it's hard not to laugh when Leo does Marlon Brando a la 'Apocalypse Now' (the horror, the horror!)<br/><br/>With its insights about tourism, consumerism and democracy, 'The Beach' is a cut above much 'blockbuster' Hollywood fare. But only just. Leo might be a competent performer, but an overemphasis upon the young actor means the film is more indulgent than insightful."

","mild spoiler possibilities below . . .<br/><br/>Like a lot of others who have commented, I initially stayed away from 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews and the nonsensical casting of Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed then (and now) to be a relatively poor choice to play the lead of Richard (apparently, Danny Boyle originally promised the role to Ewan MacGregor but was persuaded by the money-people to renege the offer and cast Leo, hot off the massive success of 'Titanic'--a slight which damaged their long-standing working relationship and led MacGregor to refuse the lead in Boyle's '28 Days Later,' which ended up going to Cillian Murphy). But I caught 'The Beach' on cable TV, and, while it is ultimately sort of a mess, I was riveted by the direction and the appealing scenario of a small group of neo-hippie travelers trying to form a Utopian community on a hidden Thai beach.<br/><br/>What makes the film so engrossing is Boyle's trademark style, combining stunning visuals, a cast of typically striking and attractive actors, and the innovative use of sound-tracking with irresistibly quirky and hip pop music.<br/><br/>The scenario: Richard is backpacking alone across Asia, partying in the various idyllic hot-spots with like-minded young people, when he encounters the aptly-named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who describes to Richard a rumored a perfect, 'hidden beach' off the coast of Thailand where a group of 'beautiful people' live in a perpetual state of bliss, playing on the beach and living off fruit, fish, and copious amounts of potent free-range cannabis. The unstable Daffy checks out of the party hotel by carving up his own wrists, but leaves behind a map to the hidden beach, which Richard discovers. Richard decides to go out in search of the beach, and takes along a young French couple he befriends along the way.<br/><br/>Eventually the trio discovers the fabled beach, hidden in a cove on a government-controlled island and known to exist only by the people who live there and a corrupt group of Thai dope-farmers, who tolerate the presence of the Utopian community so long as they keep it secret and do not invite any new residents. The community is governed by its founders, principally Sal (Tilda Swinton), a regal, quasi-aristocratic hippie goddess. Indeed, it seems like the most important requirement in qualifying for membership in the community is being lean, hip, beautiful, and European (Richard is the only American). The group accepts the new arrivals, on the condition that they will not leave and that no one knows where they are or how to find them. Life seems perfect: they live off the land, sleep in a Swiss Family Robinson-ish compound, and re-stock themselves occasionally with worldly amenities (tampons, batteries for CD-players and hand-held video games, soap and shampoo, etc.) with clandestine trips to the mainland where Sal sells big bags of dope to a hotelier who keeps the island secret in exchange for a cheap source of grass to sell to the tackier late-adolescent tourists. <br/><br/>All goes well for a while, until, predictably, 'trouble in paradise' emerges due to the typical jealousies and conflicts that are bound to happen in a scenario with a limited number of options for love and sexual companionship. Furthermore, Richard's position is imperiled by the fact that, before coming to the beach, he foolishly left a copy of the map with a pair of happy-go-lucky American stoners who had befriended him.<br/><br/>Then a tragic event forces Richard and his naive friends to face the fact that, Utopian free-love idealism aside, Sal and her co-horts will act ruthlessly and callously to protect the sanctity of their island paradise. It's a typical 'Lord of the Flies' sort of scenario, not particularly believable or persuasive.<br/><br/>The film was rightly judged as a failure, and the onus rests on two major factors: the casting of DiCaprio, and the collapse of the screenplay into incoherence at the mid-point.<br/><br/>Leo has finally started to mature into a leading-man quality actor, but he was too thin and boyish when 'The Beach' was made to be believable as the maverick Richard. Many have bemoaned the decision to make Richard (an Englishman in the source novel) American, and it's safe to conclude that this decision was a cynical effort to appeal to US audiences by giving them a lead they can identify with more directly, played by a popular US actor. DiCaprio is a great actor, but it's hard to buy scrawny Leo as the principle object of female desire when he's surrounded by a cadre of buffed up Euro-studs.<br/><br/>MacGregor would have made a much better Richard, undoubtedly, but even that wouldn't have saved the film, which careens off a self-indulgent neurotic cliff when the Richard character 'cracks up' in the film's final third. The narrative momentum grinds to a halt and never really recovers, and the conflict resolves itself with a disappointingly anti-climactic confrontation.<br/><br/>Not a great film by any means, but it's gorgeous to look at, the actors are appealing (even Leo, despite being miscast, is engaging and relatively fun to watch), and, most of all, it's fun to fantasize about what it might be like to stumble into a world where the days consist of nothing more than frolicking on the beach, feasting on the bounty of the sea and the fat of the land, balling with the beautiful people, and staying high."
"asylumseeker","7","1","4","2 April 2006"," A thought-provoking film
","Anyone who has backpacked to various parts of the world and trawled through youth hostels will appreciate some of the accurate observations in this film. It is basically about a backpacker who thinks he has found something different, but quickly discovers how insular and distorted the community he finds himself in is. I think this film makes a great point about how destructive inward-looking groups can be. Leonardo di Caprio's acting is a bit forced and over the top at times, and some things happen in the film which beggar belief, but overall it's a thoughtful account of the need for 'something more' in the lives of lots of young people, and how that 'something more' may not be travel, but a sense of community."

","I put a 7 down so people would think I wasn't a blatant fan boy of this movie. But it really deserves a 10. <br/><br/>This is an amazing movie because its purpose it so convey a story of adventure, prolific times in ones life, paradise found, mystery and again the thrill of pursuing beauty and all that life love and friendship has to offer. <br/><br/>This movie is a 10 because it does just that. In the best way. The performances are nothing short of solid. The casting is solid. And the scenery is ...well you get the point. <br/><br/>Songs like 8 ball by Underworld are perfect matches for the movie and the soundtrack is great. The only thing that I don't like about the movie is how tings go so terribly terribly wrong at the end. But hey, c'est la vie. Thats how life works and the message at the end about how paradise is all around us and cant just be sought out and found is a powerful and joyful lesson to learn at the end of the movie.

Also the danger can be inside the same group of people. Finally , that also inside an open-minded group of people some rules are necessary ... and that you can't be a real open-minded if the violence is part of your personality...<br/><br/>It renders very well that type of craziness where a person can fall into when alone and not accepted by the community.<br/><br/>Images are very beautiful, this movie is not boring, Di Caprio acts very good.<br/><br/>Its a very recommended movie to see."

","Alright the movie starts out with an adventurous vibe. A guy in a foreign land, seeking adventure, timid but curious at the same time. Within the first few seconds of the movie a guy asks Leo to drink snake blood! Everything is so exotic and out of this world! It's a real adventure. A treasure hunt for something beyond the norm. A front seat ride to paradise, no seat belts included! It's crazy pack full of emotion laughter sorrow drama and of course, tropical waters clear enough to see that this movie is an A++++ film! It's as playful as it is serious in the true quest for man to find peace in a world of anger. Whats the final message the movie attempts to get across? Well I wont spoil it here, but I definitely think it rings true and is very enlightening to those who have enough judgment to recognize the moral of the story. Go rent it and find out for yourself!! TWELVE THUMBS UP! :-) -aaron"
"silenthotel","5","1","4","11 August 2005"," Good film, but disappoints in the end
","The locations were incredible and this lifts the movie to at least 3 extra points. The story though froze in deep boredom once they actually reached the camp. Leo and the other actors were terrific and the direction was very good, but the story was terrible. I didn't like the book either. I think the main reason is the center piece - the compound of people. It could have really popped with characters we've never seen before - instead of utopia, it was a gripe session. More should have been made on the goals of the group and destructive forces surrounding it. Overall, great film for location, poor film for story. Recommended if you haven't read 'Lord of the Flies.'"
"hottievegaschica517","10","1","4","25 July 2005"," The purpose of this film...
","If you listen to what is really going on through out the movie- i.e. the secrecy of the island, Christo's fate, Sal's breakdown- shows how humanity is nothing more than the flaws we either overcome or succumb to. Great study of human nature. The whole thing starts out as Leonardo DiCaprio searches for adventure, traveling from country to country, no real way of knowing how he supports himself financially (never really mentioned outright in the movie), but seeing the things he does for entertainment makes one wonder if he may have a gambling problem, or if he is really just that bored. This film definitely takes his character on the ride he was asking for, but the ending was not exactly what he had been expecting as an outcome. And a little added bonus: finding that memories are nice, but the lifestyle must be let go."
"ehaugee","8","1","4","12 April 2005"," low expectations were wrong
","I thought this was going to be a sappy Leo DiCaprio love story--at least that's what the trailer lead me to believe. There was of course a love story on the side--but what movie nowadays doesn't have one? Instead I found it an intriguing, suspenseful, and entertaining journey into the mind of a man struggling to stay sane amid conflicting and sometime disturbing realities.<br/><br/>Like other Danny Boyle movies, namely Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, he does a masterful job of blending perceived truth with fiction. Highly recommended, but you will enjoy it more if you don't get your expectations up!"
"otatom","6","1","4","7 April 2005"," superb!
","I never went to see 'The Beach' or even bothered to rent it. The first time i saw it it was on television and i expected it to be just 'ok'. However 'The Beach' proved to be an intensely exciting film and was completely different from what i had expected and had been led to believe. The second time i saw it i found it even better than before. Many other reviews say that it was an insult to the original novel which i haven't read, so i wouldn't be able to judge that. People have said that the film is dumbed down and even a movie aimed at teenagers, i disagree with this, just because it doesn't seem to be a 'deep' movie and hasn't been marketed in this way doesn't mean that it is for morons, it has a lot of meanings and if you can't see them then it is a problem with you, not the movie. The acting is brilliant and the soundtrack is equally good. I don't understand how some people hate this film but enjoy other films like 'Meet the Fockers' which i think is 100% trash! This film is perhaps one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen, and anyone who hasn't seen it should do.<br/><br/>Thankyou for reading. Otatom has left the building."
"kevin_parks","9","1","4","19 January 2005"," either love it, or hate it.
","I loved it. And anyone that dreams of far away realistic adventures would love it as well. This movie is clearly aimed at an age range of 16-30. Excellent music, brilliant story, and The Beach itself make this movie superb. Although the acting isn't much in this movie, I don't think it had to be. I'm not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I can't see this picture without him being the lead actor. Same as Titanic really. This movie can be very trippy, and to some rather dull if they don't like the modern day sense it has. In summary, it's about a traveler in Thailand who has a need for something more. He doesn't want to do what every other tourist does. He finds out about an island which is said to be a myth. He meets two other travelers and they make their way to this island where they are greeted with an absolute paradise. The imagery alone makes this movie amazing, but the story within the imagery could not have been told better. A must see for anyone who dreams of spontaneous adventure."

","The Beach is my favourite movie of all time. I say half because I know that people expect me to love a picture with greater cinematic presence and half because it is the one movie that I watch to truly escape from my reality. Richard is the one character that has the chance to do what i have always wanted to do, get lost in the world, and find himself somewhere he never expected. Add to that the beautiful romance between him and Virginie, and you have the perfect story. I love to watch this movie for the great attention to detail by Danny Boyle in the picturesque settings matched with the perfect score. I love this movie in a way that is only fitting to me and I can understand that others may not feel the same way. It's just one of those movie that really hit me in a special way, can you dig it?"

","""The Beach"" is so bad, I feel sorry for Leo because this is most likely his best chance to prove whether or not his role as Jack Dawson was a fluke or he really is talented. It surrounds three people who discover a beach so secretive that the natives will kill for its privacy and secrecy.<br/><br/>Only one positive came out of ""The Beach"" and her name is Virginie Leyoden. She is a fresh face to Hollywood who contains enough talent to fill a gymnasium. With her role in ""The Beach,"" this actress solidifies herself as one of the most talented and beautiful newcomers to hit Hollywood since the arrival Monica Potter. Charm, charisma, presence and style were qualities that Leyoden brings to the table and makes ""The Beach"" a halfway decent film to watch.<br/><br/>I appreciate the attempt the writers make with bringing an otherwise good plot to this film. If the plot can determine the outcome of a movie, ""The Beach"" would be a winner in my book; however, that is not the case and the cast failed to follow through.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" was extremely slow, overacted and poorly written. I felt like leaving the room because I was yawning so much. A good attempt, but an awful outcome. <br/><br/>It is unfortunate that this film wastes a beautiful setting and the time of good actors; however, there is always room for improvement next time."

","The IMDb guidelines ask users, quite rightly, to refrain from gratuitously nasty comments.  I have to admit that, mildly speaking, I did not enjoy THE BEACH.  Suffice to say, the film's eagerness to adopt the DELIVERANCE/APOCALYPSE NOW/TAXI DRIVER mantle was compromised by its anti-septic, travel-brochure prettiness; that its megastar centrality resulted in play acting psychosis, rather than a disturbing embodiment (compare with Martin Sheen in APOCALYPSE NOW, for example); and that the film's fetishisation of youth's golden surface dazzles its professed aim of exploring its sinister undercurrents.  Boyle-MacDonald-Hodge once made TRAINSPOTTING; I hope they may do so again."

The cinematography in this movie was unlike anything i have ever seen.

","This is my favourite movie ever. Seeing that it contained Leo DiCaprio put me off watching it for a while, but to all the people who feel like that, you're missing out! He acts well in this one and he's not Leo, he's Richard. If you begin to watch the film and dislike it, stick with it. The film doesn't really get going for a few minutes. Even if you hate the entire film- unlikely- simply seeing that beautiful Thai island is enough, and the water. It is a really good film, that might not seem particularly deep at first but is really good to watch. The 'Richard's-going-mad-cartoon/video-game' sequence is quite mad, and reverts into Leo rather than Richard again, but it's only a short scene. I love Étienne and I feel really sorry for him!! It's so unfair, and Françoise is so unfaithful!! Also, in response to the person who said a community of 20-year-olds with no kids is unlikely- did you see the scene where Sal and Richard are doing the 'shopping trip' back to the mainland, and are laden with everyone's requests, not least a very large pack of Durex?

All characters in the movie are not only one-dimensional, but that dimension consists solely of being an utterly unlikable monkey. And pray tell, what possible purpose the stale narrator's voice is supposed serve?<br/><br/>I would say that the first half of the movie was majestetically boring, although that leaves me no means of describing the second half, and my only positive thought considering this picture was ""thank God I never saw this at the movies"". But hey, that's only because my image of paradise does not consist of pot, beach and Leonardo DiCaprio acting out his second least ambitious role, so obviously I am not this film's target audience. 2/10"

At least Hollywood High knew it was just an excuse to show some nudity (it was however mistaken in thinking it was a comedy). I digress. The point being that The Beach had no idea what it wanted to be. Is it a love story, and adventure, a psychological drama, a drama... who knows. Every time it seemed like it had finally made up it's mind the story line would change and ramble incoherently in another direction. I was speechless after watching it. I demand 2 hours of my life back, ok I know I can't get it but how about an apology for wasting my time (and my $ back if it isn't too much trouble).

"jboothmillard","8","2","22","24 June 2005"," The Beach
","From director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) this is a great adventure thriller. Based on the bestselling novel by Alex Garland, the story basically involves backpacker Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio, Boyle's first choice was Ewan McGregor) seeks adventure in Thailand, and he eventually finds it with drug-crazed Daffy (Robert Carlyle). He tells him of a secret tropical beach, and after killing himself leaves him a map, that Richard copies for some guys he met. He then rounds up two friends, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend Etienne (Guillaume Canet). They travel by boat for half the journey and swim the rest, after landing on the island, they escape some troops who own the near marijuana field, jump off high rock to water, and meet Keaty (Paterson Joseph). The island's leader Sal (The Chronicles of Narnia's Tilda Swinton) allows them to stay, as long as they do not go back and tell others, and after settling in and being accepted, they become very accustomed to the paradise (who wouldn't). Richard also gets closer to both Françoise and Sal behind boyfriends' backs, and even survives a shark attack. The paradise starts to crumble though, after more people start to come, and they also die from shark attack, this is when Richard rebels and hides from everyone, in his madness/depression, he even sees himself talking to dead Daffy. The paradise ends when after finding out about more people coming to the island, the troops force them off the island, and all try to go back to some sort of normal life, but they all have their memories of the good times on the island. Also starring Lars Arentz Hansen as Bugs and Daniel York as Hustler. The adventure is a lot of fun, DiCaprio is very good, most characters have their own lovable qualities, the big visual moments, e.g. surreal, are fantastic, the cinematography of the tropical beach is magnificent, and the soundtrack is fantastic, including All Saints' ""Pure Shores"" and Moby's ""Porcelain"". Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Robert Carlyle was number 17 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Tilda Swinton was number 44 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Very good!"

","Ignore the low rating here on IMDb. This movie is some decent and pretty looking entertainment. It's a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's a movie made without any potential and in the long run it's a pretty good and entertaining enough movie.<br/><br/>It's very simple to say why this movie 'flopped'. Reason for this was Leonardo DiCaprio. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no Leo hater, that's not my point. My point is, you have to consider the fact that this movie was released in 2000, 3 years after his role in ""Titanic"". Most of the male audience couldn't stand DiCaprio after his sappy role in this movie but most girls loved him. That's why the guys didn't went to see ""The Beach"" when it was released and also females didn't went to see it because this is a totally different movie and role for DiCaprio. So it was the wrong timing or the casting, both are possibilities, which caused this movie to not be a very successful one at the box office and among critics because they were not at the time quite ready yet to see DiCaprio in a totally different role, even though in the past he already had played a wide diversity of roles.<br/><br/>Too bad because the movie really deserved a better faith. Granted that it's no masterpiece but than again it doesn't really try to be one. The story doesn't really try to go deep, even though they could had easily gone that way with it. Instead it's a movie with multiple layers in it that go in good into some certain issues handled in the movie. The movie tries to be as realistic as possible even though the story at times certainly isn't. A reason why ""The Beach"" is just a good movie and not a great one.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful looking and has some nice settings. The directing is quite original at times which helps to give the movie its own unique feeling. Also the story helps to make this movie an original one and it's quite thought provoking at certain moments.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio shows with this movie once more that he is more than just a pretty face. He's a real talented actor and this movie truly shows his, by many yet undiscovered, talent. Robert Carlyle is also great in a fairly small but still important role. A nice surprise in the movie was Guillaume Canet. This is a great French actor, who mainly only makes French movies and already has been nominated twice for a César Award. (Let's say the French Oscar for French movies.)<br/><br/>A simple entertaining movie made without any potential. Would it had been released let's say 5 years later it would had received a better faith and a more wider audience.

Maybe the reason for not sharing characters' back stories is a way to say that you can be anyone on a vacation, or everyone starts fresh on a deserted island.<br/><br/>But I personally prefer to hear about the lives of all key characters in a movie like this. Just have them explain in a conversation with each other. Then I would care more about them. But they didn't do this.<br/><br/>I like to reminisce about being young and about adventures I had or wished I had. So I enjoyed living vicariously through our main character. Thailand is one of those places where you are likely to meet Europeans seeking adventure or release, because many live in cold, uptight societies. So I believed the fact that most of the beach people were from Europe.<br/><br/>It is totally true that no matter where you travel, you bring yourself and your nature with you. There are some good lines in this film about that. Also that any grouping of people will include ""Alphas,"" ""Betas,"" and assorted misfits. At every job I've ever had, ever group trip I've ever taken, every school I've ever attended, there were always all those types, and they didn't get along.<br/><br/>
Something I read into the plot that we are not told, is that the leader woman may come from money. Maybe they don't just exist on money from selling pot. She probably has a trust fund. That may not be in the book. But it would make sense.<br/><br/>I liked DiCaprio here, because he had that fresh, youthful loser guy vibe down perfectly. A guy who had nothing going for him, but was ready and eager to reinvent himself. He looked genuinely excited to be alive and experience this adventure, until it went bad.<br/><br/>
I totally believed the young French couple. They were perfectly cast. As were the beach dwellers. I also liked the device of using physical injury or illness as the threat to paradise.<br/><br/>As for depth, we needed to hear more conversation about the nature of life. There is a good line in the final narration about what it means to find paradise. But I would have liked to hear some debates about morality. At least there was one somewhat Christian guy and one Catholic who shows some integrity.<br/><br/>
They should have cut the entire sequence of animation. It did not fit. It was like a separate movie. I like the idea of our character starting to lose it, and witnessing what he did, but minus the technical hijinks.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile the ending was fine for me. It made sense, and I loved the touch of having him reflect on it all at a cafÃ©."

I feel the same about Bangkok, and I am happy to be 'lost' in the paddy fields and in the woods by the Mekong River, at the border with Laos.

","The film version of The Beach is not as gripping as the book, which is an absolute page turner. If you haven't read the book yet, I highly suggest you give it a read. The film is still very entertaining though, as it keeps you interested throughout, and is filled with beautiful cinematography and landscapes. Leonardo absolutely steals the show, as he does in just about all of his movies, and does a great job of portraying the young, starry eyed traveler Richard, who is seeking the ultimate journey and eventually is pushed to the brink of insanity by the utopia he was so eagerly seeking.<br/><br/>One way that the film bested the book, IMO, is by having Richard travel to the mainland with Sal for supplies instead of Jed. I think this was a much better way to depict the interactions and relationship between Richard and Sal, while also building more of an urgency for Richard to keep the others from reaching the island. It absolutely made more sense for Richard to fear being blackmailed by Sal over what transpired during their trip to the mainland than what transpired in the book."
"michiostermann","7","0","2","23 April 2018"," A movie by Danny Boyle with Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role. Can there anything go wrong?
","The movie the beach was made in 2000 by the british director Danny Boyle. 
He made his breakthrough with the movie Trainspotting of the year 1996. He is responsible for many other good movies, for example 127 hours with James Franco, 128 days later or the very succesful slumdog millionaire. For me Trainspotting will be always Boyle's best movie. I have seen the beach approximately 1 year ago and i have to say that i wasn't dissappointed about this Drama film, even if the movie can't compete with the best movies of this british guy. Honestly the plot is not so exciting to watch this film more times. But an typical loosening Boyle atmosphere and easygoing Performance by a young Leonardo DiCaprio are enough for me to feel entertained. Leo is one of my favourite actors and i enjoyed it very much to see him in a not so mysterious role like in his younger movies Inception, Shutter Island or The Revenant. (Excepted The Wolf of Wallstreet) 
Finally i have to say, this film improved my mood and that's the most critical thing for me to recommend you this movie, especially if you like Danny Boyle and Leonardo Dicaprio movies in general. In the end i give this movie 7 from 10 possible stars."

","This movie received a lot of hate when it came out due to DiCaprio's fame with females after his appearance in Titanic (much like how everyone loves to hate Bieber today), and I kept far away from this movie for many years. I too only knew him from Titanic at that point, and when I saw him shirtless on the movie poster I had pretty clear assumptions of what this movie would be like. But I was wrong. This movie is great. Its a captivating 90s new age adventure with lots of twists and thrills, and i kicked myself for not watching it sooner. If you like Inception or Shutter Island, then i think you will like this one too."

","For starters it is a Danny Boyle film and that goes a long way, he is a great director...but Leo, oh Leo, you were miscast. That role was supposed to go to Ewan McGregor and had it kept the intended actor, it would have been a much different beast, and one far closer to the novel.<br/><br/>Recasting Richard as an American, was in some cases, the biggest mistake. The insights he is supposed to deliver are more fragmented and make less sense coming from someone that isn't as close to Europe and the opportunities to experience the different cultures on a more regular basis.<br/><br/>The book itself is about a traveler and American's hardly do that. Gen-X might, but that is about all, one Generation of hopeless wanderers since the Beat Movement.<br/><br/>Still, despite the flaw it stands as a nice re-imagining, as a solid updated version of Thomas More's ""Utopia."" The monastery has been replaced with the commune. God with marijuana. The written correspondence with the internal monologue of a flawed protagonist. But the theme is the same. Utopia is no place. Void. It does not exist.<br/><br/>And the movie does a good job of capturing the hope of a Utopian offer and then revealing the truth behind that veil.<br/><br/>Had the casting been right, and not to say that DiCaprio isn't a great actor in his own right, but had the role of Richard been filled with the actor best suited for it, the film would have worked on a fundamentally brilliant level on par with Garland's source material.<br/><br/>Still, DiCaprio is a competent actor and he did his best despite the fact the role was wrong for him. The faults are small, but for some not easily over looked."

"JTriska-280-686514","8","0","1","31 January 2012"," An underrated film
","I watched it again recently and was struck by how the narrative and the various plot devices fit into the whole ""heart of darkness"" journey that is also seen in the works of Joseph Conrad and 'Apocalypse Now'. You basically have a character who is slightly obsessed with an idea and a vision, follows it to an extreme length and finally arrives at a place that is paradoxical and more than anyone is prepared to handle, both in the social and geographical sense, but also in the sense that Di Caprio's character goes to some dark places in his own mind. The film is layered - it could be seen as a parable of paradise gained/paradise lost, it could also be seen as one man's existential journey, but it could also conceivably be taken as a somewhat critical study of Utopian societies. The superficially happy and leisure-oriented hippies in the beatific 'commune' on an isolated island actually turn out to have some nasty characteristics: jealousy, ruthlessness, elitism and the usual fights for rank and control of the dialogue. The dope-growing Thai 'farmers' on the other side of the island are not as nasty as their image suggests but are ready to unleash lethal violence when they feel squeezed and exposed. I started to side more and more with these irritated, AK-47 wielding characters because their message of ""no more visitors on our secret island"" struck a chord. Man tends to overrun, overpopulate and exploit what had previously been beautiful places. Man also has the tendency to make some shady compromises and rationalize some heartless, cold behaviour (means justify the Utopian end). Anyhow, it's a deep film on that level. And if you don't want to watch something deep, the scenery, both natural and human, is eye-catching, and the filmmaking itself simply takes you on a weird trip through a colour-saturated paradise, with the occasional slice of hell dropped in it."

","This is a pretty good movie by Danny Boyle, I like this guy as a director as for Leo. Well I just wasn't fond of the guy as an actor at this time. Anyways back to the movie, I enjoyed watching some of the human thoughts and emotions that is portrayed in this movie. It's a exquisite film that makes some interesting points about people and life. Although I wasn't fond of DiCaprio as an actor at this time, his emotions was mostly believable in this. And the characters emotions is very very important for this movie. I am not sure if Leo was just playing Leo, which it seemed likely but it was believable. The plot is about a guy trying to move away from the life of just originality and problems people face during regular basis which I can relate with, since people want that sense of adventure. And when he finds the opportunity for a place of paradise he takes it, but he is in for more than what he bargained for. And no this is not a horror flick but more about human nature. The situation isn't all that believable but the some of the human nature aspect of it all is believable. So this is a character driven movie, and there is bunch of characters in this movie but for the most part you will no care for any of them. There is almost zero attachment to the characters in this. Even if the start of the movie went in a interesting direction the movie seemed to get dragged out after an hour an 30 minutes into it, although it's the climax. And also seemed a bit far-fetched as it went along. It just seemed a bit drastic and a bit out of nowhere.

","Let me start by suggesting that anyone who has seen this film and has not read the book to do so urgently. The book is an absolutely spectacular piece of literature compared to the film. Also, having such complimenting visuals to assign whilst reading which I will come to explain really make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>I have read in many sources that Danny Boyle did not bother to even read the book in preparation for his role as director. Very unfortunate, and this has major implications for the film. I will run through the film step by step. 1. Actor selection - generally extremely good. Some fantastic choices, really encompassing what people reading the book might imagine the actual people to be like. Tilda Swinton as Sal, the french couple, Keaty, Carlyle as Daffy - all brilliant choices. Dicaprio as Richard is also a fine selection. Boyle decided to deviate on the characters nationalities from the book, unusual but something I could live with. However for some bizarre reason one of the main and most intriguing characters from the book, Jed, is omitted entirely. Strange. 2. Location. Visually, this film was as true to the book and subsequently as perfect as can be. Fantastic real representation of what I only could imagine whilst reading the novel. 3. Plot and screenplay. Oh dear. Apparently the concept of utopia and the fascinating disillusionment of the characters with it was not good enough to sell cinema tickets for an evidently rather simple minded Boyle. He instead got rid of most of what made the book such a good read, and instead through together some petty romance to entertain viewers. Disappointing shortfall. These fictitious romances also altered the plot as well, and not exactly for the best. Boyle also deviated from the epic climax of the film. 4. The soundtrack. Wow. Fantastic auditory selections to encompass beautiful visuals. Although it was not the main movie theme song Pure Shores that really emphasizes what this work is really about, but instead songs such as Porcelain and 8 Ball.<br/><br/>Overall this film still scores pretty high on my personal scale. Unfortunately though it is a true tale of two cities - superb elements twinned with extreme disappointments. Would have loved to have seen this produced under the wing of a more competent and engaging director."

From what I know Boyle makes most of his films based upon novels, and I make it a point to not read the novel to enjoy the film. The Beach doesn't disappoint and while some characters could have been more roles -- Ledoyen was practically paraded through the entire movie -- the premise and the beautiful locales make it a film worth watching.

"Stampsfightclub","7","0","1","11 August 2009"," Poor scripting is insignificant as Brill Boyle sets up another wonder
","Richard (Di Caprio) stumbles across a map that gives the location to an island that contains all the elements for a peaceful existence.<br/><br/>Almost 10 years ago, Danny Boyle controversially left behind his Trainspotting and A Life less Ordinary star Ewan McGregor and was replaced by one of America's biggest stars for the leading role in the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel.<br/><br/>With Di Caprio still a heart throb after his roles in Titanic and Romeo and Juliet this was arguably the change in his career as he progressed into cinema's more dramatic genre. His articulate soft spoken style works wonders and whilst this is by no means his best ever performance, he is the necessity element that holds the script together.<br/><br/>As the film gets under way with the actor's narration explaining the formality of everyday holidays and the problems with the system Danny Boyle uses an element he lives for, the setting.<br/><br/>From 28 days later to Slumdog Millionaire the Bury born director simply knows how to set the scene in a way that is perfectly in line with the situation on screen. This beginning is perfectly realistic of a person in a foreign land adjusting to the scene as Di Caprio flits around the buyers and sellers in the market. But when the film finally reaches the beach does Boyle's presence really become profound.<br/><br/>It may sound cheesy but the setting sweeping notion feels as if you are right there on that island as Boyle swoops around the dreaming paradise. The helicopter shots and the bird eye view snaps generate a unique essence of the freedom and imagination of the supposed concept of independent holiday as Di Caprio and his friends end up in the midst of a hidden tribe.<br/><br/>The idea alone is brilliant. To escape and not have rules and regulations seems too sceptical for the everyday person like Di Caprio's Richard but after a run in with the marvellous Robert Carlyle the clues are dropped and the journey to the island itself is brilliant with some stunning shots in the water.<br/><br/>As the film progresses there are numerous factors that generate the essence of drama juxtaposed with fantasy. Richard's secret hinders with some questionable dialogue but the power of the performance neglects the scripting. There is an inclusion of romantic lust that is fairly predictable but the outcome certainly isn't.<br/><br/>There are other problems with this picture. For example the scripting is insignificant. Nothing is spoken unless it is a cue for drama to be created or for the plot to move forward. The bizarre game styled fantasy of Richard's is too out of place for the context of the moment.<br/><br/>The ending is a let down because of the way the conclusion was assumed. Nevertheless Boyle's filming and accurate talent at depicting the setting with the situation is the main reason to check this out."

"Steinikr","8","0","2","22 May 2009"," Definitely one of the most underrated movies out there!
","I can't really remember when I saw The Beach for the first time, it was probably some time after it's release, 2000-2002. I remember though that most people didn't think too highly of this movie, which in a way, kind of bummed me out. I guess the majority of film viewers don't really feel like opening their minds too much, they just want something easy and then 2 hours later they go on with their lives. And with a film like this, that doesn't really work out. You have to give it some time and keep your mind open for incoming ideas. It's very philosophical in a way, which actually is one of the greatest things about it.<br/><br/>With time as I saw this movie once and once, here and there, I started noticing all the little things in this movie that really make it what it is; an outstanding example of excellent film-making. This movie takes you somewhere else... which in my opinion is a big point in film-making. <br/><br/>People who tend to glue themselves to the ground, over-analyzing details every step of the way; might not find this movie as rewarding as people who give in to every emotion that comes along the way.<br/><br/>The story follows the adventure of Richard, an American(the only two things we know about him) who's on his great journey to experience something unique.. something else than what is to be found in his everyday life. He eventually hooks up with two Europeans after he hears about this magical island, a paradise island covered with white sand and surrounded by crystal clear ocean. Without going into the plot more thoroughly I'll say that what struck me so hard about this movie is that, like said in the movie; that paradise is not a place you find or a somewhere you just go to. It's something you'll only find in time while exploring the abundance of landscapes, cultures, societies and of course all the visually stunning wonders of our world. It might not last long, maybe not even a second, but if you'll ever get there.. you'll remember it as long as you live. And our little protagonist is willing to go great lengths to reach that moment, even if there's the chance of death. Once in a place of purity, freedom and never-ending euphoria the character finds that there is a thin line between paradise and hell. How such beautiful places can so swiftly take away your sanity.<br/><br/>I'll say that I haven't yet had the courage to embark on such a great trip yet, I intend to. But meanwhile, this movie successfully takes me to that place of paradise where every problem just goes away. The soundtrack to this movie, combined with stunning cinematography is just something that makes you forget everything and sucks you into this world of perfection, where even the most lustrous shores can evenly be paralleled by hell. <br/><br/>Give this movie a shot and just use your imagination for a while. I watch this movie probably several times a year and it's one of those movies that just soothes me down.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 because it exceeded my expectations by far and gives me everything I expect from it. It fulfills it's role perfectly. Highly recommendable to anyone longing to travel the world, just to see something new."

Everything was great about this movie except the ending which could be much better.

","Leonardo DiCaprio sought to distance himself from the purity of his character in Titanic, and his role in The Beach is in many ways a polar opposite. As Richard, a young American seeking to ""suck in the experience"" of freestyle travel in Thailand, he's a chronic liar, a pot-smoking hedonist, an amoral lover, and ultimately an unstable snake in a doomed Garden of Eden. This crazy descent might be expected from the filmmakers of Trainspotting, but The Beach is a movie without a rudder, venturing into fascinating territory, promising a stimulating adventure, and then careening out of control. After receiving a not-so-secret map to a secluded island from a stoned-out loony (Robert Carlyle, full of dark portent and spittle), Richard sets out to find the hidden paradise with a young French couple (Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet). What they find is a tropical commune existing in delicate balance with Thai pot farmers, and before long--as always--there's trouble in paradise. There's trouble in the movie, too, as DiCaprio is reduced to histrionics when the plot turns into a muddled mix of Lord of the Flies and Apocalypse Now, with shark attacks tossed in for shallow tension. Director Danny Boyle attempts perfunctory romance and a few audacious moves (notably DiCaprio's vision of life as a violent video game), but what's the point? Tilda Swinton registers strongly as the commune's charismatic leader, but her character--and the entire film--remains largely undeveloped, and pretty scenery is no guarantee of a laudable film."
"iamjcollins","7","0","1","12 March 2008"," Good for the right audience
","It seems that The Beach receives extremely poor ratings, and perhaps with good reason. Leonardo DiCaprio may not be the ideal man for this leading role - in the original novel, Richard is English - but his performance is of an above average standard. While on the subject of acting, perhaps I may mention one of Tilda Swinton's worse roles. It's not that she is bad in The Beach, but she's not great either.<br/><br/>As a fan of Alex Garland's original novel, I find this film to be extremely Hollywood-engineered: An English lead character? A story without a sex scene? Where's the fun in that?! Still, even if like me, you're a fan of the source material, The Beach can still be a fun trip.<br/><br/>The story has a very escapist feel to it, and the narrative on-the-whole keeps us empathising with an increasingly disturbed Richard. Add to this a top electronic soundtrack that appeals to the characters (as well as the audience!) and you find that The Beach is not as bad as you may have been warned."

","Well, here we are, The Beach....I remember the outcry from the Thai government at the time of filming, that they were tearing up the beach and removing trees etc. However, I remember being set up on a blind date, let me tell you I found the movie more compelling. It starts off with Richard (Di Caprio) who's travelled to Thailand and whilst there he meets Daffy (Carlyle), who gives him a map to find The Beach. When he arrives to The beach having already shacked up with Etienne and Francoise, you begin to get the vibe and feel of how it is within their self-sufficient community on this tropical paradise. I found this film entertaining, the soundtrack is quite simply amazing and it gives you inspiration to want to travel yourself ! I was staying in Ipanema Beach House (Rio de Janeiro) back in the summer of 2005 with many travellers and this movie brings back great memories of being there and meeting new people. The acting and shots were very good and the scenery was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Regardless of being a Di Caprio fan or not, if you love to travel, or you've had some sort of experience like I did staying in a youth hostel in a beach resort, this movie is for you, so discover the movie for yourself and ignore any negative press said about it !!

Let me be brief...this film is brilliant; visually stimulating, intelligently written and heartbreakingly realised. The fact people need to be spoon fed a characters motives is typical of people going to a see a film, with the idea of escaping from the realities of their lives. It seems most people were hypnotised by the blue skies and olive skinned brunettes to actually understand what this film is trying to say? Either that or their spoilt lifestyles left them no time to reflect and empathise with the human condition...if this is the case then they shouldn't even bother gracing the shores of this cinematic masterpiece as there's plenty of holes in the sand to be filled.<br/><br/>If you have indeed enjoyed some life experience - good or bad, then i suggest you watch this film and get lost in its sheer, yet relative, surrealism."

","I really do not understand why people hate this movie so much. The first time I saw this movie I was left feeling 'wow'. I found it extremely thought provoking and still do when I watch it now. People that dislike this movie are clearly missing the whole point of the film. Maybe the fact that some people hate this movie so much while others love it, is that some people are tourists looking for the simple stuff while others are travellers - open to experience something new. The films focus on the search for paradise is fantastic. The scene where Richard returns to the mainland to pick up some supplies really demonstrates how something as beautiful as the beach, can turn someone bad. He believes that The Beach is an exclusive place and the people who do not know about do not qualify for a place so perfect. All in all it's a really good movie, even if towards the end it does start to get slightly dodgy (especially with the pointless sex scenes), but the beginning and the very end are fantastic. Do not listen to all the reviews saying it was the worst film of the year, see it for yourself and try not to be the regular tourist."

","Maybe I have been hidden in a dark hole since this movie came out in 2000/01, but I have never heard of it or saw it until it came on the Bravo channel on television tonight. While I was watching it, I saw an actor who I thought was Patrick Dempsey. I asked my husband to come and see, but of course he has to look everything up on the internet, first of all to find out the name of the movie, then he tells me that it is not Patrick Dempsey it is a French actor named Guillaume Canet, playing the character of Etinne. I still believe the French actor, ""Guillaume Canet"" is Patrick Dempsey (alias Dr. McDreamy). If not, Canet must be Dempsey's long lost/adopted out/identical twin brother. As soon as I saw him on the screen, I thought, oh so this was Dempsey's acting gig between the 80's and the Lifetime mini-series ""A Weekend in Pregatory"", before his big break with Grey's Anatomy. I can't be the only person that thinks Canet & Dempsey are one in the same or at least his identical twin brother!!! Once I saw this, it was hard for me to get into the movie except for some of Leo's ""Richard's"" scenes, especially the scene where Richard is having his nervous break down and actually sees three American tourist murdered in the marijuana field and then he starts running for his own life, which brought him somewhat semi-back as much as possible, to reality afterwards. If you agree, about the Dempsey/Canet theory let me know, even if I am five or six years late!!!"

","The Beach (2000)- 4/5<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, Virginie Ledoyen, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Guillaume Canet, Paterson Joseph. Directed by Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>People often bash ""The Beach"" because of either two reasons: it is under-developed, or Leonardo DiCaprio ""sucked"" in it. I highly think differently on both counts. It is a film with an exhilarating direction by Danny Boyle with an interesting concept and characters.<br/><br/>A young, curious, nicotine-addicted man named Richard travels to Thailand in search of something new. He meets a crazy hotel neighbor named Daffy who tells him about a secret island that he refers to as paradise. Daffy kills himself shortly after and leaves a map for Richard. Curious on whether the island exists, he invites two French friends from the hotel to come with him on a journey to the island. They meet others on the island who have very similar interests to Richard about escaping the real world to paradise, but all of that can soon change.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" shouldn't really have as much negative feedback as it often gets. DiCaprio gives a good post-""Titanic"" performance, where he would later have even better roles (""Gangs of New York"", ""The Aviator""). Boyle's direction is solid and very crazy at times. The cinematography is stunning, and gives both a visceral blue and gritty picture.<br/><br/>There are only a few flaws, and the high majority of them are in the last 1/3 or so of the film. Richard's descent into madness happens way too quickly, and some of his hallucinations and thoughts are rather confusing. His character undergoes changes and is able to recover; I didn't really understand what the director was trying to say in that aside of giving references to films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and novels like ""Lord of the Flies."" Overall, ""The Beach"" is a movie that I can highly recommend to anyone who is need for something different, like the protagonist in the film. It gets better on each very, but isn't ever a perfect piece. While not a great movie, ""The Beach"" was an overlooked visual piece that deserves more respect than it gets."

It is cool when he arrives in Thailand, finds the map and they swim to the island, because of the suspense and all (though not enough of that either). However, the disappointing thing is that the to-be-expected alternative people on the island aren't alternative in any significant way (except their clothes and makeover), and lack any kind of interesting alternative ideas that their life there, one would expect, be based on. They just created a relatively quiet and private city away from the city, and even buy most of what they need from the big city.<br/><br/>Anyways, I found DiCaprio's performance quite good, though his character was somewhat disoriented and finally kind of broke down psychologically as he got isolated and started getting high on shrooms. He kind of really whacked out.<br/><br/>I would have still been happy to see the movie as a good adventure in beautiful environment, but that you can't fully enjoy either since the sight of the shark stricken people in its middle is more than very hard to take calmly, though the styling of it is i suppose what would be called professional.<br/><br/>It is an OK movie."

Sure, they had to chop out some characters and situations and speed things along because it is only a 2 hour movie... but I think what they kept in is reasonably entertaining. The plot, dialogue and acting are all up to par. The movie as a whole may not be up there with ""Trainspotting"" or ""28 Days Later""... but as a ""star vehicle"" for rising young actor Leonardo DiCaprio it does the job... and the result isn't something that he should be overly embarrassed about as it keeps popping up in his resume. A young, pretentious American goes abroad to experience life as regular tourists seldom do. He hears of a mysterious island that is supposedly the closest thing to paradise on Earth.. but once he gets there he learns that people and paradise don't mix well together.

"MarcMV12","Null","0","2","7 December 2004"," Hedonistic, Hippy Dross
","The Beach is a film about the last sanctuary known to man, untouched by Capitalism, pollution, politics, domestic banality, constraint etc. Or at least it is until Leo DiCaprio (Richard) arrives.<br/><br/>Basically the story is that Daffy founded this pure paradise based on the age old quest for living life to the max and having fun. Somewhere down the line, like every Utopian fantasy, the dream became a nightmare. Richard appears to be the one who sees the beauty of The Beach, but gets warped by the usual human emotions of lust, greed, jealousy, hate, pride - the seven deadly sins really. He lusts after Francoise, is greedy when he also sleeps with Sal, becomes absorbed in self importance when he defeats the shark, and claims to be the master of the island. Ultimately, however, it is the old cliché that nature is beautiful and pure, and it is man and human emotion that corrupts that is sickening in this film. Its like ""The Beach"" is one great metaphor for The Garden of Eaden, where Richard is tempted (and falls) for not one, but two spoken for women. He lies his way through the film in order to keep what he sees as his hedonistic right, before seeing the community for the hypocrites they are and wanting to have nothing to do with it. On top of that, the choice of DiCaprio was obviously to appeal to the female audience, and its a very bad miscast for the role he is playing. His shouting makes him sound like a pathetic petulant child, and his swearing just does not suit him. it is clever that people from all corners of the globe reside at the Beach, but it is just another layer of ""what are they getting at by this"" on top of other complexities.<br/><br/>The problem remains that there are two many metaphors, twists, unanswered questions, and confusing moments to make this film matter. I think Trainspotting by Danny Boyle is one of the best films ever made, but this is just a mish mash of hedonistic, hippy dross.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this, unless you are a philosopher who like spending hours upon end deciphering films.<br/><br/>Marc."

The only other thing that turned me away from this film at first was the casting of Leonardo di caprio, i enjoyed his performance in 'basketball diaries' but his other later work on films such as 'titanic' and 'the man in the iron mask' made me think he had out grown his talent and become very wooden. The beach returned my liking of leo, may be he is a talented actor, or may be he is just good at playing absolute nutters. his character was very likable as he descended to madness due to the beach being far to beautiful. And the love interest in francoise (the actress name escapes me) was dealt with impeccably by the writer/director. The actress was both convincing and beautiful, every thing the script asked of her. Although some cgi work with sharks is very poor, to the standard of the 3d jaws film, the director captures tohe moment very well and u cna get passed the weak special effects. the film was very enjoyable as i could relate to the characters, especially when leo comments on the fact when u have a crush everything they do seems interestin, even though it is actually very dull.

Tilda Swinton was pretty good in the role of Sal. Virginie Ledoyen, when the movie actually focused on her, was very good; however, she was rarely there, and just mainly served as The Love Interest, and nothing else. The movie could have been a lot better if it focused on the love triangle between her, DiCaprio and Canet's characters. The triangle was mostly useless, as Canet just let go of Ledoyen like *that* -- everything just seemed to go on without even acknowledging that Ledoyen had cheated on her boyfriend. Essentially no emotions are shown. IMHO, the love triangle could have just been cut out of the movie, as it was useless.<br/><br/>Up until Ledoyen cheats on Canet, I really liked this movie. The very beginning, I thought, was very nicely done, and I liked the character of Daffy. The scenery, too, was absolutely stunning. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, I felt that it focused so much on fleshing out Richard's character  which it didn't do a very good job of  and mainly just focusing on *him* that it left out everything else in the movie that would have made it much better.<br/><br/>Overall, this film had potential, and if you just tweaked it a bit it could have been great. If you're ever in the mood for an all right film on a boring, rainy day, this is for you.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 6/10"

But most of us work and struggle from day to day to pay the bills. Would we swap that for the lifestyle displayed in this film? I doubt it. Most of us would have the island developed with hotels and every latest amenity for a 2 week break.<br/><br/>This film does very well in showing that the idyllic hippy life is not for the majority of us.

","The Beach was a very odd movie experience for me. On the plus side, this was visually beautiful. What a feast for the eyes!  Being a person who craves visually beautiful movies, that was a plus for me. Unfortunetly, the minuses are everything else. This movie was a letdown. It just was. It started out ok, not really great but maybe passable.Strong visuals from the start. Haunting. I thought it was going to be very David Lynch at first, it had that feel. Decaprio plays the drifter who wants to find paradise for the soul and he and a young french couple find it, in the form of a secluded beach populated by strange people, which comes to include the three above mentioned individuals.<br/><br/>Great premise-but the movie itself didn't pull it off. I'm still not sure what The Beach was trying to do. Or say. WARNING-THESE NEXT LINES WILL CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS: The whole thing went from, if not spellbinding, at least surreal and a bit arty, to ""Lord of the flies-where they are now"". It was almost ridiculous. I soon tuned out, as the story became preposterous and almost a takeoff on a movie that I had seen in its ORIGINAL and loved dearly.<br/><br/>
I have read many reviews on the beach, none very good, and I honestly understand why(although many times I don't agree with critics). This could have been SO SO good. It had an interesting story but ultimately dissolved into senselessness. The film didn't need to borrow from other films, it showed some promise of early magic-although I never felt it was GREAT, I did feel it had the potential to haunt me.<br/><br/>So, in closing, I have to say I didn't much like this movie but I may, unlike with most films I don't like, give it a second viewing(maybe not alone this time.) I would like to see what friends have to say about this one, so far nobody in my circle has seen it. It's a pity this disolved the way it did but if it turns out my feelings change on this one, I'll post another review. Right now I'd have to say about The Beach-Almost haunting, beautiflly crafted visually, movie that had promise-but went the way of absurd, disjointed Lord of the flies gone wrong."

"Gav_tH","4","0","1","7 January 2004"," A weak movie, but decent enough to hold up
","***This summary may contain ~SPOILERS~, depending on how strict you are on the term. I hope this warning keeps in with the IMDb guidelines. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. That said, you have been warned***<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>There are a lot of good things to say about The Beach. As a novel, the book is apparently very well thought out and interesting. Unfortunately, despite a strong beginning and some standout acting, the big-screen adaption of The Beach fails to deliver a believable or strong story, yet holds up as an average, enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the book, though I like what I have heard. Going by the screenplay, however, we follow Leonardo DiCaprio's character (very convincingly played) through his journey from Bangkok to a new home on and island resort. The premise is fairly simple, but is given some depth due to many subplots and character relationships. Many of the characters are likable, and Robbie Carlyle's appearance is fantastic and well directed. The film definitely has it's merits, and it's ability to build up tension throughout is a very commendable feat of it's director - there is definitely some haunting imagery through here.<br/><br/>However, I find I couldn't enjoy The Beach as much as I had hoped to. It is hard to tell just what sort of film The Beach actually is. At times, the story dips into farce with scenes that come across as unintentionally amusing - many things are hit and miss. For example, a CG sequence with a pixilated DiCaprio is very overdone, and kills a lot of the tension in the sequence. Moments like these not only feel out of place, but they ruin the general atmosphere of the movie and make it feel uncertain of what it wants to be. At times, I had the impression of it being a parody of itself, and yet, in others, there are moments of genuine tension and horror, with fantastic imagery and symbolism.<br/><br/>Most of the movie lives and dies by it's characters. Throughout most of the second act, many characters are developed, and it is this development that keeps the movie strong, as the movie changes slowly in it's tone from a light-hearted, easy going film to a dark thriller. The film definitely has character - something lacking from many films today - and it is this atmosphere and character that drives the movie forward.<br/><br/>The Beach isn't a horrible film, but I wouldn't say it was a favourite of mine. Apparently many characters were cut from this adaption, and as such that may account for some of the movie's poor plot progression. I am interested enough to read the novel due to watching the movie, but as a movie itself The Beach is weakly scripted and at times mis-directed. The dialogue is a tad overdone - DiCaprio's philosophy is intriguing, but doesn't seem to match up to the character we see on screen.<br/><br/>Despite all of it's flaws, The Beach does hold up and manages to drive it's journey to a definite conclusion - and does manage to stay entertaining. Personally, I think the movie could have been edited better. In my opinion, a few script redacts would have added to our ability to believe the story - the opening, while very impressive, is rather weak, and it's hard to believe any characters could act so impulsively. The script does feel unfocussed.<br/><br/>Despite a fairly sketchy script and these occasional missteps, The Beach manages to tell an intriguing story of a man who seeks for more from life, and because of this the viewer manages to stay interested. There are a few commendable moments, and performances are generally well-given all round. The production values are high and it shows - the set pieces are elaborate and beautiful. I feel many characters are underused - especially the supposed villains of the piece. But, all of these flaws can be easily overlooked if you simply sit back and enjoy what is there instead of what isn't. Despite wasted potential, I think The Beach is a decent, if not great, movie. It's not a life-changing experience, but watchable, definitely."

The soundtrack is a classic, and fits in brilliantly with some great scenes.

","The Beach.  What can one say.<br/><br/>I saw the movie before I read the book.  Oftentimes, this can lead to trouble.  However, this time, it wasn't.  I was intrigued by the plot of the movie and bought the book when I saw it at Powell's.  Now, even though I saw the movie first, I'm going to talk about the book now.<br/><br/>The book is one of about three things that I can honestly changed my life. It is a wonderful masterpiece that speaks to the true heart and soul.  It has sustained me while travelling on more than one occasion; I am so familiar with it that I can pick it up, open it to any random page, start reading, and enjoy myself.  The book is.. simply incredible.  I cannot emphasize how much I love the book (by Alex Garland).<br/><br/>
Now, the movie.<br/><br/>I saw the movie again after reading the book.  It is entirely and completely different.<br/><br/>Now, the movie has some fairly nice cinematic sequences.  It's filmed beautifully and the scenery is top-notch.  Leo does a fairly horrid job portraying Richard; Ewan McGregor, the original choice, would have been much better, in my opinion.  The movie also took out several EXTREMELY vital parts in the book- they deflated the story, warped it, twisted it and turned it into utter garbage.<br/><br/>Still... the narration is a nice touch and it's filmed very nicely.  So. If you can ignore the tepid acting and the weak, sickly-sweet plot (it's so gooey in comparison with the book!) it's a good movie to play in the background while you, say, vacuum carpet.  As to any merit?  The movie has very, very little.  Perhaps its only merit is that it provided a hook large enough for me to grab the book.  Trust me.  Read the book.  It'll change your life."

And, after all, the Beach was a well shot movie with good scenes and so, but... well... many points and the whole meaning of the book were taken away. For example: The second lead role (a hippy with a long beard) was taken out completely. Maybe, because the scenes he was featured in were too violent or disgusting (especially the ending that was completely changed) for a Hollywood film, and Sal, who was described a bit like Drew Barrymore (friendly, big, attractive and calm), the real opposite of her film-character, became the really worst villain in film history.<br/><br/>There are many bad points in ""the Beach"", but I can't tell them all. But what annoyed me the most was the ending: The original one had to do with hate, paranoia, trust and even racism and gives you this ""alone"" feeling. The ending in the movie was too... happy. ""Everything's okay, all in the right place again..."" and so on. Also, the brilliant dream sequences who came after every chapter were taken out... also because of violence...<br/><br/>""The Beach"" tries to be a good story, a PG-13 version of the book, but is still too far away from a teen movie, making it look like a childish mixture-version of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"".

In fact, he's quite good, and he does a good job with this film.  The story is quite original, based on the novel by Alex Garland, about a secret island that is paradise.  The photography is great, with sweeping visions of the island, the ocean, and even the segments with ""excess imagery"" look good.  However, I couldn't help but be disappointed at how the material was treated and pulled off.  Some of the scenes waste time, while still others that are intended to be serious come across as downright laughable(aka. the scene where a digitized DiCaprio runs through a video game environment).  I also didn't like the fact that much of the story didn't come across, thanks to the over-abundant use of excess imagery.  Plus, Leonardo's character suddenly and drastically changes into some sort of ""more than a man or animal"" personality.  I still thought the source material was clever and original, but it was mistreated and misused here.  I think that a director like Terrence Malick would've faired better, not that director Danny Boyle is a bad director.  I just don't think that he's meant to direct a film like this.  As for Leo, he does what he can with a nearly complete script and I wonder how he feels about the scene where he's digitized in a video game environment.

Or maybe it was one of those half written scripts that somebody else finished.  Either way the movie certainly went downhill from there.  A few minutes are even seen as a video game in which Leo runs through a jungle.  I'm not sure if he was delusional or just high, but the movie definitely turns from interesting drama to a weird ""Apocalypse Now"" rendition.I haven't read Alex Garland's book, but I have to believe that it's better than John Hodge and Danny Boyle's version. I can't really recommend this movie, even though I know all the DiCaprio fans will go anyway.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.  D+"

","Let me just begin by saying that this review may be seen by some as biased. I didn't like DiCaprio in Titanic, and thought that he overacted terribly. There, now on with the review. There are no spoilers, so don't worry.<br/><br/>The Beach is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, Leonardo DiCaprio was supurb as Richard, and he complimented the script very well with romance, action and psycho turns that were as disturbing as they were scary.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were very good, and Danny Boyle's direction was spot on. You would think that the plot line (boy goes to find Beach and live there) would not be that interesting, but this film is so much more.  It is a tale of intrigue, romance, jealousy, and action, which is perfectly surrounded by the most beautiful environment I have ever seen. Lets just hope the rumors were wrong, and they left it the way they found it.<br/><br/>If Leonardo ever needed a boost into respectable movies after the mediocre Titanic, then this is it.  It might not take half as much at the box office, but dumps all over it in all other areas.<br/><br/>Simply unmissable.  A classic.<br/><br/>Neil"

Just because it has Leo Dicaprio in it doesn't mean it's going to do as well, but $15 million dollars, I think is a lot of money.  Besides, it was rated a 6 and that's certainly above average.

","When all's said and done, this is a good movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not *quite* top ten material.<br/><br/>I like Leonardo Di Caprio - I have ever since Romeo and Juliet, although I've never seen Titanic (don't hit me!). In _The Beach_, he is good - his acting was definitely up to standard. However, there is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Danny Boyle (the director) seems to lose the plot a little.<br/><br/>Something happens to Di Caprio's mind (I'm not going to say what), but we're never really given an adequate explanation for it. It's like twenty minutes of the film was left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's an interesting take on the _Lord of the Flies_ theme. Rather than order descending into chaos and savagery, it's more a movie about what happens when there's too much order, and people become unable to give that order, that comfort, up. What happens when you're too scared to leave your comfort zone? Well, watch this movie and you'll find part of that answer out.<br/><br/>Altogether good, but not great. A seven and a half."
"draftyrafters","6","0","1","13 February 2000"," Danny Boyle Gumbo
","What's disappointing about The Beach isn't the cinematography, which is great, or the plot, which is okay, or the acting, which is good.  It's the trailer.  Have you seen this thing?  It makes the movie out to be some fast-paced, thrill-a-minute, will they make it out alive fright-fest.  And it is absolutely none of those things.<br/><br/>The movie is about American traveller named Richard.  Played very well by Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard stumbles across a map that reveals the location of some perfect little island, a paradise, if you will, and being an impetuous and free-willed young man, Richard decides to go there, accompanied by a young French couple that he has only just met.<br/><br/>On this island are two things:  1) enough marjuana to keep all of Ann Arbor busy for a few months, and 2) drug dealers.  Barely escaping the drug dealers, our protagonists manage to find the other half of the island, which is populated by kind and reserved people who have decided to reject the outside world and create a perfect little society on this gorgeous island that virtually nobody else knows about.<br/><br/>This community has a long-standing pact with the kind-hearted drug dealers. They co-exist in peace as long as they tell nobody else about the island. Everybody's happy.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't have much going for it, other than it is a vehicle for some pretty heavy sociological/philosophical messages.  But despite the scanty use of conflict in the film, the movie as a whole is fairly entertaining. Directed by Danny Boyle, The Beach has a lot of the same sort of stuff that can be found in Boyle's other works.  It has the same gritty sound and speed as Trainspotting, but it also has the confusing and out-of-place weirdism of A Life Less Ordinary.  In fact, even though I give this movie a cozy two thumbs up, there are three problems with it that may bother more discriminating viewers.<br/><br/>1. A forced love story.  Anyone who knows movies knows that all producers want some sort of love interest in their movie.  It gets the attention of the female viewership.  In many cases, this is pulled off without a hitch. In the case of The Beach, it is almost as if they made the entire movie and then, as a second-thought, realized they needed some kissin', and so they dumped in a horribly contrived and emotionally weak romance between Leo and the young French lady. 2. An unnecessary soul-quest, a la Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors. At some point, Leo goes crazy for fifteen or twenty minutes as he wanders about the jungle.  This has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film. It's like a commercial for insanity. 3. The final moral of the movie is imparted by the kindhearted ring-leader of the drug dealers, who doesn't just vocalize the moral, but delivers it Solomon-style: with this obscure and insightful test of the hidden resort leader's faith.  Although this is plausible in Danny Boyle's world, I doubt the drug dealer's would have imparted anything to the head-strong island citizens other than a volley of bullets.  But, then again, I'm not an expert on drug dealers."

","I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and then lost faith in him after Titanic.  I was sick of the whole teen heartthrob/posse-towing bad boy image.  But The Beach put Leonardo back in my good books. If you enjoyed Trainspotting, chances are you'll like The Beach, from the same power team that gave us the Scottish heroin romp. This time it's an isolated island paradise instead of Scotland, pot instead of heroin, and Leonardo DiCaprio instead of Ewan MacGregor. The Beach is a visually stunning movie with a soundtrack that blended seamlessly with the beautiful visuals.  The acting was incredible, with not one single disappointing performance.  The movie was both funny (the video game sequence) and scary (the shark attack), just as much of a nightmare as it was a beautiful dream. With any luck we will start seeing Leonardo DiCaprio in more roles that portray him as more than just your average pretty boy, because it's once again obvious that he's a fantastic actor."

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","1","18 February 2002"," Weak and disappointing
","""The Beach"" left me cold. I remember, upon release, that it was mostly being touted as a vehicle to show the then king-of-the-world Leonardo DiCaprio's talents. It failed to do that, and failed to be much of a movie.<br/><br/>Richard (DiCaprio) is ambling around the world, trying to find himself as he visits place after place. It's only when he stumbles across a wild eyed-man, Daffy (Robert Carlyle), that he gets a chance when he receives a map to ""paradise"" - an un-spoilt beach on a remote island. Off he goes to discover it with his friends and, lo and behold, some disasters strike along the way. Didn't see that coming did we?<br/><br/>The acting isn't great. DiCaprio was, a bit unfairly, nominated for ""Worst Actor"" at the Golden Razzies here, but his performance is weak, much as it wasn't great in ""Titanic"" either. He can do a lot better - ""The Basketball Diaries"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" and ""This Boy's Life Life all showed that - and yet here it's his torso, prominently on display, that does the most acting. Noone else caught my attention, the closest being Tilda Swinton for her performance as the power-freak Beach community leader Sal.<br/><br/>The script left a whole lot to be desired. Oh look paradise is spoilt by the only true evil - man. How unoriginal. As the community starts to fall apart, because Sal is desperate to maintain it's secrecy, the whole script and movie begins to fall apart to. For relatively no decent reason, Leo's character goes mad and decides to stomp around the island by himself and perform painful allusions to the infinitely superior ""Apocalypse Now"". In the end Hollywood doesn't fail us by, once again, informing us that the Western way of life is THE ONLY WAY to live properly and be content. Grr...<br/><br/>But perhaps the biggest disappointment is the direction by Danny Boyle. He did the rather excellent ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" - the two best British movies of the '90s. I forgave him ""A Life Less Ordinary"", thinking it was a blip in his career, but this movie makes me fear the man has run out of steam. There is a complete lack of tension throughout the movie - in both the shark scenes I never felt threatened, nor did I care what was transpiring. It was so lazily I knew exactly what was going to happen. The ""Apocalypse Now"" segments were heavy handed and poorly executed - from slowly rotating fans to Leo rising out of the water. The sound-track was weak - dancing thumping music set against idyllic island scenery? What?! It's fine for a culture movie like ""Trainspotting"" but it jars here. There's many other weak directorial moments here - the highlight being a god-awful video game moment. *Shiver*.<br/><br/>""The Beach"" is by no means the worst movie ever and passes the time, but it is not a good movie. I'm disappointed in diCaprio and Boyle - they've done better, so why this? You may grit your teeth and sit through the movie, but why not read a book instead or see one of many better movies? 4/10"
"Infofreak","Null","0","1","7 December 2001"," Strong contender for the worst movie of the decade! (so far!)
","Believe me, even though I had heard nothing but negative feedback about 'The Beach' I watched it with an open mind. My taste is so at odds with 90% of the mainstream that if a movie receives such a violent reaction as this I generally regard that as a GOOD thing, thinking I might actually like it. My list of favourite movies of the last ten years features many more so-called ""bad"" movies than ""good"" ones. However this time I'm with the Blockbuster crowd - 'The Beach' is a genuine turkey! In fact it's the worst movie I've seen so far this decade, and that includes 'Hannibal', 'Zoolander', 'Tomb Raider', 'The 6th Day', and frankly way TOO many others to even think about!<br/><br/>Now look I'm not even a DiCaprio hater (though after this I'm leaning that way!). I have studiously avoided watching 'Titanic', but I thought he was pretty good in 'This Boy's Life' opposite De Niro, and more than adequate in 'Gilbert Grape' and 'The Quick and the Dead'. I even thought his self-parodic cameo was the only good thing in Woody Allen's 'Celebrity'. But Leo is SO obnoxious and unsympathetic as Richard that from the word go you truly do not give a damn about what happens to him, especially as he shows himself to be just as much a loser as the tourists and backpackers he claims to be so different from. <br/><br/>The plot has more holes than a Mafia Don's corpse, and is yet another ""searing inditement"" against the emptiness of Modern Life, that like 'Fight Club' wimps out at the end and has the rebel running back to the comforts of corporate America. Puh-lease! This ain't Nietsche for the New Millenium, it's Ferris Bueller for the Korn crowd. <br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle showed so much promise with the taut thriller 'Shallow Grave' and the savvy junkie black comedy 'Trainspotting', but after giving us all a scare with the Godawful stupidity of 'A Life Less Ordinary' he has managed to top (or is that bottom?) himself with this embarassing stinker. Whether he will ever be able to redeem himself remains to be seen. The question is now, do we even care? I put myself through the torture of 'The Beach', but that could well be the limit of my endurance. Or maybe I'm just morbidly fascinated to see if Boyle is capable of making a movie WORSE than this. Is anybody??! I truly hope for all our sakes that the answer is no!"

","Leo di Caprio flaunts his hairless chest, eats a caterpillar and goes nuts on a tropical island. The End.<br/><br/>This film about a dope-fuelled utopia hidden on a remote tropical isle off Thailand could have been much better. The first half is strong, and seems to follow a strong theme of travelling in hope being better than arriving. Robert Carlyle puts in a good but brief role as the crazed Daffy. Once the story arrives at the legendary beach, the film gradually unravels. Di Caprio may be a charismatic screen presence, but he doesn't have the acting ability to bring the story to life. The sequence in the jungle where he loses his marbles is particularly weak. Tilda Swinton, who is one of but a few reasons to watch this film, acts rings around him.<br/><br/>Bits of the film evoke other movies such as Apocalypse Now, Dr Strangelove and Lord of the Flies. This would appear to follow the book on which this film is based, in which the central character is obsessed with films and video games. This works okay in novels, where it is possible to transplant things from other media to fertilise a story, but if it's not done right (and it is not done right here) it only makes the film appear derivative. The novel ""The Beach"" was popular and very successful and this film would appear to be a sub-standard adaptation. Wonder why they changed Richard's character from English to American, hmm?"

","'The beach' has really left me with mixed feelings. I wanted to hate the movie because Leonardo diCaprio plays in it, but in spite of his presence, The Beach is not as bad as I expected. One thing that's remarkable is that Leo's character is kind of a jerk, which is a welcome change from the one-dimensional idiot he played in 'Titanic'<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie is terrible, however. Corny dialogs, stereotype tourist character and an annoying voice-over. After that, the movie gets a little better, especially the scenery (the tropical island) is breathtaking, and the movie even manages to be funny sometimes. Plus, there is a certain charm in the idea of a hippy commune living on a beautiful, deserted island.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie can't decide what it wants to be: an action movie, a romantic drama, a satire on the consumer society, a 'Blue Lagoon'- clone etc. It contains parts of all these movies/genres, but it moves constantly from one genre to the other.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the Beach to be moderately enjoyable, mostly because I just wanted to see what happened next, even though that what happened usually didn't make much sense. with a LOT more focus on psychology, the Beach would have been a good movie.

"llihilloh","Null","0","1","8 August 2001"," A mixed movie.
","Here's my thought of 'The Beach':  Half of it was good while the other half drowned out the good parts.<br/><br/>I saw this movie for one reason and one reason only, Leonardo DiCaprio is in the main role. Everyone always criticizes DiCaprio's performance in almost every movie that he makes. Well, I absolutely adore him. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', 'Basketball Diaries', 'Titanic' and yes, 'The Beach' all show him acting out his best. In my opinion, DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors around. Argue with me but I really think he does his best in almost every role. Once again, HE didn't let me down, but this movie sure did. <br/><br/>The first part (not the entire first half) was decent and it looked like 'The Beach' could make a name for itself. The plot started to carry on with little meaning and that's where I got bored with it. Although the beginning narration started off slow, it also started out with nice scenery and a good script trying to break through. Three characters hit the island and then the film started to pick up. We skip ahead to where Richard starts eating bugs, he turns into a video game character and starts hissing like a cat. Okay, that's enough. 'The Beach' was kind of lost from then on. We skip ahead some more to the ending, and like the beginning, it too was slow. In fact, it was a terrible ending. The script itself could have been good, I'm not saying great, but good for the most part. It went in one direction while what the characters were doing and saying went into another. It seemed as if the whole thing started to lose meaning at one point or another.<br/><br/>
The acting was very good. I already gave my opinion on DiCaprio's half, so let me talk about the rest of the cast. Virginie Ledoyen who plays Françoise, was just alright. Her character wasn't really given a lot of attention to but what she was given, she handled well. I really liked the man who played Françoise's boyfriend, Étienne I think. He too didn't contribute a whole lot to the plot but I thought that he was a good actor. I did not like how his character just disappeared about half way through the film. Why did they do that? Keep him around. I won't comment too much on Tilda Swinton (Sal) except to say that she is one of the most annoying actresses I have ever seen. Little tip: 're-cast.' Everyone else did good.<br/><br/>One of the worst things about this film was the narration. Richard telling the story through his eyes started to get boring. The part where he's out in the woods, keeping an eye on those four travelers is when it hit me the most. For ten or so minutes, he does nothing but narrate and we really don't see too much action. Another thing that seemed to irritate me was those darn flashbacks to Daffy in his room. There he is firing away at the tourists with Richard screaming beside him. Oh, that was one of the terrible parts.<br/><br/>
This movie had beautiful scenery, a decent script (that got screwed up some how) and so-so special effects. Again, Leonardo DiCaprio isn't what made 'The Beach' bad, the writing was."

Well, this movie saves the best for the beginning, instead of saving something moving for the final scene.  I have a feeling that Leonardo was depressed about his part in this movie; maybe he was sulking because he turned down the lead in ""American Psycho"".

In summation, if you run out of things to do, then see this film, and throw in a little Terence Malick afterwards.

For example before they jump off the waterfall, and whenever he confronted other characters he seemed to explode and damage his undoubted talent)  However, in saying that, the three main British actors (Carlyle, Swindon, Patterson Joseph) give superb, controlled, stylish and believable displays. All the visual beauty of the movie I found overrides acting flaws and the sometimes annoyingly unbalanced journey of Richard and his buddies. As a 23 year old I did relate a lot to the pleasure, sun and sea seeking ambitions of the characters I must admit. Come on, who wouldn't?

","Following in the sandals of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" Hollywood's latest foray into the lives of people on perpetual vacation is ""The Beach.""<br/><br/>This film could be worse, but it would have to work at it.  Leo DiCaprio tries hard, but he isn't really given much to work WITH here.  He is a character without motivation amid a cast of characters without motivation.<br/><br/>Each and every person on this mythical island seems to have been born the day they got there. None of them even have last names, much less lives. That makes it a little hard for the audience to care whether they live or die, much less find the perfect beach upon which to squander their time.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's character in particular is an annoying,whinny, whimp who seems as unlikely a figure to build a film around as any I've ever seen. And those are the characteristics he starts off with. By the end of the film, you think everyone would have been better off had he expired on the swim to the island.<br/><br/>But the real disappointment is Virginie Ledoyen.  When will good French actresses learn that coming to America gets them nothing but a chance to wave at the Statue of Liberty? Ledoyen, who has done some great work in France, essentially gets to do nothing on ""The Beach,"" except look fetching in a bikini. But she could have taken the flight straight through to Tahiti and walked around in one of those.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a waste of a lot of good acting talent on a typical, pointless Hollywood project that could not have been made in the first place without the participation of that talent."

","I was looking forward to Danny Boyle's latest, and I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. I was disappointed on both counts. This film is by no means atrocious, but after a year of so many good films, I just can't recommend this one. The plot drags and the characters are for the most part unlikeable. The soundtrack is the main high point of the film (the only part as good as Trainspotting), featuring some great tracks from Blur + UNKLE, as well as a nice score from Angelo Badlamenti (of Twin Peaks fame)."

","The film is both stylistically and asthetically beautiful. The director goes beyond the classical just as in Trainspotting which has some similarities. These take the film further beyond reality, ultimately making the beach seem even more spectacular.<br/><br/>The acting varies but is quite realistic. If you have ever back-packed, you'd find the characters believable. Yes, Americans really do stick out that much. Leonardo Di Caprio seems completely immeresed in his role and acts well (despite what jealous boyfriends and husbands might say).<br/><br/>A big plus is that the film is quite different to what most expect from today's 'feature length' trailers. It's rated R for a reason (or two).<br/><br/>
The book is fantastic and films rarely do books justice. I think the studio did a good job of selecting which parts to exclude and where to use some artistic merit. It's pretty ridiculous for anyone to expect a 2 hour film to incorporate and entire book. It's always funny when people complain a film wasn't how they imagined the book.

","Leonardo DiCaprio must have been very desperate for an antihero role to agree to this turkey of a script.  No amount of camera magic by Danny Boyle or idyllic locations could save this dreadful story.  It spasmodically progresses from implausible, to inconceivable and finally to demented.  It is Fantasy Island' meets Apocalypse Now'.  The only way to classify it would be Noir Bizarre.<br/><br/>John Hodge and Danny Boyle team up to prove that one success in avant-garde filmmaking (Trainspotting) does not necessarily spill over into future projects, though I must say that Boyle's direction was the only thing that kept this film from being a total disaster.  His brilliant camerawork and cinematography helped keep my mind off the peculiar and disjointed content.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, this was The Leonardo DiCaprio Show.  Though there were additional characters in the film, other than a cameo by Robert Carlyle they were the equivalent of extras that had been elevated to speaking parts.  DiCaprio gave a good performance, but his character was so mercurial that it is hard to say he really nailed it.  He ran around with his shirt off a lot, so I guess that will keep the teenyboppers happy.<br/><br/>I rated this film a 4/10 on the strength of the cinematography.  The story was a 1 or 2 at best and DiCaprio was not enough to elevate it to the level of mediocrity.  This is a film for die-hard Leo fans only."

","It´s hard do believe that the british director Danny Boyle, who surprised us with ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" made this horrible film. The story, if there is one, is a disgusting mixture of ""Apocalypse now"", ""The Jaw"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and holiday impressions from Thailand. Although I have never been to this country it´s very difficult to understand why Boyle is unable not to speak and to show pictures that are full of clichés. Above all the performance of Di Caprio is nothing special and so does the rest of the crew. ""The Beach"" is a waste of time because Boyle never show really interest in his characters or in his storyline. And for all people who where eager to see Di Caprio in his first movie after TITANIC will be surely disappointed. I was and I´m sure you will too.

","""I settled in and found my vocation--the pursuit of pleasure,"" shares Leonardo DiCaprio's Richard, shortly after arriving at his dream vacation spot: ""the beach.""  The trouble with this thesis is it is ultmiately an unsatisfying goal.  Vacations and parties must end sometime, and work begin.<br/><br/>      As surely as human nature seems to require both projects and play in equal measure, life skewed toward recreation alone is bound to become a boring and unfulfilling existence.  This state can lead to dire consequences and may even point the way toward tragedy. Novelist Alex Garland and writing assistant John Hodge try to depict this in a quite dramatic screenplay.   Somewhere along the way, however, the essential theme got lost, and one may leave a viewing of ""The Beach"" wondering what was its actual purpose.       Deleted scenes included in the DVD format surprisingly help to clarify some thematic features missing from the finished narrative.  Likewise, key character profiles, like those of Robert Carlyle's Daffy gain better understanding through these cut scenes.       As the writers' objectives seem basically sincere, it's too bad this narrative fails in its loftier expressive aims.  Utlizing inherent creative urges appear an important aspect of our satisfaction, and that encompasses a good deal more than what ""the beach"" alone can ever provide.  ###"

So that the audience gets the point, we see a scene from APOCALYPSE NOW in the movie.<br/><br/>Leo is good in his tanned, buffed form as he searches for the cure to relieve himself of ""civilization"" much as Huck Finn once did. Swinton is interesting as a female Buddha in a Bali Ha'i that is supposedly paradise. But humans always lose Eden, and Christo must die for our sins again.<br/><br/>The film fits into Leo's canon of off-beat films and certainly is not another TITANIC. It is interesting, but one wonders why such a derivative film was needed right now. It does make an important point about ecology, but at the same time, even that isn't a new theme.

"Movie-12","4","0","1","10 March 2000"," Visually effective, but lacks narrative conflict and character structure. *1/2 out of ****.
","THE BEACH / (2000) *1/2<br/><br/>Rated R (for strong language, violence, sexuality, and drug use).<br/><br/>
According to many intelligent screenwriters, directors, and us critics, conflict is the basis of all drama. If there is no problem for the main character to solve or something for him or her to achieve, there is no purpose for the character's state of being. Without character we can have no story. Without story we can have no movie. The new sexy, glamorous novel adaptation from ""Trainspotting"" director Danny Boyle, runs into that rare, insidious flaw: other than some irrelevant singular character tensions, there isn't much conflict in its plot. The film primarily consists of a slew of related events placed side by side. Thus, many of the scenes do not propel the story forward. The conclusion doesn't even know where to commence because there is nothing to explicate.<br/><br/>The filmmakers cast Leonardo DiCaprio as a young American traveler named Richard, who, as the movie opens, arrives in Thailand in quest for an adventure that can't be found in the common tourist locations. We don't know a whole lot about Richard except that he is a drifter named Richard. He rationalizes in the premise that nothing else matters, an extremely lazy method for the writers to escape character development. In reality, background information does indeed matter, and for us to care about him, we need to know more.<br/><br/>Early in the movie, Richard meets an erotically appealing French woman, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and her boyfriend, Etienne (Guillaume Canet). Soon afterwards, he stumbles upon a pot smoking, insane individual named Daffy. This strange person rambles about a paradise-like island that unseen by most people. Richard believes little this man states, but the next morning he discovers Daffy has killed himself and left him a map leading to this mysterious beach. He asks Francoise and Etienne to travel with him to the island . They accept his invitation.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle doesn't get to do much in this movie but contribute essential plot information required to move the story along. The narrative line uses his character, Daffy, later in the story when Richard slowly becomes disillusioned on the island. This theme of action is effective and developed with strong emotional depth.<br/><br/>Once on the island, after discovering that a small potion is run by rigged drug farmers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise meet a secluded group of villagers who have permanently settled there, away from all the worlds' troubles. This picture perfect location is loosely led by a young woman named Sal (Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>The island's beach is truly paradise. The atmosphere is beautifully luxuriant. The filmmakers choose the perfect location for this movie, creating the right visual style. Also contributing to the successful island concepts: the characters develop the place with colorful, momentum building dialogue and pleasant oral description. Because of these measures the writers take with the importance of creating a paradise island, our imaginations are nurtured to believe both internally and visually that this place is almost a heaven.<br/><br/>A conflict ""The Beach"" runs into is the attempt to fit too much material in one 119 minute movie. It tires to provide us with an illicit love story between the lustful Richard and the attractive Francoise. Thus Etienne provides us with some romantic competition. It also attempts providing us with a secret love affair between Richard and Sal, creating a villain, her boyfriend Bugs. We are also in an adventure film about the findings of drifters. The patrons also enters the mind of a young man whose mind becomes overtaken by his primal instincts. Also, the story about several young American travelers who behold a copy of a map to the island, threatening the native's existence. The plot with the foreign pot smugglers who murder people with assault rifles. We learn of the results of a shark attack and the pains the victims bring upon the group. The list goes on and on. If only the writers would have chosen a concrete subject and expanded on it rather than colliding a dozen different plots, we may have had a better movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the visual style in ""The Beach"" that is militant and creative. It uses neat camera angles and cinematography to its advantage. Leonardo DiCaprio contributes to film's mood. He performs with the necessary dramatic tensions that fulfil narrative requirements, although his obvious narration ends up explaining much of the story to us.<br/><br/>Within the struggling situations  of ""The Beach"" lay some very deserving potential. If only the filmmakers would have used the God given gift of imagination, something this movie lacks. In a picture half as good as ""The Beach,"" the destructive flaw would be found within the film's conflict, not the lack of conflict being the destructive flaw.<br/><br/>Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox Productions."

DiCaprio acting is awful, you cannot help to laugh at him during his ""dramatic"" scenes.  The story simply gets lost in the beautiful landscape. Characters are not believable, you just have no idea what moves them.  Too bad for Boyle since Trainspotting is one of my favorite movies."
"Martin Jarborg","3","0","1","20 February 2000"," A waste of a great story.
","When I learned that they were going to make a film based on Garland's bestselling novel, I was slightly worried. When I then heard that DiCaprio was going to star, I became even more so. But I was still not prepared for the piece of crap that they had come up with. Lots of scenes have been taken out (for no apparent reason) and replaced with others (also for no apparent reason), leaving a messy, annoying and, at times, boring movie. I was very disappointed. If you've read the book -  don't see the film, it's a waste of time. If you've seen the film but haven't read the book, please do so. Don't let the film put you off, it really is a great story."

","I thought this was a pretty good movie.  The girl in it was very attractive and I was glad to see that they included a bit of nudity to please the audience.<br/><br/>The movie was very visually pleasing.  I really got into it to the point where as I exited the theater I somehow expected to see sunny skies and palm trees surrounding me.  But of course all I saw was a late night's sky and 4 foot high snow banks.  This reality check was a real kick in the nuts."

","This is a very poor and sometimes nasty little film. The 'beach' cult are all so selfish and wrapped up in themselves. And to be honest Leo is no better. Does he go native because of his guilt (shark victims), or because he's upset that he's going to be excluded? Leo's love interest has one of the lightest roles in recent female cinema history. And the ending where she e-mails the picture. It's as if she's had a lovely little holiday. Why didn't the farmers turn the guns on all of them?"

","The Beach: Every backpacker is in search of untouched paradise, that one place that would make every postcard vendor salivate. Unfortunately, anyplace that remotely fits the bill is usually overrun with drunken revelers, package tourists and golden arches.  When Richard, a jaded traveler, acquires a map with the location of a secret pristine beach he is determined to find it, regardless the risks.  Which begs the question, what is the price of paradise?<br/><br/>Since Titanic Di Caprio has been damned, dismissed and denigrated.  His detractors have obviously forgotten his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Romeo and Juliet.  Di Caprio deserves to be judged on his individual efforts and not prejudged for having been in a blockbuster. That said, he is horrible in this movie.  Or to be more accurate, this film as a whole is terrible.<br/><br/>Beach attempts to be a fusion of Apocalypse Now and Lord of the Flies, only a lite version without the drama, irony, or introspection. The story is for the most part a sanitized, predictable muddled mess, except for the last 20 minutes, which are exceptionally outlandish -Richard's bouts with madness are laughable.   The commune consists of a bunch of elitist spoiled brats who live in tense harmony with a band of pot growers (given that drug growing and smuggling are capital offences in Thailand I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the timeÂ…) until things go wrong.  Big surprise.  Finally, although the star of the movie is beautiful (I'm talking the beach here), it is not worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Miss."

","WOW, I just saw this movie last night at the Theatre I work at and I must say it was surprisingly good. I was expecting complete c**p and that is not what i got. I got an intelligent piece of filmmaking, Danny Boyle's second best film, Trainspotting being Number 1 of course. Is it a Masterpiece? Of Course not it has Leo Dio in it, but if you want to have fun for a few hours go see it, it can even be enlightening."
