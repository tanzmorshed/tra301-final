","It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's ""retired"" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the ""good guys"", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (""Creek Johnson"" and ""Texas Jack"") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala ""Titanic"". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you."

","Probably the best Western I have ever seen, if mostly due to Kilmer's outstanding portrayal as Doc Holliday. He lacks, in my opinion, much of the gruffness of John Wayne which, although good, gets boring after so many films. The look on Ringo's face when he realises his opponent is Holliday, not Earp, is priceless, and shows you just how great a reputation Doc has that a man praised as ""The deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill"" is now making excuses not to go up against him. Russel's performance is also commendable, showing a man who has seen too much blood in his life and wishes simply to settle down, but Kilmer simply cannot be ignored as the drunken but suave gambler."
"cariart","Null","221","267","27 August 2003"," A Terrific Homage to Classic Westerns!
","TOMBSTONE, one of two epic westerns about Wyatt Earp released within a few months of each other (1993-94) lacks the lyrical, 'warts-and-all' quality of Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP, but is a more successful film, with tighter pacing, more clearly drawn characters, and a reverence to the genre that has made it the most popular Western of the last twenty years.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, narrated by the legendary Robert Mitchum, a nod to the great Hollywood Westerns of the past is evident; a gang of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' break up a Mexican wedding in a small town, ruthlessly killing nearly all the men, including village priest Pedro Armendáriz Jr. (son of the legendary Western actor), in a scene reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Led by two of Hollywood's flashiest character actors, swaggering Powers Boothe, and coldly psychotic Michael Biehn (playing Johnny Ringo), the presence of such pure evil sets the stage for the Earps' arrival in Tombstone.<br/><br/>A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn't find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers; Kurt Russell, chiseled, squinty-eyed, and razor-thin, is an ideal Wyatt; Sam Elliott, one of Hollywood's best Western actors, plays Virgil with a growl but a twinkle in his eye; and Bill Paxton, soon to achieve stardom in APOLLO 13 and TWISTER, makes a terrific Morgan. Then there is Val Kilmer, as Doc Holliday...While Dennis Quaid, in WYATT EARP, gave the most realistic portrayal of the dying dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter ever recorded on film (he was superb), Kilmer, relying on bloodshot eyes, an ambiguous sexuality, and a Brando-esque line delivery, literally steals TOMBSTONE, and has become the 'Doc' everyone remembers. He is so charismatic that you nearly forget that the Earps are the focus of the story! Watch for his early scene confronting a shotgun-wielding (and chubby!) Billy Bob Thornton (three years before SLING BLADE), out to kill Wyatt, and you'll see my point.<br/><br/>The events leading up to the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral are clearly and decisively presented, from Wyatt's first meeting with future wife Josie (Dana Delany), to the murder of Tombstone's Marshal (Harry Carey, Jr., son of another legendary Western star, and a staple of many John Ford films), which leads to Virgil taking the badge and making his brothers (in Wyatt's case, reluctantly) deputies, to the friction with Ike Clanton (GODS AND GENERALS' Stephen Lang) that explodes into the short but bloody shootout that became legendary.<br/><br/>Where TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP both excel is in presenting the aftermath of the gunfight. Unlike MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, the true story doesn't tie up neatly with a happy ending at the Corral, but becomes darker and bloodier. The Earps are placed under house arrest, and after they are acquitted in court, friends of Clanton (in TOMBSTONE, Ringo and other Cowboys), cold-bloodedly murder Morgan and cripple Virgil. Wyatt explodes, and grimly sets about, with Holiday and a small band of gunmen, to execute every possible Clanton ally he can find (""You tell him I'm coming! And hell's coming with me!""). Becoming a wanted fugitive himself, he only stops his mission of vengeance long enough to take the ailing Holiday to a friend's cabin (Charlton Heston has a brief but memorable cameo as the rancher), but the gambler returns in time for the gunblazing climax of the film.<br/><br/>TOMBSTONE is the kind of Western that critics love to say aren't made anymore, a throwback to the golden days of Ford and Hawks, when Good and Evil were clearly defined. Director George P. Cosmatos grew up on those films, as well as those of Sergio Leone, and he said, of TOMBSTONE, that it was made to honor the Westerns he loved so much.<br/><br/>It is his love of the Western that makes TOMBSTONE a truly superior film!"
"JEve264470","10","50","58","2 January 2005"," Val Kilmer = Legend
","Tombstone has to be one of the most truly touching and brilliant films I have ever seen. The action sequences are great and the acting is brilliant, in particular Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday in what is probably the best supporting actor role I have ever seen. How he missed out on an Oscar I do not know.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell was very good as Wyatt Earp and played the role very well. All the acting was superb. The 'Cowboys' who are the baddies of the film had presence and style and gave the heroes some proper competition.<br/><br/>But this was Val Kilmers film. As Doc, he had style, charisma and looked cool even when his character was terminally ill. His sayings were also legendary and Val Kilmer should go down in film legend for this role alone.<br/><br/>Tombstone is the best non - John Wayne western that I have seen."

","As a Tucson Native, I was totally impressed. Most people from other parts of the world will believe any western with a saguaro in it. This movie is one of the best of all time, and I worked at Old Tucson. If you're looking for a historical timeline, forget it. It's condensed for dramatic purposes, but still it flows, it's got love, action, comedy(mostly Kilmer) and a serious story of what the old west really was like. Amen for this one as opposed to the tragic The Quick and the Dead which was kinda silly if your brain is turned on whilst watching it. Watch for Priestly's, um, unusual performance. It also has a great back story on Earp's life, which makes for much more than a shallow shoot'em up movie."
"subego","9","31","35","2 May 2010"," For Val, a role of a lifetime
","I wont review the film here as it has all been said before. I did want to praise Val Kilmer's portrayal of ""Doc"" Holiday. Throughout the entire film, his acting and character embellishments are so nuanced and well done that by movies end, we feel his loss in a very personal way. Credit must also go out the the costumers and make-up artists for their contribution to the overall effect of his role. All the way through the film, he looks sickly, pale and world-weary. His mannerisms and intensity of gaze profoundly establish this character as a focal point in this production. But as for what I started this off with, I consider this role as probably the very best for Val Kilmer. It required subtlety and careful restraint and made the viewer believe that we weren't watching an actor merely regurgitating lines and hitting their foot-marks. I, for one, was entranced by the carefully studied body language and facial expressions...the sweaty desperation of a man who sensed his own mortality but strove to enact his own justice for justices sake. This was just very well done!"
"MrsFuzzy","8","126","156","16 May 2004"," Very enjoyable
","I decided to watch 'Tombstone' as there was nothing else on, and I am so glad I did.<br/><br/>Conforming as I do to the stereotypical 'female who does not like Westerns' it was mainly Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer that drew me in.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about the 'OK Corral' I envisioned a long drawn out gunfight scene somewhere out in the desert. To discover it happened in the middle of town was only one of the educational experiences.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a strong portrayal of a man who didn't want to get involved until circumstances gave him no option.<br/><br/>However, the movie does 'belong' to Val Kilmer. He gave a real sense of fatalism as 'Doc' Holliday, wanting to die in a blaze of gunfire rather than fading away from tuberculosis.<br/><br/>A great view of the Wild West."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","107","132","6 April 2004"," Val Kilmer's Greatest Performance
","Now Tombstone is a film that I would call the last great western of its genre so far.   It has every sub plot you could want in you're average film and especially in a western.  They have a great cast on board also to establish this gang of ragger muffins.  Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is just as good as Costner and Lancaster were.  Val Kilmer is probably the main reason why every fan of it's genre talk about it so much as he is not just a fine actor in this but you believe that Doc Holiday and him were somehow related as he takes on the exact same sense of humour which I have read in books and his likeness is there also from what I have seen in pictures.  <br/><br/>
Val Kilmer has been in a lot of films but only half of them were good and this goes into one of his best along with Oliver Stone's The Doors and Willow without doubt has to get a mention.   There is a superb cast here which makes up of Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, Billy Zane and of course Charlton Heston.   I could go on for even longer mentioning some of the great actors that star in this but the sheer action of vengeance of it make it one of the best action westerns. There are your two type of westerns like High Noon and The Searchers which are very calm but intense films.  Then you have The Wild Bunch and Tombstone which are just blood thirsty with plenty of action to cater for all tastes of films.<br/><br/>I am not to familiar with the director but he is surely missed as far as making a western like this is concerned."

","First of all, I love the movie. Now some may say, ""What a moron..."" and others will undoubtedly agree with me. But I think it's great. When I first saw the film as it debuted in theaters eleven or so years back, I came away thinking, Men doing a man's job. Sounds a little chauvinist, I'll admit, but there you are. The movie is a tribute to men being men, living their lives on their own terms. The fact that the story is about the Earp saga is almost secondary to the film. To enjoy this movie, I don't think that it's so important for it to have historical accuracy to the letter or even have rain falling consistently through the shots. I would only advise viewers to let this Remington-painting-come-to-life wash over them and just go along for the ride. As long as we remember that this is Hollywood, all is well.<br/><br/>Then there's reality. As real aficionados of Tombstone history will see, the movie sacrifices or distorts some of the facts and compresses time. In the end it's a shame, really, because the film never realizes its full potential. I'm convinced that if this movie was true to history, it could only have been better. Previous reviews talk about and compare with Costner's Wyatt Earp. I think elements of both films combined would have made a great movie. For instance, I would have lifted much of WE's script from when Wyatt arrives in town (the story, not the dialog) and used it in Tombstone. And then get the rest of the facts straight. The true story is compelling on its own, and would still be entertaining.<br/><br/>The special edition DVD includes deleted scenes, that for the life of me, I can't figure out why they were deleted in the first place. But the scene when Wyatt and Josie rest after their spirited ride still has the payoff of the scene cut out - Josie and Wyatt getting it on. I get tired of directors thinking that the audience is sophisticated so we'll just let them figure it out on their own. Come on George, some of us didn't know that Wyatt was cheating on Mattie.<br/><br/>Finally, I've got to say that the movie was cast well. And the costumes were true to life - men liked to be colorful and unique in that time and place. The guns were accurate, as were the holsters (low slung and quick draw is a Hollywood invention). As for the scenery, I lived in Arizona for a while, and I do miss the big sky.<br/><br/>If you want to be entertained, this is the movie for you. If you want a history lesson, better hit the library..."

","Proof that westerns can be fun, Tombstone delivers an action-adventure popcorn movie that doesn't have to be campy and one-dimensional to be enjoyable. Here, Wyatt Earp biography is told like a fable. Sure, the facts are often recalculated in this film. But this is not looking to give a straight-on accurate view of Wyatt Earp's life. This is trying to take a man's life as a basis and then add to it to make a cinematic joyride. As opposed to the overlong and plodding ""Wyatt Earp,"" this film decides to have a good time with the story and not get too bogged down in the misery. Kurt Russell is powerful as awful, and no man can deny that Val Kilmer, in his finest performance to date, was fully due for an Oscar nomination, if not an Oscar win. And Michael Biehn also gives a first rate performance as the sadistic Johnny Ringo. This is a thrill ride for anyone who loves westerns, or a good film to try to get others to start watching westerns."

"Bogmeister","8","44","57","26 May 2006"," Earps & Doc vs.Mean Cowboys as early Organized Crime
","A late entry in the western genre when already not too many were being made, this is one of those re-watchable mini-epics, with strong entertainment value. It begins with a bang, an intense shoot-out after some supposedly historical footage narrated by actor Mitchum. We are introduced to The Cowboys, this era's version of the Mafia, led by the charismatic Curly Bill (Boothe). These first few minutes manage to unnerve and surprise the audience right away: we are also introduced to the psychotic gunslinger, Ringo (Biehn), but he's revealed as the most dangerous of the bunch only after the shoot-out, a sleight of hand by the filmmakers - they made him look sympathetic in those early moments while everyone is blasting away and he just stands there looking dazed and bothered. Only afterward do we realize he's a lethal lunatic of the damned - it's a powerful beginning.<br/><br/>It's amazing how well this film turned out considering all the rumors of a troubled history. Credit must be given to director Cosmatos and the actors. It's a fairly huge cast, with numerous speaking roles, and everyone seems to have at least one good moment during the story. Then there's Kilmer as Doc, who is good or great in every scene he's in - this is easily Kilmer's best role. Doc is already sick as the movie begins but he manages to stay in the game to the very end, more dangerous than any 2 cowboys, using supernatural willpower & sardonic wit to distract everyone and himself from the fact he's nearly a walking ghost. Russell is just super-solid as Wyatt; he conveys a strength, tapped from unknown sources (whereas Doc draws from within), standing tall when other tough guys quake in the knees. These two make a terrific team; it's not the usual buddy stuff of most pictures. All the supporting cast is fine, including Elliott and Paxton as Wyatt's brothers, though there are some overly obvious moments. Earp's on - off relationship with the actress (Delany) has its ups & downs, there's not much room for subtlety as Earp's wife looks on quite upset as Delany strikes another of her bemused expressions. Also, due to the large number of characters, some of their stories have a heavily truncated feel (Priestley's, for example). The Vista director's cut special edition DVD has some restored footage to improve this problem. The better scenes are the confrontations between the men, the threats swung high & low, and the sheer thrill of watching Russell slap an overweight Billy Bob Thornton silly.<br/><br/>And we have the villains, ah yes, the villains. I've already mentioned a couple of them - another one is Lang as Ike Clanton in a deliciously cheesy, hammy yet mesmerizing performance. By the last 3rd of the movie, I was so wishing he would get his - please, someone - Earp, Holliday, anyone ! - blow this bastard away! Ike is one of the great unsung villains of movie history, a tribute to Lang's abilities. The conflict in this true-life story stemmed from the notion that there were no real villains. It was a matter of which faction had the rights, based on gun power and political ambition. In other words, the Earps were just making a political power play in the view of some and there was little difference between them and The Cowboys. But this film wastes no time in establishing Wyatt and his brothers as the decent side of the coin and when you have characters like Ike, there's no mistaking which side are the bad guys. For a different take on this piece of history, check out the original Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" from '68. Oh yeah, there are also other films like the Lancaster - Douglas opus from 1957. But the Gunfight at the OK Corral in ""Tombstone"" was just one set piece out of many."

Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are the leaders of the bad dudes and a massive showdown is the only answer for all concerned.

Russell's and Kilmer's opening scenes establish them as powerhouse masculines, something which this film veritably bleeds with, yet these two tower over every other dusty gunslinger and scenery-chomping henchman.<br/><br/>Russell is Wyatt Earp. We meet him alighting a train and whipping a wrangler across the face with his own whip for beating Earp's horse, growling in a rasp that would make The Clint proud, ""Hurts, don't it?"" <br/><br/>Kilmer is Doc Holliday. Drawing his guns like proverbial greased lightning in a card game gone sour, then knifing his antagonist and exiting stage right with a fistful of cash and a hard, sexy woman, Kilmer has only begun to amaze us as he takes his character a mighty step further, endowing his Holliday with a pseudo-continental accent of his own nefarious design and an educated panache that we doubt anyone on the frontier could have seriously exhibited WITHOUT being a lightning gun (i.e. he'd be killed in a hot second for being such a dandy). To this day he has never commanded a role so deliciously elitist. <br/><br/>Yes, *Tombstone* is yet another Gunfight at the O.K. Corral  but related in such a way that this fact is peripheral to the characters at the heart of the tale. <br/><br/>Directed by George P. Cosmatos, written by Kevin Jarre, *Tombstone* presents a vision of the frontier as half brutal reality, half snakeskin Hollywood, all guilty pleasure. Ten times more entertaining than that OTHER *Wyatt Earp* - poor Kevin Costner's epic, drawn-out, tedious June 1994 release, coming in a weary second to this film in release date and pure animal fun. <br/><br/>The Earp brothers, Wyatt (Russell), Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), with their three blond wives in tow, arrive in Tombstone, eager to settle in and seek their fortune. Wyatt especially wants to leave behind his bloody rep as a ""Kansas lawdog."" The frontier has other ideas, crawling as it is with The Cowboys  rowdy, red-sashed troublemaking gunhands who ""rule"" the vicinity like mobsters; led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and his sidekick, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), the ""deadliest pistolier since Wild Bill.""<br/><br/>As the trailer said, ""Justice is coming to Tombstone.""<br/><br/>Setting themselves up, unwillingly at first, as keepers of the peace, the Earp brothers' fate inexorably leads to the gunfight at the you-know-where, due to The Cowboys refusing to disarm while within town limits, the Earps sensing anarchy in the air and attempting to simply disarm them where they had congregated behind the O.K. Corral. <br/><br/>Because this movie piles on so many entertaining vignettes, the O.K. is the least of our climaxes from Wyatt driving out the Faro dealer (Billy Bob Thornton): ""Go ahead, skin it! Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens!""<br/><br/>to the tasty, intelligent, Latin exchange between Holliday and Ringo (you can see the full translation in the 'memorable quotes' link): ""Eventus stultorum magister."" ""In pace requiescat"";<br/><br/> this movie roars like a stallion on steel hooves, in a hail of Peacemaker gunfire and very real handlebar moustachios."
"RareSlashersReviewed","Null","56","80","18 January 2004"," It may not have a deep heart, but its a hell of a lot of fun...
","The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an uncharismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.<br/><br/>It opens with Earp ending his stint as a Kansas law officer and heading for Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan and their families in toe. Upon arrival they meet up with their good friend and Ally Doc Holliday and before long they've acquired a share in a thriving little saloon and card game. A group of ruthless bandits ironically titled 'The Cowboys', also inhabit the town and they take an immediate disliking to the retired lawman's reputation and moral attitudes. So far, Wyatt had done well to keep himself clear of any kind of feuding or trouble, but one fateful night a barbarous act forces him to arrest Curly Bill Brocious the leader of the desperadoes. This eventually results with the historic showdown at the OK Corral and a quest to rid the land from the curse of these malevolent outlaws.<br/><br/>On his audio commentary for the Tom Cruise drama Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe describes Kurt Russell as 'Hollywood's best kept secret'. Showing flashes of Clint Eastwood, but without ever looking like he's trying to imitate him, he provides a competent lead and proves that there's certainly a lot of truth to that statement. From his humorous will they won't they yearnings for Jose, to his anguished rage as he screams, `.Hell's coming with me' into the stormy night sky, Russell's on top form. His excellence can't help but play second fiddle to a scene stealing Val Kilmer, who has some of the best dialogue since Mr Blonde shared breakfast with a group of crimms in black suits. Hitting a career high, it's seems surprising that the Academy didn't acknowledge such a worthy portrayal.  The camaraderie between he and Earp is one of Cinema's most pleasurable buddy pairings and no one can deny the pathos he creates in his tragic exit. His rivalry with an underused but adequate Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo is compelling and their dual makes for an irresistible climax. Dana Delaney also shines as the Marshall's 'other' love interest, but frankly with a cast studded with cameos from so many familiar faces - even Charlton Heston - you could give a gibbon the megaphone and the results would probably still feel fairly acceptable!<br/><br/>The set locations are the standard cowboy fare, but director Cosmatos manages to make good use of them. The stormy night scenes when Morgan is attacked are crafted to create an electric atmosphere that is superbly lighted and the same can be said for the suspense made in the neatly staged shoot-outs. Clearly accomplished as an action director, Cosmatos certainly was the right Man for this rootin' tootin' ride through the Wild West. He shows a flare for building tension that runs smoothly throughout the beautifully shot set pieces.<br/><br/>The only complaint that can be made about Tombstone is the lack of any real depth found within the story. Where as genre classics like Unforgiven offer an emotionally charged drama that snuggles so neatly with the always-ungratuitous gunplay, Kevin Jarre's story falls into the 'popcorn western' category. Along with its contemporaries Young guns or The Quick and the Dead, the movie aims more for blockbuster appeal than a deep and endearing dramatic approach. Still, fans of a six-shooter will find plenty to be impressed by - in this admirable character-led mix of gunplay, companionship, romance and even just the right amount of pathos. Fans still ask which is the better of the two accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that were strangely released around the same time. Well I guess the answer really depends on your personnel taste in movies. If you like the more dramatic western and have no problem with an epic runtime, then Costner and co's biopic maybe the one for you. However if you're looking for a 'popcorn' take on the lawman's life then you need look no further. Tombstone's your movie! It may not have a deep heart, but it's a hell of a lot of fun! 8/10"

Or that some of the facts were traded or missed all together in Tombstone. The director had set this western up and many others on their heels. Everybody mentions Val Kilmer in this as the incomparable 'Doc' Holiday. No doubt that he was indeed just that. <br/><br/>But add to it the way that Russell and Elliot with Paxton were the brothers that fell right into cinematic place. They were picture- perfect in their places. Then you bring in Dana Delaney, who is made for this part of the love opposite Wyatt, feisty, smart, educated and beautiful. and Stephen Lang another 'Pro' in about anything he takes on. I think he has multiple acting-personalities, his range is as broad as lake Superior. From a confident Jewish Lawyer David Abrams in 'Crime Story' (1986-88) to a quivering voice scumbag criminal outlaw in this, he has all the talent and a few other actor's talents too! Along with him, Michael Biehn, who was prime as Ringo, oh yeah! Charlton Heston as ' Henry Hooker' the solid standing rancher, who aides 'Doc' in a time of trouble, to Powers Booth, as the smart-Aleck's, oddly likable but equally slimy instigator 'Curly Bill' . The guy you love to hate. There was many moments that were the blocks that built the story, the one in particular that seemed strangely authentic, was when Wyatt and Virgil (Russell and Elliot) walked with Allie and Mattie, from the train after meeting up, and stopped at that storefront window and stood there, as if posing for a portrait. Wyatt sort of directed them to take a moment and take a picture of it to remember in their mind. That was a pause for reality in this for me. This had both tragedy and hard fought victory. The Arizona sky and scenery was dreamy in some sequences and the camera crew and sound was top-notch. I still can't really say there is another 'West' picture that stimulates my senses better than Wyatt and the whole gang, with 'Doc' the wild huckleberry, at your service....<br/><br/>The crew that played together in this film, helped make it a smash hit!! There are the other actors that took part as well, too many to list with the 'word' limit on IMDb, but, it was so good, you could feel it even after the movie was over! I highly and gladly recommend to western lovers and action movie seekers. <br/><br/>Tombstone...Justice is coming.(*****)"

","Few Movies can claim historic one-liners such as Tombstone. The most popular of which being that teasing prompt from Doc Holliday to Jonny Ringo, ""I'm your Huckleberry. That's just my game."" Kevin Jarre (writer) can die a happy man knowing that every movie buff who calls himself a man will continue to utter ""I'm your Huckleberry"" from their lips as a taunting provocation towards an opponent. George P. Cosmatos (Director) rounds up a cast filled with so much talent for the genre that you could say the movie was almost doomed to become one of the most popular westerns in fandom. First of all, all characters have to sport a real man's mustache, and Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot (especially Sam), Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton meet the cowboy challenge with flying colors. Even though Russell's portrayal as Wyatt Earp was solid, Val Kilmer nearly hijacks the movie with one of the best performances (arguably) of his acting career as Doc Holiday. He almost steals the movie from the main protagonist, Wyatt. The historical accurateness concerning the Earps and Clantons at the OK Corral is good enough to indulge the history buff to a satisfactory level. Some facts would clash, but minor details are most often sacrificed to the movie gods so that maximum enjoyment for the audience can be achieved. The movie involves many themes. Obeying the Law. Love. Loss of love. Addiction. Retribution. Loyalty has a strong influence in the movie on both the Cowboy side and the Earp side of the conflict. The Action is good and heroic, but the greatest part of this movie is the dialog. This aspect is were Tombstone shines above all other western films. A dialog which bleeds with hate, revenge and history."

"romanorum1","9","10","13","26 August 2016"," A Throwback to the Greatest Westerns of All Time
","The opening narration by Robert Mitchum is told among scenes from several early silent features: ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903) and ""The Bank Robbery"" (1908). The narrator further states that the discovery of silver created the boom-town of Tombstone (1879). A large gang of ruthless outlaws, led by psychopaths Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), ride hard at a Mexican wedding party and thoroughly destroy it. An incensed priest warns them about the ominous signs of the apocalypse: vengeful men riding on horseback. He is abruptly gunned down by Ringo. <br/><br/>Only a few months after rowdy Tombstone's founding, three Earp Brothers (Wyatt = Kurt Russell, Virgil = Sam Elliott, and Morgan = Bill Paxton) arrive with their three wives (Mattie, Allie, Louisa) to settle down and make money. We do not hear about brothers James or Warren, even though they were there in the 1880s; James was a saloon-keeper not involved in the politics. Tombstone is typically western in that saloons and gambling establishments thrive. Confidence men check out the Earps as they disembark from wagons. County Sheriff Behan (Jon Tenney) introduces himself; the Earps also meet town marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.). After that, Wyatt enters the Oriental to confront bully Johnny Tyler (Billy Bob Thorton), who had seized the gaming table. By disposing of the coward, Wyatt obtains 25% of the faro take. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), an old friend who has pneumonia, turns up to renew his old acquaintances. Entering town by stagecoach is actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and her small acting troupe. Over time Josephine will replace laudanum-drinking Mattie as Wyatt's wife. At the Oriental gaming table, Wyatt and Doc make the acquaintance of Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, and Ike Clanton (Stephan Lang). Ike warns Wyatt that the Cowboys dislike lawmen; Wyatt, though, is ""retired""; he had been a noted peace officer in Dodge City, Kansas. Curly Bill wins $500 and walks away happy, although Doc and Ringo eye each other. <br/><br/>Leaving an opium den, Curly Bill is of unsound mind and fires his weapons against town regulations; eventually he murders Marshal Fred White while corrupt Sheriff Behan does nothing. The mayor wants Wyatt to be town marshal but he initially refuses. Later Wyatt becomes a lawman, along with his two brothers. Meanwhile some outlaw cowboys pull into town armed. The Earps deploy to disarm the cowboys, an action that sets up the famous shootout at the OK Corral (26 Oct 1881). When the smoke clears, two McLaury Brothers and Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) are dead; Virgil, Morgan, and Doc are wounded. Billy Clairborne (Wyatt Earp III) and Ike Clanton have run away. Actually Ike did not shoot at the Earps from Fly's studio; he simply ran towards the stables. Unsuccessfully, Behan tries to arrest the Earps. <br/><br/>""Tombstone"" is unique in that it covers six months after the OK Corral gunfight. Because of the shootout, the cowboys commence cowardly acts of vengeance. They hold a funeral for their dead comrades, carrying a sign that reads ""Murdered on the Streets of Tombstone."" On a subsequent stormy night, Virgil is ambushed by some cowboys; resulting in a buckshot-shattered left arm. After (actually three months later), Morgan is shot in the back while playing pool; he lives only a few minutes before expiring. Wyatt decides it is time to send Virgil, Allie, and Louisa to California. Curly Bill sends Frank Stillwell (Tomas Arana) to the train station to wipe out the remaining Earps. Stillwell, however, is shot to death by Wyatt, who now becomes a renegade for his vengeful action. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie focuses on the Earp Vendetta (1882). This was a federal posse that included ""Texas Jack"" John Vermillion (Peter Sherayko), ""Turkey Creek"" Jack Johnson (Buck Taylor), Sherman McMasters (Michael Rooker), Warren Earp (although Warren was not in the movie), and Wyatt. These are the men of the apocalypse, the earlier warning of the priest. Cowboys are shot to death on site, whether on the plains, in the woods, at an opium den, or in a barber shop. It's not easy, though. Once, Wyatt's band is trapped in a crossfire by Curly Bill and some cohorts at Iron Springs. Wyatt bravely extricates himself and runs towards the cowboys, blazing away, and killing Curly Bill. Doc says Wyatt walks on water. (It is an historical fact that Wyatt was never wounded in any of his gun battles.)<br/><br/>Although Sheriff Behan forms a posse (that included outlaw cowboys) to arrest Wyatt, he never locates him. Wyatt's band rests at the ranch of sympathetic Henry Hooker (Charlton Heston). Ringo sends a message challenging Earp to come to the Oak Grove (Silver Springs), but Doc Holliday arrives first and challenges Ringo, who is slain. The remaining gang-members are systematically wiped out. Ike survives (only to be killed later while rustling cattle). After the vendetta is over, a dying Doc has checked himself into a Colorado sanitarium. On his deathbed he has converted to the Roman Catholic faith. (Doc actually lived longer, until 1888.)<br/><br/>In snowy Colorado, Wyatt visits Josephine and proposes, even though he owns nothing. Josephine says she comes from a rich family. The narrator tells us that they lived together for 47 years; Wyatt died in 1929. Two of his funeral pall bearers were silent screen cowboys William S. Hart and Tom Mix. Credits appear at movie's end. <br/><br/>Director George P. Cosmatos has created a vastly underrated western. The photography magnificently pictures the grandeur of the West, like its sunsets. Notice the interior of the telegraph office at the beginning, the ornate bar of the Oriental, or the candle-lighting around the actors' stage. The sets are authentic, even finer details like clothing, wallpaper, saddles, and pistols of the 1880s. The exception is the red sashes, which appear solely for Cowboy identification. There are 85 speaking parts and characters are well-developed. This might have been the best western since the 1970s."
"BigBirdtheBum","7","6","8","4 November 2008"," Great performances and gunfights make ""Tombstone"" a western to enjoy
","Great performances and gunfights make ""Tombstone"" a western to enjoy. Well at least for me anyway, personally I have never been a big fan of westerns. So I may be to harsh or too lenient in my review, as I am vastly unfamiliar with what makes or breaks a western. So I will try to do my best to address all aspects of the film. <br/><br/>The film ""Tombstone"" concerns three brothers; Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Virgil Earp (Sam Elliot) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton) venturing to a town called Tombstone (a developing mining town) and settling in. Here Wyatt meets a close friend Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer). Together they attempt to rake in the bucks gambling at a local saloon. Unfortunately several misfits and murders land them in trouble with the cowboys, a ruthless gang of maniacs, who appear to be in control of the town more than the police, or the town Marshall. After a murder of the town sheriff the trouble really begins. This trouble leads Wyatt and his brothers fearing for there lives, and as a result they join the police force. Although Wyatt initially was reluctant (as he was once a law man) he decides to help his brothers. Violence and mayhem persists and a war breaks out between authorities and cowboys, with moral and physical losses on both sides. <br/><br/>Now what everyone man or women seems in my opinion to like about westerns is three things; number one- cowboys, number two- shootouts and number three the presence of the classic saloon. ""Tombstone"" dishes this out in healthy doses. Some of the memorable shootouts include the; Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (a real shootout) among others. Now these shootouts are quick paced and feature casualties on both sides, and include a great variation in weaponry used. This is mixed in with moderate amounts of blood that don't move interest away from, neither the brilliant sets nor the costumes, but succeed in adding realism and occasionally shock value. Now the sets and costumes are something to really wonder over. The costumes appear authentic and the sets just as authentic. The sets also have a distinct warn down feel; which assists in placing viewers in a corrupt and dusty western environment. <br/><br/>Now aside from feeling like a western movie, the acting and the dialogue is quite authentic and enables you to really soak up the atmosphere of the picture, without being distracted by poor dialogue or bad acting. Now the best acting is given by Kilmer, who portrays Doc Holiday in such a way; you really will believe he existed. Kilmer doesn't overact at all and portrays him as a calm, but an in control man. Dialogue associated with good acting include; ""All right, Clanton... you called down the thunder, well now you've got it! You see that?"" said by Wyatt and ""The Cowboys are finished, you understand? I see a red sash, I kill the man wearin' it!"", also said by Wyatt. Now what makes this dialogue authentic is it doesn't seem forced and seems to be dialogue in which someone would come p with on the spot in an actual situation. <br/><br/>What also mesmerised me about the film is the substantial character development that occurs. At first Wyatt and his brothers are to varying degrees attempting to avoid fighting the cowboys, but after a while they literally launch a personal vendetta against them, which historical became known as the ""vendetta ride"". Not only are changes and conflict intriguing to watch, it also makes successful drama which makes ""Tombstone"" seem very sophisticated. Now I didn't enjoy everything about ""Tombstone"", one thing that really bugged me about the film, was the lack of time and detail spent on developing the cowboys. Now this effected my viewing of the film quite substantially. I began to feel as if the movie lacked in presenting villains that has emotions, had motives and had lives. They just seemed to pop up and disappear. The only cowboy who is talked about in some detail is Ringo (Michael Biehn), the motive for his villainous actions are; he is simply a sick, sadistic man. Now this is probably one of the biggest flaws, and won't concern most viewers aside from the very picky viewers (like me). <br/><br/>Summing up, ""Tombstone"" is an enjoyable western flick that presents believable characters and sets, combined with compelling gunfights and realism that sets it apart from other ""action flicks"". Overall I give ""Tombstone"" a well earned 7.3 out of 10. Not the best western I have seen, but pretty damn good for a modern one. Now I mentioned the film does have some blood in it. But the blood is rather quick and occurs infrequently throughout the film and is not very disturbing, so anyone 11 and older should be all right watching this film. Although many of them may find it too slow moving."

"ma-cortes","8","7","10","19 September 2018"," Exciting revisionist Western with plenty of tension , thrills , gunplay and high body-count .
","""Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp"" (George P. Cosmatos, 1993) with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is a vigorous recounting of a familiar tale , dealing with legendary lawman moves to Tombstone , Arizona, aiming to begin a new life along with his brothers , Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) . This trigger-taut Western drama deals with a lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and a badman gunslinger and philosopher Southern gent who usually coughs , called Doc Holliday , (Val Kilmer who excels , giving comsumptive conviction to character) , the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest stand-up gunfight in the history of the West . As the fabled showdown is seen about two-thirds of the way through this film . They are the strangest alliance between the West's most famous sheriff Wyatt Earp , trying to overcome outlaws and its deadliest gambling killer , Doc Holliday. It's incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action , Kurt Russell portrays the large-than-life lawman , living by the old rules , driven by revenge , dueling to the death and Kilmer is most impressive as a gunslinger , the hellfire gambler , his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman's heart , Kate : Joanna Pacula . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone , it is the highlight to the story and the start of a small war between the revenger Earp and the baddies : ¨The Cowboys¨ , led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe ) , Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) , Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) , Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) , Frank McLaury (Robert Burke) . Meanwhile , Wyatt falls in love for an actress , Josephine (Dana Delaney) , though lacks the indispensable romantic spark . <br/><br/>
This is an overwhelming Western , though too self-conscious , suffering from 90s Western revisionism . It was partially panned , but nowadays being well considered , may be seen by some as unoriginal and cliched but is really a very fashionable outing in Earp saga and a throughly agreeable Western. Russell sounds and looks the part more than any other Earp , including Kevin Costner/Kasdan Wyatt, being helped in no small measure by his courage in growing a large Earp-like tache . Val Kilmer delivers an awesome acting , stealing clearly the show , a character designed for scenary chewing , giving a breathtaking portrayal of the doomed dentist . Although overlong , but blessed with a high-energy level , thanks to noisy action , spectacular horse riding and rousing shooting . Russell spends a lot of time looking troubled by the violence while kills mercilessly. There's also essential moustache-wearing from the very effective Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton : Virgil and Morgan . Here Doc helps Earp against other historic characters , such as Stephen Lang /Ike Clanton , Thomas Haden Church /Billy Clanton and Johnny Ringo/Michael Biehn . As the picture benefits itself from despictable villians . The film focuses Tombstone , 1881 , with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan , Virgil , Wyatt Earp , Doc against the nefarious Ike Billy Clanton , Johnny Ringo, and Tom McLowery . This main character is a historical figure , in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic ""My Darling Clementine"" in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature , in this ""Gunfight at O.K. Corral"" (1957) with Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas directed by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in ""The Hour of the Gun"" (1967) ; the demystifying ""Doc"" (Frank Perry, 1971) with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach or the more modern ¨Wyatt Earp¨ (Lawrence Kasdan, 1994) with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid . <br/><br/>This is a story enormous in scope ,unusual in concept with a mile-a-minute action on a climatic and thrill-a-minute gunfight. Packs a magnificent and marvelous cinematography-Vistavision with a nice sense of period , and Technicolor with overblown chromatic by William A Fraker . As well as adequate costuming and lavish production design . This thrilling film contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by the great Bruce Broughton who composes a rousing soundtrack . All of them help make this one an enjoyable action western film . This saga of Earp family and the band of law-abiding large moustaches beat the Wyatt Earp by Lawrence Kasdan/Kevin Costner to big screen by several years . The motion picture was stunningly directed by George Pasn Cosmatos"

"AbigailBar","10","7","10","22 April 2016"," Amazing Film, but could be more accurate
","Tombstone is my favorite film. However after learning about the historical OK Corral shootout that the film was based off of, many details in the movie are changed, like the relationships between the historical figures. Its lead me to feel the importance of historical accuracy is something that needs to be discussed.<br/><br/>History is an important subject, it can help people learn from past mistakes, learn about their heritage, their family, different cultures, and by Hollywood films changing things in order to make some money, it hurts the learning of the truth. People are watching these movies and mostly assume that they're accurate, and it leads to a lack of true knowledge and understanding . By simply making these movies have more accuracy or possibly at the end of the movie encourage their audience to research the historical event, we as a society can gain knowledge and continue to make history.<br/><br/>Until directors and actors are able, historically based movies will continue twist and change historical facts and events. The problem with this is that they will continue to cause a false sense of knowledge, it will disrespect the people who were there during the time depicted in a film if the director decided to paint them as someone they weren't and will continue to teach our generation false information."

His laconic, brave, and whimsical take on a western icon is at all times fascinating and richly textured.  He may be difficult, he may be arrogant, but Jeez can he act.  The whole film harks back to the great John Ford westerns of the past - a strong story, well acted and brilliantly told."

"hitchcockthelegend","8","9","14","16 August 2010"," Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.
","Tombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).<br/><br/>The back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.<br/><br/>In spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10"

I just saw it for the first time, and it's easily the best movie I've seen in months.<br/><br/>I've said it before and I'll say it again, but, in my opinion, characters are likely the most important aspect of a film. That said, the characters here couldn't be better, each one has their own distinct personality, they all have moments to shine and, most importantly, they are all superbly acted. Top honours in that category go, of course, to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. Simply one of the best characters ever to grace the screen, no more needs to be said. Kurt Russell also did a very good job as celebrated lawman Wyatt Earp. The supporting cast are great as well, but these two certainly stand out...especially Kilmer.<br/><br/>I wont get in to how great the plot is so that I don't spoil it. I'll just leave it at this: it's an enthralling story that will keep you glued from beginning to end, surprise you at times, and even saves time to make you laugh. Very well written, very well played out. Even the music is great, which is something that I often overlook.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'm a huge western fan.

"Lechuguilla","3","22","42","8 June 2010"," Right Off The Hollywood Assembly Line
","Muddled story about gunslingers in 1879 Tombstone, boom town of the Old West. Too many speaking parts and a lack of character focus make a mess of the plot. Cast extras number in the hundreds if not thousands. This is a big-budget Hollywood production, bombastic in tone, with lots of violent action, and not much depth.<br/><br/>The film's casting is generally atrocious. Kurt Russell, complete with ugly mustache, looks too young to play a retired Wyatt Earp. Powers Boothe, who was quite good as preacher Jim Jones, is not convincing in a story set in the nineteenth century. The cast even includes old-man Sam Elliott, a has-been actor from the 1970s. And the women, cast mostly as ornaments, make no significant impression.<br/><br/>Despite being too young to play Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer gives a fine performance as the alcoholic but eloquently spoken Doc. Unlike other actors who phone in their performances, Kilmer at least tries to imbue his character with some uniqueness.<br/><br/>Wyatt Earp yearns for some peace and quiet amid retirement. Of course, things don't work out that way, as a gang of thugs invokes Earp's wrath. Lots of shoot-em-ups initiated by scowling villains who, in stereotyped fashion, have no sense of humor. Even the dialogue is clichéd. Costumes are way over done, and feature black suits and capes, Hollywood stylish in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Cinematography features an unfortunate widescreen projection that leaves lots of black space above and below the images. Some of the dusk scenes are evocative, with human silhouettes set against an orange sunset. Most of the film looks like it was shot on studio sets and back-lots. The film's thundering score is overbearing and manipulative, totally in keeping with a film that is in-your-face blunt. Sound effects are needlessly exaggerated.<br/><br/>There's nothing subtle about ""Tombstone"". Except for Doc Holliday, there's no depth to the characters. And there's no depth at all to the contrived story. This is a film that's benefited from lots of marketing and a big-name cast. Like most Hollywood assembly-line films, the effect of ""Tombstone"" is momentary. It will leave no lasting impression."

","When you think of the 'Wild, Wild West', saloons, sheriffs, shoot-outs, and cowboys are some of the things you might think of as essential to painting a portrait of the old west. Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.<br/><br/>Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his ""marital duties"" with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.<br/><br/>Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.<br/><br/>Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.<br/><br/>Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear! This magnificent film is worth more than one viewing and I'm sure you'll agree."

","""Tombstone"" is one of those stylized movies that has a lot of good qualities--some fine players, nice camerawork and a couple of tense scenes. But, overall, it's a mess. Nothing hangs together. It's really just a series of scenes strung together and called a movie. Kurt Russell, no stranger to action hero roles, is Wyatt Earp but you never get inside this guy. We start off with a sense of family with Wyatt and his brothers but nothing develops. We just have scenes. Hugh O'Brian may have provided a clearer characterization on the old TV show. But Val Kilmer is good, playing the sharp-witted, weak-lunged Bat Masterson. The whole thing starts off like a documentary with Robert Mitchum intoning something about the old west while some silent picture is shown. It might as well have been the one of ""Beef--it's what's for dinner"" spots. I don't know who this director is but he was obviously trying unsuccessfully to recreate the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. The violence is layered in like a cake. I think there must be a UCLA film course out there that might talk about the need for subtlety when trying to establish a sinister characterization. Otherwise, it's just another shooting gallery. If there isn't there should be.  This film is good for a couple of clips but it needs to be buried on Boot Hill otherwise."

","I have watched both Tombstone and Wyatt Earp, which came out within a year of each other. Thus they offer rather vivid contrast. While they are both likable films, the former has a much more talented cast. Val Kilmer gave one of the best portrayal of Doc I have seen. He is complex, kind and cruel, careful and reckless, serious and humorous. His killing of Johnny Ringo in the woods is one of the best gun fight in movies. It is up-close and very personal so that the viewer can almost smell the blood and gun powder. I am certain that the director and writers take great liberty with history but the film is a classic western as well as a suspense thriller. The latter film tries to be more of a character study of Wyatt Earp. Here he is not the straight forward hero but a man of dubious moral conviction. Except for Costner, the cast, in my opinion, is average at best. I am particularly disappointed by Quaids' Doc performance. All the Clanton gangs seems interchangeable without individuality. The bottom line is these films are enjoyable but one is by far the better."

","I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs. Saw bits n pieces of it umpteenth number of times on Zstudio channel. Just revisited few days back on a blu-ray.
There is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it. Val Kilmer is the first reason to see this flick. He potrayed the fearlessness n daring of a man with finesse
n the second good reason is Kurt Russell who with his handle bar moustache was awesome, specially in the last river shootout sequence n the third reason is the splendid star cast, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Stephen Lang n Michael Biehn as the notorious crazy Johnny Ringo. Biehns facial expression during the last confrontation was very convincing of that of nervousness n insanity. Russells facial expression after Doc tells him that he wont survive Ringos confrontation was top notch.
The dialogues r memorable, the theme of loyalty, family n friendship was good, the contrasting cinematography, from the dry set up leading to the river shoot-out n the final confrontation in the green woods. The only drawback is the romantic sub plot n the scene involving Michael Rooker, in one scene he is shown helping the lady climb the carriage along with Russell outside the safety of Charlton Hestons house n ........ u have to see to believe the scene."

","Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Earp's two brothers try early retirement, but can't seem to escape the notoriety of their gunslinging past. It's a bit on the shallow, simplistic side, but machismo levels are off the charts and the strong personalities are endlessly entertaining, bouncing around and ricocheting off one another like careless lead sprayed on a dusty street. Earp gets the marquee treatment, but there's no masking that Holliday is the story's real star. Played with an overdose of charisma by Val Kilmer, Doc is a vastly intriguing character; damaged both mentally and physically, he spends the entire film in some combination of deep intoxication and sweaty near-death, brought on by the later stages of tuberculosis. Doesn't matter. He still gets the best lines, the most memorable scenes and the densest, most complete individual storyline. A staggering, winking car-wreck of a man who's simply impossible to look away from, I'd throw him up against any of cinema's all-time greats. The surrounding film is secondary. We get a heavy dose of gunfights, shady characters and gentlemen who look cool in an absurd mustache and a duster, par for the course given the era and genre. But Doc, man, Doc elevates this film from a stylish also-ran to an absolute classic."
"Screen_Blitz","8","6","9","11 October 2016"," Beautifully engaging with magnificent performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer
","Labeling this biopic-based western epic directed by George P. Cosmatos a classic may feel somewhat of an overstatement, but with engaging storytelling by Kevin Jarre and lively performances by such a likable cast (most notably Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer); it almost feels like one. With the Golden Age of Hollywood several decades in the rear-view mirror and the glory days of western actors like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood in the past, it seems the livelihood of the western genre has been slowly dying out with a progressing shortage of memorable or even engaging westerns outings looming year after year. However, this 90s biopic centering on the story of western lawman Wyatt Earp shows good proof that though the western genre is running low on fuel, its not out of the game yet. Set in the 1800s American West, this film tells the story of former lawmen Wyatt Earp (played by Kurt Russell) who has set to retire from law enforcement duty and settle down in the old town of Tombstone, Arizona where he reunites with his old friend Doc Holliday (played by Val Kilmer) and his brothers: Virgil (played by Sam Elliot), the town marshal, and Morgan (played by Bill Paxton), the town sheriff. Everything in town goes pretty peaceful, that is until a gang of corrupt outlaws lead by the ruthless Curly Bill Brocious (played by Powers Booth) arrive in town and cause tyranny. With the lives of their loved ones threaten, Wyatt and his gang must pick their guns back and serve justice against the unlawful gang.<br/><br/>What do you come to expect when hopping aboard the western genre? Bearded men in ten gallon hats? Gunslingers engaging in violent shootouts? Thick Southern accents? As common tropes they are, they all of these happens to be here. But director George P. Cosmotos has much more engaging aspects to offer here than the usual western conventions. Based on an inspiring screenplay by Kevin Jarre partially based on true events, the film boasts a gripping biopic story with mostly solid pacing and charismatic characters, and ventures through the harsh odyssey of former lawmen Wyatt Earp and his call for heroism when the ones he loved become the target of corruption and the life he thought he left behind comes back to grab him by his throat. This all comes down to some bloodshed conflict between his town and the ruthless outlaws of the wild west who threaten to tear him apart. This is not to say the story doesn't offer moments of levity and humor in the midst of its overall solemn atmosphere, particularly from Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday who sprinkles in some comic relief. But the murderous outlaws are not only trouble Wyatt is gutted with, he is also caught in the unexpected love triangle with his narcotic common-law wife Josephine Marcus (played by Dana Delany) and Matty Blaylock (played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), which forms to a subplot this story sadly leaves underdeveloped and less dynamic than it should have been. Overall, the story is a spectacle. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both genuine and highly rigid in their roles, and the chemistry these leads show is equally moving, though nothing in the Oscar territory, nothing remotely disappointing. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are fine, but quite as memorable as the former duo in the performance department, nor is Powers Booth as the gun-slinging antagonist with a thirst of blood.<br/><br/>Tombstone is a beautifully engaging western epic with lively performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, and boasts a powerful, if flawed direction by George G. Cosmatos and a gripping script by Kevin Jarre. Though this film may be not be what I consider a masterpiece, there are plenty of reasons why this film is worth your time, even if the western genre doesn't quite spark your interest."

","It took me about three viewings to appreciate this movie the way it deserves. Sometimes when you watch a film alone and uninterrupted you can really get ""into it"" and that was the case for me. This great western has it all: a terrific cast, great dialog, deft directing, stunning cinematography, a wonderful music score, plenty of action and even narration by the great Robert Mitchum. At 129 minutes, it moves along swiftly with no unnecessary scenes or dragging. The cast, led by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, are perfection, many turning in their greatest performances ever, especially Kilmer and Sam Elliott. I'm not a historian, but it seemed to me to be fairly accurate in its facts. Of all its pluses, I can't say enough about the cast. Powers Booth, Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Billy Bob Thornton and Thomas Haden Church all portray terrific villains, while Kilmer, Russell, Elliott, Harry Carey Jr., Buck Taylor, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Billy Zane and Jason Priestley are solid as the good guys. Dana Delaney, Paula Malcomson, Lisa Collins and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson are the love interests. Besides all the great western action, this film is about love, loyalty, friendship and life choices.

"H_Spengler","8","6","9","1 February 2009"," great western, visual eye candy
","Seen both versions with both Costner & Russell. Must say I prefer this one. <br/><br/>As a previous IMDb reviewer stated (""Kilmer & Russell together in the same picture is a treat for the ladies."") I'd have to agree, not only visually appealing, but also very talented actors.<br/><br/>With that being said, this is a great ensemble cast. Russell, Kilmer, Eliott, Paxton. They work well together and make their respective characters in history come to life. Also keep your eyes peeled for cameos by Billy Zane, and a chubby Billy Bob Thorton.<br/><br/>It's a simple story and it works. While others scream about any historical inaccuracies, Costner was better, etc. The fact remains that Costner's version was BORING. If your idea of seeing a movie is to be entertained, than Tombstone delivers.<br/><br/>I just want to take a minute and reflect of Kilmer's performance, Definitely a highlight of the film. Kilmer is a talented actor, and I like him, his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing short of captivating. You're mesmerized by him when he's on screen as he steals every scene he's in. The real Doc Holliday was an educated man from Georgia (a trained dentist). Kilmer puts a touch of this elegance in his performance which I liked. But on the flip-side, plays him as fearless, as the real Holliday (dying from TB) was. Ironically true that he died in a bed with his boots off rather than in a hail of bullets or in s gambling dispute. <br/><br/>Elliott is a wise casting choice, Western's are his forte, and he brings a polished performance. Russell is great as Earp, not to mention handsome. Paxton, I could take or leave. The locations and sets are good, and the movie doesn't keep you bored for a minute. A great and entertaining flick!"
"keesha45","8","6","9","7 August 2007"," ""I guess you could say we did our good deed for the day, Mayor""
","Whether or not Wyatt Earp ever made such a statement, it sounds like something we'd expect from a full-fledged western legend: short and sweet, with a trace of modesty. While Kurt Russell was not the biggest star to ever play Wyatt (Such honors go to the likes of Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Kevin Costner and James Garner and the quintessential TV portrayal by Hugh O'Brian), he does a decent job with the part and Val Kilmer heads an outstanding supporting cast. Many actors have played Doc Holliday on big and small screen, the earliest I can find on the IMDb website is Harvey Clark in LAW FOR TOMBSTONE (1937), while others have included Cesar Romero,Kirk Douglas, Victor Mature, both Dennis and Randy Quaid, even Willie Nelson and Adam West.Doc Holliday has always been my favorite among all the historic gunslingers of the Old West. Earp and Hickok may have been more of the white hat sort of hero, but Doc made no pretense about having redeeming qualities, except for one: he stood by his friend Wyatt when the chips were down. No lawman or cowboy could ask any more or expect any less from a true friend. Of all the portrayals of Doc, Kilmer's version is one of the best ever done for this complex man. His pathos and comic relief that he brings to his part turned this picture into an outstanding example of its genre. In real life, the western hero was never a totally William S. Hart/Hopalong Cassidy type of good guy, but a human being with flaws just like anybody else. In fact, sometimes the flaws that a western hero has to overcome make his character all the more extraordinary and entertaining, like the Duke does with his Ethan character in THE SEARCHERS. TOMBSTONE's not in a class with the classic all-time westerns, of which THE SEARCHERS is one, but it's a good tale of how a vicious outlaw gang gets its comeuppance from two of the greatest gunfighters who ever strapped on their shootin' irons to clean up their town.

","Plot: A lawman and his two brothers move to a frontier town in the Old West to seek their fortunes but end up fighting a local gang called ""The Cowboys"".<br/><br/>I must admit, I'm impressed that a film made for this much money could feature such patently false moustaches. It's like Kurt Russell has the business end of a broom poking out from his top lip. The film itself is a two hour bore-fest enlivened by a single great threat (to turn a man's head ""into a canoe""). Val Kilmer steals every scene with his dying gunfighter but only because everything else is even less interesting. The gun fights are pretty standard, the history isn't very accurate and there is a love story that is so boring that I began to sink into my couch every time I saw petticoats approaching. I kept watching and expecting something, anything, to happen which might prove why my American friends raved about this. I've just decided that they are either liars, wouldn't know good taste if it bit them or are just happy to have a Western that isn't about noble Indians or revisionist history. As a Limey I'd recommend reading J.T. Edson instead. He's fast, fun and he taught me how to cheat at cards."
"Freak-10","1","35","83","16 December 2004"," Perhaps the last, greatly-overrated American western
","After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But ""the last great American Western"", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.<br/><br/>A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br/><br/>If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br/><br/>Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

","The mystery to me is why the Buena Vista brain trust failed to see what they had -- an incredible performance by Kurt Russell (he's so angry at one point that smoke seem to come out of his ears a la Yosemite Sam!) and an Oscar-worthy one by Val Kilmer. Were they scared of the ponderous, overlong Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner? Did they just not watch their film? The sight of Russell, Kilmer, Sam Elliot, and Bill Paxton heading to the OK Corral is breath-taking. There's not a false note -- the wives and girlfriends, particularly the two Danas, Dana Delany and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, are real people, not Western caricatures. The bad guys, Powers Boothe (more menacing than when he played Jim Jones), Michael Biehn, and Stephen Lang are truly scary. Billy Bob Thornton is very funny in his pre-""Sling Blade"" mode.

The language spoken is straight-forward and sarcastic at the same time. I like how the director leaves the audience to figure out certain scenes as opposed to carrying the scene further than is needed.  He also is well versed it the art of filming.  The variety of shot angles was terrific to watch. No doubt about it: This is Val Kilmer's best performance ever.  I'm not much a Val fan at all, but I am a huge fan of the Doc Holliday that he portrays. These folks did their homework and it shows when details are being looked at.

Honestly, this is one of Kilmer's best roles - he has such a presence on screen that he steals every scene he's in.

How many people want to see two different versions, one much longer than the other? Me, for one. I think Tombstone is bad, and not in a good way. The performances are comical at times. Kurt Russell does OK in the role. Val Kilmer is terrible as Doc Holliday. Dennis Quaid nailed that role to perfection. Joanna Going is a beautiful Josie Earp and Dana Delaney is just OK. The entire cast of Wyatt Earp are so good and believable, you actually feel like you're in the room with them and seeing history play out before your eyes. Maybe some truths were stretched. Unless you were actually right by the real Wyatt Earp's side to know this, you can't say for sure. Bottom line is Tombstone is only a five for me while Wyatt Earp earns the full ten points."

Though Earp does deliver some wrath upon their heads by the movie's end, we've already seen them act in too casual a manner, to the point where any threat they may have had is gone.

","Tombstone is a gritty and fun western. It is packed with memorable lines, the best of which all come from Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer). The stacked cast which features talented actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Thomas Haden Church in bit roles. Covering the great story of Wyatt Earp's vendetta ride featuring historic moments like the gunfight at the OK Corral, Tombstone has both the exciting plot and engrossing characters to make a great movie.<br/><br/>Doc Holiday is simply one of the best characters in history and Val Kilmer portrays him wonderfully. It is absurd that he was snubbed an Oscar nomination. Every line he says is an instant classic, from ""I'm your huckleberry"" to ""My hypocrisy goes only so far.""<br/><br/>There are flaws however. The scenes on Wyatt's relationship with Josephine are annoying breaks from the tension and excitement of the rest of the story. It is understandable as to why they are there, since it was an important aspect of Wyatt Earp's life. But they still are a drag of sorts on the rest of the movie."

","There are two main film versions based on the life of infamous outlaw Wyatt Earp: a serious, sombre one with Kevin Costner (and a whole lot of others), and a rolkicking circus sideshow starring Kurt Russell, bedazzled with a jaw dropping supporting cast that doesn't quit. Both films are great, but if you held a six shooter to my head and demanded a preference, I'd have to give Tombstone the edge. It's just too much fun, one wild screamer from start to finish, filled with swashbuckling deeds, evil outlaws and bawdy gunfights galore. It should have been called It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World In The Wild West. Kurt Russell is in mustache mode again here, but looks younger and leaner than last year's western double feature his mutton chops starred in. Along with his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Norman (Bill Paxton) he arrives in Tombstone with a life of law enforcement in his dust and designs on retirement and relaxation. He gets pretty much the opposite though, when every lowlife bandit and villain in the area comes crawling out of the woodwork to give him trouble. Michael Biehn is the worst of them as crazy eyed Johnny Ringo, a deadly smart and ruthless killer, and Powers Boothe hams it up terrifically as drunken scoundrel Curly Bill Brocius. They are the two main causes of grief for the Earps, backed up by all sorts of goons including Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton and a petulant Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton. Russell is joined by an off the wall Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, the wheezy southern prince with a silver tongue that's constantly fuelled by booze. He gives the best work of the film, and it's fascinating to compare it to its counterpart, Dennis Quaid's turn in the other version. There's also great work from Billy Zane, Dana Delaney, Thomas Haden Church, Paula Malcomson, Tomas Arana, Johanna Pacula, Paul Ben Victor, Robert John Burke, John Corbett, Terry O Quinn, Robert Mitcham and even Charlton Heston good lawd what a cast. The standoffs, both verbal and physical, are a thing of beauty and the reason we go to the movies. Of all the westerns out there, this has just got to be the most fun. It's constantly alive, there's always something going on, a cheeky glint in its eye and a vitality in every corner of every frame, like a kid that won't sit still. Russell is a champ as Earp, a no nonsense killer, plain and simple, but a man of both style and charisma, two weapons that are equally as important as his side arms. Kilmer gets all the best lines and goes to town with his portrayal, creating electric tension whenever he faces off with Biehn, who is equally mesmerizing in a more intense way. The three of them kill it, and along with the howling mess hall of a supporting cast, make this simply the liveliest western I've ever seen in the genre."

","George P. Cosmatos' film `Tombstone' is a true work of art for a western. The movie is filmed in the sophisticated town of Tombstone.  Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), a retired `peace officer' from Kansas, moved to Tombstone in search of making money and starting out as a new man.  He is joined there by his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer).  While Wyatt and his brothers are enjoying making money and playing pool together an infamous gang called the Cowboys are causing violence in the so called `sophisticated town' of Tombstone.  During the movie the audience is given clues that will soon lead to the rebirth of the `Peacemaker.'<br/><br/>The Earp brothers were offered by the town mayor to become the marshals of Tombstone after the town marshal was shot by a Cowboy.   After Wyatt finds out that his brothers accepted the offer, he becomes enraged.  However, he sticks up for his brothers and becomes sworn in as a deputy marshal of Tombstone.  After many quarrels with the Cowboys, Virgil was severely wounded and Morgan was killed.  The furious Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and three ex-Cowboys go on a killing spree of every man that bears the red sash of a Cowboy.  This shows the audience why the noted U.S. marshal Wyatt Earp got his nickname the `Peacemaker.' In this movie, Kurt Russell had an awesome performance as a gallant lawmaker of the Wild West. George P. Cosmatos deserves the '2 thumbs up' for this film. This movie keeps the audience wondering who will run the `sophisticated' town of Tombstone, the Cowboys or the `Peacemaker.'  This is a must see movie for all fans of western movies."

","One of the best Westerns ever to come around Tombstone raised the viewer bar for classic Westerns and remained reasonably accurate in its story-telling. This Western has it all except for Indians which you don't even give a second thought but on second thought, there is a injun character bad guy so perhaps it does have everything. Guns, whiskey, cards, brawling, shoot-outs, dust, horses, good and bad guys, sheriffs and Marshalls, court scenes, women and even drugs too. No one knows for sure all the details but we do know that if you carried a gun or two, a knife and a rifle, chances are you not only needed to but used them often. Those that didn't died before their time. I am saying that to say this: killing remained a common problem forcing law and order to come into play or the killings would just go on. Bushwacking (getting the jump on someone) was common and shooting a person in the back was looked down on but there were many ways to kill and very few to testify. Nice long movie and who doesn't like all the stars and good supporting players they packed into it? Just well done all around. Great movie for a meal or sandwich with a tasty drink plus a decent snack to follow. I must also say the dialog was exceptional too. Get to your horses, mount-up and let's ride!"
"Wuchakk","8","3","4","22 September 2016"," ""Tombstone"" or ""Wyatt Earp""? How about BOTH
","Released in 1993 and directed/written by George Cosmatos, ""Tombstone"" stars Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp & Doc Holliday focusing on the infamous gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881.<br/><br/>This version of the story beat Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" to the theater by six months and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films is in their names: ""Tombstone"" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Tombstone"" runs an hour shorter than ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you're looking for a kinetic, mythmaking rendition of the tale then go with ""Tombstone."" However, if you want a more realistic, mundane account see ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are vastly superior to the talky 1957 version of the tale with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" <br/><br/>I just saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from ""Tombstone"" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in ""Tombstone"" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but ""Tombstone"" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going shines just as much in the same role in ""Wyatt."" There are exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini from ""Wyatt"" edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate.<br/><br/>As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor ""Wyatt Earp,"" but ""Tombstone"" has a much better build-up to the confrontation. Unfortunately, ""Tombstone"" spins its wheels in the last 35 minutes with redundant gunfights between Wyatt & his men and the remaining Cowboys. ""Wyatt Earp"" maintains better momentum after the gunfight.<br/><br/>""Tombstone"" stands with the best Westerns of all time, but so does ""Wyatt Earp."" <br/><br/>The film was shot in Arizona.<br/><br/>GRADE: A- (8.5/10 Stars)"
"jeanniedeangelo","10","3","4","30 August 2015"," One of my Absolute favorites
","I watch this movie at least twice a year, and for myself, that speaks for how much I enjoy this film. My family and I often quote this movie, using lines like ""you're a daisy if you do,"" ""I'm an oak alright,"" ""skin that smoke wagon and see what happens,"" ""Wyatt I am rolling,"" and many, many more. Every scene of this movie is exceptionally memorable, exciting, and important to the plot. Tombstone encompasses all of the aspects of a true western, including shootouts, action, loyalty, right vs. wrong, law and order, cowboys, and horses without being campy, played out, or predictable. In addition to being an overall entertaining film, it has a lot of style and substance. There is also the connection that can be made to the Book of Revelations This is made apparent in the opening scene when Johnny Ringo, a cowboy, acts a a translator for a Mexican priest who quotes the bible saying ""behold the pale horse. The man who sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."" This parallels Kurt Russel's character, Wyatt Earp, and provides some foreshadowing for the rest of the story. A compelling, action packed classic and one of my absolute favorite movies (you also can't beat Sam Elliot as a cowboy)!!"
"vinnieboards","9","3","4","30 July 2010"," It can't be historically accurate but who cares?
","Right lets get the one negative out of the way. This film isn't and never could be historically accurate. So reviews applauding the historical content of this film are nonsense.<br/><br/>The history of the Earps and Doc Holliday is shrouded in claim and counter claim based on the conflicting accuracy of eye witness accounts. No one truly knows who murdered Johnny Ringo, it could have been one of a dozen people including Johnny Ringo himself (as per the Coroner's report which indicated suicide). Doc Holliday could have murdered him but he was in court on the day although he may have been represented by his attorney. Guns were terribly inaccurate at the time and shooting whilst riding a horse was all but impossible. As in all shooting films both historical and modern, the ability to shoot with the accuracy of a laser is virtually nil (unless the shooter is a modern scoped Sniper of considerable skill). Nuff said.<br/><br/>But as I mention in my summary, I couldn't care less!! This film is nothing short of magnificent. Val Kilmer gives a career defining performance as Doc which single handedly shamed the Oscar Academy (if there is a best supporting actor winner out there thats more worthy I would like to know). The relationship between Wyatt and Doc is compelling, with Wyatt as the honourable law abiding gunman vs his friend who is embroiled in a world of excess, drugs and death defying duels.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn on the face of it, looked mis-cast as Ringo and yet delivers an understated and assured performance, Powers Booth is on top form as Curly, the Earp brothers all chip in, especially Sam Elliot who is always good value.<br/><br/>The sets are lavish, the cinematography is breathtaking and the pace is perfectly balanced between rich story telling and stunning action set pieces. It would have been easy to make this film based around the climax at the OK Corral but not so - its almost a buddy movie, which is driven to conclusion at the private gunslinging showdown between Ringo and Wyatt.<br/><br/>Personally, I would take this film any day over Unforgiven which whilst an excellent Western, never quite lived up to its own hype. Costner's Wyatt Earp doesn't hit the spot either. Tombstone definitely does."

"Leofwine_draca","8","4","6","31 October 2016"," The cast alone makes this worthwhile...
","TOMBSTONE is yet another retelling of the famous story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is a well-rehearsed one having been covered elsewhere in the likes of John Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and the Kevin Costner epic Wyatt Earp. However, TOMBSTONE is well worth a look despite the familiarity of the material, and the reason for that is the cast.<br/><br/>This film has an exemplary all-star cast of famous and future-famous faces. Nearly all members of the violent 'cowboy' gang ruled over by a scenery-chewing Powers Boothe are famous; we get the likes of Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Michael Rooker, the excellent and sinister Michael Biehn, and many others besides. Due to the sheer wealth of numbers not everybody gets much of a look in, but it's still eminently satisfying on a purely visual level.<br/><br/>The heroes are given the most depth in terms of characterisation in the movie and the actors don't disappoint. Val Kilmer has never been more convincing in what is possibly his best role playing the sickly Holliday. Kurt Russell is all gravitas as Earp and as good as he ever is. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott help to make up the numbers and certainly enhance the experience. And yet there are still more actors in support; the lovely Dana Delany as the love interest, Billy Zane as a pompous actor, Charlton Heston in an old-timer cameo, Billy Bob Thornton (back when he was fat) as a no-good card dealer and Terry O'Quinn as the mayor.<br/><br/>The film itself is epic in length but the strong production values keep it watchable and engrossing. The Old West is brought to life in a convincing way. The first half of the movie is all build up and occasionally slow, but the suspense builds and pays off in an action-packed latter half with some great shoot-outs and choreography. TOMBSTONE is a violent, vibrant film and a fitting tribute to the heroes of old. It comes highly recommended."

But if you watch the uneven Kasdan/Costner epic you will see a fantastic and far better performance by Quaid as Doc. Both are strong, but Quaid's is nearly by far more convincing and well rounded. Quaid went through major weight loss for the role and does an excellent job giving an ""accurate"" depiction of Doc. Outside of these performances both films fail, but Tombstone is much, much worse. Just watch the film with intent you can pick up some silly Hollywood crap. For god's sake, ""Peacemaker"" is engraved in Earp's six-shooter.

Looks like less than one percent gave it the minimum rating of one star, so I suppose that then gives me something to think about regarding human differences. Maybe if I had read where even just one person wrote something about a Hollywood treatment with its typical dramatization, costuming, and storyline, I might have passed on it. I recognize that many people like extreme melodrama, fancy gun twirling, very over-done shoot'em up and down gunfights, guns that don't run out of bullets, and much larger than life good-guy heroes and their extreme opposite, and the romance that gets tossed in, but I do not. And for something historical I prefer something somehow somewhat believable. And maybe even something somewhat original but that is certainly not the case with Tombstone.

"hnt_dnl","3","11","23","27 December 2014"," Doesn't deserve all the accolades
","In re-visiting this film recently, I've come to the conclusion that there are really no great Westerns post-1980! The most notable 80s Western is probably Silverado (from 85), which while being somewhat entertaining, is entirely too long with too many somber, interchangeable characters. And, yes, I'm counting 'Unforgiven(from 92)' in the list of dull post- 1980s Westerns with it's pompous sense of self-importance and array of forgettable characterizations. Also, there is the ambitious yet monumentally monotonous 'Wyatt Earp(from 94)', which somehow manages to go LOWER than both Silverado and Unforgiven in terms of underperforming. It's an ironic twist because Silverado and Wyatt Earp both feature Kevin Costner and Costner basically stole Silverado as a minor character giving the liveliest, most engaging performance while being the polar opposite in Wyatt Earp, a super-serious, somber, eternally sad lawman.<br/><br/>This film that I'm reviewing TOMBSTONE (1993) is the polar opposite of those 3 movies. Instead of ""lack of"", there is ""too much of"". Too many characters who blatantly over-act and shout their lines. Scenes punctuated with overdramatic, pumped-up music that's supposed to engage and move the viewer, but instead sounds extremely annoying. Too simplistic, unreal sounding dialog that comes across as laughable upon close scrutiny.<br/><br/>'Tombstone' stars the usually reliable Kurt Russell as the infamous lawman Wyatt Earp, who arrives in the lawless frontier town circa 1880 via train along with his brothers Virgil (played by vet Sam Elliott, probably my 3rd fave performance in the movie; will get to the other 2 later) and Morgan (played by comical character actor Bill Paxton in a rather bad performance), their respective wives, including Wyatt's common-law wife Maddie (earnestly played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson). <br/><br/>Upon arrival, Wyatt and his clan meet up with his longtime associate Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in a performance deserved of an Oscar nomination). So we've come to my BEST performance in this otherwise lacking film. Kilmer really rises to the occasion delivering an energetic, career-defining performance. But sadly, virtually no one else in the film is even HALF as good as Kilmer. Unlike the rest of the cast, Kilmer balances out the bombast with empathy, compelling the viewer to root and feel for his character. It may not be the most accurate portrayal of the famed dentist-turned-gunfighter, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.<br/><br/>The other significant group in the large ensemble are the actors playing 'The Cowboys', the nemeses of the Earp clan and Holliday. The Cowboys are played by Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo, my 2nd favorite performance), Powers Boothe (as leader Curly Bill Brosius), Stephen Lang (as Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (as Billy Clanton), and Michael Rooker (as McMasters), in addition to several other character actors. Except for Ringo, these characters are all too 1-dimensional as villains with absolutely no layers. They're hateable, but not relatable, again Biehn's solid portrayal of the educated, contemplative Ringo being the exception, which is another problem I had: Ringo disappears for huge chunks of this movie yet I feel he was the most important member of the Cowboys.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's a terrible tacked-on ""love story"" between Wyatt and town newcomer Josie (played by Dana Delany), a travelling acting troupe performer. Josie is supposedly the femme fatale role in this movie, but it's hardly believable that Wyatt would be so enamored with a rather plain-looking woman who's about as sexy as a root canal! The acting troupe includes an effeminate actor (played by Billy Zane, getting in early practice for his over-the-top villainous role in 'Titanic'). Like most of the actors in this movie, Zane thought this was a Broadway play! Then there are odd characters like Jason Priestley's who literally just occupy space and give nothing to the proceedings. And I didn't buy for a second Russell as a tough lawman. Too many characters folded against him and I didn't find him intimidating in the least.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie isn't very good, but the script has to take a lot of the blame. Much of the dialog is extremely odd, the tone of the film meanders clumsily among elements of comedy, melodrama, and existentialism. It takes itself WAY too seriously to even be taken serious by the viewer. In actuality, I used to think this film was re-watchable, but lately, I see that it's good for maybe only a couple of viewings. The revenge angle is nice because it's always fun to see truly bad guys get their comeuppance, but the characterizations are so poor, you don't really care by the end of the movie. You just want to get to the end!"

"paul2001sw-1","4","8","16","2 January 2010"," Amazingly, worse than Costners' movie
","Wyatt Earp, the hero of the famous shootout at the OK Corrall, is a fascinating character, who lived through the wildest days of the west and eventually became a friend to the actors who played him in the early westerns. The shootout itself (and Earp's subsequent trial for murder) can be seen as the story of a impudent but sorely provoked law man who was nearly stitched up by a corrupt establishment, but there's also a more interesting interpretation: that in Tombstone, many men (Earp and his brothers included) fought in defence of their own business interests; and that jobs such as sheriff or deputy (held by the Earps) or prosecuting authority (controlled by their enemies) had nothing to do with any true concept of law. I've recently seen two of the many films made about Earp's life (in fact, two films made within a year of each other in the early 1990s); but sadly, neither is particularly good. Kevin Costner even managed the unlikely feat of making Earp's life seem dull, through a leaden determination to play him as a man of frankly preposterous moral resolution. In George Cosmatos's 'Tombstone', Earp is a little less noble - but the film is clearly the worse of the two. The gist of the plot (which drops much of the interesting truth) is that Earp is a bland would-be businessman lacking even the gumption to fall in love, but when people start shooting at him for no good reason, he responds by riding around Arizona personally delivering justice to the state's leading criminals. If I hadn't known the story beforehand, I doubt it would have made any sense to me. One feature of both films is that they make play of the character of Doc Holliday, one of Earp's sidekicks; I found Dennis Quaid's take (in Costner's film) a more rounded performance than Val Kilmer's in this one (though the implausible script is more to blame than the actor).<br/><br/>The film starts with a portrayal of a random murder just to let the audience know that the bad guys are really bad; and unfortunately, that's about as subtle as it gets. I'm sure there is an interesting, ambiguous version of the life of Earp of his comrades to be told; but I certainly didn't find it here."

","This is a pretty well told and entertaining retelling of the Wyatt Earp story. I gave it only four stars in my IMDb ranking. It bombed in my ranking system, with only eight points out of a maximum of 24 points. That's well below the average ranking of 12.<br/><br/>Here's what I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>The story is well told. There are no plot holes. It moves quickly and is entertaining.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Val Kilmer did a great job playing Doc Holiday. I'm still partial to Victor Mature's rendition in ""My Darling Clementine"", but I can understand why some think Kilmer's is the best ever.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I just love Sam Elliot in Westerns. If he had been in his prime in the 40's or 50's I think he could have been one of the all time best leading men in the genre (the same could be said for Tommy Lee Jones).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This ends up being a real good buddy movie. The Earp/Holiday relationship in the older films is more ""frenemy"" than buddy. I really cared about these two guys at the end and their loyalty to each other was touching.</li></ul><br/><br/>Unfortunately there were a whole bunch of things in this movie that chapped my grits:<br/><br/><ul><li>I didn't feel film gave us any compelling reason for retelling a story that has be told in a number of very good films already.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I like Kurt Russell. Loved him in ""Overboard"". Wyatt Earp? No way. Didn't buy it. I'll give him credit for one thing though: he got the most he could get out of Kurt Russell for this. Also, he was very effective in the scene where he threw Billy Bob Thornton out of the bar.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They had too many heavies, none of which were characterized well enough. And what did they do to poor Ike Clanton? He was a blatant coward and the butt of what little humor there was in the movie. Walter Brennan must have rolled over in his grave.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The many female parts all felt gratuitous. There's only one interesting woman in this story and that's Doc Holiday's girlfriend. She gets very little screen time due to the cast of thousands. And did I miss something or did she just disappear from the story without explanation?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Besides some sarcastic remarks by Kilmer, there was no comic relief.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Very weak attempts to move the story out of the gnarly little town set into some interesting landscapes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The body count was unnecessarily high.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And what's with the blatant reuse of the Book of Revelations ""rider on a pale horse"" sruff. Didn't Russell see ""Pale Rider""?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a brief appearance by Mexican characters in the opening sequence, then the remainder of the film is 100% Anglo, which is odd for an area that is so heavily populated by Mexicans.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And as is typical in almost every post Vietnam Western, they punt on the Indian issue. To introduce an Indian character opens up a can of worms i.e. due to PC concerns, an Indian can't be shown doing anything bad anymore, so you have to make room in the story for a maudlin ""aren't white people bad"" theme. That in turn doesn't always help sell tickets to white people. Easier and more profitable to punt and pretend they weren't there.</li></ul>"
"drystyx","1","18","45","7 August 2007"," Lame spaghetti without the cool music
","Make no mistake, this is just another goofy spaghetti western, but without the great music that makes people think such westerns are good. One of the worst things about this one is the false bravado of try9ing to look like the real story. It is so Hollywood skewed that it lacks any entertainment value. First, the characters. This is where the film fell flat on its face. In the spaghetti western, there is just one character, each with different names and faces, but all the same character, the self righteous, unbelievably self confident superman (or buy who thinks he's Superman.) The trouble with this is, these characters would all be dead by believing they could fly off a cliff from day one. This movie gives a second character, the Virgil Earp. There are a few like him, but the script is so badly written, you realize these are just the same character, too. There is the ridiculous character, and the stereotype civilized character. That is it. And it is way too obvious and ridiculous to accept even in a fantasy land. We want to like Wyatt and Doc, the two main characters, but in Hollywood tradition, the director and writers do the worst job they can. This might be an example of how not to write or direct a movie. A few good actors and clever camera men try to salvage this, but to no avail. Doc and Wyatt are the same person. No difference. The same Hollywood hype Superman with an impossible to believe Superiority Complex. With such a complex, their trivial interests are impossible to believe. In Hollywood tradition, only the most unlikable of characters survive to the end, so no one ever watches the end, except for a few masochists. Even worse than what are usually inferior spaghetti westerns, because this lacks the great music. If this is not on a critic's worst 200 list, he's been bribed or is pulling your leg. Period."
"rmax304823","5","10","22","25 December 2004"," A Confederacy of Mustaches
","Sometimes I wish Sergio Leone had never made any of those much-imitated Westerns. We'd be spared all those close up of faces of the sort were get here. Sometimes, instead of a choker, we find some kind of macrolens that gives us ever fleck in the subjects irises and every pore on his nose. Sometimes if a character should smile, there is a Great Wall as the screen is filled with giant Chiclets.<br/><br/>There's that aplenty in this movie. And lots of gunplay too. Sometimes I was confused about who, exactly, was shooting whom, and why. Why, for instance, does the gang led by Michael Rooker, genuine bad guys so far, revolt against Powers Booth? Okay. Booth has been responsible for a couple of shotgun blasts thrown womensward. That's enough to turn off anyone who reeks of sensibilities the way these boys do. But why does Rooker and his gang then throw in with the Earp faction? Motivation is thrown to the winds, along with the red scarves the reformed bad guys have been wearing.<br/><br/>I suppose the story of the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons is familiar in rough outline to everyone, so there's no need to recount it. The historical inaccuracies aren't particularly bothersome. The movie doesn't pretend to be a documentary and it's not trying to make some sociopolitical point that needs propping up by evidence.<br/><br/>But, maybe because I missed a few minutes here and there, the movie struck me as a kind of sloppy lash-up. Were the cutters drinking an infusion of mushrooms or what? The story is all over the place. Okay -- Wyatt Earp is married to a hop head. What happens to their marriage? It just sort of fades away and Wyatt runs off with the red-headed singer.<br/><br/>Speaking of red-haired singers, I really like Dana Delaney, but she's miscast here as a free spirit, a saloon girl, squired around by the County Sheriff. No. She's beautiful, but not in the properly sluttish way. She has great big dark soulful eyes and a tiny dimpled smile, in which her lower lip covers much of her upper lip. This woman is not an iconoclast. She is reassuringly feminine stability. And she's the only woman we get to know much about. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) has a girl too, the exotically gorgeous Joanna Pacula, but she fades away too. The Earp's wives were almost indistinguishable to me.<br/><br/>There are two interesting figures. One is Curly Bill, played by Powers Booth. He's neat in his red shirt. He laughs with genuine pleasure as he rips things apart and shoots out lights and he has never regretted anything in his life, a regular Edith Piaf in drag. He's the kind of guy who, after having accidentally shot a harmless well-intentioned old sheriff through the heart, doesn't seem remorseful, just puzzled. ""Aww, come on White,"" he says drunkenly, as if Sheriff White were playing a game that had gone too far. I hated to see Booth go.<br/><br/>The other interesting figure is the tragic Doc Holliday, all pale and sweaty and coughing blood from consumption. I understand he was a kind of rotten guy in real life, a racist and all that, but he's a winning character here. He talks like a college graduate. ""Frederic f***ing Chopin."" And he will not use a short word where a long one will fit in. But we are thankfully spared any display of his medical skills. The script doesn't even get into his background enough to establish him as a dentists -- let alone a surgeon.<br/><br/>Holliday was a surgeon in ""My Darling Clementine,"" come to think of it, which had far more in the way of historical inaccuracies. But you know what? It's a far far better movie than ""Tombstone."" There's nothing here that even remotely resembles Wyatt Earp escorting Clementine to the church service.<br/><br/>This is okay if you're interested in lots of gunplay and not much in the way of character or humor. The photography is quite good. An item in ""trivia"" says the lightning was real lightning, and it looks it, but curiously the thunder sounds electronic, less real than the thunder of half a century ago. Nice silhouettes of funeral processions under a darkening sky. But the cinematography doesn't really save the movie from mediocrity.<br/><br/>What led to all that violence in the Southwest was honor. Honor was a vital part of the regional Southern culture and the Western culture that sprang from it. Honor is like water. We need it, just as we need a drink once in a while. But there can be too much of it and what you wind up with is a flood that destroys communities even as it preserves dignity. Robert E. Lee had to be careful about posting his officers in the Civil War. There were so many outstanding challenges to duels that he had to be sure to keep those offended far apart."

Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a ""cosmopolitan American Town"".

Well, Tombstone is that inferior movie. I'm sorry, I like Kurt Russell, but he had little to work with here. Oh sure, the 7th graders will tell you that Tombstone is the better film, but only because it was written at their level. For my money, the Costner version is much better and more intelligent.

","I saw this movie a few years ago, and I won't see it again.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a somewhat amusing low-quality western. The acting is poor, worse than most TV westerns, and the production is average at best, but the story works as a kind of parody of classic western stories. I wasn't impressed but somewhat amused. But the ending is a total disaster. A long hunt is summarized to many short cuts in very high tempo. It is almost a music video tempo, and there is absolutely no plot left, just a repetitive kill-kill-kill, a clear case of quantity over quality. The movie producer seems to think the movie gets better the more people that we see killed.<br/><br/>The opening is tasteless and over-done, where the ""cowboys"" gang massacres an entire village because someone in that village killed a gang member. I see the point, it presents the bad guys, but it is too long, had been better left out. Again, there is no point in showing every separate death.<br/><br/>So, the movie has its greatest moments in the first half, where something meaningful actually happens and there is interaction and tension. The death of the sheriff (by accident) is the only violent scene in the movie that is well done and memorable.<br/><br/>Skip the ending (and trim the opening) and it is a decent low-quality western. But as delivered, it is garbage. Leave it in the bargain bin."
"jdkraus","6","3","5","26 March 2007"," Great performances, but lacked the ""western soul""
","Okay, I'm a ""natural fan"" of the western genre, enjoying the likes of Silverado, the Spaghetti westerns, Pale Rider, The Magnificent Seven, and Unforgiven. After seeing all of these, I finally got a chance to sit down and watch ""Tombstone"".<br/><br/>The Story: It was a decent, typical tale of an ordinary man, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel) and his family including his opium addicted wife, and two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to live a leisure and peaceful life in the west. But when a band of thieves and ruthless murderers called ""the cowboys"" lurk in the town and go about their business ""scott free"" of the law, the three brothers and their friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) decide to bring ""law and order"".<br/><br/>Now, it sounds all good, but the way the film delivered it was at most the pace of a snail. There was plenty of character development, and intermittent brief tales of each individual, but the entire first hour is made up of this, with only one gun battle in the start, occasional fist fights and one or two, here-and-there murders. The film did not even feel like a western, more like a soap opera as the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" deal with their delusions of obsessive gambling and alcohol intakes, and their lust for using their testosterone. When the first hour ends, the REAL story kicks in with the famous ""shootout at the OK Carrol"".<br/><br/>Henceforth comes the gun battles and merciless killing. The action though did not have the exciting camera angles that Sergio Leone had in ""The Good, Bad, and the Ugly"", nor did it have an uplifting score as ""The Magnificent Seven"". The action sequences were very stiff and bland, lacking creativity and thrills. Even the ""Ok Corral"" sequence was a bit dull and long lasting, in which only three guys were killed in, when it looked like a dozen or so were shot. The violence in this film was brutal and cold-blooded like Spielberg's Schindler's List. Perhaps the director wanted to make a more realistic look at the film (since it was based on a true story), but even by that time, I was numb from sleepiness. Unforgiven did not have as much action, but it flew by! What's up with that?<br/><br/>The acting: It was very good. Val Kilmer gave quite a performance as Doc Holliday, with his one-liner clichés, deep philosophy of life, and armed with his two pistols. Kurt Russel was also very decent as the hero who is drawn between what to do right, and what to do for himself. He performed a very ambivalent character. The other actors were great too, even the villains who were both laughable and insane.<br/><br/>Overall: The film had good characters and a decent story, but it lacked the pace. With this movie, do not expect much action till the second half of the film. Critics call this the ""last great western"", but that's one fat lie. When I mean it lacked the ""western soul"" I mean it lacked the the thrilling action, the music, and the adventurous pace and story. Because of this, it did not feel like a western, at least to me. This is possible, since I'm old-fashioned when it comes to a western film (good vs. bad, saving the damsel in distress stuff). Basically, it does not follow ""the traditional western."" It is an okay film, but it lacks the speed and proper soul of a western. I had to give it some credit since it was based off of true events. 3/5"

","I just watched this movie on television recently and was not very impressed. Sure, I was interested but the movie was more like a photo montage than anything else. There was almost no character depth and little character development. It was if the director was trying to cram as much action in as possible. I felt as if I were watching one big commercial for over two hours. While I am a fan of many of the actors in the film, they weren't given much to work with by the director so their performances were less than stellar (but they did a valiant job). I did like Val Kilmer's acting a lot though. So, the acting was good but mainly the character depth was terrible.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Tombstone		 Title: Too much is never good<br/><br/>This 130-minutes during film doesn't give you a very good feeling. Sure, the actors are all playing their parts well (not good, just well) and Val Kilmer is really terrific as the tuberculosis patient Doc Holliday (it is one of the best roles Kilmer has ever done) and the scenery is very well done, but there is something not all right with the movie. The problem is that there are simply to many characters in this work. Besides the three Earp brothers Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan there are the three wives of the brothers, Doc Holliday and his Hungarian Kate, the tempting Josephine and her colleague Mr. Fabian, Billy Breckenridge, a good role from Jason Priestley, and a hole bunch of bad guys. It just isn't possible to put all of these persons lives and problems in 130 minutes of film. The headaches that Wyatt Earp's wife has, for instance, don't get enough attention to get involved in her situation. The same goes for the whole Morgan Earp-character, played unenthusiastic by Bill Paxton. He hasn't got enough screentime to get you interested in why he does what he does. He seems to be in this movie for the reason that it's impossible to make a movie about the legendary Wyatt Earp without mentioning his two brothers Virgil and Morgan.<br/><br/>The second thing not making the movie a very good one is that you don't know who the main character is: Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday. In the beginning it's obvious that Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp is the most important person in the film, but slow but sure the Doc Holliday-part gets bigger and so much more interesting than Earp. This is because Val Kilmer is playing Doc Holliday with his whole heart and because you feel more for Holliday that for Earp. Wyatt Earp (in this motion picture) is a man who just wants to get a lot of money with doing as little as possible and Doc Holliday is the kind of person who wants to be there for Earp whenever he needs him, ill or not, Earp can always count on Doc Holliday. Writer Kevin Jarre and director George P. Cosmatos should have made a choice between Earp and Holliday and they didn't. That's a shame and it makes 130 minutes a heck of a long time. <br/><br/>Luckily, like I mentioned before, Val Kilmer is a pleasure to watch and Jason Priestley and Billy Zane are acting very good as well. The scenery's are very impressing and Joseph Porro's customs are nearly perfect. All of this keeps the movie watchable, but not much more that that I'm afraid."

The ridiculous moustaches worn by most of the cast put me in mind of Groucho Marx: maybe they should have titled it Duck Shoot. The screenplay had some truly unbelievable scenes, such as the terminally sick Val Kilmer arriving from his deathbed to the final shoot out. Credibility had taken a suicide dive out of the window long before this with some questionable casting and/or extreme playing of the part (Kilmer again was too Oscar Wilde-ish as Doc Holliday - he would have been blown away long ago by the hard men). There was one classic scene, though, with Kilmer upstaging Johnny Ringo's gun-twirling act - with a beer tankard. Only Powers Booth survived with his reputation in tact.

Val Kilmer brings as always something unique to the role and he does it in a perfect way, making him stand out in every scene in a good way. With the movie's great writing we get some well written characters that are likeable and believable.

It looks and feels like the Old West, but unfortunately, the trimmed screenplay and the scenes that were left out in the cutting room floor turned the movie a bit more generic, disjointed and the previous envisioned epic film about the life of Wyatt Earp was turned into an action film for the less demanding audiences.<br/><br/>Some sub-plots went nowhere (more evident in the Jason Priestley's character, what was his purpose in the movie anyway?) and several scenes happened without proper explanation (suddenly the Curly Bill and Ringo's gang wear badges; who shot Billy Zane?; Michael Rooker's change of side seemed contrived) and in the last half a hour the movie looks like it was in a urge to finish with some quick editing thrown in and the result is a bit messy.<br/><br/>It's a shame because the all-star cast is outstanding: Kurt Russell plays the legendary Wyatt Earp with conviction and adequate stubbornness, but he's upstaged by the brilliant turns of Val Kilmer as the lunger Doc Holliday, in one of his best performances to date; the criminally underrated Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius and especially Michael Biehn, who delivers the best performance in the film, as the cold-blooded killer, but educated man, Johnny Ringo. His blinkless eyes & facial expressions devoid of any humanity and on-screen vileness presence made his ruthless character one of the most memorable villains of the 90's.<br/><br/>Manly, rugged and moustache favorite, Sam Elliott as the elder brother, Virgil Earp and the always watchable, Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp were both ok, but their roles needed to be expanded. Stephen Lang stole all of his scenes as the nasty drunk, Ike Clanton and Jon Tenney provides a smooth & slick Marshall Behan, an ambiguous character which reminds a bit of Jeff Goldblum's in ""Silverado"".<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were given almost nothing to do, except standing here and there and recite a few lines, a waste of Joana Pacula, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Thomas Haden Church, Terry O'Quinn, Harry Carey Jr. and even the screen legend, Mr. Charlton Heston in a thankless role. Robert Mitchum as the narrator had a way noticeable voice for fans of him and his old westerns.
Dana Delany as Wyatt's love interest, well... she may be adequate as a television actress. but she's not a leading lady material for a movie like this, and even if she didn't ruined her character, she wasn't impressive either...<br/><br/>Besides the screenplay & editing problems, ""Tombstone"" have a couple of great and virtuously staged scenes, like the long walk and consequent gunfight at the O.K. Curral and the earlier confrontation between Biehn's Johnny Ringo and Kilmer's Doc Holliday in the Saloon, which are a joy to watch and because of that, the movie got its merit, but for a long, epic and more insightful view on Wyatt Earp's life, please go watch the Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" ('94) starring Kevin Costner as Earp and an almost unrecognizable / skinny, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday.
It may be too long and boring for less demanding fans, but it's a much better written and directed film, and even if it flopped when it was released, it stands today as the definitive Wyatt Earp's biopic. Fans of ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Open Range"" (both with Costner directing and acting in it) will love the film."

"johnnyboyz","6","2","3","11 March 2010"," Energy; pot boiling; characterisation and ultimately heart sapped out of a film of its time, but Tombstone suffices as a basic, action orientated flick.
","George P. Cosmatos' loose 1993 remake of John Ford's Classical Hollywood era western My Darling Clementine is a relatively daft and wavy film; a piece that announces its intentions very early on with a big shoot out after some bandits inflict a large amount of cruelty on a bunch of townsfolk, whereas the original built to a climactic shootout in which characters we'd spent the entire film with rode on in and put themselves in the face of danger. Tombstone feels the need to establish, in the most basic of manners, that the 'bad guys' are the ones cackling and free willingly executing whilst a bunch of gunshots sound off for the sake of it. Tombstone veers more towards actioner than it does western, providing basic arcs for its characters and hand-holding us through whom we ought to be rooting for; but what else can you expect from the director of the second Rambo film? <br/><br/>There's that wonderful instance in Ford's version of the story which sees a character by name of Doc Holliday, who has spent most of the opening forty minutes giving Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp grief, have the Clementine of the title walk back into his life and put him through an emotional grinder of forlorn memories and drink. The shift in balance was stark, an informing to the audience that just because a character gives grief to someone we might assume to be whatever protagonist the film has lined up, does not mean he cannot be a human being; with respective flaws and characteristics. Tombstone tiptoes around this naturalistic air of plight, opting for archetype more often than I'd have liked whilst spending a gross amount of time plodding along before breaking off into bouts of shooting and chaos at intermittent times.<br/><br/>The Wyatt Earp of Tombstone is played by Kurt Russell, an ex-marshal whom we know is good natured at the core due to stopping of a number of horses from having further pain and harm inflicted upon them by a certain perpetrator; an entire sequence which stands in stark comparison to the opening bandits and their attitudes towards the innocent. Journeying to the Arizona town of Tombstone with his brothers, where they hope to settle down, Earp is mangled into defending the town from the aforementioned group of a group of bullyin', gun-totin' cowboys; led by Curly Bill Brocius (Boothe). Doc Holliday is this time played by Val Kilmer, a laid-back; black-clad; smooth talking' card player whom we observe beat the system, win a card game, engage in a bar-room brawl of some nature before swinging his way outta' there with the money in one hand and the gal in the other – yes, it does feel a little fabricated. Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.<br/><br/>Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it – it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.<br/><br/>Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.<br/><br/>Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time."

","This movie begins with an outlaw gang known as ""the Cowboys"" riding into a Mexican village where a wedding is being conducted. After killing several police officers attending the wedding, the outlaws then rape the new bride and subsequently murder the local priest in the process. The scene then shifts to Tucson where ""Wyatt Earp"" (Kurt Russell) meets up with his brothers ""Virgil"" (Sam Elliott) and ""Morgan"" (Bill Paxton) en route to Tombstone. As luck would have it, upon arriving they meet up with ""Doc Holliday"" (Val Kilmer) who intervenes in the nick of time to prevent them from being ambushed by a man Wyatt had completely humiliated just an hour before. Unknown to them, their fortunes are about to change when the Cowboys decide to ride in and take ownership of Tombstone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film from start to finish. I especially liked the acting of Val Kilmer and Dana Delaney who brightened each scene they were in. On the flip side, however, I didn't quite care for the manner in which Wyatt Earp was characterized as historically he was just as much of a scoundrel as any of the other people depicted in this film. So to have him in the role of as one of ""the good guys"" seems a bit of a stretch. But that's Hollywood for you. Regardless, as stated earlier, I enjoyed this movie and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"dworldeater","8","1","1","21 March 2016"," Gloriously detailed and action packed western classic
","Tombstone is a very action packed and well crafted western. Those involved with this production made a very authentic, high quality character driven film centered around Wyatt Earp and his family when they arrive in Tombstone, Az. The Earp's are looking to put their lawmen days behind them and make loads of cash in the booming town of Tombstone. However, several confrontations with the cowboys bring the Earp's back to law enforcement. Events soon escalate at the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, where the rest of the film results in an blood feud of revenge until the film's conclusion. Before the gunfight at the O.k. Corral the film spends time developing and humanizing these iconic characters in American history, exploring their lives and relationships while putting forth a great effort to be truthful and historically accurate. The film has an excellent ensemble cast starring Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Michael Rooker and a brief appearance of Hollywood icon Charlton Heston. I must say that I enjoy this a lot and the quality of performances, rich attention to detail and characters really knock this out of the park. If you just want to see a shoot em' up western, Tombstone is quite action driven and delivers big on bad ass action. I also enjoy the other film that came out a year later about Wyatt Earp, called Wyatt Earp. Stating that will not make me more popular with most other Tombstone fans, but I really like both films and if you want to know more about what I think of that film than check out my IMDb user review on that film."

","This is one of the ""go to"" movies in my DVD collection when Life is beating me up. Love this movie. It is to the American West what ""The Quiet Man"" is to Ireland--a loving tribute. Great casting and the dialogue!! More one-liners than ""Princess Bride"". Far more accurate than most history based movies. More than enough virtue to forgive it's vices. Hyper-criticism of historical reality in movies is like demanding a painting look like a photograph. ""Tombstone"" is not intended to educate the viewer on historical facts, any more than DaVinci's ""Last Supper"" needs to accurately depict the food on the table. It is one perspective delivered in an entertaining manner that conjures the flavor and atmosphere of a period that can never be recaptured. In my opinion it accomplishes that beautifully. By all historical accounts the scene at the river is one of the most historically accurate scenes in the movie. My favorite line(s): ""What are you doing' this for, Doc? You oughta be in bed."" ""Wyatt Earp is my friend."" ""Hell, I got lots of friends."" ""I don't."""
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","1","10 December 2014"," Hell's coming with me!
","While not exactly epic in scope - ""Tombstone"" does compress the passage of time a fair bit - it does do a fine job of entertaining its audience. This viewer isn't surprised to hear that it plays with the facts - such is the nature of motion pictures - but wasn't exactly expecting a history lesson in the first place. It's extremely well shot and does transport its audience to a different time and place. Everything feels very authentic, from the production design to the costume design. Granted, this gets pretty melodramatic - right after a key death has occurred, our main character is standing outside in an absolute torrent of rain. Subtlety is in short supply. But one thing this movie is not, is boring, and it fills a two hour and 15 minute run time quite thoroughly.<br/><br/>A rock solid Kurt Russell leads an absolutely fantastic ensemble. There are LOTS of familiar faces here, although some unfortunately end up with very little to do. Russell plays the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, who has left that line of work behind - or so he hopes. He retires to the Arizona town of Tombstone with brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their wives. Ultimately, fate dictates that Wyatt will NOT be able to ""live and let live"". A very scummy gang of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are going to become more than just a nuisance, and Wyatt will be forced to deal with them.<br/><br/>It's the engaging and effectively eccentric Val Kilmer, as Wyatts' good friend Doc Holliday, that ends up stealing this show. Kilmer completely immerses himself in this character. Dana Delany as Josephine is an appealing love interest for Wyatt. Elliott, Paxton, and Russell make for a rather believable trio of brothers. Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, and Stephen Lang stand out among the many antagonists. As Doc says of Biehns' Johnny Ringo, he most likely wants revenge for having been born in the first place. Lang as Ike Clanton is such a worthless weasel that you keep hoping to see him get his comeuppance. It's nice to see Western veterans such as Harry Carey Jr. and Buck Taylor among the Tombstone citizens; the real Earps' namesake fifth cousin plays the role of Billy Claiborne. Robert Mitchum, whose son Chris has a tiny role, serves as the narrator.<br/><br/>Good action scenes and visceral moments combine with some poignant elements to make for an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"Erewhon","Null","1","1","12 January 2007"," Half good, half rotten
","The first half of this movie is well-researched and well-written, with the most realistic depiction of Doc Holliday ever filmed. And some of the performances, particularly those of Val Kilmer and Powers Boothe, are outstanding. But after the Gunfight at the OK Corral, the movie goes off a dramatic cliff. Earp's vengeance ride lasted only three weeks, and only a few people were killed; in this movie, it implies Wyatt's vengeance stretched on for months. The movie becomes ludicrously overstated with scenes as hammy as in any 1930s's B Western, such as Wyatt staggering through a lighting-laced thunderstorm, his brother's blood on his hands, moaning ""Morgan!"" Or his silly, uncharacteristic question to Doc late in the film about what makes a man like Johnny Ringo do the bad things he does. A great opportunity for a movie that could have been both historically accurate and entertaining as a film was badly blown, beginning well but destroying itself the longer it goes on."

","Tombstone is about the Earps and the O.K. Corral and what happened after. Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer are convincing as Wyatt and Doc Holliday. There are two great villains Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo (Power Boothe and Michael Biehn). More than the Clantons, they are the main enemies of the Earps. They have a huge gang of guys who call themselves ""cowboys"" and wear red scarves. The gunfight at the O.K. Corral is just what starts the series of killings. What is best about the film is the high number of action scenes, which brings a nostalgic feeling of the old westerns. Tombstone also shows the relationships between the brothers, their wives, and the incredible Doc Holliday, a man who knew he didn't have much time and tried to make the most of it."
"RareSlashersReviewed","Null","1","1","21 January 2004"," A Rootin' Tootin' ride through the life of Wyatt Earp
","*One small spoiler*<br/><br/>The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an un-charismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.<br/><br/>
It opens with Earp ending his stint as a Kansas law officer and heading for Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan and their families in toe. Upon arrival they meet up with their good friend and Ally Doc Holliday and before long they've acquired a share in a thriving little saloon and card game. A group of ruthless bandits ironically titled 'The Cowboys', also inhabit the town and they take an immediate disliking to the retired lawman's reputation and moral attitudes. So far, Wyatt had done well to keep himself clear of any kind of feuding or trouble, but one fateful night a barbarous act forces him to arrest Curly Bill Brocious the leader of the desperadoes. This leads to the historic showdown at the OK Corral and a quest to rid the land from the curse of these malevolent outlaws.<br/><br/>
On his audio commentary for the Tom Cruise drama Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe describes Kurt Russell as 'Hollywood's best kept secret'. Showing flashes of Clint Eastwood, without ever looking like he's trying to imitate him. He provides a competent lead and proves that there's certainly a lot of truth to that statement. From his humorous will they won't they yearnings for Jose, to his anguished rage as he screams, `.Hell's coming with me' into the stormy night sky, Russell's on top form. His excellence can't help but play second fiddle however to a scene stealing Val Kilmer, who has some of the best dialogue since Mr Blonde shared breakfast with a group of crimms in black suits. Hitting a career high, it's seems surprising that the Academy didn't acknowledge such a worthy portrayal.  The camaraderie between he and Earp is one of Cinema's most pleasurable buddy pairings and no one can deny the pathos he creates in his tragic exit. His rivalry with an underused and looking uninterested Michael Biehn, as Johnny Ringo is compelling and their dual makes for an irresistible climax. Dana Delaney also shines as the Marshall's 'other' love interest, but frankly with a cast studded with cameos from so many familiar faces - even Charlton Heston - you could give a gibbon the megaphone and the results would probably still feel fairly acceptable!<br/><br/>The set locations are the standard cowboy fare, but director Cosmatos manages to make good use of them. The stormy night scenes when Morgan is attacked are crafted to create an electric atmosphere that is superbly lighted and the same can be said for the suspense made in the neatly staged shoot-outs. Clearly accomplished as an action director, Cosmatos certainly was the right Man for this rootin' tootin' ride through the Wild West. He shows a flare for building tension that runs smoothly throughout the beautifully shot set pieces.<br/><br/>The only complaint that can be made about Tombstone is the lack of any real depth found within the story. Where as genre classics like Unforgiven offer an emotionally charged drama that snuggles so neatly with the always-ungratuitous gunplay, Kevin Jarre's story s falls into the 'popcorn western' category. Along with its contemporaries Young guns or The Quick and the Dead, the movie aims more for blockbuster appeal than a deep and endearing dramatic approach. Still, fans of a six-shooter will find plenty to be impressed by in this admirable character-led mix of gunplay, companionship, romance and even just the right amount of pathos. Fans still ask which is the better of the two accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that were strangely released around the same time. Well I guess the answer really depends on your personnel taste in movies. If you like the more dramatic western and have no problem with an epic runtime then Costner and co's biopic maybe the one for you, however if you're looking for a popcorn take on the lawman's life then you need to look no further. Tombstone's your movie! It may not have a deep heart, but it's a hell of a lot of fun!"

The villains are loaded with Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn and Stephen Lang.  Even Moses, himself, Charleton Heston makes a cameo.  The script is relatively wide open, which is a no-brainer with the talent onhand.  What the script has is a nice sense of timing, set up and pacing. The music is dynamic and is really moving, especially in times of trouble. The movie is also pretty historically accurate in many places and doesn't mutilate the concept too badly overall.  This story is truly so much larger then normal life that other fascinating tidbits were left out (such as the true story of Earp's card game with Behan when he won the Oriental Saloon.)

My only complaint about this film (other than wanting it to last forever!) is the direction, which is sterling in most cases, but fails to maintain the various moods in the different ""acts"" of the film.  The audience feels the foreshadowing of evil a bit too early, and then the intensity of the hunt-and-slaughter episode leading to the climax is broken by a lack of sufficient atmosphere.  Bear in mind, however, that this inconsistency is not enough to ruin the film, only a minor blemish in what is otherwise a triumphant success. No, this is not a western.  This is a great film, that just happens to be set in the old west.  I give it 8 stars!"

I have seen just about every major actor in this movie in other roles and none of them have lived up to thier roles in tombstone.  This is undoubtedly the best performances of Kurt Russell's, Michael Beihn's, Sam Elliott's, Powers Boothe's and Bill Paxton's careers.  It is amazing that all you have to do is slap a killer mustache on Kurt Russell and its like your looking at an actual photograph of the real Wyatt Earp.<br/><br/>The main characters aren't the only ones carrying the weight.

Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday is superb, with the best accent of any of the actors in the movie.<br/><br/>With the exception of the Blues Brothers there isn't a movie with so many classic quotable lines.  Doc Holliday and Curly Bill have some particularly memorable dialogue.<br/><br/>The scenery and cinematography are great. I am a huge fan of the old western's but I have to admit the special effects and cinematagraphy are extraordinary in Tombstone.<br/><br/>The biggest complaints I've heard about this movie are because of its seemingly historical inaccuracy.

"jimbo-53-186511","6","3","6","10 February 2019"," Rambling and occasionally unfocused, Tombstone is far from perfect but the fine ensemble cast make it worth a look
","Successful lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) heads to Tombstone, Arizona with the intention of retiring. However, when the citizens of Tombstone are threatened by an unruly group of cowboys, Earp and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) take it upon themselves to stand up to the cowboys and protect the citizens.<br/><br/>I've seen quite a few westerns in my time and the best ones usually have Clint Eastwood's name attached to them. Tombstone had a 5 star rating and on the basis that this one was based on a true story I had hoped that this film would be exciting and informative. Well, it does achieve both objectives to a certain extent, but isn't what I would categorise as a brilliant film.<br/><br/>After an impressive start, the film seems to go into rambling mode with several scenes in the first half presumably existing to establish Wyatt Earp's heroism and perhaps why he was both feared and respected in equal measure. It's admirable to a degree, but unfortunately at times it feels a bit boring (the entire sequence at the theatre, for example, could have been omitted entirely as it has little effect on the story given how much time was devoted to it). In fact, the only reason I can fathom for its existence was to create a crass and somewhat unnecessary romance sub-plot. It's around an hour into the film before the cowboys make their return and it is here when the film starts to get back on track; there are some good showdowns and suitably tense moments - although again not as many as I was expecting.<br/><br/>One major problem with this film lies with a lot of its characters; the female characters in particular are very poorly written and as for general character development...well if I were to call it 'sparse' that would probably be an understatement. The fact we learn so little about each of the characters; particularly important characters such as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday make the film all the more frustrating when you realise how good it could have been if it would have just had a tad more depth.<br/><br/>Although the characterisation is a little flat, Tombstone does at least boast a fine ensemble cast. All the big hitters are very good, but perhaps special recognition should go to Val Kilmer whose character is perhaps the most difficult and complex one to bring to the screen and Kilmer does an excellent job making Holliday both pitiful and cocky in equal measure.<br/><br/>Tombstone is rambling, sprawling and at times a bit superficial and unfocused. However, it has a fine cast, some tense moments and some terrific performances. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't slightly disappointed with Tombstone, but overall it was still a fairly decent offering."

","Tombstone, a George Cosmatos directed picture from 1993: I am sorry, but I must give this kind effort a weak score. There is far too much laconic self importance among the principles, and very little typical human behavior. The fact that nobody ever uttered a humorous line in the entire picture says something about what Hollywood believes comprises entertainment these days. And this is a very long movie, full of melo-dramatic seriousness. (I suppose ""I'm your Huckleberry"" expresses humor on some level, but. . .) Set in the late 1800s, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a very serious performance finding revenge laden motivations around every corner of the picture. Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, helps him some. . .at least offering a glimmer of lightness, but certainly not enough. He is somewhat lighter, but I would understand I suppose, given that his gun contains a vastly superior chamber for bullets than anyone had ever seen before. In one of the numerous gunfights, I have slowed the video down to count 35 consecutive bullets coming from his 2 guns a blazing. Credulity has little business in current Hollywood fare for ingestion, I suppose. Sam Elliot is just slow, serious, and weak here. His natural sounding accent for slow and stupid never gets more play than here. The rest of the cast seem to continually try to give the very image of themselves something definite to be remembered on screen, but is'nt this the directors entire idea here? Impression!?! I was not impressed, however."

The only character we really end up interested in is Doc Holliday, humorously played by Val Kilmer in what is one of his best roles. Others just don't inspire, such as Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, Billy Zane and Powers Boothe, or they don't sit right, like Bill Paxton as the younger Earp or Michael Biehn, who tries hard as Johnny Ringo, but doesn't quite pull off the tortured, lethal gunman.<br/><br/>Most of the gunfights, including the big one, are well staged, but little else is left to help recommend what is otherwise a fairly flat western.

","The Earp brothers take on the Clanton gang, redux, in this muddled, overly long remake of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral."" The classical themes of old west lawlessness and threat of death are well displayed, but intruding upon these is an updated psychologizing theme that seems out of place as well as boring.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp spends a lot of time staring blandly into space. He is dignified, give him that. But he looks too much like a preacher and not enough like a killer with a badge. Burt Lancaster was better cast. Ditto for the Clanton gang, all tricked out here with red sashes, like some step dance troupe. Give me John Ireland and Dennis Hopper Â– both were Clantons in ""Gunfight"" - any day over the acting ensemble playing at bad guys here.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Val Kilmer is superb as the dying, mannerly Doc Holliday, way better than the perpetual ham, Kirk Douglas. And Sam Elliott is picture perfect here as Wyatt's brother Virgil. There were production problems on this film. Cosmatos was brought in to direct a month before the shoot, after Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, who was supposed to make his directing debut here, was sacked. And Jarre's screenplay is dull, too inactive, too long, especially the second hour. (Gunfight, on the other hand, moved well and was written in part by the great action novelist, Leon Uris.)

","Tombstone is an ambitious but highly flawed western, with a high production value and an all star ensemble cast. It had the potential to be an epic western. Instead what we got is a stylish but very problematic film. Part of the problem was hiring the dismally bad George P. Cosmatos to be the director. Mr. Cosmatos, whose claim to fame in America, was directing two Stallone flicks, (Rambo 2 and Cobra) proved once and for all, that he should not be anywhere near a respectable project. He would go on to direct one more atrocious film, before ending his not so illustrious career. But he was not the only problem. There was major issues with the script and casting. The end result is an unfocused and disjointed picture, with underdeveloped and uninteresting antagonists and female characters. The performances, with the exception of Val Kilmer, who is great as Doc Holliday, range from hokey to underwhelming. Tombstone is a big mess and a big disappointment."

"The-Sarkologist","6","2","4","21 December 2013"," A Decent remake of a classic western story
","This is a pretty good movie even though it is a remake of older movies with new technology. I tend to prefer the newer movies as the technology tends to add more realism to it. I also appreciate the new styles of cinematography that filmmakers use to make the movie more visually attractive. I have seen some other westerns (such as Clint Eastwood movies) and I was not impressed.<br/><br/>This movie has two actors that I enjoy: Kirt Douglus and Val Kilmer. My favourite character in this movie was Doc Haliday (Val Kilmer): he had numerous interesting personality quirks and very much seems to be detached from the world. He seems to always be around as he turns up in the most unusual placed. We are never quite sure what he is doing. The Earp brothers are normal and predictable, Haliday is not. The movie opens with a prophecy, something I have seen in another western (Pale Rider): beware the sickly horse. There are always four people around, at the beginning the three Earp brothers and Haliday, at the end Wyatt Earp, Haliday and two ex-Cowboys. This seems to suggest the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in that they are out to destroy the cowboys. The prophecy does not refer to a horse, but the rider - Doc Haliday. I won't mention anymore as it will spoil the end. This was used in Pale Rider but not as effective as here.<br/><br/>At the beginning Wyatt Earp enters the scene as a retired sheriff. Even though he continues to remind us that he is retired, it is evident that he is not. As soon as he reaches Tombstone he clears out a rough neck bar called the Oriental. Even though he does it for selfish reasons, this action shows us that he will not stay retired. Even though a number of times his desire for law and order is suppressed (and even then when things seem bad enough he finds himself in the thick of things) this overshadows him later by revenge for the death of his brother.<br/><br/>The criticism comes from a friend of mine who is a western fan. He claims that this is not the original story but rather a cut and paste to make an interesting and entertaining film. The story is twisted out of proportion to suit the audience. This was the same criticism that I had with the Odyssey which was also twisted around to make it more entertaining (though I still believe the original story was just as good). As I have little knowledge of the west, I cannot comment on this.<br/><br/>The filmmakers attempted to set this film in historical context with an introduction of the characters and the times in which the movie was set. The movie also finished with the typical narrative of what happened to the main characters afterwards. I thought that this was worked well into the movie and had no problem with it. One of the major things that I noticed about Wyatt Earp was the struggle he has with his former self. Not only is he struggling to remain out of the affairs of the state, but he is also struggling to remain faithful to his wife. When he was young it is made clear by Haliday that Earp was quite promiscuous; but now that he is married he must remain faithful. We are led to wonder whether he will give up his wife for this other woman, and when we look at his wife all we see is an opium addict. The movie thus suggests that it is alright to thus leave her because she is failing to be a good wife. This is not true for our marriage vowels tell us that we are to remain faithful ""in sickness and in health."" Even if they are sick, as Earp's wife was, we are not free to leave her for somebody else. The whole moral question though is made moot when at the close to the movie we are informed that his wife died of a drug overdose shortly after she left Tombstone, thus when Earp did meet up with the new lady, he was essentially free to marry her.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was a bit rushed but this is expected when they are trying to break up a big gang. They dealt with the leaders in a detailed manner but rushed through the other members. Ike was an interesting character as he was quite cowardly. He was the one that always escaped and when things seemed bad, he would always collapse and plead for mercy. To me, Ike was the most detestable of the cowboys because he could not face up to his punishment, and when it was obvious that he had been caught, he would plead for mercy only to go back to his old ways when set free. As a whole, I enjoyed this movie and would encourage others to watch it to."

","I think this story, cast and film making team could transpose the setting/genre and it would still work in a modern setting.

Kurt Russell shines as Wyatt Earp but is supported so ably by one of the best ensemble cast's of the 1990's that it never becomes a one man show. Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston and more put in great efforts.<br/><br/>If you judge a film by the amount of ""moments"" that come to mind after viewing it, this is a goldmine. The shootout at the OK Corral, the confrontation between Russell and Thornton, and my two favourite moments - the drunken brinksmanship between Johnny Ringo (Biehn) and Holliday (Kilmer) in the saloon, and the climatic gun fight, when Holliday beats Earp to the confrontation in the woods with Ringo. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about that electric scene.<br/><br/>The film's ending is sheer joy, despite the demise of Holliday.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it, and you don't have to be a fan of westerns to enjoy it.

","Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp must have felt a whole lot like Michael Corleone being brought back into the law business which he thought he'd left behind in Kansas. Of course when you and your brothers settle in a wide open town like Tombstone, Arizona you've got to expect your talents will be called upon.<br/><br/>As long as films are being made, filmmakers will never lose their fascination for the saga of Wyatt Earp that culminated in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral in 1881. Kurt Russell join an incredible pantheon of Hollywood's best actors who've gotten a crack at Wyatt Earp, like Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster and Tom Mix. However this film bears the closest resemblance to Hour Of The Gun which had James Garner as Wyatt Earp which also showed, in fact it concentrated on what happened after the famous gunfight.<br/><br/>Unlike in Hour Of The Gun where Jason Robards, Jr. as Doc Holliday upbraids Wyatt Earp for becoming a killing machine, nobody's really caring about that here. In fact the tubercular Holliday quite approves of what Russell is doing. He's given plenty of cause after the OK Corral as you'll see.<br/><br/>When he's on the screen Val Kilmer steals the film. In fairness to Russell and the rest who've played Earp, especially as a straight arrow the way Burt Lancaster did Gunfight At The OK Corral, the role of Holliday is such a colorful one, it's an actor's dream. Kirk Douglas walked off with that picture as does Val Kilmer here and Russell isn't quite the straight arrow that Lancaster was.<br/><br/>For the first time the Earp brothers are shown as the family men they were. All but Wyatt were married in fact and Wyatt was keeping company with Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, but he drops her for Dana Delany who in fact he was with for the rest of their lives together and Earp died in 1929.<br/><br/>Robert Mitchum whose unmistakable voice narrates the film was supposed to play Old Man Clanton, but health considerations knocked him out of the part and he only narrated. I'm sure the rewriting also reduced the parts of Ike and Billy Clanton. Another film legend, Charlton Heston, plays rancher Henry Hooker who shelters Wyatt and his posse.<br/><br/>The bad guys who get their due here are Powers Boothe as a vicious Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo who's definitely not gambling with the Earps and Doc Holliday with a full deck.<br/><br/>My favorite Wyatt Earp film still remains Hour Of The Gun, but Tombstone which follows and embellishes a lot of the story line of that film is definitely a worthwhile film. I understand according to commentary made during a showing of this on the History Channel, Kurt Russell did a lot of the directing himself.<br/><br/>He and credited director George P. Cosmatos deserve a lot of credit."

But even so this film is worth a watch for western fans and the performances range from OK Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot to a surprisingly good Kilmer as Doc Holiday.

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","1 June 2019"," This movie is indeed my huckleberry. Tombstone is a film too tough to die. It's highly rewatchable even today.
","Released by Hollywood Pictures and based off actual events in American Old West during the 1880s. 1993 'Tombstone' is one of the two epic westerns released within a few months of each other that tells the story of Wyatt Earp played by Kurt Russell battles with the Cochise County Cowboys. The other film being director Larence Kasdan and Kevin Costner 1994 film 'Wyatt Earp'. Without spoiling this motion picture too much, while the production was indeed troublesome to the point that writer & original director Kevin Jarre had to replace by George P. Cosmatos. The movie was still very well made and very beautiful shot. Everything about the film was highly focused on historical accuracy including casting, locations, costumes, props and sets. Much of this success was due to Russell who pretty much make things run smoothly, during the majority of the production. However, there were some inaccuracies. One of them is with the omission of certain Earp Family members. Don't get me wrong, I can understand why they didn't introduce Wyatt's half-brother, Newton into the story as he has nothing to do with the town of Tombstone. However, Wyatt's other brothers James & Warren were there. Even if they weren't presence for the gunfight at the OK Corral, which in reality, was in a vacant lot next to Fry's photographic studio, six lots away. James was still a key member in the historical events, as he was saloon keeper who gambling houses were often visited by the Cowboys. Not only that, but he very helpful to the events that Morgan Earp played by Bill Paxton went through. They could had add his story. The same goes with Warren whom was original part of the Vendetta Ride yet not feature in the film. I really don't know why. The only guess is that Jarre really wanted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse metaphor. While, this motion picture has the more tighten pace film than Costner's film. There were still some parts of Wyatt's story that went underdeveloped in this movie. One of them is the struggles he went through when first arriving in the city. While it's true that he did became part owner of the Oriental Saloon which is depicted. The movie didn't feature scenes of him starting out as small stagecoach business owner before turning to working as shotgun guard for Well Fargo. It's here where much of the real tension between Wyatt and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) came from, as Clanton was a loose association of the outlaws and was looking to cut a deal with the lawmen concerning some stagecoach robberies and cattle rustling by some of the Cowboys. He may have feared that his dealings with the family would be revealed after the shooting, hints why he chose to side back with the Cowboys. The movie also romanticize Wyatt's reasons of becoming a lawman, a little too much. Much of his interest in being a deputy sheriff came from seeking power in elections and gaining more money, not from protecting the people from criminals. In truth, the Earps probably did more harm on that infamous day at the OK Corral than good, as there was no need to disarm the Cowboys. It was very custom for riders heading to Tombstone to carry their guns. After all, Apache warriors had engaged the Army near the city just three weeks before the shootout. It was very well established. Yet the brothers carry on with the attack fearing an later ambush for Wyatt's friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) at his living quarters at CS Fly's boarding house even after sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) disarmed two of the members of the outlaws knowing that issues was high after the accident involving Marshal Fred White played Harry Carey Jr. The film makes them look more like heroes, when the movie should had made them more like antiheroes. Regardless, the Cowboys revenge afterwards was more spaced out in real life than the film. The shooting were not done during the same night, but rather several weeks apart. As for Wyatt hunt for the outlaws like Curly Bill (Power Boothe) & Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Much of that is up for debate. Nevertheless, one of the weaker parts of the film is the love story between Wyatt and Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The film doesn't give enough time between the violence and tension with the outlaws to establish much. I thought the western could had done better if they cut that subplot out. It made the ending so cheesy. In real life, the whole idea that Doc would tell Wyatt to find her after the events in Tombstone is very unlikeable due to Holliday's ethic remarks about the woman. In truth, the two friends actually parted ways. Nevertheless, I love the acting between the two performers. It was amazing, but Kilmer really does steal the show. He put a love of work into his sickly alcoholic character. It was very believable even if the Latin speaking parts were fictional. I just wish the historical narrating from Robert Mitchum from the closing and opening wasn't part of the movie. It distracting from the reality of the story. It kinda hurts the film. As for the other actors, they were just as great. Also the cinematography from William Fraker and musical score from Bruce Broughton is to die for. It really help set the tone of the movie. Overall: While the script ask to be lot more epic with the original intention being a three hour plus movie. I really felt that the filmmakers did enough to make the western, highly rewatchable. In the end the movie is highly recommended checking out. It put the wild in Wild West for sure."

But still could have been a better movie maybe even a epic one.

","Tombstone tells the story of an aging Wyatt Earp who seeks to settle down and create some roots in Tombstone, Arizona. He is committed to changing his ways of womanizing and scuffling, in hopes of maintaining a business and a peaceful life. When you lie with dogs, however, you are unlikely to avoid getting fleas. With his gang of rascals helmed by Doc Holliday, trouble mounts. Holliday, much less committed to Earp's draw to a peaceful life seeks as much pleasure as possible, while enjoying life to the fullest. Earp's troubles go well beyond the confines of his own gang. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Earp realizes that the cowboys that have run this town, and the law, are not willing to back down from their land without a fight. Another bright spot to Tombstone is a Miss Josephine Marcus, actress in the local theater who takes no time noticing Wyatt Earp, even though Earp tries to take his time noticing Miss Marcus. This love interest proves vital for Earp, as Josephine shows Wyatt how to seek and gain something from life, and how to enjoy it. Under attack, and unwilling to be scared away, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the rest of the gang set out to prove that the west is left to be won for anyone. Technically, this movie is a stunning success! Set against the sometimes mountainous, sometimes open plains of the Old West, each shot is a miniature piece of art that comes together to create a magnificent mural. This film also reached outside of the box (pun intended) and minimized the screen to remind the viewer of the stretched screen format in which many classic westerns were watched on. This nod proved useful to establishing the authenticity of a western filmed in the modern day. Also essential to providing the western flair that the audience expects was the multiple extreme close-up shots of faces dispersed throughout the film. These shots help set the tone, and the mood of each character by blocking out all other visual stimuli, oftentimes leaving only the eyes visible to the viewer. Not only did this camera work set the gritty western tone, but it added benefit of seeing the character as they were going through their struggles. <br/><br/>Tombstone proves to be an exceptionally acted ensemble piece. Anytime you have a film composed of about 30 main actors, the likelihood of one character upstaging another or one character disappearing into the background proves great. In this film, however, this problem never occurred. Each actor had at least one moment in which their character shines, and their acting is noticed. For me, the standout was Val Kilmer. It is unfortunate for Val Kilmer that what turned out to be, possibly the best performance of his career happened in a year stacked with masterpiece performances of supporting actors. When you watch Kilmer's Doc Holliday, and you watch both his health deteriorate and his drunken stupor, you see a depth to the actor that I, for one, did not know was there. When immersed in the film, it is easy to immediately state that he should have taken home a statuette that year from the dear Academy. Then, when you remember that was also the year of honoring work like The Schindler's List, you remember Ralph Fiennes' performance snub. Kilmer's acting in this film is the pinnacle of his career, and he should have certainly, at least, been nominated for it. An all-star cast came together for Tombstone and it will not disappoint. A stellar ensemble performance, wonderfully casted, and a beautiful backdrop proves Tombstone a western force to be reckoned with."

","One of the many cases where there are two films covering the same subject or subject matter released by rival studios in close proximity to one another, 'Tombstone' was certainly viewed at the time as having the lesser pedigree than the supposed Oscar bait of Lawrence Kasdan's 'Wyatt Earp', but over 20 years later I think it's safe to say that the former is widely regarded as being the superior film.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best ensembles of the last 25 years, and standing tallest amongst the giants is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.

","Rollicking, entertaining western. Focuses on Wyatt Earp and his brothers and Doc Holliday and their time in Tombstone, Arizona in the 1880s. For most people that story starts and ends with the gunfight at the OK Corral, but that event is only one scene in this movie. This shows how that was actually part of a much bigger picture, and wasn't anywhere near the end of it.<br/><br/>Decent plot that keeps moving along at a brisk pace. Some attempts at character development, but it is mostly superficial. Dialogue can be a bit gung ho at times but is generally fine.<br/><br/>Star-studded cast, even among the minor roles. Just about everyone involved is a known actor now. Some may have been unknowns at the time, but are stars today, eg Billy Bob Thornton who has a handful of lines, Thomas Haden Church.

"theblackscythe","7","0","0","4 November 2014"," A last hurrah for the cheesy fun western.
","Tombstone is not sophisticated, or deep, or emotionally weighty. However it is quite special nevertheless. In a time after 'Unforgiven' supposedly killed the traditional romanticised western, for this ball of cheese and fun to have been made is a happily defiant stance for simple and fun movies. Tombstone does not deconstruct, or analyse anything within its genre. It simply enjoys itself and tells a good story.<br/><br/>The acting in tombstone is very good, particularly Val Kilmer in my personal favourite performance of his. Kurt Russel also delivers a strong, if cheesy, performance as the standard action badass (I am aware that this is technically a biopic, however I'm fairly sure that this is not an accurate portrayal of the man). Their acting is enhanced by the clichÃ© and simple, but well paced screenplay. The film's humour is also pretencion free and charming, hearkening back to the golden age of westerns.Despite the obviously throwback nature of this film, it doesn't feel tired. The acting and writing is still slick and modern despite keeping the spirit of the past. It really is a fun little example of how to do a silly throwback well, and still have occasional moments of weight and gravitas (once again mainly through Val Kilmer).<br/><br/>On the downside, the film lacks a satisfying enough conclusion and in general seems to lack direction in its third act. I was also disappointing by the lack of satisfying material for Sam Elliot or Bill Paxton, two actors I genuinely like in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Overall however, despite hardly blowing my mind or challenging me, I enjoyed my viewing of Tombstone. After Unforgiven killed the genre, for a film the brazenly cheesy to come out a year later was a big risk. In my opinion, it paid off."

","There have been many movies made about Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the O.K. Corral. Chief among those are probably John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" and John Sturges' ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Both of those are classic westerns that I love a lot. But this one is my favorite because it's just such an interesting and fun movie. Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton as the Earps are all great. Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Stephen Lang, and the other Cowboys make for exciting, colorful villains. But the star of the show that steals every scene he's in is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. This is easily the best role of his career, in my opinion. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Really it's an amazing movie with good characters and lots of memorable lines and scenes. While there are historical inaccuracies (aren't there always), it's more accurate than the other more well-regarded films about Earp and Holliday, such as the two I mentioned before. If you like westerns you should like this but I think it also has appeal outside of that fanbase, due to the fun script and the action movie tone of it all."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","0","21 March 2014"," Less Grand, but Tauter and Leaner
","In the cinema, as in other areas of life, one occasionally comes across odd coincidences. There were, for example, two unrelated films about the life of Oscar Wilde in 1960 and two biopics of Coco Chanel in 2008/09. In the early seventies two Hollywood studios were working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire, but in this case the coincidence was discovered early on and the two studios joined forces to produce the film known as ""The Towering Inferno"". <br/><br/>The near-simultaneous appearance of two films about the life of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1993/94 might seem like a similar coincidence, but in fact there is a more logical explanation. Kevin Costner, the star of ""Wyatt Earp"", and Kevin Jarre, the scriptwriter of ""Tombstone"", originally planned to make a movie together on this theme, doubtless inspired by the success of Costner's own ""Dances with Wolves"" and Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"", which gave promise that a revival of the Western was possible in the nineties. After a disagreement, however, they went their separate ways to make their own separate films. <br/><br/>""Wyatt Earp"", the film which Costner was to make with director Lawrence Kasdan, is a grand, sprawling three-hour epic, and Jarre, who was originally also the director of ""Tombstone"", had ambitions to produce something in the same vein. The studio, however, were worried by the potential cost of the project and wanted something shorter. Jarre was sacked as director when shooting fell behind schedule, George P. Cosmatos was brought in to replace him and extensive cuts were made to his script. <br/><br/>As the title suggests, the film is (like ""Wyatt Earp"") based on real historical events in, Tombstone, Arizona during the 1880s, although it takes some liberties with strict historical fact. Wyatt Earp has recently retired as a peace officer and moves to Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan, seeing it as a place where he can settle down and pursue his business interests. Of course, he quickly realises that Tombstone is just as wild and lawless as the towns, such as Dodge City, in which he made his reputation and that his services will be required against a band of outlaws called the Cowboys who are terrorising the town. <br/><br/>I think that Costner is better than Kurt Russell (here virtually unrecognisable behind that huge moustache) as Wyatt Earp; Russell never quite brings Costner's power and sense of the heroic to the role. ""Tombstone"" does, however, have one outstanding acting contribution which comes, rather surprisingly, from Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I say ""surprisingly"" because, before seeing this film, I had always regarded Kilmer as a well-muscled action hero rather than as a serious actor. Holliday was (as the film points out) a complex character, a Southern gentleman-turned-dentist-turned gambler-cum-gunslinger and, unlike many of Kilmer's characters, was not physically strong- indeed, he was seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time of the events depicted here and did not have long to live. Kilmer's characterisation brings out many of the complexities of his character; his Doc is simultaneously gentlemanly, effete, soft-spoken, ruthless and shrewd. The driving force behind him is his close friendship with Wyatt Earp; he is not a man with many friends, but is unquestioningly loyal to the few that he does have. Among the supporting cast I liked Sam Elliott as Virgil and Dana Delany as Wyatt's mistress (later his second wife) Josephine Marcus.<br/><br/>Kilmer, strangely, was not Jarre's first choice to play Doc. That would have been Willem Dafoe, but in a curious piece of censorship the studio, Buena Vista, refused to distribute the film if he was cast because of his role in the controversial ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" which had appeared several years earlier. <br/><br/>Cosmatos only directed a handful of films during his career, and the only ones I had previously seen were ""Escape to Athena"" (which I disliked) and ""The Cassandra Crossing"" and ""Rambo"" (both of which I disliked intensely). I was therefore pleasantly surprised by ""Tombstone"", a far better movie than any of those. The pace does sometimes flag during the second half, a legacy of the decision not to make the Gunfight the climax of the film (as is done in some versions of the story) but to go on to tell the subsequent history of the Earp brothers and their enemies. Overall, however, Cosmatos succeeds well in the difficult task of taking over somebody else's project and then, at the behest of the studio, turning it into something quite different from what was originally envisaged. His version is less grand than Kasdan's, but tauter and leaner, and can stand comparison with it. 7/10"
"BoomerDT","10","0","0","2 March 2014"," A Truly Epic Western
","The story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers taking on the Clantons at the OK Corral gunfight has been done on film numerous times. ""Tombstone"" came out before ""Wyatt Earp"" which was Kevin Costner's version of the Earp saga. I've never been able to sit through the entire thing, although I'm a fan of the earlier westerns. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of Costner in dramatic roles. In fact the only thing I really care for him is playing the smart ass jock as he did in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup."" Russell on the other hand may be the most versatile actor of his time. He can do comedy, action, drama or play the romantic lead. In ""Tombstone"" there isn't much comedy, but he gets to use all his other skills as Wyatt Earp, the legendary Kansas lawman. <br/><br/>Russell's Earp is at a crossroads of his life, call it a mid-life crisis although no one used that term back in the 1880's. He and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) have come with their wives to the booming silver mining town of Tombstone to make a new life and hopefully their fortunes. Wyatt is tired of law enforcement, they want to try their hand at being the house in one of the numerous gambling establishments in town. However they find themselves getting caught in the middle of the lawlessness that is rampant in Tombstone. The town is controlled by Cowboys, their leaders being Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and his clan. A great western is only as good as the bad guys and this trio is superb. Curly Bill is a calculating, clever and opportunistic leader, who has a trace of likability and humor. Ringo is their gun. He's a sadistic cutthroat who truly enjoys killing. Ike Clanton is a vicious bully who turns coward when cornered. Gradually, against the advice of Wyatt, both Virgil and Morgan become Marshals and Wyatt is again brought back into it, along with his loyal friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) Kilmer is excellent and really steals every scene he is in, whether it is at the poker table or with his woman Kate, or with a gun, something he can do better than anyone, except perhaps Ringo, as they move toward an inevitable duel. Doc is a man who knows his time is limited, he's dying of tuberculosis. It also makes him a dangerous foe.<br/><br/>Wyatt has also had an unanticipated love relationship come to him in Tombstone, when he meets Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) a lovely actress in a traveling theater troupe. There are both smitten almost immediately,although Josephine is also being pursued by the corrupt and cowardly Sheriff Behane, while Wyatt is still trying to maintain his marriage,although his wife Mattie is suffering from a drug addiction and neither seems to have any affection left for each other. Their love story is really secondary to the war between the Earps and the Cowboys although the film ends on an uptempo note, with Wyatt and Josephine getting ready to begin their lives together.<br/><br/>So many great actors and performances in this. Kilmer is at the top, but Russell is very good as Wyatt Earp, a conflicted, flawed but fearless hero. Sam Elliott always plays the same character, but nobody does it better, especially in a western. Boothe and Biehn jockey back and forth as a pair contemptible outlaws, truly unconscionable. Billy Bob Thornton has a great bit as a local bully who has managed to bully and intimidate one of the towns faro games, until Wyatt Earp calls him down. Some legendary actors also have small parts-Chuck Heston as a local rancher who offers refuge to Wyatt and Doc, Bob Mitchum who is the narrator, and Harry Carey, Jr, the veteran of many great westerns who plays Sheriff Fred White.<br/><br/>""Tombstone"" has plenty of gunfights, some great action and riding scenes, excellent cinematography and a rousing musical score. If you enjoy westerns it's one you can sit and continually watch, picking up something new every time."

Kurt Russell puts up one his finest performances as the conflicted lawman, but it is truly Val Kilmer's rendition of Doc Holliday that truly steals the show.

","This is not just one of the best Westerns ever made - but arguably the best and most true-to- its-subject movie about Wyatt Earp and the men and women who surrounded him. Not to mention the fact that Val Kilmer does a tour de force as Doc Holliday that absolutely has to be seen to be believed - and if this isn't Kilmer's best film, it's right up there. (It's a shame that Kilmer has not since been handed such a great role that suited him perfectly.) That guy is off the charts in this film! But all actors in this film put in stellar performances and there's not a sour note in the whole film. Plus, it rises above its genre - this is almost more a historical biopic than a Western (not that I dislike Westerns - I don't; I LOVE Westerns). I think John Wayne himself would have endorsed this film. And it does justice to Wyatt Earp, too, who's portrayed as he should be - not a perfect man, but certainly, in the end, a hero and one whose bravery was almost unmatched (short of Billy the Kid, some of the Kid's cohorts such as Dick Brewer, and, of course, Earp's sidekick, Doc Holliday). What a great story, shot beautifully...it's a movie you want to see over and over again. And...is anyone unmoved at the end? Because there's tragedy and there's true romance. True romance. Read about it after seeing this movie - this story (including his lifelong romance with Josephine Marcus - which we only see blossoming in this film) is incredible and it's a big piece of Americana. The men who played Earp in the early movies - who knew him, in fact, in his latter days in Los Angeles in the 20s - cried when he died. I never get tired of seeing this movie. These are people you would have wanted to hang with and fight with if given the chance. This movie even motivated me to visit the real town of Tombstone, still standing where it was in Earp's time, a relic of the past. I felt the need to get closer to a man who was that great, so brave, so heroic, so admirable. And this movie makes you wish you could have joined his band of lawmen/vigilantes. Incredible story, superbly told in this movie. And perhaps you'll feel differently about vigilantes after seeing it, too. For who else was bringing justice to a corrupt and lawless region at the time? And yet this movie - to its credit - also brings out the humanity and tragedy even when the killing of bad men is necessary. And the thankless role Earp was forced into."

Kurt Russell(Wyatt Earp), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) are 3 actors I always like in movies, so that automatically had me interested. Powers Boothe was great in Red Dawn and Sin City, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed when he played Curly Bill Brocious. Michael Biehn was always good, so I knew Johnny Ringo would be played well. Michael Rooker surprised me by playing Sherman McMasters so well (although he wasn't in the movie all that long). Even Billy Bob Thornton opened my eyes as Johnny Tyler, the sleazy poker dealer (again, only in the movie briefly). It wasn't a bunch of city-slicker big name actors standing around bored talking with terrible western fake accents, shooting and cussing at everyone. This was actually a movie I could follow and enjoy. The gunfights were authentic, the tension was realistic, and the whole movie felt...well...real. However, there were some parts I feel were overdone. Wyatt seemed a little cocky at times.

","Tombstone is one of all-time favourite films. It's definitely my favourite western. It features one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen, many of who take meagre supporting roles in a film that never stops entertaining.<br/><br/>While perhaps not accurate, Tombstone is the story of retired lawman Wyatt Earp who moves to the title town and plans to go into business with his two brothers Morgan and Virgil. Before long, his reputation attracts the attention of the Cowboys, a gang of vicious outlaws who essentially rule the region. When the Cowboys target Wyatt's family, he and longtime friend Doc Holiday declare all out war on the gang.<br/><br/>Tombstone contains some quality acting, sharp dialogue and tense set-pieces which combine to form a truly rousing package. Production values and the score are also top notch. The story takes the odd detour now and then, giving the impression that a much longer version is around somewhere (with lots of characters and sub-plots touched upon). Nevertheless, the appeal of the film comes from it's strong characters.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell makes a career-best performance in a role he was born to play. Both quiet and intimidating, he commands authority whilst able to show his more personal feelings and concerns. Val Kilmer is also fantastic as Doc Holiday and for many, he is the stand-out performance.<br/><br/>Compared to it's counterpart 'Wyatt Earp', the film goes straight for the jugular and pulls on the heartstrings.

","Tombstone is possibly one of the best movies written about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The film begins in 1879 with Wyatt and family arriving in Tombstone, Arizona. Wyatt comes to here to be retired, however he doesn't get the peace he wanted. The violent cowboys led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) run the town and have in a state a of lawlessness. Soon it became a showdown at the OK Corral between the Earps and The drunken gambler Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) against a ban of the cowboys. After that the war continues until only one side is left standing. Kurt Russell brings a great deal of heroism to Wyatt. He does extremely well in scenes where he uses his reputation to make other men back down. The cowboys parts are played quite well also from Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) The coward to Johnny Ringo the fastest gun in the west. The real star of this film has to be Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. His lines are all said with a sort of sly confidence. This is what make his character s great in the movie. His Smart and witty which brings in humor to his part. He brings out one of the best roles played in this film. Tombstone is definitely a grade A movie. From the intense action to the humorous remarks from Doc Holiday. One of the top films of its time."

It's a shame he wasn't nominated the year this came out, but then again some say the western has been dead for years. I beg to differ although this one does go on a bit too long and has a bit of an awkward romance between Wyatt Earp and Josephine. But I will have to say the fantastic cast makes up quite a bit and Kilmer commands it in the right direction along with Russell who through his weight around as the lead. Best line: ""I'm your huckleberry..."" or ""You're a daisy if you do!"" Hard to call so many great one liners from Doc Holiday Kilmer."
"RatedVforVinny","10","0","0","10 October 2007"," Just about the best ever U.S Western.
","By far the most exciting and vibrant western to emerge in the 90's. George ('Rambo') P. Cosmatos, completely overshadowed Kevin Costner's own 'Wyatt Earp' made in the same year and (the latter) on a much higher budget. Excellent details, with the reconstruction of Tombstone and a little known fact that cowboys indeed wore bright colour silks (sometimes clashing). You would not normally think of Val Kilmer as being one of the greatest actors of all time but his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing less than superb. With 'Tombstone' you not only get a blinding, Western extravaganza but a damn fine history lesson at the same time. The pace never lets up and all of the skilfully assembled cast are up really up to the task; in the sense that all (including Kurt Russell) give their best ever performances. A quite brilliant movie and my pick for the greatest ever U.S Western. An exciting, cracking experience!"

","And behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.-- Rev. 6:8 <br/><br/>In a time when rumors of gold and silver swept across the nation, adventurers, entrepreneurs, and criminals packed up their belongings and left home. It was the idea of striking it rich that drove these prospectors to head west. Eventually many would settle down in mining camps like Tombstone, Arizona. Liquor, gambling, and hostesses all twenty four hours a day, Tombstone had it all.<br/><br/>Wyatt Earp (Wyatt Berry Stapp), who had made a name for himself as a peace officer in Dodge City, Kansas, was now ready to retire and try his hand in gambling. Wyatt, his younger brother Morgan (Morgan Seth Earp), older brother Virgil (Virgil Walter Earp), and their wives were going to Tombstone. One thing that the Earps hadn't counted on was trouble from the ""Cow-Boys,"" an ever-growing clan of outlaws. As Town Marshall Fred White (Harry Carey Jr.) put it, ""they're it, nobody does anything with 'em or without 'em."" The turning point is when the ""Cow-Boys"" leader Curly Bill Brocius shoots Fred White. Overwhelmed with guilt, the Earps step up to the task of keeping law and order in Tombstone. Virgil, Morgan, Wyatt, and Doc Holiday (John Henry Holiday) went to disarm five of the most dangerous Cow-Boys in what became known as the ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Virgil and Morgan are both wounded, but two Cow-Boys are dead. This sparks even more violence and this time the Cow-Boys strike, under the cover of darkness, and Shoot Morgan in the back and Virgil in the arm. Virgil suffers shotgun blast to the arm, while Morgan is shot in the back with a pistol. Morgan dies less that an hour later.<br/><br/>The enraged Wyatt has had enough, and he and his posse are out to rid the west of all who wear the Cow-Boys' red sash. Now this movie, this story, is all about one man's determination to avenge the lives cut short at the hands of the Cow-Boys. At times he seems nothing short of invincible as he travels the countryside destroying them with severe prejudice.<br/><br/>This movie does an impeccable job of depicting what it would have been like to be in Tombstone in the early 1880s. I feel that the mindset and mentality of the frontiersman was truly captured. When I watch this movie I never feel like I'm watching actors, but rather seeing what happened as though it was recorded in some way. To me that makes a truly enjoyable movie."
"walsh-22","10","0","0","7 May 2007"," The best western that has been done in a while
","I am a real fan of the old westerns and have found the modern westerns lacking in what the old westerns stood for but in Tombstone, I have found the modern equivalent of the best old westerns that starred actors like John Wayne and Gregory Peck.<br/><br/>Tombstone is about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who moves to Tombstone to retire from the law and settle as a businessman in the town. He moves to the town with his brothers Virgil(Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton)to start a new life with them but through a series of run-ins with the cowboys, a murderous bunch of outlaws, realises he can't live the save life he wanted and has to step up to the plate and keep law and order in the town but after his brother is killed, he becomes focused on killing all the cowboys for what they have done and vows he will wipe out all the cowboys completely so they can't rise again to cause more mayhem to the area.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of tension from the start when the brothers come across the cowboys and it builds and builds till you get to the point where your stomach is in knots because you are sucked into the movie and can't stop feeling jumpy when the two gangs clash. You are especially on tenterhooks when the Earps and Doc Holliday confront the gang at the O.K Corral and the director heaps more tension on as the two gangs freeze, waiting for the other to move first and you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the action to start again and when it does, it doesn't let up on the tension. It is quick and there is no hesitation as in the past, you had to be prepared to kill or be killed and you needed to be at the top of your game to survive. Even after the gun battle, there is still more suspense and apprehension about what will happen next and how it will finally end.<br/><br/>This film is very much a morality tale. None of the bad guys survive not even Doc. The scene where Doc dies is not heroic, it is just unremarkable. He is in bed and knows from the feeling in his toes that it is time for him to leave the earth.<br/><br/>What is touching is the relationship between Wyatt and Doc. They love one another like brothers and Wyatt is the only softness Doc has in his heart because he's had to survive living in the wild west and his life-threatening illness and to do so he had to be able to defend himself when the situation called for it. He is always there for Wyatt and what's sad is he is the only friend Doc has. Doc dies alone, not wanting his friend to see him in pain so he still protecting Wyatt.<br/><br/>I also liked the rivalry between Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). They are equals, very intelligent men but also very deadly and they seem to understand where the other is coming from.<br/><br/>I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Doc, Val Kilmer, makes that character his own. The accent, mannerisms and the whole essence of Doc has been skillfully crafted by Val. He does get all the best lines in the film and he delivers them with a tinkle in his eye.<br/><br/>I like that the film ends on a happy note with Wyatt finally going to Josephine and just living for the moment like Doc told him to. It is not to mushy for the boys who watch the film and there is enough romance for the girls to enjoy."

","To say this movie is entertaining is to say that Popcorn is sold at the movies. It is a no brainer. Tombstone is one of the best movies ever made from an entertainment standpoint and it is by far the best western ever made, and that includes films like Cool Hand Luke and Stagecoach.<br/><br/>I also have to concur with the opinion that Kilmer steals the show and he should have at least been nominated in 93 for best supporting actor. Tommy Lee Jones was brilliant as Girard in The Fugitive but Kilmer was equally as brilliant in this film.<br/><br/>This film may not be a completely accurate re-creation of the famous story with the Clantons and the OK Corral and such, but it is so much fun that accuracy doesn't really matter. What does matter is that you are mesmerized by Doc and even guys like Ike, Curly Bill and even small roles such as Billy. But to me the two most interesting characters in the film was the relationship between Doc and Ringo. They truly hate each other but have a mutual respect for each other and you just know that there will be a showdown between these two gunslingers. And when they do play for blood, we realize that not only is Doc "" your Huckleberry "" but Ringo "" ain't no daisy. He ain't no daisy. There is so much fun in this movie.<br/><br/>The script is unbelievable and some of the lines in this film will be quoted for generations to come, with the bulk of the hilarity and brilliance coming from Doc.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, this film easily gets a ten. And if you want to see one of the best casts ever assembled, you have come to the right place.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I'll leave you with this "" You tell em' the law is comin. You tell em' I'm comin' and hell's comin' with me. HELL'S comin with me! """

","I don't know what you can say besides the fact that every scene in this movie is done perfectly. Kurt Russell and everyone else in the movie plays a great role. It may not be 100% accurate with history but it really brightens up a gritty, heroic American tale! Val Kilmer does deliver an A+++ performance! It is rated R for a lot of gun violence They say the ""F"" word a hand full of times but otherwise it's not that bad There are no scenes of nudity so there's nothing to worry about there. I'd say this movie has enough romance in it for your girlfriend to be able to sit through it but it's certainly no romantic or comedic movie. DOC is a funny character but in a heartwarming but dangerous way. He might make you chuckle but then he'd put holes in you. very interesting roles that are both human but also legendary."

","The performances of Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, and Michael Biehn were OUTSTANDING. Val Kilmer in particular gave what I think is his best performance of his career. The story is very well told, and the historical details were quite accurate even if not perfect. This is a movie I can watch over and over and not grow tired. Wyatt stares down all his opponents and makes then feel they've lost before they start. Doc Holiday presented the class of a southern gentleman and the brutality of a frontier gunslinger. Complelling story and wonderful performances. The gunfight between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holiday was the epitome of style and guts. Love it, Love it, Love it!"

","I did not see Tombstone at the movie theater and that is something I regret. It is simply the best western/action/drama to be made in the last forty years. The characterizations written for the actors and the portrayals by every actor were flawless. I love watching the scene where Wyatt is confronting Johnny, the Faro dealer, in the saloon. You see Kurt Russell's eyes change from serious to deadly serious in an instant. It's magnificent. The attention to detail in every area of the movie was phenomenal. I had never seen the West as a vibrant, colorful, flamboyant place. Yes, there was dust and guns and good guys and bad guys but these characters seemed very real to the era and easily relates to life as we know it today. I recommend it for every person who loves movies. If you particularly like westerns, it is on a par with The Searchers, Red River, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, or Stagecoach."

Shot entirely in Arizona (only a few miles from Tombstone) the story centers on the Earp's retiring from the law business and settling down in the quiet town of Tombstone to raise their families and start a new life. They soon find out a local gang (The Cowboys) extort and terrorize the citizens and basically run the small town. <br/><br/>All this is about to change when the Earp's get involved and return to duty as lawmakers!

","Tombstone is my favorite movie because it is 90% accurate and it has everything a good western needs gunfights revenge and a love story. It builds up a feud between the Earp's and the cowboys and another one between Doc. and Ringo The only thing wrong with this movie is that Doc didn't actually kill Ringo. The acting in this movie is amazing and the actors actually look like the people they're suppose to be playing. The gunfight at the OK corral in this movie is portrayed exactly how it happened. The only two people missing in this movie is Warren Earp Wyatt's youngest brother and Old man Clanton the leader of the cowboys. This movie is the best western ever mad and it is a must see for any one."

","Probably one of the best Westerns to come out in the past 15 years. Right up there with Open Range, Pale Rider, Silverado, etc. It doesn't attempt to be politically correct, and doesn't try to rewrite history for the sake of a new audience. A far cry from the dark brooding and pathetically boring Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner which came out the same year. And not as dreary as Unforgiven. The box office doesn't lie. Tombstone cleaned up just like the Earps cleared out the Clantons. And this may have been Val Kilmer's finest appearance on film as Doc Holliday. No DVD collection is complete without this as one of your top 10 westerns. The new boxed director's cut is a fantastic value."

","To sum up Tombstone in 1,000 words is near impossible. Fantastic portrayals by the tough Kurt Russell and an amazing supporting performance by Val Kilmer create the perfect relationship between the two legendary westerners. Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Jon Tenney and Powers Boothe provide amazing roles in the background of the legend that was Tombstone. As Wyatt Earp heads to Tombstone to retire his badge for a life in business, he is joined by longtime friend John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday, as well as his young, eager brother Morgan (Paxton), the experienced, older brother Virgil (Elliott), and James and Warren Earp, (not portrayed in this movie). Trouble brews and Wyatt is caught up where he didn't want to be. The illegal cowboy faction made up of the Clantons (Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church), Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe), John Ringo (Michael Biehn), and several other outlaws runs Tombstone, until the Earps move in.<br/><br/>The lighting and scenery is believable, the roles are all incredibly well-portrayed, and the plot is fantastic. If a history buff, this is a movie for you. If not, this could easily spark interest in the Old West for you. Though, like all westerns, it contains its historic mishaps, it is mostly accurate and that makes it all the more amazing."

","Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday has a cult following among film fans. Watch ""Tombstone"" and see why. His Holiday -- an alcoholic, tubercular Southern aristocrat who spouts Latin in one scene and kills a man in the next --resonates even with those of us who don't like Westerns. Kilmer delivers some hilarious lines, and he plays Holiday as the dandified rapscallion we expect. But what makes this portrayal so unforgettable is that he gives us a peek into Holiday's self-destructive soul, too. Kurt Russell is wonderful and subtle as Wyatt Earp, but it's Kilmer who walks away with the movie. Surprise casting alert: Wyatt's wife, Allie, is played by Paula Malcomson, who a decade later plays Trixie on the HBO series ""Deadwood."""

What's amazing is that with all the hefty boy girl and brother stuff going on, the deepest, most moving part of the film is the love between Wyatt and Doc. As a matter of fact, even Wyatt's seeking the love of his life seems just to be the legitimate expression of his love for Doc. Val Kilmer's Doc is Bob Dylan finally showing up in the Old West -- ironic, laconic, fragile, and lovable...and just too cool for words. What satisfies in this film is that everyone in this film is over the top macho, in the most positive sense of the word. The cowboys are macho-ly bad guys, the brothers are macho-ly brothers, the wives are macho-ly wives, the actress is macho-ly woman, the coward is macho-ly cowardly, and the suggested gay actor is macho-ly suggestedly gay.

The scenes between Earp and Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) felt a bit cheesy to me, and her character just struck me as being too full of herself.

From what the history channel has taught me. This storyline is as close to life as it can get. Robert Mitchum's narration was really a great touch. The gun scene's were decent. Maybe VERY LITTLE toned down for a little less violent, more story oriented movie. Although at times it doesn't seam that way. The first few scenes were the most violent in my opinion, and some of the better gun fight scenes. The Gun Fight at the end was moderate. It seamed like it was just a lot of quickly cut chunks of film taped up as a gun fight. Boo! I'd slap the editor! But with its ALL-STAR cast. You can't loose with this movie!

But that's not to say the ladies won't like it, it's just that it's kind of testosterone laden.which rocks because it's not overdone. The dialog in the film just reeks of badassness. I can remember more quotes for this movie than almost all that I've seen, and understandably so. `I want your blood, and I want your soul..and I want 'em both right now! Don't any of you have the guts to play for blood?!' `I'll be your huckleberry.' YES. Or, `You smell that? Smells like someone died.'<br/><br/>Tombstone is an adapted story from real life events that took place before the turn of the 19th century. Of course not all of it is true as it's adapted, but it's cool to think about the fact that something very significant happened back then, enough so to be remembered 100 years later and worthy of the basis for a film.<br/><br/>The sets are really impressive here and definitely have the boom town feel to it that the creators were going for. That goes for the costumes as well. The whole atmosphere of the film is executed quite nicely and is believable. I watched the special edition disc on the dvd and was impressed by the fact that they built the entire town just for the movie, and that it wasn't just some set that's been used in other movies somewhere along the line.<br/><br/>
Tombstone never tries to be more than it is. It reaches epic status by keeping it simple. The movie is about the characters, and all are impressively created and depicted. And because of that, it is an epic for me. And epic of great acting and excellent characters. It's because of this that the movie has such a high replay value and is a wonderful edition to anyone's collection. It's a very pleasing movie experience that can be returned to time and time again.<br/><br/>An absolute must for Michael Biehn and Val Kilmer fans.<br/><br/>`Fight's not with you Holiday' `I beg to differ sir..play for blood remember?' `I was just foolin' about.' `I wasn't.' `Alright lunger.' `Say when..'"

","I rented Tombstone on DVD the other night because Roger Ebert had said something about it in his Movie Answer Man column.  I had missed it at the theater, as I suspect most of America did.  This is a pretty dang good western.  The story of the shootout at the OK Corral has been told in countless films (perhaps partly because Wyatt Earp himself lived in Hollywood during the early years of the film industry -- two of his pall bearers were Tom Mix and William S. Hart) but never quite like this. Firstly, this film uses the shootout as the beginning of the story, whereas all the other films used it as the end of the story.  Also, Doc Holliday is on the same side as the Earps throughout and is portrayed (by a pale, sweaty and shaky Val Kilmer) as an educated Southern gentleman who, after being diagnosed with tuberculosis, decides to turn his remaining days into an orgy of his three favorite pursuits: Drinking, Gambling, and Killing.  The movie even intimates that he wants very badly to be put out of his misery in a gunfight, rather than die the slow miserable death imposed on him by his disease.<br/><br/>
Kurt Russell has never been more kickass commanding as he is playing Wyatt Earp.  In a scene early on -- perhaps the most fun in the movie -- he has a confrontation with Billy Bob Thornton. Russell's steely glare and resolute bitch-slapping of Thornton establish Earp as a man to be reckoned with. I never knew Russell had it in him.  The movie itself looks great.  Lots of period detail and spectacular scenery.  The strong supporting cast includes Sam Elliott, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Terry O'Quinn, Bill Pullman, and Jason Priestley.  Especially good is Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton, who shows us equal amounts of bravado and cowardice and sweats almost as much as Doc Holliday, but out of fear, not fever.<br/><br/>Unforgiven was a better movie, but Tombstone is more fun. 8/10"

For its genre it is well done. The DVD and its surround sound track are well done, and the wide western vistas look really good on a widescreen HDTV.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton has a small role, but in a very important early scene that sets the tone for Wyatt's stay in Tombstone. Wyatt walks into a bar known for trouble and finds Thornton at a gambling table, giving all kinds of grief to the others, being an obnoxious bully. Wyatt walks up and says ""You're sitting in my place."" Incredulous, Thornton's tough guy gets up, face-to-face with Wyatt, and gets slapped. Not knowing what to do, he gets slapped harder, not realizing yet who was doing the slapping. But he sensed that he might be in over his head. Finally, Wyatt says, ""Pull your gun. Go ahead, pull it, or do you plan to stand there and bleed all over the floor."" Thornton wipes blood from his mount, backs down, and leaves, still dazed over the quick sequence of events. Wyatt then takes over the dealer's spot, agrees to 25% of the take, in return he keeps the peace in the bar."

Without question, Kurt Russell plays one of the greatest police characters in movie history.  Sam Eliott and Bill Paxton play cops just as well.  The acting of all three was superb, and I was able to identify myself with all three characters on a professional level.  I especially liked the arguments between Eliot and Russell before the gunfight.  It was a clash of differing views on law enforcement, a clash that is widespread among police.  Even better acting was provided by Val Kilmer, who played Doc Holliday.  His portrayal of the arrogant, suave Southerner was, for some reason, overlooked by the Academy Awards that year. Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn, who played the villains, probably rank as two of the most ruthless villains ever in movies.  This is a great with action, adventure, drama, romance, and some comedy.

As for the work of the actors, Val Kilmer steals the show.  He was absolutely fantastic as Doc Holliday.  He was funny and tragic at the same time and really made you believe in his relationship with Wyatt Earp.  Kurt Russell was brilliant as Wyatt Earp. In a role that could easily have been overplayed, Russell makes Wyatt very human and not as stoic as history would have you think.  Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are excellent as Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo and are both vital to the movie and plot.  Though some of the picture is historically correct, most of it is not.

"tkfor2one","Null","0","0","25 May 2002"," The Best Wyatt Earp film to date!
","Tombstone is the best of the bunch when it comes to Wyatt Earp films. The reasons are many. 1)The Look. Tombstone looks real and authentic. The dress is consistent with the time period. From the hats to the suits to the dresses. Every character looks like they just stepped out of a time machine from the last half of the 19th century. Also the exteriors and interiors are authentic. It was not filmed on a back lot somewhere or in New Mexico, but on location in southern Arizona. And last but no least the firearms and holsters were accurate in their use and appearance. Holsters were not worn down the side of the leg with a string strapped around the leg. This holster is pure Hollywood fiction popularized in the 1940's and 1950's. Wyatt Earp did not even wear a holster when he was in Tombstone. He carried his gun in the pocket of his long overcoat, which is depicted true to fact in the in the film. 2)The dialogue. The characters in tombstone use words and phrases of that time period. A good example is ""no need to go heeled to get the bulge on dub like you. The screenwriter, Kevin Jarre, (who was also the original director before he was fired) wrote a well researched script that was full of authentic words, phrases and dialogue common to late 19th century not the late 20th. 3)The story. Tombstone is not completely accurate in some of the events that it depicts. The gunfight at the ok corral was about half as long with half as many rounds fired, There was a fourth brother James who was in Tombstone but was not in the gunfight, the vendetta ride was not as long and violent as in the film, Virgel and Morgan were shot about 4 months apart, Doc Holliday died 6 years after the gunfight at the OK corral. Johnny Ringo was found dead with a bullet in his head out in the country, no one knows who killed him. The rest of the film however is fairly true to fact. Most important it accurately depicts Wyatt Earp as a man who did not back down from a fight but also did not go looking for them, as a businessman first and lawman second, and as a fiercely loyal brother and friend. 4) and lastly Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer were Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday personified. A truly great film."

They, along with Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott), come to the mining town of Tombstone to seek their fortune.  Instead, however, they wind up becoming not only gamblers but making a return as lawmen when the ruthless gang known as the Cowboys, led by the perpetually drunk Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), turn the dusty streets of Tombstone red with the blood of innocent people. Frontier justice was never like this.<br/><br/>Well directed by George Cosmatos (who helmed the infamous RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II in 1985), TOMBSTONE, like other films based on the legend (MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, HOUR OF THE GUN), sticks pretty close to the facts (**SPOILER**: the real shootout at the O.K. Corral lasted only about forty seconds, and the film is dead-on in accurately recreating that).  TOMBSTONE is further boosted by Dana Delany's efficient performance as Wyatt's future wife Josephine Marks, the excellent Bruce Broughton score, and the expansive cinematography from master cameraman William Fraker (BULLITT, ROSEMARY'S BABY).<br/><br/>TOMBSTONE proves that there is still life to be had in the western genre; it is a shame that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that."

Russell is flawless as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer, puts in the greatest performance of his life as Doc Holliday.. he is funny, moving and tragic, and steals the film away from Kurt Russell. Although I have since heard of the real events in Tombstone, and realised that these characters wre portrayed in, a very favourable light, I cannot help but feel the impact that Tombstone produces. This is thoroughly entertaining and is a good example of great story telling.  Watch it if only for Val Kilmer, even non-western fans will find it hard to flaw his performance. 9/10...Excellent adventure!"

","There are very few films that blow me away and still keep me in awe hours after watching it. Tombstone is one of the few. The action scenes were wonderfully captivating and the scenery and costumes were splendid but I believe it was the acting and the characters portrayed that hit me so hard and the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. First of all Doc was amazing and Val Kilmer should have gotten more praise for his portrayal of the quick-shooting, great-one liner Doc that I continue to adore to this day. The loyalty, friendship and brotherhood emanated between himself and Wyatt and their scenes together were just incredible. Kurt Rusell was perfect for the role of Wyatt Earp and I believe he played the part of this historical character the best out of any other actor playing the role. My favorite line in the whole flick is a quote of Doc's of course ""I got two guns one for the each of ya"". I also love it when Wyatt beats this guy, who was beating a horse and just gives him that hard look and says ""Hurts doesn't it?"" Dana Delaney was wonderful as the spirited Josephine and her scenes were all charming especially the love scenes with Wyatt. I especially love the part when he finds out she played the devil. And the crowning touch on this movie is how historically accurate it is. Excellent movie.The best western ever made (in my book). Four stars."

","This is a tremendous movie crammed with gunsmoke, romance and the full flavor of the old west. The life of the legendary lawman and his family is very interesting. Earp moves to rugged Arizona to start life over with his brothers. He proves to have a strong stature as a businessman, but can't get away from his legend or let it die. The elaborate gunfight at OK Corral lets the lead fly. Flawless camera work and lighting and talented ensemble cast will draw attention to this epic for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell is a powerful and macho Earp. This role is almost as strong as his portrayal of Elvis Presley in a TV bio-pic. Val Kilmer is excellent in the role of Doc Holiday. Probably his best job of acting ever. Sam Elliott is a standout as Virgil Earp.<br/><br/>Other fine performances come from Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston and Jason Priestly.<br/><br/>This one you can watch again and again with no fear of tiring of it.The full cast and crew are responsible for making Kevin Jarre's words come alive.

"crewJG","Null","0","0","5 November 1998"," val kilmer's performance
","In this viewer's eyes, Tombstone was Val Kilmer's finest performance to date. He was almost chameleon-like in that the viewer saw very little of Val in Doc. The deadly gentleman could not be played by anyone better.  Kilmer's off-screen antics are no secret, but his on-screen performances are most always electrifying. Having Kilmer's Doc Holliday in a mind set makes seeing Dennis Quaid or Kirk Douglas portrayal of the gunslinger almost painful. Not that these actors are of second rate caliber, but they simply can not hold a candle to Val's representation.  With such memorable lines as ""i'm your huckleberry,"" ""I'm dying, how are you?"", and ""Oh, Johnny. I apologize, I forgot you were there. You may go now,"" left an imprint on my mind and I can recall most if not all of Val Kilmer's lines from Tombstone.  The fact that Kilmer was not even nominated for an Academy Award is a travesty in and of itself. I do not recall who won the award for best supporting actor in 1993, but whoever received the gold surely did not deserve to. I do not believe I have ever seen a performance quite as memorable as that of Val Kilmer's John ""Doc"" Holliday, and if anyone can, well ""you're a daisy if you do."" -CrewJG"

"altanic","Null","0","0","25 January 2001"," good movie, though it has it's faults
","I like this movie, and I also bought it soon after watching it for the first time.  It's a good western yarn with a lot of great performances.  Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday in this movie will be remembered by anybody, even if you hated the rest of the movie.  Kurt Russell and Sam Elliot do pretty good jobs playing their characters as well.(well, Sam Elliot just has to do what he normally does and he seems like pretty good redneck.. hehe :-)<br/><br/>*slight scene spoilers follow*<br/><br/>But as much as I like this movie, it seems to lose some momentum after the train station scene.  I think the action was intended to pick up here, but it seems the whole mood of the movie is kind of derailed instead.  Those horse-chasing shots at the end with the heroes blasting their guns off just don't work for me.  I would much rather have seen more ambush/dig-in-and-shoot-it-out scenes than all those generic chases.  I realize gun-fights are never as glamorous as they make them in movies, so why not have a sloppy, ugly, lucky to make it out kind of scene. (I guess the scene where Curly Bill gets whacked is kind of what I mean, but it still goes off too smoothly)<br/><br/>But I still watch this movie every now and then.  I can almost guarantee that you'll love Kilmer's Doc Holliday role.  He's got some of the best lines in this movie and he nails them too.  In my opinion it's not the best western ever made(GoodBadUgly is) but Tombstone is a pretty good movie and I'd recommend it to anybody who thinks they might like westerns even just a bit."

I watched a show on Earpp's life before going to this movie, and it's script is historically close.  The unbelievable events in this movie is true, and life, sometimes, is more bazaar then fiction.  The way this story is crafted, and the director's feel for the era is well executed.  The movie left a feeling of being educated and entertained at the same time."
"Antithesys","8","0","0","26 December 2000"," I got two guns - one fer each o' ya!
","Tombstone is pretty darn good; it's a kind of epic story, a great example of post-modern Western storytelling in the same vein as Unforgiven, portraying the Old West as a strange mixture of the best and worst of humanity, sometimes clean, civilized and chivalrous, sometimes harsh, filthy and barbaric. It has a good story, although it runs a little too long, and the direction and cinematography is splendid. <br/><br/>But Tombstone is a great film because of its cast, especially one Val Kilmer, who turns in the best performance of his career as Doc Holliday, a legend with both the pistol and the shotglass. I can count at least two dozen of Holliday's lines that qualify as classics (""Maybe poker's not your game. I know! Let's have a spelling contest!""). Kilmer's delivery is the real key, and he gives a memorable performance that really carries the film, and makes Tombstone not just a good drama but an excellent entertainment."

","This is Val's finest hour, no doubt about this. Non-Western and non-Kilmer fans still are amazed at his performance. Val chews the scenery, digests the scenery....you get the picture. His lack of an Oscar is yet another in the long litany of Academy Award buffoonery. The scenes where he confronts Michael Biehn are highly charged: Biehn looks at Kilmer and sees his future, and it frightens him. The film suffers in terms of continuity, but a lot of the continuity was left on the cutting-room floor: the relationship between Billy Zane and Jason Priestly; and scenes between Kilmer and Joanna Pacula, etc. Hopefully these scenes will be in the inevitable ""director's cut"" DVD. This version will hopefully showcase the secondary actors such as the excellent Stephen Lang, and of course more of Val Kilmer! Too bad that his later career has been, shall we say, somewhat erractic ( Dr.Moreau....AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!)"

","I like it, but more than it actually deserves. The acting by the entire cast is very good. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt very well. Dana Delaney is stunningly beautiful and Val Kilmer's performance as the seriously ill Doc Holliday is brilliant. But the best performance is by Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo. He was convincing and made me undeerstand that Johnny Ringo was totally evil. The character of Curly Bill Brocious was poorly written in that he chuckled too much to be taken seriously. I believe the film begins to go downhill a bit at the end. The part where US Marshall Earp, Doc and his Deputies finally mop up the Cowboys is just a little too neat, too choreographed. There was a bit too much showmanship there. The final cleanup of the cowboys was actually a difficult, bloody process. The cowboys didn't give up since they knew they'd be hanged if they did. Consequently, most of them had to be hunted down individually. So for that lapse in the ending, I dropped it to a 7. The rest of the film is absolutely excellent, however!"

"jimhenderson","Null","0","0","12 June 2000"," A great movie that is more realistic then you think!
","This movie is most often criticized for being a typical `Hollywood' misinterpretation of historical fact and seriously distorts the legend of Wyatt Earp and Tombstone.  It is often quoted that `My Daugter Clemitine' or `Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' were better movies.   In actual fact Tombstone was the most accurate description of the events that took place in Tombstone Arizona in 1880  1882 then any movie before it.   A number of Hollywood liberties were taken with the myth but they were made in the interest of making the story more entertaining and broadly appealing then a serious lack of respect for the actual history. Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, did a lot of research on the legend of Tombstone and the Earps involvement resulting in most of the main plot points being historically correct.<br/><br/>The gunfight near the OK Corral was the most accurate put on screen.  If you use the trials - The Earps (Virg and Morgan did not attend because of their wounds) and Holliday were arrested two days after the fight - eye witness accounts plus local newspaper accounts following the event you would find that this was very close to the way that it actually happened.  It was also why they were found not guilty of murder.<br/><br/>You will find compromises made to make it a more entertaining movie but even when doing so subtle things were done to increase the historical validity of the film.  For instance, Virgil and Morgan were not shot on the same night (a plot point combined to keep the film moving) but as an example of a subtle point related to the history  Morgan's dog was at the scene of the shooting and was howling while he lay dying on the pool table (A newspaper article the next day described the scene of death and mentioned the loyal dog whining for his master).  There are tonnes of little subtle things done like this that point to the historical record of events.<br/><br/>Another criticism is the relationship between Josie and Wyatt seemed to be direct Hollywood manipulation with the throwing in of a love interest. Again, this actually happened.  Tombstone is where Wyatt met Josie,  Johnny Behan was her original boyfriend, and Wyatt's relationship with her did add tension to the situation (Behan was a supporter of the Cowboys) and also complicated the troubles Wyatt had with Mattie during this period.   Also based on personal accounts about the kind of person Josie was, I felt Dana Delaney did a good job portraying Josie's personality accurately.<br/><br/>Even some of the questionable events can be argued to be real.  For instance, in 1883 Johnny Ringo was found dead under an oak tree with a bullet wound to the head.  He didn't have his boots on and his gunbelt was on upside down.  It was of wide belief at the time that he committed suicide but some facts refute this.  The main of which is his wound did not show any signs (flash burns) one would normally find when holding a pistol to your head.  Ringo and Doc did hate each other and there were numerous accounts of run ins with each other while Doc was in Tombstone.  It is agreed that Doc often said he didn't want to die with his boots off (meaning while he was asleep) and with his TB wanted to go out with a blaze of glory.  Again, the subtle use of dialogue here is evident.  Doc's referral to `Daisy' which in those days meant `a person of high reputation' was used to communicate this thought.  At the Ok Corral one of the Clanton/Mclaurys says `I have you now' and Val Kilmers response `You're a daisy if you do'.  After shooting Ringo he says `Your no daisy' referring to his disappointment in not being killed. So is Jarre incorrect in showing Doc Holliday as the killer of Johnny Ringo?  Maybe so, maybe not, but again you can see the attention to detail that lies just below the surface, with a thorough understanding of the facts that allows for some educated guesses around some of the more mysterious and unexplained events of the time.<br/><br/>In terms of the facts, the only thing missing in my opinion is the under representation of the political undertones that existed in the 1880's Tombstone.  The representation of the cowboys' as a gang of criminals instead of a gang of democratic (political affiliation) ruralistic cattle herders who were maybe a little more grey then black in terms of crime, and their confrontation with the silver mining republican capitalists that Wyatt Earp was paid to protect.  These tensions (personified in number of political battles  e.g. The Earps and Holliday were implicated by the Cowboys to be responsible for the killing of a stage driver in a botched hold up when the facts clearly showed that the Cowboys were behind it) were what ultimately led to the showdown near the OK Corral though the events of Ike Clanton from the night before were correct (Most of the participants in the gunfight did play poker the night before!)<br/><br/>The bottom line is this is a good film with some excellent performances. It is in fact closer to the truth then many of its predecessors and is much better scripted movie then Wyatt Earp, which should have been a documentary. Kurt Russel's Wyatt Earp is dead on in retrospect to the facts given by people who knew him and Val Kilmers Doc is the best ever done.    The supporting cast is good at capturing the nature of their real life characters.  Despite what has been said about the ridiculousness of the moustaches and costumes, they were true to what was the fashion in 1880 - 1883 Tombstone.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a fun filled entertaining movie that is closer to the truth then any other movie to come out of Hollywood on the subject.  In fact, this maybe why there are some Western fans who did not like this movie, maybe it was too much based on reality."

","Even if you're not at all familiar with the Wyatt Earp legend, or with Westerns particularly, this remarkable film can easily draw you in to an obsession with both.  The depiction of the time and place seems thoroughly authentic, and the acting is top-class - while Kurt Russell makes a fine central character, Val Kilmer displays effortless cool as Doc Holliday, and Michael Biehn is suitably menacing as gunslinger Johnny Ringo.  The fabulous script allows every actor to shine, and many of Doc's lines especially will stick in your mind, such as ""I'm your huckleberry"" and ""Isn't that a daisy?""<br/><br/>My only criticism would have to be the love story in this film - it just doesn't work.

Wyatt's relationship with the actress is weak, but that can be forgiven, as it is a subplot. What begged to be developed is the relationship between Wyatt and Doc, the central core of this story that everything revolved around (or should have). Why did Doc and Wyatt become friends, what drew them together - nothing is explained. That said, Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc.

The chilling verbal confrontation between him and Ringo (played sadistically TO THE HILT by Michael Biehn, later Kyle in The Terminator), which was done in Latin, is one of the film's best scenes.<br/><br/>And although Kilmer steals every scene he is in, you cannot overlook Kurt Russell as Earp (who else besides Jodie Foster has made such a successful transition from child to adult roles?), Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton, as Earp's brothers, Dana Dulaney as Earp's love interest, Billy Zane (is there anything that he is not good in?) and a surprising Jason Priestly from 90210.  Powers Booth is a likeable villain, although cold-blooded and vicious.<br/><br/>So the movie isn't historically accurate down to every last detail.  Well neither was Titantic.  So what?

The movie is actually a lot more clever and deep than it might appear at first.

At the end, we see a glimpse of Doc Holiday's motivation.  Having lost the only thing that he ever wanted, and dying besides, what does it matter that he acts so recklessly?  It doesn't - he really has nothing to lose.  The similarity of Johnny and Holliday - both are reckless, both great gunslingers, both ""educated men"" - is neat.  And the word-off in Latin is unique to all films.   I also believe many critics miss the entire point of this movie - it's really about friendship and the western is just there as a vehicle.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Anyway this movie is in my top10.

","What were the full time critics on about?  This is a really good picture, full of interesting characters and blessed with some clever scripting by a writer who has studied the period.  When will the people in the film industry realise that films should be entertaining.  Give me a film like this over Costners Wyatt any day. Set piece encounters abound and are original.  I can't remember any other film where gunfighters square off by quoting Latin at each other.  Or where some cracker barrel philosophy is so well done.  The whole enterprise reeks of the atmosphere of the old west. Kurt Russell makes a good Earp and even looks like the real man.  For a change, the two Earp brothers have life breathed into them by the actors and Val Kilmer puts in an excellent performance as Doc Holliday.  This is not a perfect film though.  The romance between Wyatt and the actress fails dismally to interest (maybe some of it was lost on the cutting room floor) and the events following the Earps departure from Tombstone are rushed and patchy as if the film was finished in a rush.  What is left is still a good picture! Wyatts slow despair,  Doc's plummy language, Johnny Ringos soulless killer, the reckless Curly Bill and the music. Bruce Broughtons score is a pleasure to listen to and progresses with the storyline.  Although one very good piece of music is thrown away on the Earps arrival/departure vis Tombstone, Wyatts theme develops slowly as the luckless man is drawn inevitably toward the very destiny he fears and despises.  Finally, the theme blares forth in all its tragic splendour as a now lonely figure of Wyatt Earp stands alone in the midst of the carnage of the OK Corral, outlined against a western sky where even the clouds draw attention to him. Great! The relationship between the two killers Holliday and Ringo is excellent, with a slightly unsettled Ringo trying to handle the fact that he is being stalked ""Let's play for blood!"". If more westerns had been like this the genre would not be unpopular today."

","I rate this as the best Wyatt Earp movie as far as combining entertainment with historical accuracy.  The gunfight ""on the same block as OK Corral"" had many witnesses and is as well documented as any 30 second event with a lot of shooting can be.  I saw nothing in the film that contradicted written reports or court records.  The aftermath of the gunfight has always been open to controversy and the events in the movie, with the exception of Ringo's fate, are not outlandish.  Costner's Earp may have been closer to the true Earp persona, but it's just not as entertaining.  Kilmer, as mentioned by many, is great.  His relationship to Wyatt is just as touching but not nearly so somber and melancholy as the Costner--Quaid one.  For my money, Sam Elliott nearly steals the movie.  There will never be a better Virgil. This film is right up there with Unforgiven and Silverado as one of the best of the modern westerns."

","I ""accidentally"" watched this movie when I pushed the wrong button in selecting a movie at a hotel in Reno, Nevada.  What a great bit of serendipity!  This movie is completely entertaining.  Men like it, women like it, people of all ages like it. Not a typical fan of Westerns, this one excelled, especially in the hilarious bits of humor given to the fabulous Val Kilmer.  (I was truly shocked when he was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor - at least at the Golden Globes - but, alas, his reputation precedes him.)  Nevertheless, the analogy he gives to Big Kate, ""then again, you may be the AntiChrist"" is classic! There are so many other fabulous lines.  Another highly appealing aspect to Kilmer's Holliday is his slightly effeminate appearance which masked a very confident machismo - and - the way Holliday is perceived as an independent loner, yet lets Wyatt in on the fact that he has been Holliday's best friend.  The desire to still maintain his manly dignity while dying with his friend at his side truly moved me to tears. I paraphrase, ""Wyatt, if you have ever cared for me... leave now."" Whoa!  So good, so good.  Kilmer was truly a standout in this movie.  He personified Doc Holliday.  Great movie - highly recommended!"

Moreover, unlike the atrocious ""Wyatt Earp,"" we get a suspenseful, actionpacked and COHERENT storyline. We discover ""the Clanton gang"" of earlier films was actually a huge gang (over 100) of outlaws known as ""the cowboys.""  We learn that Virgil, not Wyatt is the real instigator behind the ""gunfight at the OK Corral and Wyatt a reluctant participant.""  That gunfight is given its proper perspective rather than being the dominant event in ""Tombstone.""  The male cast is mostly extremely good, particularly Val Kilmer (Holliday), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Powers Boothe (Brocius) and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo). Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Joanna Pacula (Kate Elder), the female cast is pretty colorless. Especially disappointing is Dana Delaney as Josephine Marcus. There's nothing flat about Delaney, except her acting here.  One wishes, Joanna Going (""Wyatt Earp"") had performed the role in this movie. Nevertheless, it's a mild disappointment in a mostly terrific movie.<br/><br/>George P. Cosmatos' director's  cut is a BIG improvement over the original theatrical release.  Although only four minutes longer, his version provides much better context and continuity, particularly during the ""reckoning "" portion. of the movie.  I would give the theatrical version a ""high 7"", while the director's cut is clearly a ""9"".<br/><br/>The VISTA series DVDs comes with a bonus disk with lots of great features and a reproduction map of the OK corral drawn by Wyatt Earp in 1919.

The site of the shootout is not true to history, which is common in this genre.  After the Earp's were shot, the demise of the Cowboys was creatively characterized. In reality, Earp actually killed Johnny Ringo with a rifle shot at about 100 yards as Ringo was attempting to flee.  He did shoot him in the head, and laid him up against an oak tree, which was accurately represented in the movie.  All in all, it is probably the most entertaining and true-to-form movie on the Wyatt Earp saga yet to be made, including Costner's boring movie: Wyatt Earp.  Hope you enjoy it.

","""Tombstone"" deals with the adventures of Wyatt Earp and his brothers covering a two and one half year period. It starts with Wyatt (Kurt Russell) and his two brothers (Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton) arriving in Tombstone to seek their fortune. Subsequent events put badges back on the Earps and lead to the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral. The last third of the film deals with Wyatt's revenge on the baddies, known as ""The Cowboys"".<br/><br/> Director George P. Cosmatos gives us a visually stunning film. From the spectacular sunsets/sunrises to the real lightning flashes and authentic settings and costumes. Most of the male actors are hidden under real beards and handle bar moustaches they grew which were common at the time of the story.<br/><br/> The performances are excellent all around. Russell makes an excellent Wyatt. The relationship between Wyatt his brothers and Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) are developed in detail. Kilmer plays Holiday as a former southern aristocrat complete with accent and mannerisms. Joanna Pacula plays his girlfriend. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is good as Wyatt's drug addicted first wife and Dana Delaney looks stunning as the ""other woman"".<br/><br/>  Heading up the villains are Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, Michael Biehn as Ringo and Stephen Lang and Thomas Haden Church as the Clantons. Wyatt Earp's grandson Wyatt Earp III plays Billy Claiborne. Veteran western performer Harry Carey Jr. does a nice turn as the town marshal and Buck Taylor (of ""Gunsmoke"" fame) plays one of Wyatt's marshals. Charlton Heston puts in a cameo as a rancher and look for Billy Bob Thornton as a saloon bully early in the film.<br/><br/> ""Tombstone"" ranks in my opinion, as the best and most accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga ever filmed. Try and catch the director's cut (at 134 minutes) which restores many of the cut sequences from the original version and serves to provide further clarification to the development of the characters and their relationships with one another."

","This movie, while maybe not entirely correct, is good old fashioned entertainment.  Rarely, does a film come a long that is so much fun to watch, that it will not only please fans of the genre, but nonfans as well. In all honesty, I have never known one person who did not like this movie. While the director keeps things tight and handles his action scenes like a pro, I believe it's the cast that really made this one shine.  Kurt Russell was great as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer delivered the performance of his career as Doc Holiday.  My personal favorite was Powers Boothe as the menacing (but funny) Curly Bill Brosis.  Almost every line out of his mouth had me in stitches and his sneering facial expressions are priceless. <br/><br/>

"bigpurplebear","Null","0","0","18 November 2001"," At last, the movie that demythologizes Wyatt Earp
","Wyatt Earp comes to Tombstone to establish a business with his brothers Virgil and Morgan.  He's given up law enforcement, he's tired of being poor, and he's reasonably content in his common-law relationship with a laudanum-addicted ex prostitute.  He basically wants to get ahead by getting along. So he thinks. Brother Virgil (Sam Elliott at his considerable best) and adventuress Josephine Marcus (slyly seductive Dana Delany) soon pull him into twin maelstroms which force him to confront questions of loyalty, honor, love and happiness -- all questions which Wyatt would just as happily avoid. But he can't dodge them.  And so the events of director George Cosmatos' definitive ""Tombstone"" unfold. Wyatt, as here presented (and in contrast to the usually iconic treatment) is not ""the fastest gun in the west.""  He's good but, as he verifies with Doc Holliday (Val Kylmer in a landmark performance), he probably can't take Johnny Ringo. The 'gunfight at the O.K. Corral,' as here presented (and again in contrast to the usual treatment), is not a climactic resolution; with superb pacing in the circumstances leading up to it, it's depicted -- accurately -- as a vicious 30-second streetfight which nobody wanted, which resolved absolutely nothing, and out of which many of the ensuing events of ""Tombstone"" take their impetus. Wyatt Earp has come down to us through the years as a larger-than-life icon, both in literature and in movies/TV -- not to mention the tourist industry in present-day Tombstone, AZ, which focuses primarily on those 30 seconds on a chilly October afternoon in 1881.  He has been portrayed, alternately, as a stalwart, grim-faced pillar of law enforcement, or as a sham. Director George Cosmatos here chooses to present him, for once, as something infinitely more complex: a human being. And, in a surprisingly well-crafted performance by Kurt Russell, he does it exceedingly well."

Dana Delaney was perfect as Josephine, although I have to admit the constant wagging of her head annoyed me a bit. The one major flaw in this movie is that at the very end, as Wyatt and Josephine are dancing in the snow, the music is drowned out after three seconds as the final narration begins. They should have let the music carry on for a bit. But Hey Ho. Rent it, buy it, watch it. Let yourself be immersed in this movie. It will make you feel great.

","Aside from reading a lot about Doc Holliday, I have also been in touch with the Doc Holliday Society in Griffin, Georgia, which hosts the Doc Holliday Days every August.  Tombstone was a highly accurate depiction of the characters and events.  Except for some blatant fiction (ie, Doc and Johnny Ringo finally shooting it out in the end), most of the other events -- large and small -- actually happened.  Val Kilmer did the best job ever done of portraying Doc, who was a charming, educated, well-bred southern aristocrat, was witty and fun to be around, was supremely deadly when aroused, and was an absolutely fearless gunfighter and killer.  However, his cousins in Griffin insist he killed only one man, and that was in the OK Corral.  I have to check that out.  Although he was not a good shot, which Wyatt Earp was, Doc was lightning fast on the draw, which Wyatt Earp was not.  At 5'10"", 160 pounds, he usually carried a nickle-plated revolver, a derringer, and a small knife slung down his back on a string.  He was a splendid figure of a man, went impeccably dressed and groomed at all times, wore well-tailored suits, and sometimes carried a cane. Dennis Quaid in Wyatt Earp LOOKED more like the Doc of the 1880's -- emaciated, tubercular, alcoholic; but Val Kilmer captured Doc's three-dimensional personality."
"ccthemovieman-1","5","6","20","30 August 2006"," Entertaining But Way Too Prejudiced & Profane
","Most people consider this the best Wyatt Earp story ever put on film, and there have been a half dozen. I don't put in that category for personal reasons: I took offense at the blatant anti-religious tone of the movie. I don't to hear Earp (Kurt Russell) tell us he's an atheist, somewhat mock those who do believe, all the while using the Lord's name in vain frequently, nor did I need to hear the latter over 25 total times in this movie, which is almost 25 times more than any other Earp film. This kind of bias was not needed in the story. What was the purpose? Answer - religious prejudice in films is so strong screenwriters apparently can't help but put it in everyone's face, even if it doesn't fit in the storyline.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's extremely entertaining and Val Kilmer's portrayal of ""Doc"" Holliday"" is still the best-ever. He is the star of this movie in my opinion, and I'm not alone in that view. I think Kilmer is an underrated actor, in the first place.<br/><br/>There are lots of well-known actors in here and the story moves extremely well with one interesting scene after another. It's just too bad they had to include all that blasphemy. I might feel different about it instead of preferring Kevin Costner's version of ""Wyatt Earp."""

","******WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE******<br/><br/>I live a hour from Tombstone and have been there several times and I have been at the gun site. A relative of Ike Clanton still runs a business there. I know a little bit about the history of the gun fight and of the circumstances that lead up to the fight.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed in the many big historical inaccuracies in the movie. I was hoping it would be the first movie to truly show what actually happened, but it didn't. That being said, the actual gun fight in the movie was pretty close to what actually happened, so that pulled the movie back up a little.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointed was how Val played Doc Holliday. I don't know what he was thinking when he decided to play him as a kind of ""dandy boy"". Doc Holliday was a pretty tough character in real life and certainly wasn't a sissy. And they really lessened the real life role of ""Big Nosed Kate"" in the movie. She wan't some nobody bar girl in real life.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't like how they portrayed Wyatt at all. They made it look like he was a fairly passive player in all this and didn't want to get involved in enforcing anything, which is absurd. He was a very experienced lawman in real life. What were they thinking in portraying him like this? Then they swung the pendulum the other way by making it look like he went out and killed about 30 cowboys - it was only 3. They also had Doc killing Ringo, but it was actually Wyatt that killed him.<br/><br/>In the movie Wyatt didn't see Curly kill White, but in real life he did and even testified in Curly's behalf that it was an accident. Before White died he even said it was an accident.<br/><br/>And for some reason they portrayed Josephine as some high class entertainer, when in actuality she was a low class prostitute.<br/><br/>There are many other little incorrect representations of facts. One is concerning the timing of when Morgan arrived to Tombstone. 3 of the brothers did arrive in Tombstone at the same time, but it was Wyatt, Virgil, and James that arrived on the same day - Morgan arrived there later.<br/><br/>And Virgil was made a US Marshall before they even arrived in Tombstone. In the movie they made it look like he wasn't even a lawman when they got there.<br/><br/>I think if someone made a movie that more historically accurate, it would be even more interesting than anything they have done so far, so am hoping one day that will happen, but it didn't happen with this movie. But still I think it is a pretty good movie. It would have been a great movie if they would have portrayed Wyatt and Doc a little more realistically."

"van_ecko","5","2","5","3 November 2005"," Kilmer shines, the movie doesn't
","Tombstone suffers from the weight of its cast. Including all that star power costs money, and in order to ensure a good ROI on such films you can count on the producers to gut the script of any intriguing or complex character development. The good guys will be good and the bad guys will be bad. The only morally gray area in the film is Wyatt Earp's extra-marital affair with Dana Delany's character and even that apparent stain on his reputation is rendered acceptable by portraying his wife as a self-absorbed drug addict. <br/><br/>The only interesting aspect of the movie is Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. He steals every scene he's in and his sardonic delivery of lines works perfectly because he knows, as well as the audience does, that he can back it up with his pistol if need be. <br/><br/>The rest of the acting is ho-hum. Michael Biehn does an admirable job as the evil sharpshooter Johnny Ringo but he's not given enough opportunities. In my opinion the movie would've benefited from more Holliday/Ringo scenes. Their interactions were far more interesting than the pitiful clash between Wyatt and Curly Bill. In fact the final duel between Wyatt and CB just might be one of the most anti-climactic scenes in cinematic history. I've had more emotional moments brushing my teeth.<br/><br/>And poor Kurt Russell demonstrates his inability to be a real leading man. His attempts at manifesting his internal struggles (pacified retiree vs. ruthless lawman and committed husband vs. adulterer) never quite hit the mark. It's clear that he's better suited to roles such as Big Trouble in Little China and Tango and Cash in which he's asked to do nothing more than look tough and kick ass.<br/><br/>Tombstone is worth watching just to see Kilmer's performance, but calling this ""one of the greatest westerns ever made"" is a bit of a stretch. Of the recent western revival films, Unforgiven was much better."

","I watched this right after having seen most of ""Wyatt Earp"" on TV, and I gotta say, that movie beats the hell out of this one, even *with* Kevin Costner.  Whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is a movie about the legend of the man, ""Tombstone"" is a dumbed-down Hollywood depiction of one instance in the West that happens to revolve centrally around that man.  Most everything that happens in ""Tombstone"", from the very first scene with ""the Cowboys"", is stylized to the Hollywood convention; ""Wyatt Earp"" presents its story in a much more realistic manner.  Everything in it feels more down-to-earth. People seem to react more in the way real people would.  This film comes across as too contrived.  The best thing about it is Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, which I think I like a little more than Dennis Quaid's in WE, but he was quite good as well.  The facts that I've read seem to line up more with WE, too, so I'd recommend skipping this one and seeing that."

It aims for the epic and it looks great, (William Fraker was the DoP), but the director, George P. Cosmatos wasn't able to tie it all together and it's poorly written by Kevin Jarre. You get the impression that someone, (the director, the writer, both?), thought they were making the greatest western of them all, the one that would put all other epic westerns in the shade, even down to casting Charlton Heston in a tiny role and getting Robert Mitchum to do the narration but this is a classic example of overwhelming ambition operating in a vacuum. Earp is Kurt Russell, who's barely adequate in the role and a pasty-faced Val Kilmer isn't even that as Doc Holliday.

"MartinHafer","8","1","2","12 February 2020"," While it still promotes some of the old west myths, it's far more accurate than most westerns.
","In movie westerns, there were shootouts all the time, Indian attacks and chaos. Well, this is true...in films. But in reality, the west was not so lawless and things like the shootout at the OK Corral were the exception rather than the rule. So, when you watch ""Tombstone"" understand that in many ways it is more historically accurate than most westerns but it still presents an image of western life that isn't really true....at least not for the average person living out west back in the day. So, when you watch the movie, just understand that it represents an exception...not the rule. And, while this might surprise you, the famed shootout wasn't even seen as anything that important when it happened...and it was only because of Wyatt Earp's publicizing it so much in the 1920s and 30s that we think it was some big to do today.<br/><br/>The film is a modern and more adult version of a western. There is a LOT of realistic blood and gore...which there would have been in shootouts (WHEN and IF they occurred). It's certainly NOT a film for kids and is one I recommend but only for adults who know what they're getting into...it's unrelentingly tough and violent. This is much unlike other versions of the story (such as ""My Darling Clementine"" and ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"")...and for added realism, Doc Holliday looks awful...which he should have looked like since he was dying from Tuberculosis.

","Supposedly the original script of Tombstone had fully fleshed out lives and motives for even the smallest of secondary characters but which had to be cut for budgetary and time constraints. But in Fraker's dusty, deep focus shots of the bustling western town we get an inkling of this ideal anyway. The church sits in centre background like it did in My Darling Clementine, but here it is not a redemptive, restorative symbol and instead something to be burnt down and cursed. Townsfolk mill about in the distance, on foot and on horseback, and shootings erupt and cease fire like they are an everyday occurrence. There are those classical wide shots of posses riding furiously across the everlong plains, and those sunset silhouettes of caravan travel (that usual motif of the death of the west, the steam engine, not yet appearing). And who knows how long the crew had to wait to capture those shots of the red scarf billowing in the wind of the lightning storm in that frightful ambush? <br/><br/>What better to play over the closing credits then the best sequence of the film, where the four 'tall drink of waters' approach the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. They are dressed in black, and stride so confidently like the role of bringers of death that they have taken up, like undertakers ready to their duty (the thespian's description is rather apt). We know from their moustaches their history easily; Sam Elliot's iconic weathered one, grey with age and experience and good intentions (we react exactly as he does to a mother's scar). Paxton's thinner, younger one, who is most obviously the only of the brothers to not have killed a man. And Russell's whose is thick and in its prime, but reluctant and looking for a new life. Cosmatos (in reality Russell) takes his cues from Leone in the climatic build-up to the shoot-out. <br/><br/>But the best performance undoubtedly belongs to Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, who is electric as the long-time friend of Wyatt Earp. His tuberculosis does not hinder him; it in fact makes his sweaty face and his steady drawl even more menacing along with his eyes that seem alive in contrast. His gaze is steely and his wit unmatched - we cheer along with the bar's patrons when he mocks Ringo's quick-fast skills with the pistol with his drinking cup. And we know exactly where his loyalties and intentions lie when he fiercely objects to Wyatt's claim that he has no business here: he has not many friends, but once gaining that title it is for life. <br/><br/>There's a curious element that goes mostly unexplored here. These men are more concerned with gambling and money and guns than they are with the arts - Cowboys shooting at a stage performance manages to be comedic and frightening at the same time. And in a symbolic blow, Mr Fabian falls later to more fatal shots, but Josephine is hurriedly moves on to the next arc of her life. Not even the gorgeous Dana Delany and her little shake of the head as she proclaims upon seeing Wyatt for the first time ""I want one"" can really save this subplot from veering into Hollywood clichÃ©; it seems a little too coincidental for them to bump into each for a flirtatious horse ride and picnic, and the ending is too cheesy on the backdrop of such dramatic events (the director's cut ties up some loose ends, including the fates of Big Nose Kate and Mattie Blaylock). And some of the action sequence are a little sloppy and rushed - the river's end for Curly Bill, and the montages of the posse finishing off the Cowboys. But of course right on cue, the credits remind us how good it is at its best."
"classicsoncall","10","1","2","30 July 2010"," ""If we're gonna have a future in this town, it's gotta have some law and order"".
","I'll get on a roll every now and then, and right now I'm into the Earps and the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Actually I'm coming back to the subject having watched 1994's ""Wyatt Earp:Return to Tombstone"" last week, which in turn caused me to do some more reading and research on the topic. Both movies actually get a lot of the history of the Earp Brothers down pretty accurately, right down to some of the nuances that led to the famous gunfight. Like Wyatt Earp bumping into Tom McLaury coming out of The Oriental, and cold cocking him to provoke a confrontation. There were a lot of those historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the story, so that if you learned about them ahead of time, you would be even more intrigued by the film.<br/><br/>That wasn't the case the first time I saw this picture when it came out in 1993. Back then, this was purely escapist entertainment, and the story of the OK Corral was just another fuzzy piece of Western history. But watching today, there's a lot about that period of the early 1880's that comes into focus under director George Cosmatos' discerning eye. If you're a Wyatt Earp fan, (and I am), and watch the picture from a completely neutral perspective, it becomes pretty evident that the Earp Brothers formed their own version of a protection racket once they got a foothold in Tombstone. With no more than a blistering confrontation with Ed Bailey (Frank Stallone) - ""You gonna do somethin' or just stand there and bleed?"" - Wyatt picks up a quarter interest in the Oriental. That kind of intimidation gained the Earps a reputation that quickly earned them a financial stake in virtually all the gambling and prostitution the town had to offer.<br/><br/>On the opposite side of course were the Cowboys. The opening narration to the picture might have gone a bit overboard with their description as the first instance of organized crime in the country. Actually, the Cowboys depended on a rather loose association based on business interests and family affiliation, along with personal friendships. In 1881, the Clantons were rather large landowners who derived much of their income from cattle rustling. The citizens of Tombstone were somewhat divided in their opinion of the Earps and the Cowboys, because even though they were a rowdy bunch, the Cowboys spent their money freely throughout the town. It wasn't surprising then, that elements would seek revenge on the Earps after the gunfight and trial.<br/><br/>But enough of the history. One of the things that I had forgotten all about was the opening sequence with Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Eight years earlier, Clint Eastwood built a movie narrative around Revelations 6, Verse 8 in ""Pale Rider"" - ""And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on his back was Death, and Hell followed with him"". I'm somewhat surprised the picture used virtually the same theme to kick off this picture. Johnny Ringo goes on to effect his own demonic influence throughout the story, but I wonder now whether it's more intriguing to consider Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday as the real pale rider of the story. Racked by tuberculosis, Kilmer gradually transforms his character into a deathlike spectre who faces Ringo in a final throw down that was pre-ordained. But I have to say, their initial meeting in The Oriental ranks right up there as one of the most memorable scenes in movie Westerns. Kilmer's cup twirl was an inspired piece of writing and acting brilliance.<br/><br/>As for the fabled gunfight, the story gets it right once again (for the most part). The McLaury's and Billy Clanton died, Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran off, while Morgan and Virgil Earp were severely wounded. Doc Holliday took a bullet to the hip, and Wyatt came away unscathed. I counted over fifty rounds fired in the picture against history's account of roughly thirty one shots fired, nevertheless, it was all over pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Dispensing with the Spicer trial that found Wyatt and Doc cleared of murder charges, the events that follow wind up economically compressed for time. With Virgil (Sam Elliott) once again severely shot and wounded, and Morgan (Bill Paxton) murdered, Wyatt and Doc embark on a lesser known facet of Tombstone history, the Earp Vendetta Ride. With a loyal group of followers, Wyatt and Doc sought revenge on those they considered responsible for the attacks on the Earps. Historically, Johnny Ringo met his demise during this period, though the circumstances of his death is open to wide speculation, one of which is the version offered here.<br/><br/>Although they maintained contact following the vendetta ride, Wyatt and Doc Holliday basically went their separate ways, so the scene at the Glenwood Springs Sanatorium is the film's final attempt to elicit some genuine emotion from the players and the viewer. I'll let them get away with that, as every film takes some license with history. It's the picture's last chance to put the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday relationship into perspective, as reflecting on Doc's words earlier in the film states it best - ""Wyatt Earp is my friend""."
"Squonkamatic","7","1","2","2 September 2009"," Still Quite Remarkable
","Not sure how it happened but somehow I ended up reading about one of my favorite American anti-heroes, Doc Holliday, the other weekend and by golly I was inspired to dig out my tape of TOMBSTONE. And gosh darnit this is still a very enjoyable modern day western, with a fabulous cast, some great laugh out loud moments and a sly sense of humor that sets it apart from some of it's more lead-footed contemporaries.<br/><br/>It's far from a perfect film. Kurt Russell isn't quite larger-than-life enough for Wyatt Earp (he's still the COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES guy, even thirty five years later), the screenplay & cinematography is hit or miss in spots. The music is stirring at the right moments but doesn't have the resonance of something like Walter Hill's THE LONG RIDERS -- still my personal favorite of the modern era westerns -- nor the novelty of a good old spaghetti western score.<br/><br/>The comparison to spaghetti westerns is inevitable, as far as I can see, mostly because TOMBSTONE is a cartoon of sorts. A graphic novel for grown-ups that just happens to use the legend of the Gunfight at O.K. Corral as it's departure point. It's colorful, bloody, bombastic, funny, pop oriented, and yet it has some very memorable moments that are perhaps more important than the work as a whole. Westerns in general are usually more about their individual moments than their story arcs, an attribute that directors like Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci understood very well. I think both of them would have enjoyed TOMBSTONE & gotten a kick out of how some of their own ideas were recycled by the very industry they themselves were recycling.<br/><br/>The standout attribute of the film is still Val Kilmer's delightful interpretation of Doc Holliday. With his southern drawl, cultured mannerisms, sly quick wits (""I've got two guns, one for each of ya."") and still quotable one-liners he created a role that was uniquely his. Whether or not it was as historically accurate as Kirk Douglas or Jason Robards or Dennis Quaid's versions isn't important. And like him or not as a person, the moments where Doc gets to shine are the movie's high points. The best part of his role is that Kilmer seems to have been aware that TOMBSTONE was a cartoon, and caricatured himself accordingly. As did many of the supporting players, particularly Powers Booth, Michael Biehn and Stephen Lang's delightfully scummy Ike Clanton.<br/><br/>Part of what makes the film so remarkable is what a star crossed production it was in the first place. Originally a Kevin Costner envisioned project, he departed quickly to make his own Wyatt Earp movie upon creative disagreements with writer + original director Kevin Jarre, who was promptly fired when Kurt Russell came into the project and changed it's focus. Robert Mitchum was injured before he could play his role, a sitting director could not be secured until the late George P. Cosmatos agreed to helm. Kurt Russell apparently directed the bulk of the project himself just to keep the production alive, which perhaps explains some of the more awkward moments.<br/><br/>The most awkward being Dana DeLaney's role as Josephine Marcus, Wyatt Earp's love interest. Her part was either inflicted on the script hastily or is sadly under-written, a conclusion borne out by stories about an original three hour version that might have explored her character in a bit more interesting of a manner. I also can't get around Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, who makes bizarre facial expressions through the whole film that aren't helped much by that cookie duster mustache he grew. Then again one of the historical accuracy traits the film boasts is that all of the mustaches and period costumes are real, which explains why Val Kilmer is sweating there in a wool suit for the entire movie. No air conditioning in the old west.<br/><br/>So while it may not have the poignancy of UNFORGIVEN or the breadth of THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY or even the macho swagger of an EL DORADO John Wayne film, TOMBSTONE is one of the great American westerns and a marvelous entertainment & deserves to be seen again. Here's a movie that's worth owning your own copy of.<br/><br/>7/10"

"joynbrouwer","9","1","2","19 February 2008"," The Spiritual Wyatt Earp
","""Hurts, don't it?"" Those are the first words uttered by Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, an amazing rendering of the story of the Earp brothers, the O.K. Corral, and of the Cowboys on the Arizona frontier. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, the main characters played by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer respectively, are loyal friends. They have come to Tombstone separately to make their fortune, Earp with his two brothers, Morgan and Virgil, Holliday with his companion Kate. The Earp brothers attempt to live a quiet life, not getting involved in the lawlessness of Tombstone. Yet, the increasing violence pulls at Virgil and Morgan Earp who both agree to be town marshals. Wyatt at first resists the pull of the law, but his loyalty to his brothers win out before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Loyalty motives Doc Holliday, as well. In a memorable conversation with Turkey Creek Jack John, Holliday reveals the depth of his feelings: ""Turkey Creek Jack Johnson: Why you doing this, Doc? Doc Holliday: Because Wyatt Earp is my friend. Turkey Creek Jack Johnson: Friend? Hell, I got lots of friends. Doc Holliday: ...I don't."" In the Old West, a man could not count on much; a true friend may be the difference between life and an early death. Earp benefits from his friends as he rides to end the reign of the Cowboys following the death of his brother, Morgan. There are deep spiritual truths within Tombstone. As mentioned above, friendship and loyalty are highly valued in this film, even by the ""bad guys."" The Cowboys back up each other's actions, just like the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. Another is the difference between revenge and a reckoning. ""Sherman McMasters: If they were my brothers, I'd want revenge, too. Doc Holliday: Oh, make no mistake. It's not revenge he's after. It's a reckoning."" What does Holliday mean by this? How does he differentiate between revenge and the Old Testament idea of a reckoning? The Cowboys have certainly done some horrific things. They had created a hell for the people of Tombstone; Wyatt Earp put an end to that. Yet, it was not until Morgan was killed and Virgil was maimed that Wyatt took decisive action. This would certainly put his actions into the revenge category. Personally, I think there is more weight for the revenge argument, but the Cowboys were not innocent. Wyatt did not have crystal clear motives, but his actions are justified. I loved this movie and enjoy watching it over and over! Full of great lines and interesting characters!"
"mkarindash","10","1","2","9 February 2008"," Val makes it a masterpiece
","This is one of the best westerns ever made, and one of the best movies ever made. What makes it one of the best is VAL KILMER. Without him, it would've been a good one, but with him, it is a masterpiece. Doc Holliday himself was sure bigger than life. And Val is bigger than him, and much bigger than life. Not giving him the Academy Award he unquestionably deserved here is more than a mistake, it's a wrongdoing. I am certainly one of the many who would never forgive the Academy for that. This usually-underrated suprastandard master should be given his value and respect. And he should be in such exceptional themes more, no matter ""leading"" or ""supporting"". He leads even when he supports. He enhances, and he makes it prime. As a movie critic of decades, if I'm asked the best three performances (leading/supporting) in the history of cinema, I would admittedly take my time to choose the second and the third, but I would say the first without thinking a second: VAL KILMER's DOC HOLLIDAY. He just diffuses the whole movie into your bloodstream. He makes you love watching it and keeping it in your memory forever."
"revtg1-2","Null","1","2","6 August 2007"," A very entertaining movie and a total crock of horse apples.
","One thing you should see in western movies that you never see is piles of horse apples all up and down the dirt streets. You know they were there but you don't see them in the movies. ""Tombstone"" is a video of a crock of horse apples. Wyatt Earp was a brawler, a bully, a pimp, a horse thief. He made his money in Dodge City beating up drunks (at $3.00 a head knock) and keeping the peace in whore houses. That's how he earned the title ""the battling pimp."" He and his brothers were vagrant thugs and bullies. They were cited for the robbery of the Benson, Arizona stage but they had the badges so they blamed it on the Clantons and their friends. Then they closed the case by killing them at the O.K. Corral. One of Wyatt's brothers, Warren Earp, was a drunk and a brutal bully who lived in Wilcox, Arizona. One day he walked into a saloon and got too far out of control and someone shot him as many times as he had bullets. But back to the movie. You know you are looking at a crock of horse apples when Powers Booth's character, Johnny Ringo, stumbles out of an opium den and fires his two six shooters twenty-one times without reloading. According to records John Rheingold shot one man in his entire life. He shot a drunk in the face in a saloon because he didn't like the man's beard. The man did not die. Then in the re-enactment of the famous O.K. Corral gunfight, Val Kilmer's character, John Henry Holliday, fires a double-barreled shotgun three times in less that two seconds. Now you know someone has foisted a crock of horse apples off on you. The only saving graces of the movie are Robert Mitchum's voice over and Charlton Heston's underplayed and unannounced role. But, watch it because it is well scripted, well cast, well directed and a very entertaining crock of horse apples."
"boomerchinde","8","1","2","10 July 2007"," Tombstone rocks as a great western
","Someone once said, ""when the truth dies, print the legend"", and that's exactly what happens with this film. Although accurate in many respects, it is highly inaccurate in others, but what the hey, who cares when it's pulled off this well. George Cosmatos handles the directing reins wonderfully, and the pace of the film only slows down for the sappy romance between Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney. The Earps come to Tombstone to make their fortune and end up in a bloodbath of historic proportions. Oddly, the one scene where you're most likely to say ""Oh, that's phony"" is the scene where Wyatt walks into the face of a ambush and holds his own -- but that's highly accurate! The real Wyatt had bullet holes in his hat, boots, saddle and coat, but dished the dirt to the baddies. Great dialog, and an absolutely movie stealing performance by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Joanna Pacula is gorgeous as always, and plays Big Nose Kate Elder, Doc's ""girlfriend"". Look fast for the bar scene where Wyatt tosses out a loud mouthed braggart -- Billy Bob Thornton in one of his first roles. This film tosses in every Western thrill you can think of, even the presence of Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum. Don't just see it, buy it."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","8 November 2006"," Epic blockbuster that gets many things right
","Tombstone is arguably one of the more 'accessible' Westerns  a readily-molded popcorn flick that serves plenty of action, emotion and fun. Former hard-boiled lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), his two brothers and his tuberculosis-infected friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) move westward and settle in the town Tombstone to retire and lead the profitable good life. This is grossly undermined by a band of outlawed cowboys who stir up a conflict with the authority.<br/><br/>First let me say that the occasional shortcomings that 'Tombstone' has are what makes it a good film in the first place. To put it bluntly, it is a mish-mash of old 'harder' Westerns that has been filtered through Hollywood producers and softened up to a shameless blockbuster calibre. From the dramatic musical crescendo and the damsels in distress to the wide-ranging extended cameos by a big high-profile cast  it's accessible and fun and it makes no pretense about it. It is also so far into the Western genre with the dusty outback, the moustaches, the tense duel looks, the relentless alcohol-chugging and gunslinging characters that is almost tips over into camp territory.<br/><br/>The good news is that Tombstone never quite slips that far and instead remains not only afloat but periodically extremely entertaining. At all other times, it manages solid fun. As said, hard-boiled graphic gore is kept to a relative minimum in the film which undoubtedly only makes its infrequency all the more effective. The acing is also top-notch  if a little theatric, but hey, it's Western  Russell and the others crisply retain an emotional transparency throughout and the prevalence of emotionally-charged looks among them is particularly impressive. In the ultimate showdown (that spans across the entire movie) between law-men and outlaws, the key word is tension, and Tombstone aptly plays upon the former at all times.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"Hancock_the_Superb","8","1","2","1 May 2006"," Fun, Unpretentious Western
","The story of Wyatt Earp has been told innumerable times in cinema. In the old days, Earp, the marshal who tamed Dodge City, Abilene, and Tombstone, among others, always represented the good and virtuous lawman who defended the downtrodden and was quick on the draw - in short, the archetypal Western hero - accompanied by the drunken, philosophical, tubercular Doc Holliday, and his brothers Virgil and Morgan. Every movie about the Earps seem to center (and with some good reason) on their conflicts in Tombstone with the Cowboys, a gang of vicious cutthroats led by the Clantons, McLoweries, Curly Bill Brocious, Johnny Ringo, and a bunch of others, which resulted in the mythic gunfight at the OK Corral and the lesser-known series of vendettas which left one Earp and most of the above outlaws dead. In 1993/4, both ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" would present this traditional hero in a darker, more critical light, changing from a heroic superman to a flawed man who more often than not was a cold-blooded murderer.<br/><br/>The point is, this story's been done to death. There isn't really much you can add to a story that's been filmed dozens of times, or a character that has been played by Randolph Scott, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, James Garner, Burt Lancaster, and many, many others. So, the creators of ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" deserve credit for trying to take this oft-told legend in different directions. It's a shame that the two films had to be released almost simultaneously, resulting in inevitable comparisons.<br/><br/>""Tombstone"" is easily the more accessible of the two. While ""Wyatt Earp"" tries to be an epic a la ""How The West Was Won"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", showing Earp's entire life, ""Tombstone"" is a simple, unpretentious action Western full of slam-bang shootouts and loads of clichés. It's hard to say that either film is really better than the other, as they are two different types of film altogether, but ""Tombstone"" is easily the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The movie centers on the Earps' troubles in Tombstone and after. The movie at times seems a very simplistic black-versus-white movie, with sneeringly evil baddies as personified by Powers Boothe (Curly Bill), Stephen Lang (Ike Clanton), and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo), while the Earps - Wyatt (Kurt Russell), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and Virgil (the always-great Sam Elliot), plus Doc (Val Kilmer) - are the good guys, albeit with a tainted past. No sooner do the Earps come into town then trouble starts. The villains are sneeringly evil caricatures, the Earps paragons of virtue. If you don't like old-fashioned Westerns, then the first hour might make you sick - particularly Wyatt's extramarital affair with the lovely actress Josephine (Dana Delaney).<br/><br/>However, the second half of the film does show Wyatt in a darker light; after Morgan is assassinated and Virgil wounded by the Cowboys, Wyatt and Doc are deputized by the US Marshal, and a long with a few others go on a vicious rampage from which no one is safe. This sequence of the film is by far the most effective; an exciting montage of action ranging from shootouts to just plain murders.<br/><br/>The movie isn't exactly a deep film; it's very highly stylized and does have its moments of overt corniness (the slow-motion ""No!"" before Wyatt blasts Curly Bill, for instance). However, I don't really think that should be held against it. If you want depth in a film, don't come here.<br/><br/>I do think that Kurt Russell has to be on the lower-tier of screen Earps. Despite physical resemblance, Russell never really convinces as the tough guy Earp was, and at times even comes across as a loser. On the other hand, Paxton and the always-reliable Elliot pick up the slack, though Val Kilmer's brilliant turn as Doc steals the show. I won't add any more to the sea of compliments on Kilmer's performance, except to say that he really DOES look like he was dying of TB. Boothe, Lang, and Biehn scarf up the scenery and are a joy to watch while they're doing it. The supporting cast interestingly includes some soon-to-be-famous stars - Billy Zane, Terry O'Quinn, Billy Bob Thornton - in solid roles, and cameos by Western veterans Buck Taylor, Harry Carey Jr., and the legendary Charlton Heston add some class to the proceedings. The woman characters, unfortunately, are mostly caricatures. I wanted to like Dana Delaney as Josie, but her character was poor - don't know if it was the performance or the screenplay, but either way, I didn't really care for her.<br/><br/>I give ""Tombstone"" an eight - instead of a seven - because, unlike the similar ""Silverado"", it didn't pretend to be anything more than it was - a fun action Western with an edge. There were many flaws, and it will never be featured on any ""Best Movies of All Time"" lists, but it's still a solid movie, much like ""The Untouchables"". Kevin Costner was the better Earp of 1993/4, but ""Tombstone"" is probably the better film.<br/><br/>Eight stars."

Upon arriving in the lawless boomtown, they run into Earp's old companion, ""Doc"" Holliday (Val Kilmer).<br/><br/>Trouble soon begins when the local bad guys, a group that calls themselves the ""Cowboys"", learn of the Earps' arrival, and try to show the Earps that Tombstone is their territory. Further complicating matters, at the same time, a new woman enters into Earp's life. Despite his wishes to retire to a quiet life at the poker table, Earp and his brothers are drawn into yet another fight, having to choose between living out the rest of their days as they'd planned, or doing what's right to save their town. After the Cowboys go too far, however, the decision is clear to Wyatt Earp: the Cowboys need to be taught a lesson, and he's just the man to teach 'em.<br/><br/>A tale of revenge, vengeance, and legend, this movie is well made and exciting. Kilmer is fantastic as the brash, suave, gambling Holliday, and is a perfect compliment to Russel's Earp. Michael Biehn gives a solid performance as the dastardly Johnny Ringo, main nemesis of Holliday and the Earps. The movie features some classic lines and will keep fans riveted with a solid blend of action, drama, and good 'ol fashion Western gun play. A very good movie, and definitely worth watching, even if you aren't a fan of the typical ""Western""s."

Powers Booth was also good as Curly Joe. A raging maniac. Stephen Lang playing the role he does so well, a weasel. The only complaint I have about the movie is a big complaint and her name is Dana Delaney. Every scene she is in the movie comes to a screeching halt. There is something about Dana Delaney that is so goofy I can't look at her with a straight face. A miscast if there ever was one. I could not see what the attraction was in the movie. In real life she was a Jewish New Yorker who left home at a early age. She seemed to be a very interesting person. Wyatt was even buried next to her in a Jewish cemetery in San Fransisco. Dana Delaney made the character one dimensional that the only person who would be interested in her would be someone looking for some nookie. Other then her almost killing the movie there are no complaints from me. Val Kilmer should of got a Oscar for his performance. Tombstone is a good old type western with a lot of action. Take a look and try to overlook Dana Delaney's Josephine."

"jeffcoat","9","1","2","22 January 2004"," One of the best westerns of the last 3 decades
","As with any movie involving the legend of the OK Corral, this is not history.  Script writers were limited only by their prolific imaginations.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell plays a believable Wyatt Earp, Sam Elliot a phenomenal Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe a perfect Curly Bill, and Val Kilmer a bazaar Doc Holliday.  Kilmer's entertaining interpretation of the role is unlike any done before.<br/><br/>This movie has a radical change in character at the mid-point.  The first half consists of introductions and character development.  There is plenty of action to carry the story forward, plenty of the tension of anticipating the next act of violence.  The focus is on the Earps and their friends and love interests, the Clantons and their allies, and the dynamics of Tombstone.  The second half is unbridled action, with no effort to tell a story.  There is little story left to tell, but the action sustains the adrenalin flow, keeping the viewer absorbed while waiting for the final details to unfold.<br/><br/>Though the violence is more graphic then the westerns of the John Wayne era, gore doesn't become a co-star.  One of the best westerns of the last three decades."

","""Tombstone"" is a memorable film which is best viewed in the extended version. While most scenes restored in already released films are a gimmick to get you to part with more cash, the restored scenes in Tombstone should never have been cut in the first place, as they tie up loose ends which marred the original theatrical release, and kept it from true greatness.<br/><br/>Then there is the other Wyatt Earp film of the season. (What was it with Costner? Wyatt Earp wasn't the first time he tried to beat a premised film to market. First there was the competing ""Robin Hoods"" of 1991. Costner was so arrogant that he did not even attempt an English accent. Totally unwatchable rubbish.)<br/><br/>Comparing Tombstone to Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" is like comparing fresh hens eggs to that powdered stuff the army serves up... you can roll Tombstone around in your mouth, exploring its every texture, or you can watch Costner play Costner while you gulp down the reconstituted mess, which, they tell you, ""is just as filling."" Yes, it will keep you alive, but something essential is missing. <br/><br/>Length doth not an epic make.<br/><br/>Tombstone has the epic feel. Tombstone has ""scope"". A finely choreographed testosterone slaughter-fest. Its dusty streets and wooden walks are brought to life in exquisite expectation, where Russell and Kilmer stride, larger than life, dueling and dwarfing worthy adversaries.<br/><br/>There is a timeless feel to the film; a hyper-reality, which makes all other ""Earp"" films pale in comparison."

","Kurt Russell never fails to give an excellent performance he is perfect as Wyatt Earp.Val Kilmer is terrific as Wyatt's friend Doc Holiday. Wyatt and his brothers arrive with their wives in tombstone looking for a peaceful place to settle down. Dana Delaney is the beautiful lady Wyatt falls for though his already married. His wife is a drug addict and Wyatt's marriage doesn't seem to be working out the way he hoped it could have. Wyatt is in retirement but Doc isn't but soon trouble comes in the form of an outlaw gang called ""the cowboys"" wearing red scarves tied to their belts. They cause all kinds of trouble wherever they go. One night they kill the town sheriff and then they bring their revenge and kill Wyatt's brother Morgan, Wyatt comes out of his retirement for good and becomes US marshal and he wants revenge too. Soon a  shootout takes place and even Doc gets in on the action as well.<br/><br/>Spoiler- my favourite scene in the film was when Wyatt walks in to the ""Oriental"" bar and sees from afar Thornton making a scene and shooting his mouth off. Thornton is acting like a bully with the other person his playing poker with. Wyatt gets up and has a confrontation with Thornton and then slaps him round the face. Thornton has no idea whom his crossed as he wipes blood from his mouth and Wyatt says:'Are you going to just stand there or bleed'(something like that.)Thonton then gets thrown out by Wyatt.Classic!<br/><br/>This is one of the best western shootouts I've ever seen I'm not usually a big fan of western cowboy films but it has a good believable story about real people I'll watch it. Tombstone was very enjoyable and the film was brilliantly acted there were no boring scenes throughout the entire film it was a great ride.Dont miss this you will not be disappointed with an all male cast including Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer,Bill Paxton,Michael Biehn,Sam Elliot,Billy Zane, and loads more then you cant go wrong with this one."

"elgee","8","1","2","11 November 1999"," Great Stuff !!
","Out of all the Movies made about Wyatt Earp and The O.K. Corrall, to me, Tombstone is the finest. Kurt Russell playing the stoic Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as the tormented gunslinging Doc Holliday, really did a job in this version of THAT gunfight as they swaggered through the film both looking invincible ( as indeed they were ) and I must say looking highly credible also. Tombstone reminds me of the fifties when most good Westerns were made, full of action, romance, a dash of humour here and there, and full too of heroes showing us how to get their man, ( or men.) And, like Westerns in the fifties, Tombstone ignores some of the truths about what happened before and after the gunfight just off Fremont Street and concentrates more on what we all pay our money to see.....men doing what men had to do. The facts? Who cares. Tombstone has the right balance of history and fiction to make it work and keep us interested in the Movie, as it gives us glimpses of the truth, then decorates it with heavy doses of Hollywood and it's determination to entertain. Val Kilmer almost steals the show as Earp's loyal side kick, but Russell held on to his character well and I think it's fair to say they came out about even. My favourite part is when the Dentist gives us a rousing rendition of musical mugs in the Saloon while responding to a testy cowboy from across the table. A table also where Earp, always in control sat with his trusty shotgun pinned underneath it and aimed at the cowboy's underbelly. That scene was about as far away from the facts as night is to day, but is was riveting stuff and the thought of it ever actually happening never really crosses our minds. Tombstone is a slick Movie, well directed by George P. Cosmatos who along with most involved in the film was hell bent on giving us a story, rather than a history lesson."

","Ladies, we have a fine ensemble of some of the best looking men in the business:  Kurt Russell; Val Kilmer; Michael Biehn; Billy Zane; Sam Elliott; Bill Paxton, etc.  So don't let the fact that it's a ""western"" deter you from catching this one.<br/><br/>I love movies that pay attention to fine details: Kilmer's filthy fingers during a poker hand, a child soothing her doll after a street shooting, the size of paper money, spittoons in the theatre, etc., etc.  Even the colloquialisms were accurate for the time period:  ""savvy?"" ""ain't that a daisy?"" ""I'm your huckleberry"" and so on.  The women in the film were not overly made up, only a small amount of lip color.  And the furnishings, drapes and other decor made me feel I had stepped back in time.<br/><br/>The historical details were not right on the money, but for a movie which must wrap up in a few hours, who cares?  The movie is so enjoyable.  Russell WAS Wyatt Earp - the steely eyes, the head-strong determination.  Kilmer did steal every scene he appeared in, however, and mastered a Virginian accent magnificently.  Powers Booth and Michael Biehn played villains who really get under your skin.  And those in lesser roles (such as Curley Bill and Mattie Earp, who in reality was never officially married to Wyatt) were greatly effective.<br/><br/>If you rent this movie or watch it for the first time, take note of the extra's.  These folks are not just walking around; they were painstakingly directed and busy doing tasks common for that time.<br/><br/>A fest for the eyes."

from Blockbuster in the early '90's. I think we must have looked at the video cassette box more than once to double-check the running time of the film. Why, we wondered, couldn't they have cut this film by 30 minutes?

Obviously some romance in there as well, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>I mean don't get me wrong, it accomplishes that kind of movie very well and that's perfectly approvable 6/10 fun in itself, nothing bad about it. Just nothing special about it either.<br/><br/>However, there *is* something special about this movie - and that's Doc Holliday. What can I say, Val Kilmer manages to create just an absolutely hypnotising character whose magnetism would captivate you all the same no matter what genre this movie belonged to or in what setting it happened to take place in. I feel like the rest of the movie is just an inconsequential container vessel for this one mesmerising individual. I feel like all the clichés and banalities are there so that you could for only a brief moment make eye contact with Doc Holliday, nod in agreement, and just laugh together silently about the stupidity of all of it, each knowing that the other understands *exactly* how he feels.<br/><br/>I suppose if the ""typical good guy action movie"" REALLY isn't your thing, then just this one supporting character won't be enough to bother with the whole thing, but if this kind of movie is acceptable for you like it is for me, then you will find yourself impatiently waiting for the next moment with Doc Holliday, and you'll find the wait was worth it every single time."

Also, Val Kilmer was fantastic in the role of Doc Holliday as the witty, cavalier and charming gunslinger pal of Wyatt Earp. Dana Delany plays the ultimate siren as Josie who captures Wyatt's heart.<br/><br/>The backdrop for Tombstone was a typical small western town with saloons, corrals and lots of shooting. The movie thanks to the great acting does capture the audience. The pace may be slow in places but not enough to have the viewer lose interest. The other great thing about this movie was the music.

It only took 3 days to get there from Virginia. I was a completely different person. While we were in Tombstone we talked to the historian about Tombstone. I was so happy it was like I was in heaven.

"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","5 October 2006"," Perhaps the most awesome western ever made.
","I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the western genre, although the genre has definitely grown onto me the last couple of years. But even as a non-fan of the genre I've just always loved this movie.<br/><br/>A '90's western is per definition a rare thing. Even rarer is that it's also a great one. ""Tombstone"" is a movie made in the tradition of the old spaghetti westerns but with a flavor of '90's action added to it. The end result is a great to watch and spectacular movie.<br/><br/>Of course one of the reason why this movie is such a great one to watch is due to the story that is filled with some of the best known character of the wild west. The Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo etcetera. Everybody knows these persons, no introductions are required, which means that the story can do to them what they want without ever having to explain to much about their motivations or background. The movie is filled with well known characters, which are all portrayed by well known and excellent actors.<br/><br/>The cast is also definitely one of the things that distinct this movie from other genre movies. The movie basically has an all-star cast but on top of that every actor is well cast as well. They suit their roles fine and make sure that the all-star cast doesn't distract from the movie its story. The cast has both well known established actors, like Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Charlton Heston, Michael Biehn, among others and yet fairly unknown actors that now are well known names such as Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Zane. So I say, good casting!<br/><br/>It would be impossible to name and rate every actors performance in this movie but still I would like to mention a few. Kurt Russell works better than expected in the main part. Sam Elliott is solid as always and he delivers a powerful performance and puts down a strong character. Powers Boothe is truly great as Curly Bill Brocious, the leader of the cowboy-gang. Michael Biehn is also a great ruthless and hard tough cowboy, that also knows how to handle a pistol. Movie icons like Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum as the narrator at the ending also show up in this movie. But obviously the one that steals the show, is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. It's a real shame that his performance was overlooked by the academy awards and any other award show for that matter. His performance is among the best of the '90's and definitely Kilmer's best till date. <br/><br/>All of the characters also work well on an emotional level. It makes this movie so much more than just another western but a solid drama about true friendship, brotherhood and loyalty. The movie even manages to put a love-story into the movie, which works in a non-distractive way which is of course a real positive thing,<br/><br/>The movie is basically filled with all of the western clichés and characters. You can say that this movie is a great homage to the good old westerns but that is also a great movie on its own. The movie is however not made in old western style but in '90's action style instead. This works surprisingly well for the movie and its story. It makes this movie perhaps the most awesome western ever made and an original one as well.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with some great and memorable moments. Lots of those moments feature Doc Holiday. A coincidence? I think not. It proofs how utterly brilliant Val Kilmer is in his role and how well his character works out in the movie. Especially the stand-off between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holiday is one to remember.<br/><br/>The movie might start off as a cliché filled western with nostalgic feelings but from the moment on when Wyatt's revenge starts, there is no holding back. The movie takes pace quickly and the movie turns into a non-stop action filled feast with some true awesome and well filmed moments, that are unforgettable.<br/><br/>The way the cowboys are portrayed as a early group of organized crime is an interesting take, which works well for the story and the events in it. It also is another reason why this movie distinct itself from other genre movies.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is great with some wonderful looking sets and costumes and a sweeping musical score from Bruce Broughton. I'll admit that the musical score is one of the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. Broughton has composed some great musical scores over the years but yet he remains fairly unknown and underrated and mostly works on TV projects.<br/><br/>I just totally love this movie, although I'll admit that it's not a flawless one.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","When the discussion of Western's comes up among film fans there's the obvious choices like the Sergio Leone classics, The Searchers, Unforgiven and a myriad of other well-liked tales of the Wild Wild West but one film that has also managed to find itself in the conversation is 1993 hit Tombstone, a film not adored by critics upon release but one that's stature has continued to grow in the years following its initial release.<br/><br/>Filled with one of the most eclectic and talented casts assembled in the 90's, with some of the most enjoyable turns in the career's of Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell in particular, George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre's film (with Jarre doing a bulk of the early filming only to find himself fired and replaced by Cosmatos) that chronicles the events leading up to the famous shootout at the O.K Corral that featured famed Western stalwarts Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday and Wyatt's brothers Virgil and Morgan.<br/><br/>Overcoming a somewhat loose and scatter-gun early approach that makes it hard to care to much for anyone or anything, Tombstone finds its pulpy western groove around the half way mark with it impossible not to get caught up in the retired lawman going on one last mission quest that sees Wyatt and his gang taking it to a group of marauding cowboys who are making the lives of those living in the town of Tombstone far harder than it need be.<br/><br/>With some of the best facial hair and swagger going around, the core cast of Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton make for some extremely enjoyable viewing with the gang of A-lister's all clearly having a blast getting to play dress-up and enact out every young boys fantasy of western life, with Russell and Kilmer in particular shining in a loaded ensemble that find themselves competing for screen-time in a loaded two hour event.<br/><br/>There's little nuance to anything going on and little deep reflection that is prevalent in the more thoughtful westerns like The Searchers or Unforgiven, to be expected when the director tasked with finalizing proceedings is responsible for the likes of Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part 2, but there is a prevailing sense of playfulness and energy that keeps the film ticking along, particularly when the bodies start piling up in the films latter half.<br/><br/>Without providing anything that will make you ponder it once the credits begin to roll, Tombstone showcases how exciting and enjoyable the western genre can be, reminding us that its great to have the serious minded products but also that ones that feature Val Kilmer's Southern accent and Powers Booth wandering around with custom made cowboy boots.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A fun western that eschews anything of lasting substance to instead give us an abundance of action and sassy attitudes, Tombstone is a fun ride to the wild west with one of the best casts ever assembled for such a product.<br/><br/>3 gun-toting audience members out of 5"

Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both great in this film, as Wyatt and Doc, respectively. The two actors play off of each other with ease and make the film more watchable. In fact, Kilmer gives a bit of comedy relief where it's needed, compared to Russell's straightforwardness.<br/><br/>There are some great scenes throughout the film, in particular, the scene with Holliday and Johnny Ringo and the ending scene is very heartfelt too.

"RyanEberhart","10","0","1","17 September 2013"," Amazing!
","If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone.<br/><br/>I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that ""law don't go round here."" Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did.<br/><br/>Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them.<br/><br/>The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have.<br/><br/>There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, ""I'm your Huckleberry"".<br/><br/>I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article."
"alkoffice","10","0","1","31 July 2013"," A great American Western
","I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree."
"daviddaphneredding","10","0","1","10 July 2013"," Definitely a favorite of mine
","I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John ""Doc"" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in ""Titanic"" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!"
"jcbutthead86","10","0","1","2 July 2013"," An Excellent,Action-Packed Western Classic And One Of The Greatest Westerns Of All Time With Brilliant Performances From Kurt Russell And Val Klimer.
","Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs.<br/><br/>In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone.<br/><br/>The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey).<br/><br/>The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos.<br/><br/>The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. <br/><br/>Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version.<br/><br/>Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol<br/><br/>Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic!<br/><br/>Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version.<br/><br/>Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. <br/><br/>Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman.<br/><br/>Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money.<br/><br/>Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4"" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, ""this is the handsomest man I have ever seen""! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. <br/><br/>In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there."

There isn't a place in the movie where I was left to wonder who is that guy and why is he doing what he is doing.

","""Tombstone"" wow what can I say it's just an amazing movie. I think this one of my all time best cowboy movie. I think it is up there with John Wayne's movies. The villains are great, the backgrounds or scenery is mind blowing, and don't forget the gunslinging. It makes you feel like it was real. It is just an all time classic movie. Also what makes the movie even better is that it is based on true people and events. ""I'll be your huckleberry"" says Doc Holliday and in this case I'll be your guide to seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, the main actors are Kurt Russel (Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (Doc Holliday, Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) and Powers Boothe ( Curly Bill Brocious). They all did a splendid job as villains/heroes. They made it feel like it was back in the 18th century and we were all deputies and cowboys. <br/><br/>The scenery was all so very good. It was filmed in Arizona, because of the plateaus and the red sand which mimics the area where tombstone actually was. They probably would pick Arizona because there are many spots that are inhabitant to people, and because there aren't as many roads every where like California. <br/><br/>The gunslinging is always the best part of cowboy movies to me. Doc Holliday in my opinion has the best gun slinging part. It seems like the hero's always win but there are twists in this movie that you won't see coming. People may not like this movie because there isn't much gore or blood but there are good amounts.<br/><br/>The movie ""Tombstone"" is a great movie, for those cowboy fans! It's about a ounce was deputy Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel), who was from dodge city and cleaned it up, who just stopped working as a deputy and moves to tombstone to become rich. He meets his brother up there and a gunslinger, drinker, and gambler Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). When Wyatt just gets there he notices that there are people every wear who have red sashes. He asks the mayor why they are wearing sashes and the mayor says that they are a gang of outlaws who call themselves the ""Cowboys"", and they have been starting trouble in that region."

","This is a very good film, whether you like westerns or not. It's the perfect balance of historical accuracy and artistic license. While I enjoy Kurt Russell, I thought Kevin Costner made a better Wyatt Earp overall. Russell does a great job showing the human side of a legend though. Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Doc Holiday, and Dennis Quaid did an equally fine job in the Wyatt Earp film.<br/><br/>Tombstone has all the things you'd expect in a classic western film-- action, romance, some comedy, etc., but it's played in a way that steps out of the box. Not, perhaps, as much as something like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but you won't be disappointed. The good guys are clearly the good guys, but they are also human. The bad guys are clearly bad guys, and they are human, but evil.<br/><br/>This is an R-rated film, but is not overly violent.

In an era when the change in laws on gambling and gun handling was sweeping across America, Tombstone was one of the last towns to be affected. Hench the reason all cowboys and harden gamblers moved in causing an extremely volatile town and ultimately the infamous GUN FIGHT AT THE OK CORREL!! Wyatt Earp is a legend that moved to Tombstone with his family and close friend Doc Holiday! Val Kilmer plays Holiday with unbelievable brilliance and wit in with out doubt his finest performance ever and Kurt Russel is excellent playing the tough Earp. This is a must see and see again!!"

","I saw this on the big screen when it came out in 1993. After enjoying most every minute of this rich, colorful, and gripping movie, I just couldn't believe it wasn't getting more attention. It's one of the most quotable, fun, moving, memorable films ever. THIS is what movie-making is really about --creating and celebrating unforgettable characters in a compelling story.<br/><br/>And they managed to make it tense and moving with minimal cursing, sex, nudity, gore, etc. It is simply wonderful. Certainly not a family film; but tame on some levels, and I love it. I especially adored Dana Delaney in her role --she was breathtaking and fascinating. Oh, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday? Are there words? He SHOULD have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards for that performance. It's a crying shame he was not. To this day, it is a crying shame he was not nominated.<br/><br/>There were many good performances in Tombstone. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was achingly sad and believable as the morphine-addicted Mattie. Sam Elliott was in top form. He was so calm and reserved --when he lost his temper in one scene, it was really frightening. Billy Zane, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Boothe, Kurt Russell, Stephen Lang --many of the actors were simply fabulous. And WHAT a cast of actors! My gosh! If you watch it today (2011), it's amazing how many actors you recognize who were fairly unknown then.<br/><br/>Wonderful character development. It was so easy to get involved in the characters' stories and to pull for them. Yes, they took a few liberties with historical facts; but they brought the gunfight at the OK Corral and its back story to life in a grand, wildly enjoyable film with rich, interesting characters.<br/><br/>Tombstone is a ""10"" in my book. It always will be. Our family LOVES it and we quote it often. Thanks to everyone who took part in making such a great film for us, your audience, to enjoy again and again for years to come."

","This movie doesn't get the credit it most clearly deserves. The casting, acting, sets, script and story is magnificent. It shows a rough Arizona town - Tombstone - in the lead up to the event that put it on the map - the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.<br/><br/>We're introduced early in the piece to retired lawman Wyatt Earp. Earp, whilst spending time on both sides of the law, was for the most part a peaceful man. At different times in his life he was a gambler, a law enforcement officer, an investor, a buffalo hunter, a boxing referee, a teamster on a wagon train and a barkeep. Kurt Russell's Wyatt is sharp, hard and rough - but behind his eyes you see a man just trying to live his life. Russell does a tremendous job of conveying the struggles of Wyatt's life as well as showing his ruthlessness in pursuit of the cowboys.<br/><br/>Moving to Tombstone seeking his fortune (not for the first time) he gets caught up in a feud with the cowboy faction led by Curly Bill Brocious and Johnny Ringo. Earp's brothers Morgan & Virgil, their wives and the cunning gunman & outlaw Doc Holiday also move to Tombstone.<br/><br/>It is the relationship between Wyatt & Doc which forms part of the remarkable story. One man, Wyatt, a strong lawman with values of loyalty and family and the tuberculosis ridden, womanizing, card playing murderer Doc. Holiday's only loyalty lays with Wyatt. Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc is one of the history's great pieces of character acting. How Kilmer was ignored for honours (bar 2 MTV awards) is astonishing. You could watch Tombstone just to see and hear Kilmer, who also gets most of the best lines. Playing a character racked with illness is no easy task and Kilmer carries it off with what seems like relative ease. No doubt Kilmer is one of the great actors of his time.<br/><br/>Wyatt's develops a friendship with travelling actress Josephine Marcus whilst his relationship with his partner Mattie collapses due to her laudanum addiction. This partnership was to develop into the main one of Wyatt's life and Delaney's performance as the bubbly Marcus, while easy to ignore with all the star power around her, is quite good.<br/><br/>Wyatt's rivalry with County Sheriff John Behan is tested due to their feelings towards Josie, and Behan's need for the cowboys to stay in town as they are good for business. Jon Tenney plays the part of politician Behan perfectly - outwardly friendly while devious behind closed doors.<br/><br/>The shoot out at the O.K. Corral is a famous and often viewed spectacle in film - but none does it better than this. The scene is one to remember - the Earps and Doc slowly walking towards the impending gunfight in a line across the street is now an iconic image.<br/><br/>The gunfight leads to severe retribution from both sides with Wyatt leading a vendetta against the cowboys who are seeking their own revenge on the law. One famous (and true life) scene is the face off between Wyatt and Brocious at Iron Springs - hopelessly surrounded, Wyatt treads defiantly to the middle of the river to face Brocious one on one. Powers Boothe's portrayal of the dastardly Brocious is chilling. He is able to bend the minds of his cowboys to his will, while for the most part protecting himself from capture.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn plays the mentally unstable Johnny Ringo marvellously - he is quick to enter into a rage and his Latin wordplay scene with Doc is one of the movies memorable moments. The other cowboy offsider is Ike Clanton, played by Stephen Lang. Lang does dirty well, and he had his job cut out for him with Ike who came up against all the Earp boys and Doc at one time or another.<br/><br/>Doc's showdown with Ringo shows the best parts of Kilmer in Tombstone before a heartfelt final goodbye between old friends Holiday and Wyatt. Their final scene together brings together the story of the two who despite their differences have a love, loyalty and respect for one another.<br/><br/>While some aspects of the story are embellished for the film, left out entirely or changed, there is still no denying that this is one of the great Western movies. Considering there were times when it wasn't going to be made, was written off by Kevin Costner as the inferior Wyatt Earp story (he made his own attempt the following year) and all but abandoned by the studios, it's amazing how spectacular Tombstone is. The acting is absolutely top notch and the actors gel so well they make you believe they're really as bad or good in real life. Tombstone was the first Western I ever saw and is still my favourite movie of all time. One for lovers of Westerns and one for movie lovers in general."
"phd_travel","Null","0","2","3 October 2011"," The best version of this legend
","Superb. There is no better movie version of the OK Corral shoot out than this. It is so exciting - with perfect pacing and a stellar cast. It has an action adventure pace and leaves out some historical facts about the Earps and character interactions etc but it doesn't matter you can't put everything in a movie. When you compare this to the old B&W version with Burt Lancaster it is just such an improvement. The actors are perfectly cast. Kurt is excellent as Wyatt. Val Kilmer has one of his best roles as Doc and the others are great too like Joanna Pacula. Thomas Haden Church is terrific. Michael Biehn is a good bad guy Johnny Ringo. The Kevin Costner movie about Wyatt Earp may have more details about Earp's life but was a bit of a drag overall. Even watchers who aren't generally fans of Westerns will like this one. I'm generally not a cowboy movie spaghetti western fan and don't like the trend of the recent ""ugly"" and realistic Westerns but this isn't just a simple Western - it's historically based and the story isn't contrived since it's based on a true story. This is a must watch."
"DietCoke13","Null","0","2","3 September 2011"," Val Kilmer steals this movie
","I am not a fan of westerns. I have no idea if this story is accurate about the subject matter. However, this movie is worth watching. All the performances are well done, but Val Kilmer IS the reason to see this. I don't understand the rules for being nominated for an Academy Award (probably more ""politcal"" than anything), but how he wasn't even nominated demonstrates questionable procedure at best. Kilmer is absolutely superb. I get the sense this was supposed to be Kurt Russell's movie, but Kilmer steals the show. Doc Holliday was obviously a very educated, intelligent man, but was well aware of his flaws and doomed fate. If for no other reason, watch this movie for Kilmer's performance."
"Mr-Fusion","7","0","1","1 September 2011"," If ever a western could qualify as a chick flick, it's this.
","I'm not sure whether it's in spite of, or because of the movie's lack of subtlety, but hell if ""Tombstone"" isn't an entertaining ride. All the the usual (dependable) are her: revenge thirsts, gang wars, gun fights, showdowns and memorable characters - mostly because the actors take their parts and run with them. Such scenery-chewing is endearing. There's more than enough rugged to go around, yet there's such a strong romantic undercurrent that really flavors the whole thing. It's amazing just how Dana Delany impacts the movie even when she's not on screen. But it's a western first and foremost, and not a bad one, at that. You tend to wonder how historically accurate all of this is, (with Doc Holliday especially), but that's nitpicking with a movie this good.<br/><br/>7/10"
"freemantle_uk","8","0","1","31 July 2011"," The Law is coming
","Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven helped reinvent the Western for modern audiences in the 90s but it was still unpopular genre. 1993 and 1994 also saw two films about legendary Wyatt Earp Old West hero being released in a short space of time.<br/><br/>In 1879 lots of people are heading West in America to make their fortunes, buying land to become farmers, ranchers, miners or various businessmen. But it was also a wild place and in Arizona and there is a violence gang, the Cowboys who wear red sash who strike fear in the area. In Tombstone, the Earp brothers, Wyatt (Kurt Russell), Viral (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) move to the town, Wyatt being a famous peace officer from Kansas. Wyatt wants a peaceful life but many things prevent him, his wife's (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), his interest in an actress, Josephine (Dana Delany) and his personal sense of justice make him and his brothers get involved with law enforcement. As the Earps get into conflict with the Cowboys the violence start to escalate.<br/><br/>Tombstone does have an old-fashion feel with its story of a more simple tale of good vs. evil and the score felt like it was from an older film. But at the same time there is more willingness to show violence, that bullets are painful, that the Old West is rough and that knives were used. Director George P. Cosmatos certainly knew how to make the film tense, building scenes up as characters come into conflict and not letting you guess if the scene is going to end up having a violence conclusion. Particular scenes of note are when Wyatt as a poker dealer comes into clash with the Cowboys as his drunk friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) challenges one of them and Wyatt has a shotgun under the table, the other being the build up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Coral, knowing something major is about to happen and the music really fitting the tone.<br/><br/>The actions scenes were strong: quick, snappy and violence. They are fast paced and well edited, not using shaky cam or quick cuts. It what I want in a Western.<br/><br/>Acting wise whilst Russell is prone to some meladramatic moments it shows that given the right material he can be a good actor and his Wyatt Earp is smart, tough with a sense of justice but also good wit with behind him. A particular scene being when Wyatt beats a dodgy poker dealer out of a saloon. Kilmer also surprising gives a good performance as a TB suffering alcoholic who is good gun slider and ally to Wyatt. Kilmer makes him softly spoken and a slightly campy fella but still a tough man to fight against despite his illness. Elliot is always a strong performer and most of the acting is solid in the film.<br/><br/>Reading the trivia page on IMDb, Kevin Jarre originally wrote the film as a longer, more epic story and I can see that with many elements were cut. Wyatt's relationships with wife and Josephine were not explored very much and I bet in the original version of the script there would have been more of a focus on personal drama. After the family is attacked as well the film seems to speed alone very quickly as Wyatt and Holiday hunt the Cowboys: it feels very rushed.<br/><br/>Overall Tombstone is enjoyable to anyone who is a fan of the Western genre."

","In George P. Cosmatos' ""Tombst-- wait a second. Who the frick is George P. Cosmatos'? Oh well. This movie was pretty damned good, so he's o.k. in my book. Anyway, in George P. Cosmatos' ""Tombstone"" he creates an endlessly entertaining modern western; something that is nearly unachievable these days. The movie features about as much action as it features comedy, tension, and drama. I found myself incredibly impressed by this movie and how gratifying it was to watch. All the performances were great, especially Kurt Russell's memorable portrayal of legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. But. . .Val Kilmer, bro. This guy is a frickin' riot; funny as hell, and badass too. Probably (and sadly) the greatest role he's ever played. I found very little to criticize in this movie- the script was well written, the camera-work was aesthetic, and the music was pretty appropriate for the movie. I feel that ""Tombstone"" is quite possibly one of the greatest westerns I've ever seen. Immensely entertaining. I highly recommend it. . .pardner."

","Wyatt Earp, a former lawman, and his brothers want to start anew in Tombstone, Arizona. Unfortunately, the so-called Cowboys, a notorious gang of outlaws cause increasing unease for the regular citizens of the town, and the three can no longer sit idly by. This has an incredibly talented cast, and everyone does excellent work. The pure awesome of Russell, Booth, Biehn and Elliott makes this required viewing for anyone with a Y chromosome. This is one of the best modern Western classics(and not a spaghetti one, it's largely realistic), if the action is, if not small in amount, then at least grouped here and there in the film... long stretches pass with no guns fired, which is not to say that you'll be bored. There are a lot of characters, and this isn't about a detailed study of each of them, though they are well-developed. The plot is easy to follow and satisfying. Given that George P. Comatose(yes, I call him that intentionally) also directed The Cassandra Crossing and Rambo: First Blood Part II(and I've heard ugly things about Cobra), I have to wonder if this was the one film he did(R.I.P.) a really solid job on. The humor works. Dialog is pretty sharp, and well-delivered. There is blood, disturbing content and violence in this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine enjoying it. 8/10"
"knucklebreather","8","0","1","25 April 2011"," Almost great
","""Tombstone"", a big-budget retelling/re-imagining of the legendary Wyatt Earp complete with the shootout at the OK Corral, is mostly an homage to the classic westerns of the 1950s and 1960s. And that's fine, they were cinema at its most fun, and it's always a pleasure to see their themes rehashed with a big budget, an updated script and more modern production quality. ""Tombstone"" mostly succeeds, with Russel's Earp approachable and enjoyable as he does battle with bad guys, despite seemingly wanting to just make a few bucks, after his arrival in boomtown Tombstone. The movie is full of great action scenes, mostly memorable characters (western clichés, to be sure, but longingly depicted and well-drawn ones).<br/><br/>It's fun in the way the classic westerns were fun. If you like the genre there's really no reason not to pick up ""Tombstone"". However, this is a movie that seems to have had so many things going for it that it could have been that great movie that manages to capture all of the electricity of the western and distill it into one single, amazing film. So many movies came close, but ""Tombstone"" unfortunately falls short. The main problem is the sprawling cast of characters which populate the story, so many, and apparently so edited, that characters do things that aren't properly explained and that many seemingly important characters appear sporadically that I found myself asking ""Well where have you been?"" when some of them appeared after a few dozen scenes of absence.<br/><br/>So it's not perfect. It's still a great western."

"cbrueggemeyer","8","0","1","21 April 2011"," A Great Modern-Day Western
","I think that overall, this movie was very good. This movie takes the iconic western theme and mixes it with a modern storyline and witty humor, mainly produced by the character of Doc Holliday. This movie has great twists, and makes the audience feel uncertain and anxious about the fate of the characters. Different types of characters in this story make the audience question who can be trusted, similar to the movie Stagecoach, where no one really knows who is bad and who is good until the characters develop. The storyline of the movie is very exciting, and an array of terrible villains always provides a challenge for the Earp brothers. My favorite thing about this movie is that there isn't just one villain. When one villain dies, it seems like there are many more to take his place. Even though this happens many times, at the end of the movie the audience still has that wonderful feeling of relief seeing the main character succeed. <br/><br/>The Cinematography and editing in the movie Tombstone is great. Fast, cutting action scenes and quick close-ups of the main heroes and villains make this movie very enjoyable. One of my favorite scenes that shows great filming techniques is the scene where Wyatt Earp kills a few Cowboys next to a train with his shotgun. At the end of the scene, the camera takes the position from a dead body, showing Wyatt Earp standing over the body with a dark coat holding a shotgun. This scene is one of those iconic scenes that make you think of movies such as The Wild Bunch and The Searchers, where the main heroes/villains show their authority over other characters by standing over their dead bodies. The editing in this movie is below average. This movie is very good, but some scenes seem to serve no particular purpose, like the scenes with Wyatt and his wife who is addicted to laudanum. The movie is 2 hours and ten minutes long, and it should be about 1 hour and 50 minutes long. <br/><br/>I think the acting in Tombstone was above average. This star studded cast seemed to live up to our expectations, no more and no less. Some usually great actors, such as Charlton Heston and Stephen Lang, seemed to contribute almost nothing to this movie. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp, the enigmatic cowboy with a habit for finding and stopping crime. Russell does fairly well in this performance, he executes the romantic scenes well but I have a hard time believing him to be the hardcore cowboy that he plays. Russell's performance in Tombstone is over shadowed by his performances in movies such as The Thing and Death Proof, both extremely scary movies where Russell gives stellar performances. Russell's performance overall is good, but I think that he could have easily been replaced in this movie by actors such as Kevin Costner and Daniel Day-Lewis. Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday, a doctor battling problems such as alcoholism, a gambling addiction, and tuberculosis. This, in my opinion, is Kilmer's best acting role. Although Kilmer is great in movies such as Heat and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, I think this is by far his best movie as an actor. The role of Doc is a very difficult one to play, he lingers between depression and happiness constantly. Kilmer executes this role perfectly, giving insight into the effect a terminal disease can have on the human soul. Also, Kilmer has many scenes where he provides comic relief to the action packed sequences of death and destruction. I would compare Kilmer's character of Doc Holliday in this movie to Thomas Mitchell's character of Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Both are veteran grizzled doctors that wander aimlessly through life battling the effects of alcoholism. Both characters provide necessary comedic support to the stories that they are in. Overall, I think that Russell's portrayal of Wyatt Earp and Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday are both essential to the success of the movie, and both actors once again prove why they are among the elite in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The music and sound effects in the movie Tombstone are effectively used, but are nothing extraordinary. A man named Bruce Broughton does the sound for this movie, and he does a great job adding dramatic effect to the scenes that need it. However, I think that some scenes could have used music more effectively to set the mood of the scene. For example, the scene at the beginning where Wyatt and his two brothers are just arriving in Tombstone. Scenes like this are a composer's dream. Most composers will start with a cheery, uplifting instrumental piece that will capture the audience's attention and get them ready for the scenes to come. Also, I think the movie needed more dramatic dark music during scenes where there is killing going on. This kind of music, used very effectively in The Searchers, brings the movie down to earth, and doesn't make it seem corny. <br/><br/>The direction in the movie Tombstone is great. It seems like this would be a very difficult movie to make, having to balance the historical expectations of the story with filmmaking expectations of making the story original. I think that the director, George P. Cosmatos, did a great job with this. Costamos employs great cinematography to makes his scenes realistic, and he uses wonderful sound effects to set the mood of certain scenes. Overall, I think that Cosmatos' greatest strength regarding this movie was his casting. The cast of this movie is great, and they really help to make this movie as memorable as it is. I think that Cosmatos' greatest weakness regarding this movie is the editing. I really think that the movie was too long, and that some scenes seemed extraneous and not relevant to the storyline. I think that Cosmatos did a great job with this movie, he showed how important it is as a director to have experience."

","Ah the old west...we always romanticize about its wonders with all the sex alcohol and murder going on but we somehow make it though having it look like something out of a black and white Disney fairy tale. In more recent years the westerns have been darker in nature especially so after the Clint Eastwood era. Tombstone is somewhere in the middle of all of this.<br/><br/>Well we are welling the story of Wyatt Eart and Doc holiday taking on the outlaws of the OK Corral. We have all the things that make our western's fun such as the violence and the drinking and the sex (well more implied). It also tends to have the oddly clean feeling that we got in the other old day westerns were most of the heroes cleaned their suits regularly and not like the Clint Eastwood type westerns where everything is covered by a level of dirt.<br/><br/>The acting was very well done though I really wasn't' that impressed by Kurt Russels performance it like his character was more wooden than the others. Of course he was probably overshadowed by Val Kilmers spectacular performance of Doc Holiday, only Robert Downey Jr. Could have played the character better.<br/><br/>The movie is easily watchable and though it clocks a little over 2 hours in length we can forgive it as you are entertained most of the time. The action is good but not overwhelming so you tend to not get bored easily.<br/><br/>Is you are a fan of the old style westerns or like a little more gutsiness behind it this is a good movie to enjoy."

","Biographical Westerns are special for the simple reason that it is even more fascinating to know that all this stuff had happened for real. These were real bad-ass cowboys.

All the main characters in the movie are real, the events shown have historic backing. But still, I think, the director's job is very important here. He has established all the characters in a very believable way. This movie also may be the director's tribute to all his favorite westerns. There is everything in this movie - juggling of guns, bashing at the bar, poker, alcohol, opera singer beauty and loads and loads of gun fights.<br/><br/>Two actors - Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are very impressive from the extended star cast, especially Kilmer.

","Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career as Wyatt Earp in 1993's TOMBSTONE, a fairly accurate rendition of the Earp brothers adventures in a booming mining town. It's Virgil, Morgan and Wyatt versus a loose-knit gang of thugs known as The Cowboys for control of Tombstone. Things heat up after a showdown adjacent to the OK Corral, and Wyatt -- now a federal marshal -- creates a special posse including Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in top form) and a trio of Cowboy deserters to hunt down the remaining Cowboys. Many familiar faces dot the landscape, including Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, leader of The Cowboys, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, second-in-command of The Cowboys. Russell is given two women to romance in this film, Earp's drug-addicted wife Mattie (Dana Nicholson) and saloon singer Josephine Marcus (Danas Delaney) who has her sights set on Wyatt. A big production with a genuine feel for the mythical cowboy era, although the truth is more likely that the Earps and Holliday were as ruthless a gang as The Cowboys.

","The entire movie is a true ride. Kurt Russell is one of the most underrated actors of all time, but he pulls off Wyatt Earp as none have before. But just when you see Russell making Earp come to life, Val Kilmer takes Doc Holliday to a new level of brilliance! It is mesmerizing to watch Kilmer BECOME Holliday as none have done it before. His manners, his words, his drunkeness, are so incredibly wonderful to watch, that as good as Russell or anyone else in the cast are, you could throw them all away and just watch Kilmer doing Doc. Many people have wondered why Kilmer didn't win any award for this, and I can only say that it is a travesty of the system. There is no finer performance in any role by any one. The Val Kilmer interpretation of Jim Morrison is almost as dead on, but Val just lives Holliday in this, they are one and the same, and it is so real that you actually forget it's a movie. The drunken sweating cup twirl is fantastic, but even before that, when he talks Latin to Johnny Ringo and then just watches as Ringo twirls his own gun in Docs face, is sheer wonderfulness. Great movie, terrific acting, out of this world Val Kilmer."

","After having seen some other westerns from the late 80s-mid 90s,and having heard from friends about this movie,i decided to pick up Tombstone.The movie was a lot better then i ever thought it would be,and it has the look and feel of a great film,from maybe the 60s or 70s. <br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>After having retired as a lawman,Wyatt Earp decides to live in the town of Tombstone with his two brothers and his best friend Doc Holiday.When he gets to to the town,Earp finds out that there is a gang terrorising the town called The Cowboys.Everyone knows that The Cowboys think they are above everyone (even the law!) As Earp and his family and friends stay at Tombstone,he realises that he must come out of retirement and get everyone to to stand up to them.So Earp gets his family and friends to take out The Cowboys.This will lead them to Arizona for The Shootout at The o.k. Corral.But not all of Earps friends and family will be alive after the shootout. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Direction/screenplay,the film is directed by George (Rambo 2) P.Cosmatos and the screenplay is by Kevin Jarre.After having seen this film,i am suppressed that Cosmatos is (i feel) really under-rated as a director.The thing that Cosmatos does really well,is instead of letting the action drown the film down,he uses it at the right moment,so that the film is more a really great character piece.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Jarre does a great job with the characters,in giving them all there own time to build,and having the characters speak in a very ""natural"" way,so you can tell how much they are really good friends to each-other.The cast.<br/><br/>Whilst this film is a fantastic ensemble film,i have to point out the major to actors of this film.The first is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.I have to say that this is one of Kilmers best performances.(Along with his acting as the charismatic Jim Morrison in Oliver Stones flawed movie The Doors.) The other performance is Kurt Russell as the legendary Qyatt Earp.Russell (who has done some fantastic work with director John Carpenter and in the much under-rated film Breakdown,) does a really good job playing the every man,who you can see wants to do everything to help the people in the town.Acoures these two actors would not be able to work in such a great group of actors,that includes-Sam Elliott,Powers Boothe and the very under-used Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn who all make the film work with there strong support work. <br/><br/>Final view on the film: <br/><br/>A western that anyone can enjoy (even those who usually don't like westerns.)"

","The reason I love movies is my father. Because of him I grew up watching westerns and war movies, his two favourite genres. While I loved the fact that a huge number of things generally blew up in war movies, I always found the westerns to be more to my taste. The sun glaring off the sand, worried townsfolk scurrying indoors and the single gunman facing down the bad guys. Tombstone is a fantastic tribute to these movies.<br/><br/>Leaving historical accuracy aside, the plot is fairly straightforward. Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) brings together his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their respective spouses to seek their fortunes in the mining town of Tombstone. Personally I would have chosen the sister town, Happyland; still, what's in a name? There they meet old friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) and set about making money. Unfortunately, lawless gang 'The Cowboys' ruin everything by being loud, obnoxious, spitting, and shooting the occasional town sheriff and curse-laying priest. Wyatt gets involved though he doesn't really want to, and then Virgil takes the place as the new town sheriff, forcing the two brothers to become deputies. One thing leads to another and suddenly it's all guns blazing as the Earps and Holliday head to the OK Corral.<br/><br/>The Earps and Holiday kill three Cowboys. In retaliation the women folk are shot at, Virgil is crippled and poor Morgan killed. Earp decides enough is enough, becomes a US Marshall, and accompanied by his good friend Doc and three other companions, goes to seek bloody vengeance. We see the descent of Earp into vengeance-reaping killer, a man who loses himself until, at the end of the movie, he finds true love.<br/><br/>This is a movie of the myth of the Earp story, rather than some kind of Hollywood biography. Accept it as such and then we can talk.<br/><br/>Stylistically this movie owes a massive debt to the classic westerns of the past, and is in many ways a homage to them. However, please don't think that this makes it some simple movie. Although the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined, there is still plenty of symbolism to look out for. The priest at the beginning curses the Cowboys, saying that death would come on a pale horse, which initially is incorrectly translated as death riding on a sickly horse. Then Johnny Ringo shoots the poor priest in the forehead. As the Earps first go to face the Cowboys for the showdown at O.K. there are four of them, like the four horsemen heralding the apocalypse for the cowboys. Behind them we see fire. Now, it may just be a fantastic opportunity to make a great looking movie poster, or it may well be the fires of hell that Wyatt talks about following him later as he and Holliday begin their vendetta ride.<br/><br/>Of course it is this vendetta ride where the priests curse/prophecy comes true. Wyatt being death and the pallid Holliday could easily be called the 'sick' horse. Finally Johnny Ringo is shot and dies in the same way he killed the priest, one shot in the forehead.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are generally good. The supporting cast are very supportive, and throughout the movie faces pop up that are unexpected. Charlton Heston is the most obvious, but Billy Bob Thornton, Terry O'Quinn, Billy Zane and Michael Rooker all appear in relatively small parts. Kurt Russell is totally convincing as Wyatt, at times doing what appears to be a fine Clint Eastwood impression, but he's believable and looks good. The person who really shines of course is Val Kilmer. Playing the consumptive 'Doc', he's the cowboy all the little Goths want to grow up to be. He delivers every line with panache, his natural charisma turned up to eleven, and no matter what, there is always a look in his eye that says 'You may be holding four of a kind, but I know I've got me a royal flush. Call me, I dare you.' No, this isn't the greatest Western ever made, but it's probably been the most popular for the last 20 years. Give it a go if you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned gun slinging."
"jboothmillard","7","0","4","18 January 2007"," Tombstone
","Months before the Kevin Costner version was released, this Wyatt Earp film came out, and I think is almost better. Basically Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) has come back from cleaning up Dodge City, and now comes to the town of Tombstone, Arizona, and wishes to get rich in obscurity. He meets his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton) while there, as well as his old friend, Doc Holliday (a great Val Kilmer). They encounter a gang called The Cowboys (how original) who are causing chaos with random violent acts, and eventually it leads up to shoot ups at the OK Corral. Also starring Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocious, The Terminator's Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo and Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker. Very good!"
"monika-woods","7","0","1","18 November 2006"," Tombstone is for everyone
","I NEVER watched Western movies. When they came on TV, I would have rather pulled weeds. ""Tombstone"" takes a classic plot, a little bit of history and a lot of action to pull you in. Kilmer's performance as Doc is beautiful. His palid complexion is by no means an indication of his performance. Doc puts heart into the old west, and gives tenderness to the harshness of what was. Kurt Russel made Earp come to life for me. Sam Elliot was perfectly cast, as he has the perfect rugged, western look. Though Tombstone was loose in the interpretation of fact (as Hollywood always is), it opened up the reality of what the wild west was to a whole new generation. It put Westerns back on the books and intrigued me to learn more about the interesting life and times of some of the earliest contributing members of our western United States."
"Panamint","8","0","1","16 November 2006"," What a ride......
","A very good movie, well made action and with fine adult psychological aspects.<br/><br/>The law was what you made it. Hard to believe, but this was western America in the 1880's. Equally unbelievable to us nowadays is the fact that Earp's ride of vengeance really happened, but it did.<br/><br/>Outstanding performance by Russell. He nails Earp, and is the only actor to portray a sense of the personal charisma that Earp apparently had in real life. Kilmer is also good. He delivers a very watchable, outlandish and complex portrait of Doc Holliday that, like Russell, portrays a sense of who his character probably really was. Kilmer's and Russell's acting styles are so different that they interestingly show what a true odd couple these two historical characters were.<br/><br/>Powers Boothe portrays crazy, wild badness as the insane Curly Bill. A fine performance that provides a glimpse at one of the types of unrestrained humanity that were roaring across the western landscape in the 19th century. The other supporting actors also do a good job as they portray the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of human nature.<br/><br/>The director and actors have probably been to the real Tombstone, Arizona and have researched the subject matter. This is arguably the best of the Tombstone/Earp era movies. It is the only Tombstone/Earp movie you will ever need to see, but anyone who is not a western buff will also be entertained by these remarkable performances."
"MartianOctocretr5","7","0","1","25 October 2006"," Superior retelling of the OK Corral gunfight
","The legendary gunfight at the OK Corral has been addressed several times on film; this is a well designed and faithful retelling of the story.<br/><br/>For the 1990's, this was remarkably old-school western in its approach. The larger than life Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell, sporting a giant mustache) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, also mustachioed) are portrayed as the legend paints them: heroically brave, with only traces of dented halos. Both Russell and Kilmer occupy their respective roles as these historic gunfighters with exuberance and urgency. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are great as the remaining Earp bothers, Virgil and Morgan.<br/><br/>The movie, like most of the other versions of the OK Corral story, elects to take poetic license to inflate the legendary characters and events of Tombstone. One of the Earps and one of the Clanton gang gunmen are missing, and the order of a couple of events have been changed in chronology. A couple of items are omitted, and a couple others fabricated. However, the deviations from history are negligible and easy to overlook, as the movie's focus on developing the main characters is thereby enabled. There is good insight to the souls of Wyatt and Doc, and what they stood for. The steadily mounting animosity between the two camps, and how it is exacerbated with each skirmish, is presented well.<br/><br/>The gunfight itself is strategically handled, and realistic. Events before and after the fight are also developed and showcased well. A fine movie for history buffs or western fans."
"RAY-130","8","0","1","24 September 2006"," Wyatt Earp Vs Tombstone - An unfair comparison
","I have just watched back to back these two movies and ranked both an 8. Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman Etal made me feel that their movie was closer to history and also brought pride in their perceived honor. The chronicle from childhood to the 20th Century felt complete. BUT Then came Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Powers Boothe (Deadwood 93) etal and left me entertained to the ninth degree. The sheer pace of this one leaves you breathless. <br/><br/>these movies should be seen back to back and not compared as they tell two different stories occurring at the same time and place. Costner as Wyatt was more believable But Russell's Earp was more fun. Quaid was Doc Holiday but Kilmer had a holiday with the role. I will concede that Sam Elliott made Virgil his and nobody is going to take it away. Rent or buy both movies as it a worthwhile investment of your time."

How do I know--because when I come across it while channel surfing, I have to stop and watch--after all these years! Its clean (no sexual acts), fast moving and colorful. Its a movie were each character has a unique personality and appearance thus you can separate who is who. Which is my favorite character?? How can you pick one. Each was entertaining in his own way. I can also excusing the guns that never empty or historical inaccuracies. I should also add that this is a man's movie--no time wasted on the typical male bashing by macho women. The men were men and women were women."
"rainpeace87","8","0","1","4 May 2006"," Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer at their Best
","Tombstone really surprised me. I am not usually a Kurt Russell fan at all but as Wyatt Earp he was quite good in this movie. This is probably his best performance. I was not expecting much so I walked away pleasantly surprised. The plot is nothing especially unique, tension between good and bad leading to a showdown, but it does have some special qualities. The characters are well-rounded; the humor is dry and wonderful.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer's character, Doc Holliday, is especially witty. Aside from being comic his character seems to have much more depth to it. He keeps up this persona of careless living even as he is slowly dying from tuberculosis. Maybe the fact that death was imminent encouraged the idea that he had nothing to lose. Underneath the drunken exterior Doc shows himself to be a true friend to Wyatt. Even though he is very outgoing he does not have many, if any, other true friends and that means a lot to him. I especially like the scene where Wyatt is supposed to meet Johnny Ringo for a shoot-out. He knows Ringo is faster than him and that there's no way he can beat him but he goes anyways because he feels that he must in order to get things settled once and for all. Before he can get there, however, Doc (who has a very quick hand) shows up and takes his place. Even though he was so ill at that point that he was incredibly weak he still did that for his friend because he didn't want Wyatt to die. He probably figured that since he was going to die anyways he might as well take a crack at Ringo. If he could beat him then Wyatt wouldn't have to risk his life. If not, well, at least he tried.<br/><br/>Dana Delany is also quite good as Josephine Marcus. She is not your average woman who was ruled by men and whose only purpose was to get married and look pretty. She does not want to settle down in one place. Rather, she wants to travel around the world and see everything and, as she put it, ""live off of room service."" If she happened to meet someone (which of course she did) who could meld with her idea of life then wonderful but she wasn't going to settle for any less than she believed she deserved.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has it all; action, romance, justice, wit and most importantly well rounded characters that you can empathize with."

","I have seen this film probably 12 times. It's one of those movies that draws you in if you catch it on cable. Walk by the TV with this playing, and kiss your next two productive hours goodbye.<br/><br/>The script is solid, but it's performances, direction and editing where this film makes its mark. You can also throw a nice nod to the score, which supports the mood of the scenes, rather than attempt to create it.<br/><br/>Simply put, Val Kilmer should have been nominates for Best Supporting Actor. He and Kurt Russell give the move its soul. They are the emotional core and they nail it. Russell's Wyatt Earp is my favorite of all time.<br/><br/>George Cosmatos is an enigma. He's capable of doing this kind of work, yet he's also made some real crap during his career. The man obviously has talent and it shines brightly here. He came into the production after shooting had started, replacing the film's writer, Kevin Jarre.<br/><br/>Despite all the scenes that were cut, this film qualifies as a western epic, and I consider it a classic. I also think this movie is what Kurt Russell will be most remembered for.<br/><br/>""Tombstone"" is closer to the true story of the town, but is not meant to be factual.

","The time has been and gone for me to make a comment on this movie which readers would find original. There is one point I'd like to make though: the moment when Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday proves he ""wasn't as ill as he was making out"" and reaffirms he's still by far the ""fasted gun in the West"" by taking out Johnny Ringo- the pretender to his aforementioned throne before he can even draw the gun from its holster, is still Kilmer's all time screen highlight. This moment still gives me goose pimples- especially when it's set in the context of his relationship with his best friend Wyatt Earp, who was riding to face Ringo knowing he was too slow to defeat him.

If you like them, even a little bit, you'll probably love this film. It's the telling of the true story of Tombstone with the best cast of any Western: Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Val Vilmer, Sam Elliott, Terry O'Quinn, Michael Rooker, that guy from ""Wings"", Powers Boothe and others...<br/><br/>And the drama is there: a man torn between two women while his family is gunned down. And the action? It's the Old West! Gun fights everywhere you look! But the real story is the mustache parade. Val Kilmer in a silly mustache. Kurt Russell's mustache is a bit large. Both seem rather fake. Terry O'Quinn looks like his is real, not unlike the one he had in ""The Stepfather"". Bill Paxton's mustache is unremarkable. And the best mustache award goes to Sam Elliott. But that's obvious, because Elliott's mustache is his second-best quality (behind his gravely voice). In ""The Big Lebowski"" his mustache was massive. In ""The legacy"", his mustache actually had a co-starring role on the opening credits. One time I saw Sam without his mustache, and it was like Samson without his long hair.

The evil Curly Bill (that doesn't sound so evil) and his red rag gang run amok in the Earp's newly found retirement heaven. Soon things get out of control, a few deaths are involved, and vengeance is sought, then found, then forgotten just in time for retirement #2, which costars Dana Delany. Crazy run-on sentences abound and commas come flyin' from out of nowhere. The movie itself is very solid and tells a cromulent story that is sure to embiggen the hearts of all who witness it. The acting is darn good especially Russell and Kilmer who definitely steal the show. Billy Zane however is still missing. If you have any information on his whereabouts please contact the Unwanted Actors Outreach Center, Gary Busey will be standing by to take your phone calls, and yes he will try and talk to you for a long time because he has been forgotten by the general public and needs your attention.

Val Kilmer was both humorous and pathetic as the diseased and dieing Doc Holiday. I felt all of the actors were convincing and believable. This is certainly one of the better modern day westerns. Wyatt is portrayed as wanting to avoid being a lawman because he saw the risks as outweighing the benefits. It is others and circumstances that draw Wyatt into being a lawman and later he is incensed to the point of revenge bordering on lawless behavior himself. Dana Delaney provides an interesting distraction for our hero. The shootout is portrayed quite well and of course we know the outcome."

The film makes you feel like you can reach out and touch history, it gives you the feeling that you are really there.

Though Kurt Russell is excellent as the main protagonist Wyatt Earp, it is clearly Val Kilmer's character of Doc Holliday that makes the film. His acting is impeccable, and I don't think he has played a character as well since. He should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Performance. Even if you aren't a fan of Westerns, rent this movie...not only for the other fine performances, but for Doc Holliday as well.<br/><br/>There have been few fine great Westerns in the past 15 years...the only other that comes to mind is Unforgiven...another reason that makes this film special."
"nick-1227","10","0","1","21 December 2005"," A winning combination of violence, romance, thrill and heroism
","The opening to the film sets the scene beautifully. What appears to be an old film, cleverly well captured to create the illusion of a historic background. However note the spoof of the obvious silhouette of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.<br/><br/>The first scene is an interesting sketch, gaining the audience's favour against the cowboys. This is an important point, as it is the basis for the film. What is most impressive about this scene other then the introduction of the well read Jonny Ringo, is the end of scene cut. This should be highlighted to any director of when, and how to cut. The scene ends with the quote from Revelations ' Beyhold the pale horse, and the man one him was called death, and all hell followed'. This is very well directed as the next items to appear are Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp riding a train. Reading more into this, it is a premonition of things to come, mainly Wyatt Earp being the destroyer of the cowboy gang, in other words the one bringing death to the cowboys.<br/><br/>The next, and perhaps most delicious, extrovert and intriguing item i wish to draw to your attention, is the relationship between the cool, calm and sophisticated John 'Doc' Holiday; and the legendary peace officer Wyatt Earp. These pair somewhat resemble the odd couple, and make the movie what it is, in particular Doc Holiday. IT is this type of skillful writing and acting that make you wish you could travel back in time and become that character. The perfectly timed whit rivals modern day comic actors, and the slick comments make you want to base your existence around being Holiday's persona.<br/><br/>Furthermore the scene toward the end of the film, in which we see the final showdown between Holiday and Ringo, is one of several climactic events. This in my opinion is the greatest of them, because of the lighting, and because we get to see for real how quick Holiday is at drawing, combined with his skill, and deadly aim. When Holiday does draw his gun, it is like a perfectly rehearsed dance move, the elegance of the movement, and the calm, effortless look on his face add to the hype of this single moment. This scene is why i class this film as my favourite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Finally, a very good reason why this film is so entertaining, is because it offers more then a well plotted western. Aside from this, it offers a captivating tale of love, lust and flirtation. This intricately worked love story is between Josphene MArcus, and 'the tall glass of water' Wyatt Earp. This is different to most chick flick love stories, because it seems real, and is believable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, i may not be an expert on films, but i can give many, many reasons why you should watch this film. It appeals to varied audiences, and because it is based on a true story, it makes every aspect more thrilling."

"TheUnknown837-1","10","0","1","18 July 2005"," One of the best Westerns ever
","Tombstone is one of my top favorite movies for its action, humor, and great plot and acting. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Michael Biehn, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Harry Carey Jr., and the others do an excellent job of portraying the real men who lived back in the 1880s. Kurt Russell did a fantastic job of playing Wyatt Earp and he also bears quite a facial resemblance. Val Kilmer practically stole the picture as Doc Holliday. He was excellent at being casual, humorous, and dangerous all at the same time. And personally, out of them all, I like Michael Biehn (who we all know as Reese from The Terminator) as the sadistic and ruthless murderer Johnny Ringo. And after him I do favor Powers Boothe as the equally dangerous Curly Bill Brocious. They did their roles very well. And wow, Michael Biehn is equally great as being a bad guy as well as a hero. He just did a spectacular performance in my opinion. And the long gunfire-filled vendetta at the end is one of the best I've ever seen (although nothing compared to the shootouts in Open Range). Although Tombstone is a fun movie to watch, there are a lot of historical differences regarding the lives of the Earps. I will list a few examples. One, Virgil Earp (Sam Elliott) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton)were not shot on the same night. It was actually three months apart. And for Morgan's murder, there would be no need for the doctor to dig through his spine looking for the bullet, because in fact, Morgan was hit with a shotgun and the shell had gone clean through him and embedded itself into the leg of another man. Also, it is only suspected and not proved that Doc Holliday killed Johnny Ringo. Because Ringo was found tucked against some trees with a bullet lodged in his temple, some say it was suicide. And also, Sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) wasn't sheriff when the Earps came to Tombstone, he became a lawman after they arrived. Another Earp brother, Warren was also involved in what happened in Tombstone, but he didn't get involved in the gunfight. Another thing, the cowboy gang wasn't distinguished by red sashes they wore. They didn't have anything distinguishing in truth. And they didn't have any leaders after Old Man Clanton (the father of Ike and Billy Clanton) died. But Ringo and Brocious were the most famous after Old Man Clanton passed away. Tombstone is a fun movie to watch, and although not 100% accurate in historical means, one of my favorite movies to watch."

","I must confess that I never expect much from Kurt Russell as an actor, but when it comes to the often played role of the legendary Wyatt Earp, I taken aback at how well he came across.Russell gave the role a tough, grittiness that in my opinion is quite effective.For my taste,it is the best portrayal of Earp I have seen,which is quite a compliment considering the Hollywood heavyweights that have tackled the role in the past.Equally impressive is the performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.He exuded an undeniable charm here.Upon viewing recently for the first time in many years,I discovered an impressive amount of actors who would go on to bigger roles later.A pre Sling Blade Billy Bob Thornton,a pre Titanic Billy Zane,Thomas Haden Church,just to name a few.Performances aside,this is the most compelling presentation of this often told story."

I don't think it's possible to find another actor more suited to playing a cowboy in todays Hollywood.

","Everyone knows the story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at O.K. Corral. This film covers the events before AND after that event with a beauty and ferocity that is rarely seen in westerns. Kurt Russell does well as Wyatt, Boothe as Curly Bill, Biehn as Johnny Ringo, but the real showman is Val Kilmer as the chronic killer ""Doc"" Holliday and turns in the best depiction of the gunslinger since Kirk Douglas. He is astounding. I think it was the best role he ever had and he makes the most of it. Kilmer makes you care about his character like no else can and his chemistry with Russell works like a charm. The casting was very good and the realism is unmatched. The gunfights are entertaining and keep your attention. There is tension and suspense in Tombstone like no other western you can feel it permeating the whole picture. Forget the movie ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner this one knocks it out of the box rather easily. It's destined for classic status and is re-watchable which is unusual for most films being made today."

The physical debilitation, the polished gentleman on the skids, the whole nine, was there. Whether the genius was actor, director, or both- his Doc Holliday is a tough act to follow. All the other actors were top notch -making the ensemble seamless. Newer efforts like Deadwood are interesting experiments in ""realism"", but real art is worth watching over again and enjoying.

","Like True Romance, released the same year, this movie has one of the best casts ever, and is more remarkable because everyone plays their parts extremely well without trying to out do one another. The film is about Wyatt Earp, the OK Corral etc, but focuses more on his relationship with his family and friends, including Doc Holiday, played by Val Kilmer who perhaps should have won the Oscar. The action scenes are all exceptional ,there is some awesome dialogue, Biehn and Russel are also worthy of nominations, and the film manages to evoke every emotion. There are funny, moments, sad ones too, all making an effective western, one without racial prejudices etc. Probably the last good Western."

","If you believe in fate, and Hollywoods endings that are completely detached from reality, then this feature is for you ! Kurt Russell shines as Wyatt Earp, retired law enforcement officers, with brothers Virgil(Sam Elliot) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The gunfight at the OK Corral is dispatched midway of the movie, and then the real story begins.The Earp brothers relocate to Tombstone,AZ. This is where they encounter the ""Cowboys"" based on a real life group of thugs, they don't seem to like each other. So , after throwing a chubby faced Billy Bob Thornton out of a local gaming facility, Wyatt decides to run the establishment. ""Doc"" Holiday (Val Kilmer) steals the show as the sickly killer, with a sympathetic following. Wyatts ailing wife played by Dana Wheeler-Erickson, is a crutch to Wyatt, whose ambitions outweigh his sense of right and wrong. Enter Dana Delany , how convenient, another portal for Wyatt to take comfort in. As a matter of fact, the movie always has an answer for every situation! But the redeeming factors are the even pace, magnificent cinematography, and excellent acting ! Look for Jason Priestly in a throwaway role, and Charlton Heston in a cameo as a rancher. The movies basic philosophy is that might makes right !<br/><br/>So if you are ready to suspend reality, a lot of killing , especially toward the end of the movie, and an unreal dance in the snow, by all means take the afternoon off, and see ""Tombstone"", not a great movie, but enjoyable fare with a Hollywood ending ! I give it a 7.5 for overall effort!"
"The_Void","8","0","3","26 November 2004"," Russell, Paxton and Kilmer raise some hell in a small town
","Legendary lawman Wyatt Earp is now a retired man, and has decided to travel to the town of 'Tombstone' to find his fortune. While there, he meets his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan along with his good friend Doc Holliday; and all is fine and dandy. That is, until an infamous band of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' turns up to spoil Wyatt's party. These are the outlaws that Wyatt loved to dispatch in his prime, but now all he wants is to retire and have done with it...will he be able to do that, or is it time for him to re-enter the frey?<br/><br/>Kurt Russell takes the lead role of Wyatt Earp for this movie, and does a good job with it (despite a very silly mustache). When justifying his reasons for casting Russell in Escape From New York, John Carpenter said that he could play anybody; and I think he can...but he's a lot better at roles that require him to show off, and he doesn't really get that chance here. Still, it's different and refreshing to see him in a more serious role. Russell gets support from a number of good actors, one of which being one of my personal favourites, Bill Paxton. Like Kurt, Paxton isn't given reign to play to his strengths here either. Paxton is at his best when he's running the show like he was in Aliens and Near Dark (despite them also being supporting roles), but his character here is a more subdued one, so he doesn't shine as much as he had previously. Val Kilmer is the only cast member that is allowed to go over the top in his role. He plays Doc Holliday; the drunken, loud mouthed braggart of the film and spends most it making quips and generally showing off. Although this does the film credit as it makes it more exciting, it does become annoying after a while. These are the stars that stick out the most, but also getting in on the fun to complete an excellent cast are Sam Elliot, Paxton's Aliens co-star; Michael Beihn, and Powers Boothe, the man he would later cast in the excellent 'Frailty'. Then there's Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker and we've even got Robert Mitchum doing the narrating!<br/><br/>The film is very dramatic; a lot of the cast look like they could auditioning for the next Oscar ceremony, and the music adds to the theatrics, coming in whenever there's a whisper of a heartbreaking or exciting moment (the latter of which the film has plenty). However, this over-dramatization adds to the campy feel of the film and it makes it quite fun to watch. Tombstone is a very good movie; it's well shot, the acting is good enough and it remains entertaining for it's duration, and it's certainly one of the better westerns that have been released since 'Unforgiven' was met with critical acclaim in 1992. However, it's no classic."

","Well, our friend Val Kilmer comes on strong in this gem of an entertaining western. Even though this story is centered on the Earp brothers, the character of Doc Holliday played by Kilmer is the most intriguing. His make-up is convincing and you have no doubt that this man is a ""lunger"" as his adversary Ringo calls him. Actually, Kilmer portrays a very horrible killer but you look up to him as a lovable light-hearted hero in this movie.<br/><br/>His character is like Mike Tyson in many ways; you resent the personality, crimes and mistakes but you cheer for him and want to see him destroy his adversary. You would want this guy protecting your butt, but would not want him marrying your daughter. The most memorable lines for me are when Holliday challenges Ringo after Ringo challenges Wyatt Earp. ""I'm your huckleberry...just say when..."".<br/><br/>You see, in the Old West days, there were gunslingers who were simply masters at quick draw shooting. In those days, it was fair game to challenge to a gun battle anyone who carried a firearm. Even though Wyatt Earp was a ruthless lawman, he did not have a chance in heaven at defeating Ringo. But Holliday WAS a legendary gunslinger just like Ringo and Ringo respected and feared Holliday's skills. With that being said, you must hold on to your seat as the story moves to an exciting scene with an inevitable confrontation. Val Kilmer is a brilliant performer.

Kurt Russell does a superb job playing Wyatt and I must say Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott do their rolls justice also as his brothers. BUT, the most excellent and brilliant performance comes from Val Kilmer who plays the part of the legendary, Dr. John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday. Without Kilmer's awesome performance, this film, in my opinion, would just be mediocre and no better.

","""Tombstone"" is a gem of a movie. It has everything a good movie should have: action, drama, romance, and comedy. An all-star cast and good writing round it out to make it an awesome film.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell did a good job starring as retired lawman Wyatt Earp. Along with scene-stealing Val Kilmer as the best on-screen Doc Holliday to date, the chemistry between those two was awesome. They played well off of one another, and showed a deep friendship between the two legends. Other notable performances include Michael Biehn as the contemptible gunfighter outlaw and rival to Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo; Sam Elliot as Wyatt's older, more world-weary brother, Virgil; and Bill Paxton as Wyatt's light-hearted and more innocent brother, Morgan, whose best moment in the film came with Morgan's realization of what it felt like to really kill someone, even doing it to save Doc's life.<br/><br/>Someone else mentioned that this movie is more ""popcorn"" fair, as far as Westerns go. I don't agree. I think this movie, while not going as far as some, still manages to convey character depth, just more subtly, and I must admit, taking a back seat to much of the action. <br/><br/>I have two complaints about this movie. One, some of the scenes were incredibly graphic. The opening sequence at the mission, designed to make the viewer despise the outlaw gang, The Cowboys, did a good job at that. But it was a little hard to take, as was the part after Doc shot Ringo. The camera angles were strange, and jarring to the eye. Two, the parts of the women in the film, aside from Josephine, were too small and not very developed. I would have liked to know more about Louisa and Allie, Virgil and Morgan's wives. But for all that, this movie is an excellent movie, and I would recommend it for anyone who likes Westerns.<br/><br/>Note: the majority of this film was filmed at Old Tucson, a movie studio built in 1939. It's a place tourists can go. However, a fire nine years ago has changed what it looks like now, as opposed to then. But if you'd ever been there before 1995, you can recognize the places they filmed in Old Tucson!"

Trouble in the town of Tombstone is always caused by the merciless Cowboy gang, who the Marshals of Tombstone must stop. Not with vengeance, but with justice.

Kilmer has the most memorable lines combined with awesome action scenes that all really come off nicely. Kilmer definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance. I love the action and personality each character brings to the table. If I had not already seen this movie I probably would have critiqued it for my Film class.

","This is one of my all-time FAVORITE films! I'm not particularly partial to movie westerns, but I AM very much interested in history, and even though there were minor liberties taken with certain details, this version was surprisingly accurate in MOST aspects of the story of the Earps, the Clantons, the ""Cowboys,"" and Doc Holliday -- moreso, in fact, than in any other film that I've seen on the subject.  (The DVD version comes with a great ""bonus"" disk which includes interesting interviews with cast and crew members, and behind-the-scenes production information.  It's fascinating to see how much painstaking effort was put into the production details, by cast and crew alike, in order to make the sets, costumes, and characters appear as authentic as possible).  <br/><br/>The story is SO well-acted, and so engrossing and entertaining, that I found it impossible to sit and nit-pick about historical accuracy; instead, I just relaxed and went along on a VERY enjoyable ride! As an example, in one scenario in which fact is unknown but theories abound --i.e., the circumstances surrounding the demise of the real Johnny Ringo -- the screenwriters presented a theoretical, but AWESOME, showdown scene between Ringo and ....oops!...won't spoil it for those of you who haven't already seen the movie -- but it's a MUST SEE!<br/><br/>The cast was SUPERB, with special kudos to Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp -- EXCELLENT!!! -- (made me realize that he's capable of SO much more than I'd ever seen from him before) -- and to Val Kilmer, for his BRILLIANT portrayal of Doc Holliday -- he came, he saw, and he conquered the HELL out of that part! Also, Sam Elliot delivers his usual high-calibre performance, as Virgil Earp, and...well, there really wasn't a weak link in the entire cast! -- It is truly one of the greatest groups of actors that has EVER been brought together for any one production!

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>It feels almost appropriate in the same week that ""Open Range"" is released in Britain and once again Westerns make a comeback to really consider the last time this really happened. In 1993, not for the first time and not for the last, two films were created on exactly the same topic. In that year Holywood released the overly long and slightly infuriating Wyatt Earp staring Kevin Costner (again I'm just going to quickly plug ""Open Range"" which looks impressive from the trailers), but Holywood also released this film, ""Tombstone"".<br/><br/>In ""Tombstone"", we're told by Robert Mitchum's narration about the ""Cowboys"", an outlaw gang who control the area. This gang is recogniseable by the Red Sashes around it's members waists and when the film begins they run around doing basically exactly what they like. At this point enters the man of the hour, the legend Wyatt Earp. Earp arrives on a train with the plan of retiring and settling down with his brothers Morgan and Virgil and the three brothers wives. This peace doesn't last however and eventually Earp is forced to put his retirement on hold as he fights first unwillingly, and then for retribution.<br/><br/>It's been a strange habit of mine over the last few months to praise practically every single film I've seen. Whilst there's been one or two I've heavily criticised, the vast majority of the time I'll talk about how wonderful a film is and generally describe it as either close to a masterpiece or a masterpiece itself. Well in this case I'm going to make a discerning effort not to. If anything I'm going to make an effort to actually condemn this film.<br/><br/>In ""Tombstone"", the key areas of Wyatt Earp are played out. We don't get to find out about his childhood or his earlier years and are forced to make do with only the action packed years around the town on which the film is named. This film contains a vast spectrum of talents ranging from Kurt Russell and the amazing Val Kilmer, through to cameo's from Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley and  Billy Zane. Also we have outstanding performances as the leaders of the Cowboys by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn. Despite this though, do we really have anyone with as charasmatic a figure as Kevin Costner (I am joking if you hadn't gathered).<br/><br/>Ok, so far I'm not doing a good job at really condemning this film, but truthfully, why should I? ""Tombstone"" is just another of those modern Westerns which aims to mix a sense of realism in with a fantastic plot and an amazing cast. Add to this the special effects and you've got a hit. So it might not be worthy of a place anywhere near the Internet Movie Database Top 250, who cares. If you want to watch a clever, gritty, correctly lengthed Western from the last twenty years, this is the film for you."

He convinced me to watch the movie based solely upon Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday.<br/><br/>
Well, I thought Val Kilmer was magnificent in ""The Doors"" and ""Heat"" and have been a fan of his since ""Real Genius"" so I grudgingly agreed to watch the movie.  Even as I put the VHS tape in the VCR, I was dreading my promise to him.  I waited to watch the movie until late last evening, ensuring a smooth transition into dreamland because I would be bored to tears and let's face it:  a boring movie is better than a sleeping pill.  Okay, here: ""You were right, honey."" <br/><br/>This film captivated me in the first 5 minutes.  I went into the movie having little to no knowledge of the story of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. Basically I knew their names from history; however before last evening I couldn't have told you whether they were ""good guys"" or ""bad guys."" <br/><br/>
The performances by Mr. Russell and Mr. Kilmer were phenomenal as I was transported back to the day of the Wild West.  Val Kilmer *was* Doc Holliday.  He oozed sex appeal, emotion, and honesty; every woman who has ever watched this movie wishes she were Doc's Kate.  Holliday was extremely attached to Wyatt Earp ~ the depth of the friendship beautifully portrayed by both actors.   Either would have given his life for the other.   The additional performances by Elliott as Wyatt's brother Virgil, and by Paxton as their brother Morgan, gave us a further glimpse into the dynamic lives of the Earp Family.   <br/><br/>This movie has everything:  good vs. evil, comedy (Holliday's response to Johnny Ringo's pistol twirling show), action, suspense, romance and some incredibly moving and emotional scenes.  I cried twice, once almost to the point of sobbing.  It has been a very long time since I had been so moved to that point by a film.  I have watched it three times in the last 24 hours and am planning on purchasing it for my own VHS collection.  Hmmmmm ... now may be a good time to upgrade to DVD .........<br/><br/>Revisit Tombstone ... remember when you wanted to be a cowboy?  And ladies, you know you want him.  *wink*"
"MovieMusings","Null","0","1","27 December 2002"," very good western
","I don't know much about what is ""truth or fiction"" where the real story of Wyatt Earp is concerned, but, as a western, this film is absolutely splendid.<br/><br/>There is a real feel for the west of the time, a time when the battle with the natives is no longer an issue, but the juxtaposition of white and Mexican cultures comes more towards the fore (how many people know that ""Mexico"" once included everything from Mexico to Utah?!). It has a feel for the way in which law was managed in these alienated towns, long before information technology and central intelligence could unite national law enforcement, and ""the law"" in any given town was simply the local sheriff, who didn't spend 2 or 3 years in a law enforcement program at the local community college, he just walked into the local sheriff's office and said ""I wanna work with you"" and when he was the last man standing whom the people trusted, he'd be sworn in.<br/><br/>In this story, Wyatt Earp comes riding into town, and installs himself as a protector, able to negotiate a fee for keeping rif-raf out of a local establishment, simple as that. It was mighty easy back in those days to just saddle up your horse, go somewhere else and start all over. No real estate agents, no hiring moving companies, no sending change of address cards to all your creditors, no having to prove employment or demonstrate good credit in order to get a new place, no having to come up with ""first and last,"" no reference checks... no hassles with the phone company to change your service, no worries about ""no vacancy"" or high mortgage interest rates...no decision about whether to live ""closer to downtown with more crime but access to amenities or out in the suburbs with bigger lots but a longer commute to work""...never having to fight for a tight parking spot...instead of having to buy a new car, you just owned some horses that could have babies...<br/><br/>The gun culture and gun play is remarkable. Folks would walk into an establishment and check their guns the way we today check our coats. Itchy trigger fingers abounded, and a man watched his adversary's eyes for the slightest hint as to whether this was going to be the showdown, right here, right now, or whether they'd walk away to square off another day. When they did finally square off, the townsfolk treated ""another dead body in the middle of town"" almost matter-of-factly. A shout-out was almost like the only real family entertainment. Folks didn't hide between shuttered windows, they lined the streets for a front-row seat!<br/><br/>As I mentioned in my comments on ""The Quick and the Dead,"" Tombstone is a much more authentic movie (of course, that's a matter of conjecture, since I wasn't ""there"" living in Colorado in 1830 :-) but guns just weren't that accurate. Also, Tombstone is a lot ""darker"" - after all, they didn't have overhead lights the way we do today, after sundown it was bloody dark! I also found it rained a little too much in The Quick and the Dead, and it seemed to rain quite a bit in Tombstone as well (forgive me, but when I think of the west, I think of arid desert conditions where rain just doesn't happen a whole lot - although I'm no meteorologist and perhaps both movies were filmed during the rainy season...??)<br/><br/>Both movies also had a good view of medicine back then. If you got shot, chances are you were either done for, or you'd have some ugly scars. Doctors couldn't do a whole lot more than pour whiskey on the wound and into your mouth, while they either tried to remove bullets without anesthesia or stood over your abdominal wounds and just shook their head ""nope, he ain't gonna make it."" (and, in The Quick and the Dead, the presence of the undertaker was an interesting note, grim with his black hat!)<br/><br/>Anyway, there are some bad guys running the town, and ""the people"" beg the Earp brothers, with some help from their old friend quick-gun Doc Holliday, to restore some law and order in this town. In this story, Kurt Russell is the reluctant Wyatt who is dragged into conflict with the bad guys due to his brothers giving in to put badges on their chest; this leads to the showdown, and a final reckoning of who will run things in Tombstone.<br/><br/>If you want the true story of Wyatt Earp, do some surfing, there are plenty of websites offering their versions of who he was, good or bad. If you want to see a good story of how life was in the west, see Tombstone!"

","This film is amazing. I have watched it about 20 times and i never get bored of it. Kurt Russell is excellent as Wyatt Earp but by far the best performance is by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. From the moment the film starts to the very end there isn't a moment that wont keep you enthralled. I personally am not that bothered by Western movies but this one is amazing, so even if you don't like most westerns i would recommend you watch this one anyway. The rest of the cast are also fantastic, from the Earp Brothers Virgil and Morgan to Johny Ringo. This film changed my opinion of Val Kilmer. 10/10!!!!"

","This movie is great,even though I am not a big western fan.The history isn't exactly accurate,but it did get me intrested in learning more about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday,The Clantons,Johnny Ringo,& Tombstone AZ. I am not a big fan of Val Kilmer,but his performance as Doc Holliday was very impressive,so much so that I decided to check out his performance in ""Batman Forever"". Kilmer's version of Doc was far superior to Dennis Quaid's in ""Wyatt Earp"".He was funnier & tougher than the Quaid version. If Kilmer would stick to roles like Doc & Batman,he would be a bigger caliber box-office draw today than he is. This movie has made an old west history buff out of me.

","The movies portrayals of Wyatt Earp and the southern gentleman Doc Holiday surpassed my high expectations. The actors were outstanding.

"rjray","10","0","1","30 July 2002"," The Best of my Least-Favorite Genre
","I actually can barely stand westerns. Maybe because I was raised in the midwest, in the same town as the Cowboy Hall of Fame. Call it over-exposure.<br/><br/>But, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen, in any genre. The cast is what makes this movie stand so far above the rest. The dialog, the scenery are all first-rate. This is the only western I own on DVD, and I pre-ordered it when it was scheduled to be released. Whether you are a long-time fan of westerns or a more of a comedy or action fan like myself, you really will enjoy this movie if you give it a spin."
"jdb-4","Null","0","1","25 July 2002"," One of the best movies I ever seen!
","I read some of the comments and was surprised that some people didn't like this film. This was a great film! It's not ""Gone With The Wind"" and was never meant to be. When you judge a movie you have to judge it first on entertainment value.  Historical accuracy is almost last on the list, if it wasn't the film would be a documentary. Russell is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. Kilmer was great as Holliday. Who ever put this film together knows how to produce. They got some of the best actors in Hollywood to take minor roles. That is not easy. Trust me on that."
"PeachHamBeach","Null","0","1","18 May 2002"," Fun Fun Fun From Beginning To End!!!
","WARNING...MIGHT BE SOME SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>This is the best ""new"" Western movie I've ever seen and it's still one that I can watch and it's never stale or loses its power.  It's got a terrific all star cast (without the really big tiresome annoying names)and it's just pure entertainment,  action,  comedy,  drama.  I just love Kurt Russell, he's perfect as the most famous of the three Earp brothers,  Wyatt,  a former U.S. Marshall who migrates from Kansas to the silver-rush boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona, hoping to strike it rich and live a more peaceful life as a civilian.  He meets up with his brothers Virgil (another perfectly cowboy-ish actor, Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). There are a couple of snags in the way of happiness for Wyatt though.  His wife is addicted to laudenaum (an old time version of morphine) and there is a gang of vicious criminals who frighten even the sheriff and mayor of the little boomtown. Lead by Ringo (the always magnificent Michael Biehn) and Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) these Cowboys wear red sashes and wreak havok on the streets, shooting innocent people,  terrorizing the local businesses and generally making life miserable for everyone in town. Eventually, Virgil and Morg get fed up with the Cowboy Gang and decide to get involved with a campaign to get rid of them,  much to Wyatt's chagrin...all he wants is to live life in peace,  without guns and violence.  But he soon finds out that there will never be any peace until someone shows the Cowboys that their violence and mayhem won't be tolerated.  With the help of their loyal friend Doc Holliday, (Val Kilmer's finest moments!!!) who is suffering with ""consumption"",  The Earp Brothers wage an all out war that includes the famous ""Gunfight At the O.K. Corral"".  There are some sad, wrenching moments of violence and death and blood, some heartfelt romance and Doc Holliday's smart aleck one liners make for some great comedy relief!!! I give it ****!!!"
"bobswife","9","0","1","17 April 2001"," A movie to watch again and again
","*** tiny spoiler about romance included **  I do not like action films.  I do not like shoot-em-up scenes.  I do not like movies with cursing and taking God's name casually.  I do not generally stay awake and alert during Westerns.  Why, then, did I run out and buy this after one viewing? Why do I drag family and friends over to enjoy it with me?  This movie is visually beautiful but deals with rough times and difficult themes.  The characters are full of contradiction, just as in real life. The acting is great, down to every bit part. The action does not get boring even after you've seen it enough times to know exactly what will happen.  There are more quotable lines than you can shake a Peacemaker at.  Kurt Russell -- I still have trouble believing it is he! -- is so good at creating a persona who is admirable yet unsure of the deeper aspects of life.  Val Kilmer is riveting in his portrayal of Doc Holliday: it is a hypnotically intense portrait, brimming with pathos.  PLEASE don't get the idea that it is some cerebral, talk-filled flick.  I watch the shooting and horse-riding scenes over & over because they are so clever.  But even if you only like action and bang-bang-you're-dead stuff, I guarantee you will be doing a mental ""compare & contrast"" of the characters days later, and discussing them with others. You'll be sifting thru the many fan sites devoted to this multi-layered movie and watching again and again to catch some trivial background action or piece of dialogue.  Don't expect historical accuracy -- it's a movie! -- and don't expect it to be either totally realistic or squeaky-clean. My only two complaints are that the DVD comes in widescreen while my husband enjoys full-frame (wah wah), and I don't like the silly romance between Wyatt and It's-Obvious-To-Whom, who is an unattractive person, being a 10-year-old mind in a woman's body."

","I greatly enjoyed this file, over the Kevin Costner Version ""Wyatt Earp"" released about the same time.<br/><br/>Ignoring the beginning and the hollywood ending, from about the time Marshall Fred White was killed up to the scene at the train station was fairly accurate for history buffs.  I must say Kurt Russells' and Sam Elliots' acting to me was above par.  along with veteran Robert Mitchum's narration as well as the intense music made this movie.<br/><br/>When the 4 marshalls rounded the corner on the way to the OK correl, you could just cut the tension with a butter knife.<br/><br/>This is a must see film for Western lovers and history buffs."
"coverme6","Null","0","1","8 June 2000"," Rip-snortin', yet kind of dull
","Kurt Russel makes a fine Wyatt Earp in this otherwise decent<br/><br/>western.

Wyatt and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan<br/><br/>(Bill Paxton) along with Doc had cleaned up the dusty town of<br/><br/>Tombstone, but a group of nasty bandits raid the nice village,<br/><br/>persuading the Earp Bros. and company to save the town, a la<br/><br/>""The Magnificent Seven."" <br/><br/>This is a nice flick, but it doesn't really hold the viewer's<br/><br/>interest long enough like how a real western should.

","My friends recommended this movie to me, saying it was one of their favorite movies of all time.  I watched it the very next day, expecting an amazing, spell-binding western/action.  Suffice to say, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I AM a fan of western movies, and this was by far the worst one I have ever seen.  The characters in this film triggered no emotional response from me, and by the end of the movie, I could barely sit still I was so bored.  The action scenes were dull and slow, and the dialogue was absolutely atrocious. But maybe I was expecting too much from this movie because it came so highly recommended. See if I ever watch a movie recommended from those friends again.<br/><br/>Final Thought:  I do not recommend this film; it was a complete waste of my time."
"dust-7","Null","0","1","9 March 2000"," Almost - not quite
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>A Val Kilmer showcase - though to be fair Holliday was an interesting character; doomed with incurable tb, out west (or Puerto Rico for awhile?) trying to live as a doomed man, always a step ahead of the law or actually escaping arrest, violent, crooked, mean, but a friend of the Earps.<br/><br/>I think the Russell portrayal of Wyatt was fair enough, and reading Wyatt's accounts and testimonies, it's probably how Earp saw himself. Might have been nice to tie in the Wells Fargo angle, particularly as they went to the trouble to have an office in the town for the movie.<br/><br/>The gang was broadly portrayed, too, though you never saw them rob a stage, just generally cut up in town. You never saw the HQ ranches - making them the 'first gang', the 'cowboys', etc. And the owners of the Clanton Ranch, today, have their own take on things, suggested in the film, as well.<br/><br/>And the fight seems fairly described, with some of the gang unarmed, and Doc doing most of the shooting. Why they were waiting in the alley still seems something for speculation, considering it may have been just across the street from the window of Doc's hotel room. But, basically, this and the set up and Wyatt heading the posse later, is pretty much fact.<br/><br/>What's missing is the feel of that period in the old west. The costumes are too flowery, the lighting is not Arizona or NM, the buildings look both too clean and too modern, save maybe for the Grand Hotel, and so on. And of course, the Dana Delaney 'love interest' seems tossed in, though it is important to the film's plot.<br/><br/>And worse, the feel of the situation itself isn't developed. What about the friendships and animosities? It seems as if the background had to occur only in town, that old friends could only get together in town, that the threats and fights - in town. But these guys, good and bad, got around. And not everything happened - in town - unless I guess one wanted to shoot a Hollywood movie pretending its Tombstone.<br/><br/>It seemed at times more an outline for movie than a movie, more an attempt to try and stay with the historical fact while superficially blending in Hollywood cliches, rather than just telling the story of the feud, of that 'gang family', true to the beliefs of the day, the expectations of that time, and even the look and feel of Tombstone and outlying ranches.<br/><br/>The movie seemed more cut/view, buy it/reshoot, and so on, than a smooth telling of the story of the Earps and the Clanton gang."
