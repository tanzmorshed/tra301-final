"DonFishies","8","302","385","16 July 2011"," Bittersweet, emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious
","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.<br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have hit a rough patch in their long-time marriage, and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed, Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar, attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a professional bachelor, takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife, and become a new man in the process.<br/><br/>But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters, but Crazy, Stupid, Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentine's Day, and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it, and stood out more as an example of every rom-com stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully, Crazy, Stupid, Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.<br/><br/>While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behind-the-scenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman, who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus, and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this, but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances, plays other sequences totally unconventionally, play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at, and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcom-like shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal, moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation, and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most, and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences, and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again, and make even better. Gosling plays against type, and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene, nailing every line and mannerism, while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone else's performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances, easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys, but hold their own on- screen.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role, conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances, and gives the performance a well-rounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good, but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannah's best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone, playing one of Cal's conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously over-the-top, but never falters. Her performance may be one-note, but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.<br/><br/>If I hold anything against the film (other than the final act stumble and the oh-so convenient way one particular scene comes together), it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy, Stupid, Love. is, but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters, and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet, and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"IronBallsM","Null","212","270","4 August 2011"," I enjoyed everything about this movie.
","My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that I've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately. So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the ""A"" story you wonder why and start to think that the ""B"" story is going to be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not and everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done."
"nicki9112","9","231","307","30 July 2011"," It works
","You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of them fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!"
"Reel_starz","9","135","179","4 August 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, Love is a real crowd-pleaser
","It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room, a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of ""Oh no!"" even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that, much like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times, painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.<br/><br/>Using a witty, compassionate and ever-so-slightly subversive script from Dan Fogelman, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who are best known for writing the pitch-black comedy/satire Bad Santa and only have one other directorial effort under their belts (last year's I Love You, Philip Morris), guide the production along with subtle ease. They strike an ideal balance between humor and drama, allowing the overall tone to develop organically. Laughs come mostly in chuckles at the cleverness of a line or its delivery and are never awkwardly forced in to lighten up a scene, while the emotions feel genuine without becoming manipulative. Most of all, their restrained approach allows the actors to breathe and to fully embody the characters they've been given.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, has there ever been a more likable group of people assembled for a film, much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels remarkably well, and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain; even when a character threatens to become unlikable, the actor portrays him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes hard, if not impossible, to not root for each and every one of them. Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy, they pull it back, making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable lead of the film, Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth he'd only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The 40-Year-Old Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office, while Ryan Gosling, all immaculate grooming, sly grins and twinkling eyes, is perfectly cast as his foil, Jacob, a suave ladies' man who's really using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and Hannah, respectively, radiating a down-to-earth presence and relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo, who form Crazy, Stupid, Love's youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored by the movie's publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.<br/><br/>What truly sets Crazy, Stupid, Love apart from other modern-day romantic comedies, aside from the perceptive writing and direction and a dream cast, is that it strives to be meaningful, rather than just mindless, predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of clichés (precocious kid, guy falls for the one girl who initially rejected his advances, etc.) , it's often done with a knowing wink, most obviously when, after an altercation with Emily, his ex, and rain begins to pour down on him, Carell's despondent Cal mutters, ""What a cliché."" It shows that love is messy, irrational, sweet and universal, filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates movies like Say Anything or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn't a bad word and love meant more than sex, diamond earrings and expensive, candlelit dinners, where those small, precious moments of quiet intimacy – a shared look, a simple but honest conversation, a laugh, a smile, buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone, a spontaneous phone call – speak as loudly as the grandest, most dramatic, craziest gestures.<br/><br/>In short, Crazy, Stupid, Love does what the best romantic comedies do: it gives us a glimpse into the raw, human moments that collectively build to bring two people together – or, at times, tear them apart; we fall in love with them just as they fall in – or, out of – love with each other. It's the perfect date movie, and so much more. To all the other ones, the mediocre, cornball, lazy, offensive rom-coms and chick-flicks out there, Ryan Gosling has a message for you: be better than The Gap. Be better than The Gap."
"taleeya","9","107","147","26 July 2011"," Pleasantly surprised, a great movie overall!
","I saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! <br/><br/>Steve Carell plays a man, Cal, blindsided by his wife's sudden request for a divorce. While wallowing in self pity at the local bar, Jacob (Ryan Gossling) decides to turn him into a project, and introduce him to the wonderful world of womanizing.....But you've seen that from the previews right? What comes next is a great look at love, from first crushes to long term marriage.<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect blend of funny and sweet (the entire theatre was laughing throughout). Great performances from the whole cast, including a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. The writing was perfect, the pacing was great.... A perfect date movie! Not overly sappy and not typical ""chick flick"" drivel."
"cat_ranchero","8","17","20","11 November 2012"," Better than expected!...
","I actually found it quite engaging eventually; it was a little hard to get into at first but when the narrative began to settle down I could see a structure there that had potential. Brief summary: When Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces to her husband Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce, his world collapses around him. She had slept with another man, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and Cal finds that hard to take since they had been together since high school. He takes to going to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) who shows him how to dress, behave and (most importantly) how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful (eventually) but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhile there are a couple of other sub-plots going on. One involves Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), who has become infatuated with his babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). She, meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal With me so far?... Also, there is law student, Hannah (Emma Stone) who Jacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him (I can't really say any more about her without giving too much away, so here I'll stop). All these threads eventually tie together in what (at times) appears like a French farce, but which does ultimately have a very valid point.<br/><br/>All the performances were very good with Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore taking centre stage. I thought Kevin Bacon was slightly underused, and more could have been made of Emma Stone's character. Over all, it's pretty well made but the narrative does tend to wander in places. An endearing film that does have quite a strong message about love and about soul mates. I freely admit this old romantic found it quite relatable.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 7.5/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"ferguson-6","7","71","98","31 July 2011"," Creme Brulee or a Divorce?
","Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.<br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.<br/><br/>The intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.<br/><br/>After moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.<br/><br/>The polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).<br/><br/>All of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.<br/><br/>Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.<br/><br/>No question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie."
"iheart_ny","10","120","176","12 August 2011"," Crazy Stupid Love
","Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided to check out ""Crazy Stupid Love"", because it had decent critical and audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by surprise.<br/><br/>One of the reasons for this, is because ""Crazy Stupid Love"" works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is going. While the ending itself is a lot like I predicted it, there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.<br/><br/>However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grown-up way. <br/><br/>It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily (Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter, who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.<br/><br/>And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that guy from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.<br/><br/>Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the audience.<br/><br/>While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role in ""The Help"", she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character is instantly lovable, and I can't wait to see what she does next. <br/><br/>This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as Emily's co- worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.<br/><br/>What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out, and occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot. And while it could have been a bit longer, and given its characters some more room to grow, it was a satisfying overall package that I would recommend to someone who's trying to escape the summer of superhero flicks and sequels."

","Romantic comedies aren't usually my kind of thing but I thought this film was great. The cast is strong (Gosling, Stone, Carell) which is the main reason I chose to watch this film. It is quite a long film but the plot is really clever. There is plenty of different things going on in the film and the way it all gets linked together is brilliant and certainly something I did't see coming.<br/><br/>There are some genuine laugh out loud moments and the film is straight to the point. The cast is great and all work together well, the plot is fresh and clever and it really was one of the best romantic comedies I have seen (haven't seen many but still) - Would recommend this film to anyone. <br/><br/>8/10"

","I will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. It was a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Steve keeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength but never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most ""sappy-est"" of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twist at the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do however wish that they would have developed a little more back story with Ryan's character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma delivers some nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! I believe Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play that main love role and still maintain his ""funny guy"" image."
"littlemartinarocena","5","64","99","2 August 2011"," Somewhere between crazy and stupid
","I loved Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's ""I Love You Philip Morris"" but it must have been terribly frustrating for them, having to wait 2 years for the release and then, not finding an audience in sufficient numbers, not even with Jim Carrey. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" seems like a totally understanding attempt to go main stream and get the kind of box office response that will allow them to go on. I think Ficarra and Requa are two enormous talents - remember their script for ""Bad Santa? - the market needs made them do this silly, complacent, undercooked comedy. Something so far away from what they've done before that I hope we haven't lost them forever. I didn't believe for a minute that Julianne Moore and Steve Carrell were a couple. I love Ryan Gosling but didn't believe for a minute he will dedicate himself to the Carrell character. And Carrell's outburst at his son's graduation seems a monumental miscalculation. What's great about stealing your own son's thunder. I don't get Carrell, I must confess. I can't wait for him to play a serial killer. That will get him an Oscar nomination. To make things even more puzzling, Kevin Bacon plays a joke of a part and he's photographed without any regard. I'm puzzled and a little bit annoyed."

The characters are well played out, not very likable at first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel for everyone. I thought Julianne Moore & Steve Carrell had great chemistry with their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great casting with Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. I loved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar & with their friends. This was very well played out & comes together in the end extremely well.

"3xHCCH","5","24","36","11 August 2011"," The Plot and the Characters are Unbelievable
","There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch a romantic comedy, I watched this one for Steve Carrell, whom I believe is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now. <br/><br/>This movie starts with Emily (Julianne Moore) telling her husband of 25 years Cal (Steve Carrell) that she wants a divorce while they were dining in a restaurant. OK, so now I know that I have a black comedy ahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was ""helped"" by playboy Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to get him ready to meet other women. One of the women he hooks up with is Kate (the hilarious Marisa Tomei). Emily on the other hand, takes up with David (the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon). <br/><br/>Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone), who in turn was hoping her colleague (Josh Groban) would propose to her. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's 13-year old son Robbie is sure that his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (America's Next Top Model finalist Analeigh Tipton) is his soul mate. But she is in love with a much older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movie weaves.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell again does very well with this sad-sack character that he seems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funny situations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character of Ryan Gosling though, I find preposterous. I agree with Cal's belated realization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically play straight men to the male characters, with Marisa Tomei shining in the laughs department despite her short role.<br/><br/>While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene at Robbie's graduation, the rest of the film did not really appeal to me too much. Yes, there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. I must say that for conservatives, there can be a lot of uncomfortable situations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women may disagree with me about Ryan Gosling's part though."
"JimmyCollins","6","19","28","8 October 2011"," Not as great as everyone says but it's still a notch above the usual romantic comedy.
","After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell gives a terrific performance as the poor guy whose life just seems to go from bad to worse, I think he will be nominated for a golden globe or something like that, he is a very funny guy to watch no matter what role he is in, the rest of the cast is fine also, Miss Moore once again proves she us an actress with a spectacular, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have excellent chemistry together which makes them entirely believable as lovers, however one person steals the show and that is Marisa Tomei in all her nutty glory, her scenes are exceptionally funny but they are too few and far between.<br/><br/>This movie does have it's flaws, the end twist is too far fetched and unbelievable, I think it would have been better if they gave you some clues as to how the story all comes together in the end, the Gosling/Stone relationship isn't given enough time to make you really care, and also it's a tad too long. But other than that this is a nice, funny and overall enjoyable film to watch."
"ThreeGuysOneMovie","5","6","7","18 February 2012"," Not as Funny as it Should Have Been
","Steve Carell is Cal Weaver, a 40 something dad who has embraced middle age mediocrity. He goes out to dinner with his baggy chinos, and New Balance sneakers on. He takes his relationships with his children and his wife for granted and is basically living with the cruise control on. Cal's wife Emily (Julianne Moore), drops a bombshell on Cal while they are out at dinner and tell him that she wants a divorce and that she has been sleeping with someone else.<br/><br/>Cal is devastated and is forced to re-think his life now that he has to live alone. In order to drown his sorrows, Cal starts hanging out at a local bar where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a womanizing playboy who agrees to help Cal find his mojo and win back his wife. I had some high hopes for this movie. They certainly found enough stars to be in it. Does it translate into a great movie? Not really. The problem with this movie isn't the acting it's the script. The plot is pretty ridiculous and there are unnecessary twists that just didn't need to be included in the movie. It plays out like a bad episode of Threes Company. Although I was impressed with the acting from Jonah Bobo as Cal's son, he is also the victim of some of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. It's too bad because he could have had one of the more interesting performances in the film.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore seemed to playing the exact same character she played in The Kids Are All Right. A 40 something mom that cheats on her spouse and is confused about what she wants from life. She was the least impressive of the cast for me. The rest of the cast did a good job, Ryan Gosling continues to impress. He proves that he can do comedy just as well as he does anti-hero. I am getting a little worried that we are starting to get over saturated with him though. How about you give us a little time to miss you? I know that I was supposed to like this one, its 78% percent fresh on RT but for me some decent acting can't make up for a flakey unrealistic script that wants us to believe in one too many coincidences."
"Danusha_Goska","9","6","7","17 August 2011"," Warm, Surprising, Funny, Grown-Up. Worth Seeing
","""Crazy Stupid Love"" is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying. <br/><br/>Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to ""stop talking."" When she keeps talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene. <br/><br/>I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that made me look twice. ""The Notebook"" was one of the blandest and most forgettable movies I've ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too hard. <br/><br/>Gosling's Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest, subtlest performances I've ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, ""Do you want to get out of here?"" Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha male, as if he were a silverback gorilla – or Frank Sinatra – even while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He's Buddy Love on steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film – and I did not – I'd watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it. <br/><br/>Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie's love, but it never did – in fact it got a little weird – and I liked that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love. <br/><br/>There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams and plans smashed – and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside of participants' hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers. <br/><br/>""Crazy Stupid Love"" includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light. This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its best. Steve Carrel could not be better in this scene."

","I feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has. We've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new. OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it would be 10, Carrell & Gosling give good performances and really gel as a duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid section drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that really shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies always do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, it couldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it's just a pity the project is wanting."

","Once in a great while I watch a movie that I really enjoy... this is that movie. The actors in this movie are great! Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors now. Prior to this I had only seen him in Drive, The Believer and Lars and the Real girl. Just on those 4 movies alone, talk about a diverse spectrum of roles. The confident all around cool guy is the role you would almost expect him to get type casted into, but this is the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Coming from a hedro, he's one sexy bitch!!! <br/><br/>Emma stone plays her same character, which I totally dig... and why not, no ones better with the sarcasm then she is. Marisa Tomei is classic in this movie. Hilarious!! For me it's the best role I've ever seen her in. They must have been dying on the set, when she was busting her stuff out. <br/><br/>The movie is well written, the story line is nothing new, but never done this well. It's basically just a love triangle that comes to a head. The message that the movie leaves us with is kind of lame and borderline stalker. <br/><br/>Anyways, This is a great movie in any setting. Highly recommended!!!"
"Hashimuri","2","120","228","29 September 2011"," Stupid is right - and also sexist, boring and disingenuous
","This film reminded me a lot of Little Miss Sunshine, a ""dysfunctional family"" comedy I also hated. Things that are actually way creepy and/or disturbing are played for laughs, for example:<br/><br/><ul><li>a 13-year-old boy stalking and harrasing his 17-year-old babysitter. He is relentless: tells her upfront that he masturbates while thinking about her, embarrasses her with public declarations, texts her nonstop, cycles to her house in the middle of the night to leave a bundle of flowers at her door (long after she's begged him to stop)... If he's old enough to feel an attraction for someone, then he's old enough to understand the concept of backing off when it is made clear that the attraction is not mutual (not just that-- the girl tells him repeatedly that he makes her feel ""uncomfortable""-- ignoring someone's feelings is a trademark mainly of guys who veer on, or actually are, abusive</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>a 17-year-old girl obsessing over a 44-year-old dad (Carrell), to the extent that she overtly disrespects his wife (Moore), who employs her as a babysitter. Her obsession reaches new lows when she snaps naked pictures of herself with the intent of seducing Carrell. There was no logic to why this character would cheapen herself so absurdly just to win the affections of a nice, but by no means charming or exceptional, family man. Not to mention, if she hates Moore for breaking up the marriage, why is she so keen to further sabotage it by throwing herself at Carrell?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>a 44-year-old dad controlling his 27-year-old daughter's love life, to the point that he disowns her for having a boyfriend whose past sexual behaviour he disapproves of, even though he himself has recently indulged in that exact type of behaviour. What is it with male characters in films being so patronising and protective of female characters? Are women in audience meant to find this manly and flattering? Is this the 1950s, where sexual hypocrisy reigns supreme? So it seems in the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>a 40-something woman (Tomei) who goes to bars on her own to get laid is totally upset when a random dude she goes home with (Carrell) doesn't ever call her. Really? Are we meant to believe the sex was that good? Why must the film depict an older woman seeking sex with a stranger be so pathetically? Oh, I know-- because only a pathetic woman would still be single at that age and go to bars seeking no-strings-attached sex. Again-- are we stuck in Pleasantville or what?</li></ul><br/><br/>Other old-fashioned clichés forced upon the viewer include having an indiscriminate playboy (Gosling) fall for a near-virginal girl (Stone), whose purity of heart and earnest innocence no doubt compel him to abandon his reckless, emotionally stunted, promiscuous ways. To add insult to injury, the near-virginal girl initially fawns over a douchebag in a suit (i.e. the financially secure but boring guy), and is heartbroken when he doesn't propose (girls just always want a ring on their finger, don't ya know).<br/><br/>Amidst these pathetic story lines (compounded by some really pathetic dialogue), the only saving grace were a few well-timed and refreshingly funny jokes, plus Gosling's barely-concealed smirk for having carte blanche to do absolutely no real acting whatsoever. He merely prances around in flashy suits and flaunts his pecs.<br/><br/>My final quip: for a film about sexual conquests and awakenings, where was the chemistry between any of the characters, the steamy innuendos, the sensual vibes, or the actual sex? I would've killed for random scenes between Gosling and any of the two dozen women he picks up throughout the film-- or between him and Stone's quirky friend (also the token ethnic minority, who conveniently disappears the minute Stone and Gosling sink into a trite state of happily-ever-after-ness).<br/><br/>Or how about a scene with Moore and Bacon, who were far cuter together than Moore and Carrell? There's just not even anything in this film that could be considered a payoff. In this sense, it really reminded me of that most disingenuous of romcoms that also has ""love"" in the title but completely denigrates the concept-- yes, the perplexingly much-loved turd, Love Actually. Well, Crazy, Stupid Love has joined the ranks, congrats!"
"jm10701","Null","10","14","17 September 2012"," Stupid and annoying movie
","Somehow the makers of this movie took two of my favorite actors - Julianne Moore and Ryan Gosling - and made them so phony and annoying that I could barely watch; and they magnified all of Steve Carell's most annoying traits so that he was even more obnoxious than usual. I don't think it was supposed to be that way, based on other people's reviews, but that's how it hit me.<br/><br/>I guess Carell fans love anything he does; gasp with amazement any time he manages to cry or to read a line without making a funny face or a funny noise, and tell themselves what a great dramatic actor he is in addition to being the funniest man in the world; and they probably don't care or even notice how anybody else comes across. That's the only way I can account for the vast multitudes who rave about how profound (huh?) this silly, irritating movie is and how phenomenal (awesome, anybody?) Carell is in it. I don't get it, but then I'm obviously not a fan.<br/><br/>And I'm sick of movies that get laughs from pubescent boys getting caught doing what they all do in their rooms any time they're alone and of angst-ridden teenage crushes on older men/women. Those two dumb themes have been done to death.<br/><br/>To summarize this review: this is a stupid, boring, obnoxious and annoying movie that wastes at least two great talents in a stupid, clichéd story about stupid, totally obnoxious and unbelievable characters."
"sharonmaceda-1","Null","19","31","6 October 2011"," Stupid stupid stupid
","I watched this movie trying to distinguish it from a soap opera or romance novel, that it was almost impossible to do. The idea is that a woman (Julian Moore) has sex with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Then on their way home after dinner, she tells her loving husband of 25 years (Steve Carrell)—a dinner where he thinks everything went great, by the way—that she screwed her co-worker and she wants a divorce. Let's just review this the guy, after 25 years, still loves his wife, and still takes her out to dinner, along with the fact that he's a loving husband, hard worker and all the trimmingsand she screws around behind his back and SHE wants a divorce. Let's go one more step: the guy is lost after that, he just literally jumps out of the car and is so sick to his stomach, because let's face it, mister perfect man loved his wife and loved his life, and he finds out within seconds that his wife is screwing another man and wants a divorce. Fast forward a bit. Now he's drinking a lot, he's lonely, he has to go out and live in an apartment (of course she gets the house), and all that, and then, after meeting the town hunk (Ryan Gossling), he is mentored into the ways of the world and women. So after some months go by, he finally starts to have sex with other womendid I mention that he never had sex with another woman other than his wife before she kicked him out and he'd had no desire to cheat? And this is the killer—after he has sex with other women, his soon-to-be ex-wife flips out! Did I miss something here? She screwed someone else, she's divorcing him, but she flips out when he seeks out other female companionship. Wait, it gets better! All along, he's still trying to do the right thing. He waters the lawn at his (separated) wife's house, he continues to be a good dad, and he continues, under the influence of his son, to attempt to get his wife back. This is the message I get: a spouse cheats, wants a divorce and then the other spouse—who never did anything wrong—has to do all the work to try to fix things. That doesn't sit right with me. Maybe in some twisted fantasy a woman, or man, wants to think they can cheat, demand a divorce and have their mate pursue them endlessly, but that's not reality...nor does it make for good entertainment."

What a waste of time"
"dougwintersmusic","Null","9","13","26 September 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, Love; a simple story ruined
","I've come to the conclusion that Hollywood is incapable of producing a fully engrossing, delightfully simple ""romantic comedy."" ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" makes the unfortunate mistake of presenting three touchingly believable stories along with three completely superfluous, ""wacky"" bad sit-com ones.Steve Carrell plays ""Cal,"" the emasculated, depressed husband of his restlessly bored wife ""Emily,"" played by the amazing Julianne Moore ""Emily"" who admits she has been cheating on ""Cal"" within the first few minutes of the movie and the couple spend the next 118 minutes trying to get back together. There are several genuinely charming, unaffected moments that allow us to see the chemistry Cal & Emily once had as a happily married couple.Ryan Gosling tries his superb, chameleon-like acting chops out on romantic comedy deeply involved in two of the three believable relationship with convincing ease. With a chiseled body, perfectly coiffed hair, million-dollar wardrobe and extraordinary good looks, Gosling ""Jake"" falls easily into the role of a  disarmingly handsome, irresistibly charming cad. His confident playfulness reassures us that ""Jake"" is no mere shallow misogynist, he's simply a guy doing what he apparently does best.                              With a great deal of the action set in a chic cosmopolitan ""glass-and-chrome"" bar, Gosling, as the king of this castle, has yet to meet the woman who can say ""no"" to Jake's ultra-smooth ""closing"" line of ""Wanna get outta here?"" Witnessing Cal's self- pitying ineptitude, Jake decides to take him under his wing. Surrendering his credit card, Cal puts himself in Jake's hands for a confidence-building make-over. Gosling and Carrell's ensuing friendship is genuinely endearing as Cal progresses as Jake's protégé.             The unthinkable happens when Jake becomes instantly smitten by the one woman who refuses his offer for casual sex. But to Jake's surprise and delight the same woman, ""Hannah,"" played by the incandescent Emma Stone returns several days later, plants a big drunken kiss on Jake and insists that he take her home. In one of the movie's most charming scenes, Hannah giggles her way through Jake's mask of perfection, followed by both of them laughing at his admittedly canned and rehearsed seduction lines, with Jake finally admitting ""What can I say? They work."" Hannah and Jake don't have sex their first night together, allowing Jake the opportunity to begin to open up about himself for the first time, marking the beginning of their light and breezy, ever-deepening courtship.                                     The problem with ""Crazy, Stupid, Love,"" is that the writer Dan Fogelman and director Glenn Ficara didn't feel that these three stories in the hands of these four exceptional actors were sufficient to hold our attention. For some inexplicable reason, they felt the need to throw in Maris Tomei as the sex-starved schoolmarm ""Kate,"" with whom Cal has his first successful one-night stand. She, of course, becomes the ""one-night stand from hell,"" and ""OMG!,"" turns out to be Cal's son's English teacher. In a disturbingly poorly written and poorly acted role, Ms.Tomei is so needlessly ""over- the-top"" as Cal's sex-partner turned ""woman scorned"" that she threatens to single- handedly destroys the credibility of the entire movie. Not quite finished, Mr. Fogelman and Mr. Ficarra felt the need to introduce John Carroll Lynch as the Cal & Emily's ""wacky neighbor,"" who appears for the sole purpose of engaging Cal in a cringe-worthy backyard brawl. The fight is so absurdly contrived because the audience is well aware that Cal is the innocent victim, rather than the perpetrator of his neighbor's wrath. But worst of all, it wasn't funny.                                                       And as the coup de gras, they felt the need to throw Kevin Bacon into the mix as Emily's new boyfriend (""David Lindhagen."") His presence is so insignificant, that Ficarra and Fogelman must have been under laboring under the misconception that Mr. Bacon needed to add Carrell, Moore, Gosling and Stone to his famous ""six degrees.""                         The simple advice I would give to the movie makers of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is ""less is more."" What could have been a delightful rom-com ends up as a convoluted mess. By editing out these pointless cliché-ridden characters, the four principals might have given us the streamlined, surprise hit of the summer, rather than yet another tepid, half-baked attempt at romantic comedy. Please refer to ""Larry Crowne,"" ""Friends With Benefits"" and ""No Strings Attached."""
"PWNYCNY","5","29","52","18 August 2011"," Not funny.
","Crazy, stupid, love? The middle word aptly describes this ridiculous movie. Steve Carell and the other cast members are completely unfunny in this movie that purportedly is a comedy. The story is dreary and implausible. Steve Carell's character is so unbelievable that no amount of literary license can make it plausible. When Steve Carell throws himself out of a moving car, that sets the tone for this movie. Not only is this movie not funny, the story is warped. It asks the audience to accept certain premises that are not are not only untenable but destroy whatever humor the story may contain. As a study of domestic dysfunctionality, the movie does better job, but frankly that is not supposed to be the theme of the story. There is nothing funny about a man ejecting himself from a car after he learns that his wife wants a divorce and that his life has been turned upside down. That's tragic. If someone is expecting an amusing movie, prepare to be disappointed. The same can be said if you are expecting high drama. In fact, it might be best of you wait until the movie goes to DVD land."

","I went to see this upon reading the cast members...Marisa Tomei, Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, wow. But what a waste of talent for these people, and a waste of time for me as well. The story felt very sloppy, and the characters were bland as a result. Steve Carell's role reminded me of his role in ""40-yr-old virgin"": nerdy middle-age guy with little sexual experience. Sure he managed to be funny at parts but talk about typecast! Ryan Gosling's role meant to be a muscular dandy but came off as border-line homosexual. His upper body seemed to occupy an unhealthy amount of screen time. And one scene they put Steve Carell's face right on Ryan Gosling's groin area-what the hell was that all about? Oh and the whole thing about the 17-yr-old babysitter taking naked photos of herself for Cal(Steve Carell)-what?? How's that funny? It's rather disturbing! Julianne Moore's performance was kind of generic and I couldn't take one more shot of her teary, blank stare. And I also thought their kid (Jonah Bobo) was horrid! His character was the most painful to watch, following by Emma Stone. My! What a terrible actress. The total lack of depth of the film was astounding. Please can someone tell me what's the point of the story? I mean, really. I think it was made for people that are grown up on the outside but still 8-yr-olds on the inside. For the real grown-ups, it might leave a bad taste in your mouth, so be warned."

Oh, please you can barely look at her she is so awful. Every shot of her and everyone else is so tight it makes you uncomfortable. There is so much wrong with this film I really don't know where to start, so I'll just say: the big ""twist"" is just plain stupid -- who cares? It doesn't add anything to the story. The child porn thing is just creepy. The main story element of the failing marriage is never really fleshed out. The other main story point -- of Steve Carrell's character becoming a horn dog -- is odd and off-putting. The whole movie is just plain weird. That's as best as I can sum it up. The casting is especially odd. Marissa Tomei and Kevin bacon are thrown in for -- oh, I don't know. The 13-year old son is bad. The little girl has no lines at all. Julianna Moore is just not good here -- comes off as a harpy. The only saving grace is -- Emma Stone. She is kind of radiant, if that makes any sense. But the story line she has really doesn't make sense, because Ryan Gosling also plays a horn dog with no sense of goodness, who only goes after really hot chicks so, no -- he would NOT seek her out from a crowded bar.<br/><br/>Not worth your money.

"spambouk1000","1","19","34","19 December 2012"," Creepy stalking is not funny
","Awful film. As others have commented, it is one cliché after another. But more than boring, it was very creepy. The ""dad"" teaches his son to stalk his babysitter by ignoring her when she asks him to stop. The son follows her, spies on her, humiliates her in public, texts her after she asks him to stop and even says that she is uncomfortable with his conduct. Worse, the producers of the film thought it would be cute to end the film with her giving him explicit photos of herself...because it's good that she has learned to degrade herself in order to satisfy weirdos who won't leave her alone.<br/><br/>I thought the father's interference in his 27 year old daughter's relationship also very creepy. He seemed to think that he owned her and could prohibit her from dating men he deemed too promiscuous. Similarly, the man goes to his wife's lover and says ""you can have her,"" as if she were a dog he's giving away. <br/><br/>While his wife was certainly wrong for cheating, he condemns her then sleeps with 9 women himself...dumping them all painfully to feel better about himself. Why should they be punished for his wife's error? For that matter, why isn't his cheating condemned, even mentioned as wrong in the film? Although wronged, he is still married and did not tell his 9 partners that he is still married.(see the Charles and Diana mess for proof that two cheaters don't make it right...it makes them both wrong) What a skeevy film."

What I got was one of the most appalling movies I have seen in a long time, a sick demented number full of crazy stalkers, that entirely endorses and promotes stalker-ish behavior. Because, you see, as long as YOU are convinced that the target is your ""soul-mate,"" it can't be considered stalking.<br/><br/>Hello, Mr. Screenwriter! Have we forgotten that John Hinckley was fully convinced that Jodie Foster was his soul-mate? We know how that turned out, correct? <br/><br/>Ah, well, I guess we don't. So keep on pursuing your ""romantic"" thesis, and thanks for the details on 13-year-old boys masturbating and 17-year-old girls taking nude pictures of themselves. You are keeping it real and contemporary! <br/><br/>By the way, the answer to the burning question, What kind of dad hangs out at the same singles bars as his offspring? is, Creepy-as-Hell Dad! <br/><br/>Apart from pointing out the descent into the moral pit that this movie represents, I must also ruefully report that there is nothing of any aesthetic interest or pleasure here. No sprightliness, no style, no charm, not even such as might show up in the service of an entirely misguided plot. Not a single shot worth looking at, not a single line worth listening to. The characters are utterly boring, contourless screenwriter creations - no interests, no hobbies, no thoughts worth sharing, nada. No actors no matter how good could do anything with this material.<br/><br/>Steve Carell certainly cannot convince us that he could suddenly become a swingin' SoCal ladies' man, effortlessly picking up women half his age - and again, given the third act revelation here, it's a big yuck that he would want to.<br/><br/>Have fun."

I had expected a better movie than this and the twist in end I found as been put together forcibly just because they want some twist to regular story. Well let me talk about performances: Steve Carell is good, gets advantage as he is producer of film. Julliane is OK..Kevin is small role(really good actor), Emma stone just lost her one fan in me. I mean seriously. Ryan is OK and gets little scope but good as flamboyant playboy. His story is undeveloped and should have been better told. Steve Carell's youngest daughter is really good actress. If you have not watched her film then you should check out Ramona and Beezus. Rest of the cast is OK and did give OK performances."

I agree with the first reviewer that this is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade.<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more surprised at my reaction. After all, it's a Steve Carell movie. I like him well enough, but his movies have usually left me mildly amused. In this film, he shows a depth of emotion that he had only hinted at before.<br/><br/>But the character who got to me the most was Ryan Gosling. His performance was amazing.

","Romantic comedies are dime a dozen these days and they are all mostly tacky, boring or unbelievably clichéd and raunchy but even then they are soulless rehashes of the same stuff over and over again. So when my friend recommended ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"", I wasn't too interested to watch another romcom even though it starred some of my favorite actors like Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Steve Carell, Bacon and Ryan Gosling. But, she finally persuaded me to watch this with her last week and boy do I wish I had seen this sooner.<br/><br/>An average middle-aged couple, Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) are out on a date when Emily announces that she wants a divorce as she is stuck in a rut and is bored by her married life. Cal cannot process the thought that the woman he loves doesn't want him anymore and is sleeping with another guy, Lindhaaaaaagen (Kevin Bacon) and leaves home. He keeps on moping at the hot local club to everybody who would listen to his plight. Here Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), who is a real charming ladies man and seems quite successful in his life, decides to help out Cal in becoming a real man and score with the opposite sex. But Jacob cannot score with this one hottie, Hanna (Emma Stone) who is in a stupid relationship with a lawyer, according to her best friend. The rest of the movie is about how their paths collide with each other and a babysitter's crush on the dad, while the son crushes on the babysitter.<br/><br/>This movie is really refreshingly different from the tons of other romcoms that are being churned out by Hollywood. Its surprisingly deep without throwing it at our faces, tugged at my heartstrings in a few scenes and yet made me laugh so much and relate to these flawed characters. Marissa Tomei's cameo role was awesome! Emma is as usual, brilliant in the movie. Its nice to see Gosling in a comedy after a long time. He really looked and acted like a sexy heartthrob and reminded me of Jensen Ackles for some reason. Julianne and Carell rarely disappoint me. The lovestruck babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) deserves a special mention. It could have come off as cheesy and disgusting, but any scene involving her and Cal or her and the teen boy were so intense and ridiculously hilarious! Suffice to say that all the actors were great and I can see no flaws in the storyline or anything which made me not like the movie in any way.<br/><br/>Oh, and also nobody could predict that amazing twist at the end! If anybody says they could see it coming without knowing that beforehand, is just plain (insert expletive) you! Or they're just saying it randomly and sticking to it. Most comedies are dragged down by the second half of the movie, but that never happens here. There's no slump!! All the credit goes to the writers and actors for pulling this off seamlessly and rooting it in reality while not compromising on the laughs. It has its heart in the right place and the story doesn't depend on cheesy, raunchy antics to push the plot forward.<br/><br/>As I grow older and being a guy, I am finding that the romcoms I once loved are getting more nauseating day by day and there are very few of them that I really like. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a little gem of a movie, quite easily the best comedy of the year. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this movie should have been nominated for the Oscars in place of ""Bridesmaids"" if they wanted a distinct comedy movie to be in the Best Picture category. Watch it folks, you won't be regretting it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Usually, I'm not a huge fan of this rom-com genre. There are just too many opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from acting to story to ridiculousness. Fortunately, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" doesn't fall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny, and even moving production that appeals to a broad range of movie-watchers.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" sees a middle-aged couple (played by Steve Carell & Julianne Moore) get a sudden divorce, shaking their family to the core. Concurrently, a suave love-guru (Ryan Gosling) takes Carell's sad-sack character and tries to turn him into a ladies man, all the while pursuing a mysterious, fresh-faced girl (Emma Watson) who is unlike any girl he has met before.<br/><br/>The calling-card of this flick is its ability to carry multiple plot lines over the duration of the film until they all converge in the end. There is never a shortage of things going on, all related to the central concept of the ""craziness of love"".<br/><br/>The acting has to be great for a movie like this to succeed, and that is exactly what we get here. While all the actors are impressive in their own right, it's their chemistry that really shines here. By the end, all of the major players have interacted with each other, and it all comes off seamlessly.<br/><br/>The ""polish"" of this film is also impressive. Everything is just so slick, from the dialogue to the clothing and especially the young cast members (Gosling & Stone, in particular). In short, this movie lacks nothing in the production-value department.<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is a film that can be enjoyed by teens on up for a variety of different reasons. I watched primarily for Carell's acting, but was quickly drawn in by the innocent beauty of Stone and the slickness of Gosling. I'm sure you'll find a reason to be sucked in as well."

","""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is a very known film for a reason that I don't have any idea of. The characters are somehow interesting, but the cast is just as hack as it could be, considering there's just no new actor at all. Therefore, as you can imagine, the movie as a whole is just another merchandising for those actors whose performances are almost always the same. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, is someone I had rarely heard of, and even thought he seems to be a copy of David Arquette. Moreover, there isn't much to be said about this picture, since it didn't stay in my memory due to the uninteresting plot that has been showed. Maybe ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is just another movie from the Hollywood that we'll hardly remember of."

","The comedy-drama genre, or ""dramedy"" is a tough nut to crack and a problem can be that films lean too far into drama and the comedy on offer is usually very light. Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately breaks that model and is actually funny, as well as dramatic.<br/><br/>Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carell and Julianne Moore) are a married couple who have two young children and Emily ask Cal for a divorce after she admits she had slept with co-worker. Cal is heartbroken, loses his friends and spends his time at a bar bemoaning his situation. A successful bachelor and womaniser, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), takes pity on Cal and tutors in the ways of picking up, gives him a makeover and a new wardrobe and after some mishaps becomes plenty successful himself. But he still longs for Emily and there still seems to be a spark between the two.<br/><br/>Despite Jacob's success with the ladies there is one woman who knocks him back, a very attractive law graduate, Hannah (Emma Stone), and this is the woman who he actually has a connection with whilst Hannah actually longs for being more exciting.<br/><br/>Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bono), is a 13-year-old boy who is infatuated with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), embarrassing and hounding her. But Jessica is a bit of strange girl and actually fancies Cal himself.<br/><br/>Much of the comedy is based on awkward situations, mostly at Cal's expense, a little like The 40 Year Virgin. The situation and humour portray is in a slightly exaggerated world, but for the most it works and we can believe most of the situations, except maybe why would a 17-year-old fancy a man like Steve Carell. He does not strike me as a person who teenagers would fall for.<br/><br/>There is a great cast in the film and they are excellent throughout. Carell and Gosling were the best of them all. Carell is a natural comedian, making his character believable despite what's happening around him and is a natural delivery of his lines. He is also great at the more dramatic elements and I would like to see him in more dramatic roles. Gosling has shown he is a very talented actor and can tackle almost any genre and he shows he has excellent comic timing. What is even more remarkable it would be really easy to dislike Jacob as a character, but Gosling and the writers were able to making him into a more interesting, likable character simply because he because he formed friendship with Cal.<br/><br/>Moore plays the most grounded, serious character and she does a good job with what she has to do and she is always a pleasant screen presence. Stone is a strong, fun loving character, with plenty of spunk and when she was with her friend a great person to be around, but the she did get the shaft with screen time and her story was lacking development. Tipton shows she is an actress with potential and she really felt like a naïve, young 17-year-old, both physical because of her small frame and braid and also the way she act and properly why she has a daddy complex, because it is safe.<br/><br/>There are a few visual treats in the film to keep film fresh. The best example is a montage where the camera pans around a bar as we see Cal become a ladies man and see him pick up a number of women in an excellent 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love is a very good but there a few faults. There are funny scenes and characters, but Marisa Tomei's role as a teacher who Cal sleeps with was someone who simply mugged and overdone when the character and the comedy should have been more grounded and awkward then overblown. It is even more annoying because Tomei is a very talented actress. Also because of the large cast of characters some of the character really did drop off the screen at times. This was the case of Hannah who is physically not in the film for large portions of film: but Stone is a strong performance and has excellent chemistry with Gosling and her friend played by Liza Lapira.<br/><br/>A more minor criticism is the role of Cal and Emily's daughter, Molly, played by Joey King who seems market the uncharacterised child role. I can understand why she was included because it would have been weird for a 17-year-old girl to only babysit a 13-year-old boy, but Molly could have had a few more scenes.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love film is an enjoyable film that is funny for the most part and does build on its dramatic elements and character development. Crazy, Stupid, Love has sometimes been classified as a romantic-comedy, if that is the case it is a great example of a film that avoids clichés and is a film that people who do not like the genre can enjoy. It makes an big constant to Gosling's other romantic film, Blue Valentine."

","I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film, but I've now watched it three times! The way that it follows a lot of different story lines makes it interesting, and all of the actors made their characters believable. I especially like the character of 13 year old Robbie ( Jonah Bobo) - I think that he plays to his character very well- and it is a very real portrayal of a teenage boy. Steve carell shows that he can play serious roles, and Ryan Gosling is the perfect choice for the character of player- Jacob palmer. There are a lot of funny moments, and some more serious but heartwarming scenes. With some cute speeches and a theme of 'fighting for your soul-mate', this film is a great hit with teens and adults alike, and went down well with my whole family. The characters are relatable to, and it's nice to hear their individual stories. I would definitely recommend this movie!"
"gradyharp","Null","3","4","4 November 2011"," A Kind of Love between Crazy and Stupid
","The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is. Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled, Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up form his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.<br/><br/>Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable. The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh. The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages. The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.<br/><br/>It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two hour formulaic condensed television series type story. And yet the Bravos form the audience must mean there is a craving for this type movie. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"ChipperX","10","3","4","6 September 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, 40 Year Old Virgin Still In Love.
","Love is all of these things at once - that is why a movie called ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" succeeds as a romantic comedy. Okay, okay - that is only part of the reason. The ingredients for the success of this movie are irreverent comedy, razor-sharp dialogue, awesome imagination and great execution. In other words, the writers keep the love side hot, and the stupid side cool. No, really.<br/><br/>Case in point: The divorce (AKA Crazy). As the movie opens, we see Cal and Emily having dinner together at a restaurant - a seemingly perfect scenario which rapidly degenerates as Emily asks Cal for a divorce after 20 years of marriage. On the way home from dinner, Cal rouses from his catatonic state and throws himself from the moving car Emily is driving. Despite the awkward moments presented at dinner and during the car ride home, we can see that the two still love one another. Cal (Steve Carell) is predictably upset, since we learn much later that his character has only had ONE sexual partner his entire life - his wife Emily (Julianne Moore). With the help of his pre-teen son Robbie (Jonah Bobo), Cal sets out on a ridiculous quest to win her back. That's just CRAZY.<br/><br/>Get ready for the fireworks... (AKA the Stupid). This sets the stage for Steve Carell to sort-of reprise his bumbling-but-good-natured-and-somehow-sexy role Andy from The Forty Year Old Virgin. And... it works. Somehow. This time, Steve has a wing man in Ryan Gosling (Jacob). Jacob quickly tires of cuckolded Cal's vocally incessant, divorcée whining at a local pick-up bar and decides to assist Cal the only way he knows how - by turning Cal into a misogynistic, promiscuous man-whore. Cal focuses on making himself more attractive to Emily, while Jacob focuses on making Cal more attractive to women. Any woman. All women. Every woman. While this premise of the movie - Cal's desire to reunite with Emily - is not ridiculous by itself, the way Cal goes about fulfilling this motivation is simply outrageous - and laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>Steve Carell mutates from a sexless eunuch into an oversexed gigolo in the space of 30 minutes. It isn't entirely believable, but it is quite entertaining - Jacob slaps Cal's face - A LOT, gets him into the gym, and browbeats Cal into buying a hip, new wardrobe. Meanwhile Robbie, wing man #2, guilt-trips Cal into trying to win his mother back. Unfortunately, Robbie has the hots for his much-older baby-sitter or nanny, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who is in love with none other than Cal, her boss. Not to be outdone, Cal's older daughter Hannah (Emma Stone) falls in love with Cal's wingman-cum-misogynist, Jacob, whom Cal begins to despise for ""ruining"" his daughter.<br/><br/>The resolution of the movie (AKA Love), is where its beauty truly lies. There are plenty of sight gags and one-liners to keep everyone entertained, but beneath all the hilarity is a gorgeous, messy painting which seeks to mirror the real world. I would not call this a typical ""Hollywood"" ending, but I was very satisfied with the way all of the dramatic threads of this film were deftly tied together.<br/><br/>Does Cal eventually get Emily back? Do Jacob and Hannah live happily ever after? Does Jessica eventually return Robbie's affections? We are not given these answers - nor do we need them. We are allowed to play out the rest of the drama in our own imaginations - and sometimes it's just better that way. Loved it! - Chipper F. Xavier, Esq."
"chaz-28","5","4","6","12 August 2011"," Carell & Moore have chemistry & a great script; Gosling & Stone do not
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is naturally about relationships. The one which consumes most of the film focuses on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore who have been married for a very long 25 years. They are stuck in a rut. They look exhausted and seem to just be going to through the motions of their monotonous relationship. In fact, they are getting a divorce. Carell moves out and immediately finds the local bar. It is here that Ryan Gosling notices him as a very sad case of a man and assumes a Fairy Godmother role of personal improvement. He initiates new clothes, a new hairstyle, and a new way of thinking on the newly single and confused Carell.<br/><br/>Most of this seems like a standard run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, which for some part it is. But the script is a bit savvier than to just throw formulaic plot movements at the audience. The chemistry between Carell and Moore works. Carell reminds you of his Dan in Real Life character a bit and both actors really show a weight on their shoulders which their marriage has become. What does not work is the Ryan Gosling situation and how he latches on to Carell. The motivation is lacking and the script really never bothers to explain it. Naturally, the womanizing Gosling meets and falls for Emma Stone and this relationship does not work either although they share a quality late night scene together. In fact, the Emma Stone character dangerously approaches Sweet Home Alabama territory as she throws away a decent guy (Josh Groban's first film appearance) for the womanizing chauvinist.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what was once a real and tough script at points collapses into farce and a Three's Company misunderstanding at the film's climax and becomes so unbelievable that I was a bit sad that Carell and Moore's marital problems are reduced to stock slapstick. Another let down is the inclusion of Marisa Tomei in the cast. It has nothing to do with her character, but what is Tomei doing in such an underwritten and one dimensional role? I thought her acting comeback in The Wrestler would have saved her from something as minimal as this.<br/><br/>On one hand, I praise this script for probing much deeper than the average insipid rom com. However, it severely plummets at key points and in a conniving manner manipulates certain characters which spoil its originality and wit. Also, what is going on with the movie poster? That particular scene in no way whatsoever represents this film. This was a particularly poor choice by the advertising department."

","A surprising movie on many levels. Sassy humor mixed with grounding reality. The story seems to sprawl a little, in the way it goes all over the place at times, and yet it manages to create a fun gem of an evening. I haven't laughed so hard in a theater in a long time--and it wasn't over the crude humor that so often gets the crowds going (which I don't care for). Yes, there is crude humor--it seems to come with the territory in Steve Carell movies--but that is not the basis for what makes this movie great. Nor is it ""great"" in the sense that I expect it to land a bunch of award nominations. But if you're looking for a movie that mimics life, but presents it in an entertaining way, you'll probably enjoy this one. The actors portray their characters well, the plot twists keep it interesting, and it is really a deeper story than the surface value suggests."
"Nuz_Reviews","8","8","16","1 August 2011"," O-M-G! A sappy comedy that even works for the male audience
","I can't even remember the last time Steve Carell was actually in a good movie. In the past decade he's been in a lot of ""hit or miss"" type flicks. Emphasis on the ""miss"" with movies like Dinner for Schmucks, Date Night, Get Smart, Dan in Real Life, and especially Evan Almighty. Don't get me wrong, I still laughed, just didn't enjoy the cinema. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine were the only true Carell flicks that I enjoyed in roundabout way.<br/><br/>With that being said, 2011 brings us Crazy, Stupid, Love. A quaint little rom-com flick under the direction of duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who came together once again after their tag team direction of R- rated rom-com I Love You Phillip Morris. Being released two years apart, their movie direction definitely improved.<br/><br/>On to the movie review itself.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love begins with the divorce dinner of two of the main characters, Steve Carell's Cal and Julianne Moore's Emily. Cal is immediately deemed by the audience be the ""loser"" or ""40 Year Old Virgin"" type character he does so well. Even a little bit of Michael Scott from NBC's The Office can be felt. I was definitely excited at this point and the movie just started!<br/><br/>The next scene introduces us to Cal's 13-year-old son, Robbie, played by Jonah Bobo. For being only an age older in real life, I thought little Jonah Bobo did a spectacular job. Immediately we see that he is madly in love with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica, played by Analeigh Tipton. This situation alone fuels some of the comedy.<br/><br/>The casting really does add so much more appeal to this film. Details ahead. I was also surprised to witness how funny a PG-13 rated movie really could be, while maintaining a classy feel. No raunchy comedy here. No ""F-bombs"" here. No slap-stick. Sure, the characters cheat and seem to be angry at times, but they understand their mistakes.<br/><br/>We figure out that Emily is fooling around with a guy at work played by Kevin Bacon. Interestingly funny is Bacon.<br/><br/>After Cal finds himself completely depressed by the thought of his divorce, he sobs at a local cocktail bar. Here he overhears, thus finding Ryan Gosling's character, Jacob, who is undoubtedly the complete ladies' man. Even actor Ryan Reynolds admits his abs to be more superior than his own. Ryan Gosling is the superior actor as well. Really enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>From here Jacob agrees to help Cal make the most of himself and teaches him the way of the ""Ladies' Man."" That's when the movie really begins. The humor that perspires from the interaction of Cal and the women at the bar was delightful.<br/><br/>The movie does slow down towards the middle with cliché montages, but seemingly picks itself up.<br/><br/>Eventually Cal finds himself a real catch in the form of Marisa Tomei's character named Kate. While this is going on, Jacob, the man who taught Cal how to score all those girls, falls in love with Emma Stone's character, Hannah. Cal is not happy about that.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that I really enjoyed all of the O-M-G worthy plot-twists that took place. You'll just have to see for yourself. Take a date.<br/><br/>8/10 Stars."

Between this and ""Dinner For Schmucks,"" he's done a poor job of working the post-""Office"" movie angle. The script left no hint as to what anyone was feeling, and we had to take it on face value what was going on in the characters' heads.

It is rare that a romantic comedy can be as good as this.<br/><br/>And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this one almost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so. With Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actors who can convey almost anything, if the material is right. And right it is!

","Well, at least the marketing department must have done their job properly - the poster made me think that I was going to see ""The 40 year old virgin"" with a twist... needless to say that at some point I was not only rolling my eyes with disbelief but also wondering if I should not get up and leave - alas, I did not and had to endure yet another outpour of deeply illogical hamfistedly conceived schmaltz right at the end. I see that the film received mostly positive acclaim here which makes me wonder if I was one of the few gullible slobs who could not figure out the marketing buzz and ended up in the movie theatre, right beside two women in their 30s - basically the audience that would probably love this so called ""romantic comedy""... yep folks, it is supposed to be a comedy - the only problem being that most of the jokes are already in the trailer. Someone falls in love with his high school sweetheart and marries her but after 20+ years of marriage she has had enough of him so she not only has an affair but also tells him she wants a divorce. He is such a schmuck you know - wears funny shoes and is not up to her style so she is somehow entitled to move on. From this moment on, we are supposed to laugh at the poor cuckold and his feeble attempts to gain ground. But wait, although his wife is no longer interested in him, for some strange reason, he is the wet dream of a teenage babysitter - a notion that has some credibility only in the parallel universe of the scriptwriters. To make things complete, the cuckold's son is in love with the babysitter - luckily, there is no kindergarden girl being in love with the son to prolong this chain of unanswered love and affection. Anyway, the poor wretch finds his only consolation in drinking at a bar and whining to strangers about his lost suburban happiness and then - voila! - there goes our deus ex machina: a debonair gentleman who knows how to charm all the ladies. Sure enough he volunteers to reshape the hapless whiner so that the latter does not spoil the atmosphere at the bar with his constant and unwanted confessions... of course the zero to hero trip succeeds and the former loser turns into a lustful predator, managing to bed 9 women in no time. Credibility? Well, yeah - see my above remark. Unfortunately, this is not where it ends. There is a sugary monologue about ice cream and first love which - in the above context!! - made my bowels churn and probably made the women beside me sigh. There is also a twist right at the end which follows the film's own logic i.e. why not throw in more unlikely stuff, it may be fun. To me - it was not and I will be avoiding anything titled ""romantic comedy"" in the near future."

","I went to see this movie only because Steve Carell was in this and he is always good, given the right material. Given that this is a romantic comedy, I wasn't expecting anything new considering it's the same story over and over again. The movie had a good story and the first half was fun and entertaining, but into the second hour, the movie lost me because like all comedies, eventually the fun draws to a close and it just becomes ridiculous. A lot of this movie is implausible and would never happen in real life and there are way to many stories going on which makes the script more convoluted than it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Kevin Bacon are bored as heck on screen with barely anything to do except to spike the movie's budget up for a few known faces in the industry. This movie also has way too many twists ad turns to knock you on your ass and bewilder you. With a cast as stellar as this and two directors, you would think it would be more unique and to the point, but this becomes a mess and fast. I was really looking forward to this and wanted like it, but as a whole package, it just gets soggy after a while. This is a rental at best and to avoid all the horny teens looking to see Gosling shirtless and Emma Stone in bed just avoid the theatre."

","I'll pretty much watch Steve Carrell in anything, but this was creepy in several ways, starting with the lounge lizard (Ryan Gosling) being the wise guru and effortlessly bedding woman after woman (sorry, I don't care what his abs look like). The script lacks charm, and it's a waste of a lot of interesting actors (Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei). There's also one crazy, stupid plot twist you might say. The 13 year old and 17 year old characters are in there in a way that's far more disturbing than authentic, especially that gift of the nude photos that was absolutely god awful.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","3","24 February 2018"," Crazy, Stupid, Love literally sums up my life right now.
","The ironic and embarrassing thing is, the person I was watching this with knows how relatable the theme of ""finding your one true soul mate"" is currently. This will be difficult to review without affecting me personally, but when a film does that to you it just goes to show how powerful the art can be. We follow a variety of characters as they explore the emotion of love. A middle aged couple going through a divorce, a babysitter who has fallen for her employee, a young boy who's in love with the babysitter, a promiscuous dating expert who eventually finds ""the one"" and a young woman hoping for a proposal. Eventually, we find that these characters interlink in a sprawling narrative detailing the joys and sorrows of love. Despite all that, the biggest element that resonated with me the most was to never give up fighting for the one you love. And I know the person this refers to in my life will read this review, and I know they will do everything in their power to not acknowledge my true feelings...but it's worth fighting for right? Absolutely, and the film conveys that message eloquently, particularly in the third act which I did not see coming at all. I literally shouted ""no...nooo...NOOO!"" as one character attempts to regain a form of relationship, albeit goes terribly wrong. The narrative consistently switches between characters, reminiscent of the classic rom com 'Love Actually', which keeps the pacing interesting. Acting was emotionally investing from everyone. Ryan Gosling shows us that his comedic timing is excellent, Steve Carell is able to perform some dramatic scenes and Julianne Moore is always dependable. Emma Stone's character needed a larger amount of screen time, I felt her character was unevenly balanced. We see practically nothing of her in the first two acts and then she becomes the main attraction in the third. It just meant I hadn't warmed to her like I did with the other characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this though, I laughed, teared up and smiled. Love hurts dammit!"

Jonah Bobo drove me crazy, but I feel that his lines and story had more to do with that.<br/><br/>But the cliché's are off the charts, and let me count the ways. -Zero-to-pick-up-artist romantic lead (40 Year Old Virgin - same actor and everything!) <br/><br/><ul><li>Rich-but-doesn't-work-super-sexy-womaniser (think Barney Stinson without a shade of originality by the filmmakers) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Reformed playaa (Wedding Crashers) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Super attractive female lead who we know won't end up with current boyfriend because he's played by a no-name actor and the male lead has already appeared in the same scene as her (there's too many to list, but lets just use Spider-Man) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crazy one-night stand personality and the awkwardness that ensues (Wedding Crashers) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Boorish and cringeworthy kid love story (ripped straight out of Love Actually, but a lot less cute) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Teenage girl obsessed with older man (think American Beauty) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Everyone gets closure and lives happily ever after (Love Actually)</li></ul><br/><br/>OK maybe my list of examples is limited, but I'm sure once you've seen one you've seen them all (certainly true of McConaughey and I'm starting to suspect of Gosling too) By the end I was wincing in pain.

It's helped by having a decent cast. Although, I would say that everyone apart from Carell should be described as 'supporting cast,' as all the best laughs are generated from him. He takes his 'loveable, but bumbling' character we're so used to seeing him as, and applies it here to his cringeworthy attempts at dating.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is good too. However, he's merely Carell's straight man and the movie does slow down a bit in the second act when the story focuses more on Gosling over Carell.<br/><br/>However, it picks up near the end, before ending how you've probably guessed it would (assuming you've seen a romantic comedy before).<br/><br/>All it all, some decent fun with a fair few adult situations and gags.<br/><br/>Small criticism: might have benefited by being cut in length by about twenty minutes - just to tighten the comedy up and stop it dragging in places.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"eshwarmail","7","2","3","13 November 2012"," It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own.
","The build up, humor and chemistry between characters was so good in the first half, the remainder felt like watching a totally different movie with generic writing that just runs through the motions. While talking about the good parts, it is remotely inspired by a subtle combination of 2 iconic movies of the genre - 'American Beauty' and 'Love Actually' with performances inching close to the former. <br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carell) has just been asked for divorce from his wife of 25 years Emily (Julianne Moore). His son Robbie (13) is infatuated by his babysitter Jessica (17) who in-turn has feelings for Cal. Emily is reluctantly seeing her colleague David (Kevin Bacon) while Cal meets a mysterious young womanizer in a bar Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to loosen up and get score girls, Cal makes decent use of it. When Jacob meets an interesting but nerdy girl Hannah (Emma Stone) and decides to put an end to his ways and meet her parents, all hell breaks loose. My synopsis has taken a bit of effort to finish both from my side as well as yours (if you haven't taken a nosedive midway), well that is how the characters are linked and I have not included all. The story is about these relationships blended with slightly intentional dark humor. More than the script it is the performances that make it work. Be it the comic timing, just the beauty of watching them or the emotional depth (nah). Like I mentioned earlier, had the second half been handled with a bit more care and some innovation, it would have become an instant classic. The first half makes smart references of contemporary verbiage, Carell's unique histrionics and giving enough screen time for rest of the superb cast portraying well developed characters. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone continues to shine in every endeavor they take up. The kid who plays Robbie is very entertaining. The background score, cinematography and editing does not deserve any special mention here. <br/><br/>It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own."

","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a rom-com that gathers all the codes, clichés and stereotypes of the genre.<br/><br/>Yet, the acting is perfect, there is a good chemistry between Gosling and Carell, and one can easily empathize or sympathize with one of the characters. The script relies on a basic story, but well developed, dynamic, without overlong passages; the dialogues are well written with a good dose of humor. The cinematography is also quite good, as dynamic as the script.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie turns out to be enjoyable, without revolutionizing anything."
"richy1024","7","2","3","7 October 2012"," A smart insight into the middle-aged man.
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a poise between perfect love and the perfect heartache. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's movie is toned with a blessing of an appealing cast and a catalogue of emotions, accompanied by a sentimental description. The narrative is smart, counteracted by the bizarre irrational, dealing with love cheats, the self-pitying and the young and the wild. Steve Carell's role exploits the confusion of the male bearing. His wife Emily (Julianne Moore) declares her unfaithfulness due to her exasperated feelings of their long serving marriage. Cal (Carell) moves out in an attempt to clear the air, or in his case languish in his broodiness, wandering how his perfect suburban marriage crushed before his very eyes. Whilst in this fragile, yet sympathetic frame of mind he takes the time visiting a lustrous modern bar where he meets lady's man Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Jacob is a people watcher, a male spectator, inviting his services to help a man revitalise his sense of masculinity in an attempt to whisk the ladies off their feet and prize a night under the covers. Cal represents the typical middle-aged male stereotype, a lack of fashion sense, appalling hairstyle and a list of terrible handbook jokes. With Jacob's tuition Cal sets out on an operation to tangle with as many women as possible in a stab back at his unlawful and dishonest wife.<br/><br/>The film's ending cunningly weaves all our lead characters together in an unexpected round up of commotion and revealing confessions. Although we are familiar with Carell's usual role as the family sweetheart or the exile trying to bind his way into the mainstream, his usual temperament is recognised with mischievous tones that we adore him for."

","Finally a rom-com for everyone. Additionally, midsummer comedy Crazy, Stupid Love is at times as much a drama as it is laugh generating. In fact, is as serious a deconstruction of modern love as it is a humorous exposition of how stupid and crazy it can be for teens through adults.<br/><br/>And rewarding and mystifying and . . . Well, you get the idea: this film sweetly shows the fortitude needed to play the game, right to the end.<br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carell) is being divorced by Emily (Julianne Moore) after 25 years of soul mating. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) helps him get over his despair by teaching him to be cool with women. But Cal's heart belongs to Emily to the end. That part of the action is easy to predict; it's the other characters that lend color and unity to the pursuit of love by every healthy girl and boy, man and women.<br/><br/>Son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) loves babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who loves Cal, whose wife has had an affair with David (Kevin Bacon), who loves Emily. Throw in a horny teacher Kate (Marisa Tomei), whom Cal loves ever so briefly, and you have a zoo of unfulfilled love that only an American farce can untangle at only the right time. And it does, with a light heart that teaches the virtue of pursuing your love relentlessly.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid Love does better in the earlier parts of the film as Cal tries out his new clothes and line; in the latter part it becomes serious about it homiletic goal."
"tired_cornelious","3","5","12","5 February 2012"," A Disgusting Mockery of Middle Class America
","Crazy, Stupid, Love promised kindhearted, if not benign, pokes at the unpredictable misadventures provoked by being in love. Helmed by directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, whose previous film I Love You Philip Morris was an effortless blend of cynical sweetness and charm, Crazy, Stupid, Love seemed like an easy homerun when considering the superbly talented cast they had assembled. Sadly, this film only serves to prolong Steve Carell's post-40 Year Old Virgin slump, joining the likes of Dan in Real Life, Evan Almighty, and Date Night in the actor's past mistakes. It is obvious Crazy, Stupid, Love prides itself on its candidness. Characters blurt out whatever is on their minds, and act upon any impulse no matter how foolish. The film begins with Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carell and Julianne Moore) out to dinner during one of the most ritualistic of 21st Century suburban events – the date night. When Cal unassumingly asks his wife what she wants for dessert, she compulsively exclaims she wants a divorce. It turns out Emily has been unhappy for quite some time, and even confesses to having had an affair with her coworker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Cal is understandably blindsided by these revelations; he is one of those dopey husbands that assumes everything is fine when no one is complaining. Apparently being a kind, caring husband and father is not enough for the new bourgeois American wife weaned on The Real Housewives and other such filth. This film's portrayal of men and women, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers are, simply put, disgusting. This is a film where boredom is an understandable justification for divorce. Where we are expected to sympathize with a woman that kicks the father of her children out of his home without giving him any chance to mend their issues. Cal, having been cheated on and cast out from his family unit, is the one expected to ""change,"" and to be the one that fights for the marriage. This is a film that glorifies Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a 20-something club-hopping womanizer who lives off of his dead father's inheritance. With no ambition beyond sleeping with every attractive woman he comes into contact with, Jacob is most likely a degenerate sex-addict, bringing home a new girl every night. For Crazy, Stupid, Love Jacob is a hero. He is the savior to Cal's humdrum suburban persona, and promises to help the hapless ex-husband learn how to meet women. This includes maxing out his credit card on new suits, and memorizing every manipulative line and mannerism to trick, I mean motivate women to sleep with him. This film quickly goes from bad to worse, adding not only a silly B-plot involving Cal and Emily's teenage son and the babysitter, but also a misaligned C-plot involving Jacob and the girl of his dreams (Emma Stone). It is by way of these useless and underdeveloped subplots that Crazy, Stupid, Love sacrifices structure and common sense for shallow twists and nonsensical character development. It tries to sell depravity as charm, and selfishness for self-reliance. It portrays women as shallow and superficial, men as emotionally unconscious boobs, and everyone as oversimplified instinctually confused wrecks completely incapable of empathy or self-restraint.

"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","5","12","24 August 2011"," A few genuinely funny moments completely smothered by an overall insulting premise.
","Comedies have not had a good track record with me in recent years. Crazy, Stupid, Love didn't present much via trailer to keep me from pre-assigning a bad review, but what the heck – that's why we watch the movies!<br/><br/>CSL (as it will be called for brevity's sake) opens with about 90% of the trailer – Emily (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce, Cal (Steve Carell) can't handle it and jumps out of the car. Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), professional womanizer, and transforms from a simple, committed husband to a complete sleaze-bag. Meanwhile, Jessica likes Cal, Robbie likes Jessica, David likes Emily, Hannah likes Jacob, Molly likes TV, TV likes trailers for CSL, and we all follow with ease despite the attempts at misdirection.<br/><br/>The wheels really came off in the second half as all these story lines attempt to resolve and still try to bring the funny. As Carson on ScriptShadow says, ""the first 60 (minutes) were all one big setup, and the last sixty (minutes) are a continuous ESPN ticker feed of payoffs."" Unfortunately, he was talking about the script which I'm going to assume was significantly better than the film itself. Character development poses a problem for the payoffs. Actions indicate that each and every one of the characters are not just flawed, realistic people, but the kind of morally bankrupt individuals that can only come from the Hollywood mind. We're to believe that despite sleeping with a number of women in the what 4 months of separation from his wife, that Cal still really loved his wife throughout it all? That would fly if he slept with one woman, had remorse, and settled in to the main plot of trying to win his soul mate back, but we're supposed to believe his sincerity through some cliché dialog and a few pitiful acts of ""love."" Likewise, Jacob has slept with, if we follow the logic of the limited timeline we see, thousands of women. We're likewise to believe that in one hasty montage where he, for the first time, laughs and shows more than that half-dimension he was assigned, he's now a changed man? Cal's reaction to that is probably the most genuine moment in the entire film.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to unravel the twisted morals of that CSL throws at the audience. I don't go to movies to judge, honestly, but when the theme supposedly is ""true love"", this warped L.A. view on love insults anybody with a real relationship. If I were separated, slept with a dozen women, and then had the unmitigated gall to claim I never stopped loving my wife through it all, I would expect her to not just laugh in my face but also beat me to within an inch of my life. Cheating is one thing, but Cal's response to it is so odious that it just revealed that he never was the simple good-guy at the core. Once you pull that rug out from under the plot, there's nothing enjoyable or believable about this film.<br/><br/>As if audiences couldn't be insulted enough, this unabashedly Los Angeles-centric film was crudely dumped in to the indie film mold complete with quirky soundtrack, minimal locations, and lots of hand-held shots. Really? Do they think audiences can be fooled that easily? Them and critics both, apparently – Tom Long of the Detroit News thinks that this film should get an Oscar. He uses little phrases like ""astoundingly strong ensemble"" and ""Gosling, probably the best dramatic actor of his generation"" while wishing all the while he could get out of this hell-hole known as Detroit and live with the real people in California. Get a grip, man!<br/><br/>With a few genuinely funny moments completely smothered by an overall insulting premise, Crazy, Stupid, Love doesn't really give you anything to love."

First, the little boy told his babysitter that he has being masturbating himself while thinking about her, that was suppose to be cute or funny?? And the final scene, I adored it!: She gave him pictures of her naked as present (really??), she is just a body to use to masturbate???? Meanwhile he is stalking her when she had said several times that is was uncomfortable for her. The message is ""don't listen to woman, stalk their until they realize they have no choice, it's us, men, that choose what we want).<br/><br/>The other obvious sexist part is Call. He is a Don Juan and girls seems hypnotised around him, they put this sexist image of women like beautiful but naive person, without any judgement that are trophies; their only quality is beauty to serve manhood.<br/><br/>The scary part of this movie is the fact that these sexism concept are visualised with dull music and can easily be confused with an inoffensive sweet movie and It is not, It reflect an accepted submission role of women in love relationships."

","Love is the be-all and end-all of life. It's crazy, it's stupid, but you have to put everything towards winning over your soul-mate. That is what all of the characters believe. Except Jacob (Ryan Gosling). He believes that people who are in love are pathetic. Thank God for Ryan Gosling. I've been saying that a lot recently, but it's true. He makes everything he's in better.<br/><br/>Here, he wants to improve Cal (Steve Carell). Cal's wife (Julianne Moore) has announced she wants a divorce, so he jumps out of the car and winds up at a very swanky bar. The bar is basically Jacob's turf where he knows how to win over all women and get them to sleep with him. Disgusted by Cal's pathetic demeanor, we then get a man-makeover.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is that they make everything funny. From divorce, to objectifying women, to inappropriate soul-mates, to depression, everything is funny. It's not darkly comic or making you laugh out of awkwardness, but taking real situations and making them genuinely funny. I frequently found myself laughing just waiting for Gosling's next line. His comedic chemistry between both Carell and Emma Stone was perfect.<br/><br/>Analeigh Tipton, a young Liv Tyler-type actress, plays the babysitter with the inappropriate crush, but I liked her. She added another layer to the role with a little bit of sassiness and a fresh take to the character.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is supposed to be your standard romantic comedy, where you know exactly what you're getting. But it is directed by the comic geniuses behind ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" and ""Bad Santa"", and you should know by that that this really isn't all the predictable. It has twists.

Quite why the review on the DVD box claims it's better than 'Love Actually' I don't know, but it's amiable enough.<br/><br/>My main problem with it is that it doesn't seem to know whether it's going for heart-warming or lewd in terms of its humour. It flits between the two and ends up being neither properly.<br/><br/>A talented cast do their best with a so-so film."

","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy with a big heart.That is it is a refreshing change and almost a throwback to a golden era of romance. It relies on the sharp writing by Dan Fogelman and the sparkly chemistry of its cast, led by Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, and the emerging superstar Emma Stone. John Carroll Lynch,Analeigh Tipton,Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon play key supporting roles.It's not that the plot is ground-breaking but it is maybe the fact, the appeal of it is that it's all too easy to relate to the characters and the story.<br/><br/>At forty-something,straight-laced Cal Weaver is living a perfect life with the dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his life quickly unravels. Worse, in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of being uncomfortable as a single person. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wing man and protégée to handsome, thirty-something player Jacob Palmer.<br/><br/>This is not the ultimate romantic comedy.It is one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction.Also,it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the movies released out there.It gets better and funnier after a labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of most Hollywood comedies.It's the interplay between the characters, the true humanity of their emotions that is long missing from many contemporary romcoms that set this film in a class of its own."
"zetes","8","3","6","4 December 2011"," Really well done
","A shockingly intelligent, adult romantic comedy. Steve Carell, in his best film role, stars as a man whose wife (Julianne Moore) admits to having an affair. She also wants a divorce. After a couple of nights of loud whining at a bar, super-stud Ryan Gosling decides to teach Carell how to be a man - that is, pick up women. And it works! But that only seems to ruin Carell's life more in the long run. Meanwhile, Gosling, always the cool cat, falls for the one girl who is too smart for his schtick, Emma Stone. Stone is the best thing about the movie. She's so utterly charming and intelligent. She can elevate a mediocre movie like Easy A. In an already good movie like this one, she raises it to a whole other level whenever she's on screen. I also loved the subplot about Carell and Moore's son, Jonah Bobo, and his crush on his four years-older babysitter (Analeigh Tipton), who herself has a crush on Carell. The film also co-stars Marissa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, John Carroll Lynch and Beth Littleford (Carell's real-life wife). About the only thing I didn't like in the film: Stone's sassy Asian friend (Melissa Tang), who apparently has no sex life of her own. Apparently we've moved away from the gay best friend stereotype and moved into the Asian best friend. But besides that one tiny element, we really don't get that many comedies with this level of writing. It's a gem."
"Ric-7","9","3","6","4 August 2011"," Amazing script, outstanding comedy
","The best thing about this movie (and there many great things) is the screenplay. Though I thought there were a few script problems toward the end, perhaps some shortcuts had to be made in order to keep the movie under two hours.<br/><br/>The second scene between Jacob and Hannah is absolutely amazing, as Hannah unintentionally gives Jacob some important perspective on his life, and not by way of a lecture. For example, Hannah makes Jacob self-conscious about his appearance--compare that to a similar earlier scene. The Jacob/Hannah encounter is so well-written, so funny, and so well-acted, it's one reason I want to see the film again soon.<br/><br/>Another instance of amazing screen writing is the scene which has Emily on the phone by the kitchen sink. The script furnishes an occasion for an actress to put so much across without really saying anything important, and Julianne Moore is terrific.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei is given the chance for a star turn, and does it perfectly.<br/><br/>There are some flaws toward the end, and this is not a perfect film. But nearly so: extremely funny, well-written and well-acted."

Tonight I willingly tried to watch Crazy Stupid Love. I have never seen a movie that was so predictable. The characters, the lines, the situations, come on! I don't watch movies to see someone's abs, or someone's chest. I watch movies to be entertained. This movie was so far from entertaining it was ridiculous. Steve Carell was enjoyable, not as much as in The 40 Year Old Virgin, but not bad. The only thing is, this type of character can only pull a film so far. It is the epitome of female fantasy. Cute young guy, older aging guy, old ex-wife, young female love interest. Where did they hope this film was going to go? It went nowhere. At least The Notebook had a story, ( however sappy), Brokeback Mountain was a cinematic marvel (kudos to Ang Lee). This movie has nothing. If I were able to rate a 0, I would have."
"DICK STEEL","9","3","7","5 September 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Crazy, Stupid, Love.
","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is this season's equivalent of He's Just Not That Into You, Valentine's Day and other recent romantic dramas and comedies that sprawl in their dealing with that titular emotion that can drive you wild when things are going your way, or mad when things aren't, and especially the latter which is what this film had its multiple narratives dwelling on. The ensemble cast makes it a bonus to sit through with its star power on display, with a good mix of veterans and the Hollywood youths stamping their mark to make this a lot more memorable than your typical, formulaic romance.<br/><br/>With multiple threads running, we have Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as husband and wife Cal and Emily, who begin the film with an announcement that their marriage is doomed, setting off a catalyst of events and series of stories involving their son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) being infatuated with the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the latter's own infatuation for Cal, Emily and her romantic dalliance with office colleague David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) being the root cause, and Cal being helped by the suave womanizing player Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who falls hard for Hannah (Emma Stone) a lawyer who had spurned his advances, which has so far snagged him all his targets, and is now imparting his technique and knowledge to Cal to help him move on. Think of it as Hitch who doesn't provide a bill, but there to overhaul wardrobe and attitude.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid. Love. just about covers an entire spectrum both good and bad, well, mostly the challenging aspects about being in love with someone, from the feelings of being unrequited, that of what would be a stable relationship drifting apart, of loving someone much older, office affairs, bar pickups and one night stands, playing the field and being played, and the list goes on. Writer Dan Fogelman packs so much into the narrative though its near two hour runtime doesn't get felt thanks to the superb pacing in giving each aspect, and narrative thread, plenty of room to develop and breathe, not leaving you feeling that they are being rammed down your throat.<br/><br/>Some may balk at how convenient the story lines all play out, and frankly the way how the convergence was done was something that Bollywood comedies do on a consistent basis with everything coming together and the revelation being a moment where you inevitably pause to take stock and shake away your complacency, and work at your memory to pick up the clues that have been peppered throughout. It's the same case over here as I didn't see much coming, save for directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (whose previous film was the remarkable I Love You Phillip Morris) to pull the rug from under my feet and making me go ""I should have known"".<br/><br/>I'd always prefer Steve Carell in non comedic roles such as Dan in Real Life, that while there are funnier moments, he doesn't draw too much attention to his comedic side unlike his well known 40 Year Old Virgin role, which in some ways this contained shades of. Ryan Gosling aces the player role with his smooth talking charms until his washboard abs got in the way, and Emma Stone was well, Emma Stone in what would be a typical young adult female stuck with that fantasy that her prince charming will finally propose. Julianne Moore was a delight to watch as the woman who had betrayed her husband and still getting confused over her emotions, while Jonah Bobo almost stole the show with his performance as the young man so determined and infatuated with his babysitter, it just hurts. Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon add wonderful supporting screen time and star-studdedness to the ensemble.<br/><br/>With some incredibly witty lines that do make you want to sit up and note that real people rarely talk like they do, scripted in a certain way and delivered with impeccable, deliberate timing, Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a romantic comedy that punches above its weight. It may be rote and formulaic in some parts, but as mentioned its Bollywood comedy inspired plot development is something fun to behold. Recommended."
"FanPerspective","Null","3","7","4 August 2011"," Crazy Stupid Love is heartfelt, hilarious and grounded in reality!
","I couldn't be more happy with this film! The story is so grounded in reality. The writing is so perfectly heartfelt and hilarious. The cast is incredible! It's just a wonderful movie and kind of a nice break from all the big action films that have been dominating the summer. True, it is a romantic comedy, but I think it is one that the guys will enjoy just as much as the girls.<br/><br/>It may fit in the typical romance movie cliché every now and then, but overall the story is much more realistic. It skips the lovey dovey elements of a normal chick flick and introduces you to a married couple, Cal and Emily (played by Steve Carell and Julianne Moore), who seemingly have a normal life.. a stable living, kids, they were high school sweethearts. We meet them, though, at a not so great time in their lives because she wants a divorce. Now, Cal must navigate in the role of a single man with some assistance from a ""professional bachelor"" (Ryan Gosling).<br/><br/>Even the most serious of moments in this film are dashed with a flavor of quirky comedic relief.. the kind that life so graciously grants us so that we don't totally fall apart in a horrible situation. I also liked the fact that this film not only explored the topic of love many years after the couple had fallen for one another, but it also took a look at young love, as well; that first time a guy falls for a girl because it is like he is seeing women for the first time. Or the first time a younger person develops an interest for someone much older than they are. Everyone can relate to this film.<br/><br/>The casting truly was perfect. There a lot of times when a film features so many big names that it just tries to sell them and loses track of the story; the heart of the film. Playing alongside Carell, Moore and Gosling were the talents of Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, Josh Groban and relative newcomer Jonah Bobo. Each brought these characters to life in such a way that you forgot they were big name actors and just got yourself immersed in the story the characters were apart of.<br/><br/>It's definitely a film that you won't want to miss! Truthfully, I fell in love with it! When it comes to romantic comedies, I don't often find ones that I really like, but this is just a fantastic film!"
"Hellmant","9","3","7","2 August 2011"," 'Crazy, Stupid Carell!'
","'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Steve Carell returning to what he does best, emotionally sweet but honest comedy-drama. After a couple mediocre to dud films (like 'DATE NIGHT', 'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS' and 'DESPICABLE ME'). It's nice to see Carell getting back to higher caliber quality comedy (like his much better earlier films 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN' and 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE'). He's not the only reason to see the film though, like those earlier noted films, this is an ensemble piece made up of a lot of great talented actors such as Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. It's directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who also co-directed 'I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS') and written by Dan Fogelman (who's worked on the screenplays for several kids' films including both 'CARS', 'TANGLED' and 'FRED CLAUS'). The film tells the story of a recently dumped father who attracts the sympathy and mentoring of a younger popular 'ladie's man' bachelor. Carell plays the sad father and Gosling co-stars as the hip 'hot shot' womanizer. It's a well made and effective buddy film with a lot to say about love, relationships and family life as well.<br/><br/>The film opens with Cal (Carell) and his wife Emily (Moore) sitting down to a nice dinner in a beautiful restaurant when Emily tells Cal she wants a divorce, much to Cal's surprise. On the drive home she also lets him in on the information that she's had an affair to which Cal responds by jumping from the moving vehicle. Cal takes it like a man and moves into a small apartment but is devastated inside. Their two young children, Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King), are hurt by the news as well. Robbie is a thirteen year old with apparent wisdom well beyond his years and has just professed his love to the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who secretly has an obsessive crush on Cal. While telling his sob story repeatedly (to anyone who will listen, or won't even) at a local club Cal attracts the attention of Jacob (Gosling) who offers to teach Cal all he knows so he can hopefully 'regain his manhood'. The two bond during their experiment but things become complicated when Emily begins to show feelings for Cal again and Jacob falls for a young lovely woman (Stone).<br/><br/>The film is grade A material and production values all around; the cast is outstanding (especially Carell and Gosling, two of my favorite actors), the directing is decent, the film looks great and the script is smart and fun. It's equally as funny as emotionally charged and honest, although it does lose it's way a little towards the end. Like many, many comedic dramas before it the movie takes brief turns into somewhat sappy slapstick. It's a minor amount of screen time but it does come at key points in the film, which does take away a little from it's otherwise greatness. This is it's only true flaw though and you get so much more good from the film than bad. It's like at least twice as good as something like 'DATE NIGHT'. It's refreshing to see Carell return to form and actors like Gosling and Moore branching out a little (from their usual all too serious Oscar bait). As a buddy film it really works, as an emotional drama it really works as well and as a comedy it's equally as impressive. Other than the previously mentioned flaw it is a near perfect example of it's genre and definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA"

","Some Hollywood writer who's been burned at love decides, ""Hey, if I have to be miserable, I'm gonna make everyone around me miserable too."" Thus is born Crazy, Stupid, Love.<br/><br/>But to sucker the public into the theaters they have to market it as a rom-com, so the stars do the publicity tours and call it a wonderful, funny movie. Then you go see it hoping to get what's been advertised, but it soon takes a turn away from the nice, funny story it starts as and harps endlessly about infidelity, child porn, the futility of trying to get back together and the hopelessness of life.<br/><br/>Against all this negativity and depravity they throw in some really ham handed slapstick (the actors must have been embarrassed while they shot some of these scenes) and a cute kid, the boy who plays Robbie and steals the show, and some surprise twists. A twist is OK, it spices up a movie, but you know they're desperate when they put in another surprise twist, and then another one, and then another one.<br/><br/>And then they end it all with a lecture delivered by the leading man, whose embarrassment at delivering the lines seems to go beyond acting to reality.<br/><br/>I tried to give this movie a 3 rating because of the humor, which is good in places, but I just couldn't. On the IMDb scale of 10 it gets a 2.<br/><br/>There are Tragedies and there are Comedies, and if you are one of those people who likes Tragedy I guess you'll probably think this movie is OK. It's pretty much the opposite of a romantic comedy."
"FilmRap","Null","4","11","28 July 2011"," Charming, touching, surprising and fun to watch as well as being easy to identify with
","Dan Fogelman, who wrote Cars and other successful animated movies wrote this well thought out comedy about all too human relationships. He wrote it having Steve Carell in mind as Cal , the middle age guy around whom all the actions swirls as his marriage suddenly falls apart. Carell loves the project and decides to produce it with Warner Brothers coming on board to make it a big studio film. The team of Glen Ficarra and John Requa are brought in to direct it. They have been working together since their college days at Pratt in New York City. They have written Bad Santa and Bad News Bears as well as recently directing I Love You Phillip Morris with Jim Carrey. After meeting these three talented people at our screening we can see how their chemistry worked for this character driven comedy with a wonderful cast. Ryan Gosling played Jacob, the cool single but obviously complex guy who takes the recently jilted Cal under his wing. Julianne Moore is Emily, Cal's wife who is going through what she describes as a mid-life crisis. Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon round out this all star cast with each putting just the right touch on their characters. Special mention should be made about young Jonah Bobo who plays Robbie, the 13 year old son of Cal and Emily whose emotional experience helps all the characters and the audience understand the essence of the movie. The result is not only a funny comedy but a touching story which examines love that can start as teenagers and sometimes be destined to last a life time with trials and tribulations. It also looks at teenage ""love"" that may only just feel like love. The story line is close to being brilliant as the characters evolving relationships are charming, touching, surprising and fun to watch as well as being easy to identify with. FilmRap.net"

(and it did only $143 million)"" <br/><br/>This is an unimaginative and uninspired 'formula movie' that you will swear you have seen before, and it's easy to understand why.<br/><br/>Carell plays an identical character to his depressed-loser from 'Little Miss Sunshine' meets his no-idea loser characters from 'the Forty Year Virgin' and 'the Office'. At this point he's just turning up and reading lines, occasionally raising or lowering his volume.<br/><br/>Gosling has been told by the media that he is gods gift to women and is creepily vomitus in his- 'cool person does a makeover on a loser' roll (hasn't that been done to death already?).<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon? I'm embarrassed for the guy, he's an A-list actor playing a C-list doofus supporting role?

It's so choreographed, your eyes will roll like a cartoon character at the predictability of this script that was obviously written with a 'scriptwriters template program' (probably the 'Love Actually' template?).<br/><br/>This is a- 'straight to DVD' type movie, that I hope you have someone willing to make-out with while you watch, or a lot of drinks choke down this very ordinary Steve Carell joint."

","This was strangely one of the best films I have seen in recent years. I went into it expecting it to be just another ""chick flick"". I came out with almost completely the opposite feelings. First off, what a stellar cast in this movie! Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Marisa Tomei?! I was expecting it to be very similar to ""Dan in Real Life"" (a disappointing watch). Crazy, Stupid, Love incorporated all the elements of what a romantic comedy should be. The name itself is enough to summarize the story. Ryan Gosling portrayed a very different role that we know him to be; an unhappy, rich-boy who has an epiphany and meets the right girl. His normal role is one who starts out happy or sad, and just dives deeper down the rabbit hole (Stay, Drive, U.S. of Leland, etc.). Crazy, Stupid, Love was an incredible movie that evoked numerous emotions out of me (which is hard to do) and would probably everyone else who gives it a shot."

","Major let down. I watched this movie enticed by the stellar cast. I thought ""how bad can it be?"". Turns out it can be pretty bad. The only bright point is some funny moments close to the end of the movie. I find it annoying that it tries to be profound, but actually doesn't say anything that hasn't be said before about love, relationships, divorce. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is very convincing in the beginning of the movie and the photoshop line that Emma Stone utters is one of the best I have ever heard.

","It is so good that I watched it twice in one day. I watched it the first time and really enjoyed it as I was pleasantly surprised. It is like a suspense story with a happy tone. So in a few hours I watched it for the second time and traced the threads and appreciated it more. <br/><br/>It is probably the best romantic comedy I have not seen for a long time: it made me cry. It made me laugh (before my tears were dry). Then there were some uplifting and heartwarming messages. The whole cast is just excellent. We need more films like this.<br/><br/>Really love this movie. There are three love stories – parent, older kid and younger kid. So the movie will appeal to a wide spectrum of audience. Naturally it addresses three types of love: marriage and fading love interspersed with midlife crisis and adultery, promiscuous and materialistic vs. spiritual and physical love with communication, and youngsters' infatuation (Robby to Jessica and Jessica to Cal).<br/><br/>The plot itself is cleverly crafted and twisted yet flows very naturally. The cast were excellent. Everyone is likable even though they might be stupid and crazy. Julianne Moore is good as always but what shines in this movie is Steve Carell who proved that he can really act. I enjoyed the scene when Emily (Julianne Moore) called her ex-husband Cal (Steve Carell) to ask him how to turn on the boiler in the basement when actually she just missed him too much and was using it as an excuse to hear his voice. Cal was just outside the yard secretly helping and was aware of everything but he gladly and touchingly played along. That was so sweet. <br/><br/>Another moving scene is when they talked outside their son's classroom about their children and they had tears in their eyes. It makes you wonder maybe they should not have separated in the first place. They should explore what challenges they are facing and try to solve it altogether. Instead Cal did not deal with it very well. But it is so human - men usually do not know how to deal with these emotional things. <br/><br/>Jacob (Ryan Gosling) is another character so real in life – materialistic as he was, he was not happy because he had not found true love. He did all the things people did and thought love will come but it did not, until Nana (Emma Stone) entered. Nana was so different from other women - she kept bugging him to know more about him and he finally opened up. <br/><br/>What is love anyway? My only complaint about the movie is it did not touch enough on what love is except it never quit. It is not just sex. It is not crush. Maybe it is caring, missing and thinking about each other (Cal and Emily). Or be yourself and not judgmental of others (Hannah and Jacob). <br/><br/>I wish we had more comedies like this."

Emma Stone was sweet, funny, cute and did a great job. The young son of Steve Carell was heartfelt, adorable and really added to the movie. The ending actually surprised me, not sure if it was just me but I am never usually surprised in romantic comedies. Nothing too sappy, nothing too inappropriate or raunchy. The movie was almost 2 hours long but did not feel like it. For a large cast they pulled all the characters together very well. The character's stories are realistic making it a great movie. Not a chick flick just for women, Gosling and Carell's character's relationship is funny for all. This is a great movie for anyone to watch and portrays how crazy people really are when they are in love."

","Crazy Stupid Love is with no doubts the best (modern) rom-com ever and it's without doubts, my seventh favorite movie and I'm not a fan of romance movies.

The cast was fantastic, it included one of my favorite actors, Steve Carell, who was just amazing here, It included Ryan Gosling, his great performance was worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. It included Julianne Moore, who was just okay here. It included Emma Stone, who was amazing here. And the cast also included Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon. The soundtrack was amazing and the rest was also amazing. Sow, as you can see, so far, I didn't said there was something bad about this movie, for one simple reason, there isn't, what leaves me able to say that Crazy Stupid Love is a perfect film. Sow, men, women, movie lovers, you all should watch Crazy Stupid Love, it is a rom-com surprisingly cliché-free, it knew how to separate the romance from the hilarious comedy and providing you a fantastic movie with a few touching moments and a few hilarious moments. Watch it right not if you haven't, it's the best (rom-) comedy I've seen since Horrible Bosses, it's worth watching it more than twice because all of the viewings will be an amazing waste of time, a waste of air by the big quantity of jokes and a waste of tears, at least for girls, not for me. <br/><br/>Crazy Stupid Love: *****<br/><br/>10/10: Sow, Crazy Stupid Love is one of the first rom-com's that can be recommended for men and women and it's clear that everybody will love it, I mean, I'm a man and I consider Crazy Stupid Love one of the 10 best movies ever made."

","Steve Carrell's funny. Ryan Gosling is funny. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are funny.<br/><br/>Everyone's funny and sweet in this movie, and this is why it carries you away and makes you ignore some flaws and mishandling of social taboo.<br/><br/>I can't help but notice that the male characters evolve much more creatively than the female ones. Steve Carell's and Ryan Gosling's journeys are heartfelt, and the adolescent Jonah Bobo's would be also, but the fact that a 13 year old acts as the moral voice for the movie at the top of his simplistic and naive worldview is a detriment to the overall message.<br/><br/>At the end, Carell tries to find the answer, and the movie wants you to believe that Bobo and Carell learned their lessons, but they really quite didn't. The flaws that set the plot in motion and creates the whole distress they have to overcome are creatively dismissed at the end by the female characters, who welcome their female parts with open arms. Only Gosling's character manages to deeply transform.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the female characters lack a story arc. They begin and end the movie the same way, as if they were just waiting for the male characters to do their thing and come back to their arms, no matter what shape the dudes end with. The females lose voice altogether as the plot unfolds. Although all of them start with vision, decision, passions and shortcomings, they freeze as if a picture was taken at the beginning and it was maintained for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>To put it in another reviewer's words, it is patronizing to women in general. The overly patriarchal stance envelops many of the character dynamics, even though I truly felt the male characters were specifically designed to break the stereotype and add layers of depth to the male figure of our society. It can't be said that the same depth was successful for the female ones, so the final moral lesson was left limping on one of its halves.<br/><br/>I still scored this a 7 because the sweetness and humour are incredibly strong and well knit. If you're conservative, you'll probably enjoy a 9 experience."

"heidee7","8","2","4","4 September 2011"," enjoyed the twists and hilarious scenes
","I had absolutely no clue what the movie was going to be about, didn't even see any trailers of it. The title gave me the impression that it was another one of those mosaic movies ala Love Actually, but it's not. The movie revolves around just two guys - Cal and Jacob. Mostly Cal, though.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely, most especially the twists and the hilarious scenes. There was also a moment when a tear trickled down my cheek. I also couldn't believe that I did not recognize Josh Groban in the film. As I was watching it I was thinking, that guy is so familiar. Which film is he from? Turns out he's not from a film, because this is his first one (Though he has done some spots on TV, like Ally McBeal and Glee. Had no trouble recognizing him in those.) I didn't recognize him without his huge curly mane. I therefore conclude that hair has a huge impact on a person's appearance.<br/><br/>And now that we got that out of the way, on to the spoilers.<br/><br/>The story goes: Cal is out on a date with his wife of 25 years when she blurts out that she wants a divorce at the exact same time that he says he wants creme brulee. When she admits that she slept with another guy, he begs for her to stop talking and jumps out of their moving car when she rambles on.<br/><br/>He moves out of their house and frequents a bar, blurting his miserable story out to anyone and everyone who would listen. Jacob, an expert ladies man, sees him and pities him, offering to help Cal find the manhood that he lost and vowing that his ex wife will rue the day that she gave up on him. He gives Cal a total makeover from his shoes down to his wallet (which had an annoying velcro opening that made a ripping noise every time he opened it). He then brings Cal along on all his bar conquests that end up with him bringing ladies home to bed. In time, Cal is ready and manages such a personality overhaul that he mirrors Jacob's success, enough to bed nine different women, when so far he had slept with only one woman in his entire life; his wife had been his teenage sweetheart.<br/><br/>He sees his wife again during their son's parent-teacher conference and this is also when the first major twist happens - turns out their son's teacher was the first girl he hooked up with. And there goes his chance to get back together with his ""soul mate.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jacob is in bar moving in on another conquest when a rain-drenched Hannah who had previously rejected his advances swoops in and kisses him. Hannah had just come from a celebration where she thought her boyfriend (who is Josh Groban whom I didn't recognize as I mentioned earlier) was going to propose to her but it turns out he was just going to offer her a job in his law firm. Her anger with him had propelled her to do something crazy. She lets Jacob take her to his place so that she could ""bang"" the hot guy who hit on her at the bar. She nervously asks him to take off his top and when she sets eyes on his abs, she goes, ""F***! It's like you're photoshopped!"" When he asks her to take her own clothes off, she asks if they could dim the lights. They finally make it to the bedroom but as he is kissing her, she starts asking funny questions and they end up talking and laughing the entire night instead. This is the first time Jacob makes a personal connection with a girl, so he falls for her, and asks Cal's advice on what to do.<br/><br/>Cal is still in love with his wife and secretly tidies up her garden at night so she wouldn't have to ask her other guy to do it for her. While he is in one of these sessions, he catches sight of her through the window as she walks into the living room to call someone... which turns out to be him. She says that she's in the basement and needs him to guide her through something. He knows that she is lying because he could see her, but he plays along. And that's when he realizes that she also still loved him, as she was just making up excuses just so she could talk to him. This was the moment when I was so touched that a tear rolled down my cheek.<br/><br/>So Cal decides to follow his son's advice and fight for his soul mate, hatching a surprise for her. While he is in the middle of doing this, though, all hell breaks loose. His eldest daughter arrives with her new boyfriend who is none other than... Jacob. Both men are shocked at the revelation that Hannah is Cal's daughter. Then a friend of Cal's storms into the house looking for him because he had just seen his 17-year old daughter's naked pictures in an envelope addressed to ""Cal."" Cal had no clue that his kids' babysitter had been secretly in love with him while his 13-year old son was in love with her. Then the guy that Cal's wife cheated on him with shows up as well, and all the men end up trying to beat each other up. This was a laugh out loud scene.<br/><br/>Everything works out well in the end, though. Love for the win! :)"

"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","4","9 August 2011"," For Your Soul Mate
","Estranged Carl (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) sit in uncomfortable school chairs in the silent hallway waiting for their parent teacher conference for their eccentric son Robbie (Jonah Bobo). Carl says, ""I miss you Em."" He confesses his anger for not having the courage to fight for her, "" because you fight for your soul mates."" You fight for your soul mate. That is what distinguishes and touches your heart about ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa in tandem narrate this hysterical and poignant portrait of life. <br/><br/>I did not notice that Ficarra and Requa co-helmed this voyage until the end credits. In retrospect, this makes sense given the distinct narrative threads that poetically intertwine. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one the best movies of year. Julianne Moore is amazing, deserving of an Oscar Nomination. Ryan Gosling as master player and Carl's mentor, Jacob, is awesome in his bravado and reluctant compassion. Gosling too deserves a Supporting Nomination nod. Steve Carell is invisible in his understatement; though his performance as Carl is all authenticity, vulnerability, and courage. His speech at the story arc is in character, and powerfully touches your soul. He is brilliant.<br/><br/>The transparency and fluidity of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is the genius of Ficarra and Requa. They seamlessly envision the screenplay by Dan Fogelman. The innate brilliance of Fogelman is that in this world, people are smart; it's just sometimes we all do stupid things. The most courageous of us forgive. Carell and Moore have astounding chemistry. I was in awe of the scene at night where Carl sneaks into his home to garden the lawn. While their kids have ice cream in the kitchen, Emily calls Carl's cell in another room. She invents a washing machine problem to ask Carl's advice. He plays along, all the while watching Em from the lawn. What resonates is their unspoken love. <br/><br/>As ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" opens we witness all too familiar Carl and Emily having their scheduled dinner date, while the kids are left with the babysitter Jessica (sharp and beguiling Analeigh Tipton). Out of nowhere Em announces that she wants a divorce after 27 years. On the drive home Em also confesses an affair with co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Bacon is awesome in his charming smugness. When Em refuses to shut up, Carl ejects himself from the moving car. <br/><br/>Back home Jessica finds herself in the midst of Carl and Emily's implosion. Jessica secretly is in love with the solid Carl—why she takes the gig. Previously, to the deathly embarrassment of their son Robbie, Jessica unexpectedly witnesses 13 year-old Robbie's crush on her. For Jessica, Carl is the fantasy opportunity. For Robbie, he is perhaps alone on an island. <br/><br/>Carl moves out of their home into an apartment. Clumsily and desperately he begins frequenting a local bar. Slick handsome master player Jacob dressed in his Dolce' suit has compassion for wallowing Carl, whose wife slept with David Linhagen. Carl begrudgingly agrees to a makeover and Jacob schools him in the art of getting with women. One tip for Carl: Never talk about yourself. Amazingly sound. <br/><br/>In the meantime, smart and beautiful Hannah (Emma Stone) is a law student studying for the bar exam, with expectations of joining the firm where she interns. More specifically, she is holding out for marriage proposal from the firm's deadly bland attorney Richard (scarily boring Josh Groban). Hannah's friend Liz advises that she can do way better. She also warns Hannah that she has a ""PG-13 love life"". While the two are having a drink at the bar, Jacob makes a play for Hannah. Jacob is bewitched by Hannah, partial, because she seems immune to his charms. <br/><br/>Later when Hannah's world collapses, she tracks down Jacob to ""bang"" the hot guy who hit on her. He queries, ""They still say banging?"" Emma Stone is wonderful. She is naturally self-deprecating with a big heart. When shredded Jacob takes off his shirt, Stone says, ""Come on! It's like you're photo-shopped!"" Ryan Gosling is ripped, but that is eclipsed by his amazing performance. He humanizes the transforming cad, who finds his soul mate and is completely defenseless. Gosling evokes a quiet power. When Carl tells Jacob that Hannah is too good for him, he gazes into his drink and admits, ""I know"" <br/><br/>The cast all have their moments. Tipton is a surprise as Jessica. She captures the angst of the teen growing into a woman. Marisa Tomei is restrained comedic brilliance as Kate. Bobo as Robbie is harder to peg. At times he seems relegated to appointed jester; however, he poignantly reminds his Dad that you fight for your soul mate. Writer Fogelman culturally whips everything at us, from hysterical sexting, ""Twilight"" jokes, to even ""Dirty Dancing"". At the end one concluding narrative thread on the surface is humorous, and perhaps unintentionally creepy. Probably chalk it up to the eye of the beholder. Acknowledge and applaud Ficarra and Requa for the poignant and humorous catharsis. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is all about the possibility of finding and fighting for your soul mate. Sure love can make you crazy or sometimes do stupid things. And love is the only thing that matters."
"meeza","Null","2","4","7 August 2011"," Love this non-stupid rom-com! Call me crazy but I do!
","Call me crazy (as many have), call me stupid (see last comment in parentheses), and call me love (as many females that have called me crazy & stupid have), but I think the romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one of the best romantic comedies of the last few years. Before I continue, I must confess that I am a master of crazy & stupid puns and there will be more coming your way in this review. So let me get to the cool crazy of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Steve Carell stars as Cal, a dull husband & father who suddenly is dropped the bomb by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce. Cal's streak of hits with his wife comes to an abrupt end and he must cope in living a new single life. There is where the slick Jacob comes in, played by Ryan Gosling. As Cal embarrasses himself profusely in a stylish singles bar by yelling out the name of the man that slept with Emily, lothario Jacob takes notice and takes it upon himself to help stop the Calsanity. So then Jacob befriends Cal and shows him the tricks of the singles trade and the notebook to pick up women, Gosling can't seem to let go of those notebooks. Then we have Hannah & her Sisters, actually just Hannah, played by Emma Stone. She is an aspiring lawyer who is self-confident and initially does not let herself be another Jacob conquest when they first meet. Hannah wishes to be proposed to marriage by Richard, an uninteresting lawyer at the practice where she interns; it is quite evident that the charismatic Hannah is in a higher court than Richard, who is really a dick, by nickname of course (coughing twice). There is a quasi-creepy side plot in the movie of the babysitter of Cal & Emily's kids that I will not provide too much info on because that would be downright stupid to spoil it for you. Co-Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa do incorporate crazy in the movie with a lot of love, but it is hardly ever stupid. So yea, I do commend Team Ficqua for their crafty orchestration of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and for not letting it drown to the formulaic pitfalls of most romantic comedies. And it sure looks like Dan Fogelman was the write man to pen up the witty screenplay of the movie. I could not think who else can ""Calify"" to play Cal than Steve Carell himself, and he was up to par with a steady performance as Cal. Julianne Moore once again brings more to the table in each role and here is no different with her solid work as Emily. I would have liked to see more of Emma Stone (in more ways than one, call that one under the stupid comment category) but she continues to shine with each thespian assignment; and yes, it is another performance that earns her an Easy A in acting. Gosling was a scene-stealer even though at times I was thinking that he was auditioning for the remake of ""American Gigolo"". There were some fine supporting work also from the underrated John Carroll Lynch as the babysitter's father (sounds like a scary movie), Marisa Tomei as a teacher that becomes a one-night Cal gal, and Kevin Bacon as a colleague of Emily who wants her to eat his bacon to another degree. I did tell you that there were crazy, stupid puns in this review! So stop yelling at me!! Anyways, if you reached to this point of my review, you must be crazy. But please do not be stupid and miss the enjoyable ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". ***** Excellent"

","I could hardly wait for Hangover 2, it was terrible. Bad Teacher, another disappointment. All the funny lines were ran together for the previews and that was it. Horrible Bosses had potential but the characters were too dumb to be believable. Crazy, Stupid Love was finally a different story, just a simple, touching comedy. Not roll on the floor, but thoroughly enjoyable to the very end. I would see it again. I happen to think Steve Carell is one of the best comedic actors and he proved it again in this movie.The surprise for me was how funny Ryan Gosling was. I would never have pictured him playing a character that I really liked. And Marisa Tomei was really an extra bonus, she was perfect for her part."
"Bravesfan17","8","2","4","5 August 2011"," This one is really all over the place
","Crazy, Stupid, Love has many good qualities to it, but is also really all over the place. Steve Carell stars in this comedy-drama as Cal, who has been married since he was 17. Julianne Moore plays his wife Emily. One night while Cal and Emily are out to dinner, they talk about what they want. Cal says that he wants a dessert, while Emily says that she wants a divorce. On the drive home, Emily confesses that she slept with another man. Cal becomes too heart broken to care.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, their son Robbie admits that he is in love with his babysitter Jessica. However, Jessica refuses to do anything about it other than to tell Robbie to stop.<br/><br/>While heart broken and moved away, Cal spends his nights going to a bar upset talking about how his wife cheated on him. This catches the attention of Jacob, a ladies man who knows how to pick up women, played by Ryan Gosling. Jacob takes Cal under his wing and teaches him to change his looks and style and what to say to women in the bar.<br/><br/>The film goes through so many crazy twists and turns that directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa can't focus on what parts to focus on and what parts to leave out in the story. While a lot of the twists and turns all come together in the final act, this one felt too much all over the place and couldn't decide if this is a comedy or a drama. The only real flaw to me in this film is the directing job.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great. Steve Carell is a great leading actor and shows that he can carry a film and rocks at being the broken man who finds his way of getting his wife back. Ryan Gosling nails the role of the ladies man who takes the broken man how to move on, even though his game has been a bit lacking. Julianne Moore is great at being the fickle wife who wants a divorce, yet can't stand the guy who she is having an affair with. Marisa Tomei only has a few short scenes, but she rocks them all. Tomei's character Kate is a middle school teacher who Cal picks up in a bar. There is a funny twist about her. Kevin Bacon plays David, the man who Emily had an affair with. Bacon isn't given much to work with, but he does a good job. Emma Stone is also good as Hannah, an up and coming lawyer who Jacob finds himself crushing on.<br/><br/>The film is worth watching just for the acting alone. The cast ensemble carries the film through its flawed directing and decent screenplay."
"jadepietro","Null","2","4","5 August 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, Love. :: Funny, Smart, Movie.
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love. is not really crazy or, thank God, stupid, but it does speak eloquently of love and relationships with a honesty sorely lacking in most rom-coms these days. The film is a refreshingly honest glimpse of love and all its complications with a large amount of humor and pathos to spare.<br/><br/>After 20 plus years, Emily wants a divorce from Cal, a happily married family man, although he'd rather have the Creme Brulee on the menu than hear the news. Set adrift, Cal is forced to enter the world of dating and is mentored by Jacob, a six-packed sexy ladies man who is slicker than slick. Meanwhile, Jacob goes from woman to woman until he meets Hannah, a no-nonsense savvy young lady. Both men are suddenly in free fall, quickly in need of re- evaluating their vastly different lives.<br/><br/>Solidly directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, Crazy, Stupid, Love. ( Yes, that is the correct punctuation for the title. ) is a rarity in romantic comedies. It is romantic and it is a comedy with genuine laughs that do not sacrifice characterization or plot structure. It does not pander to cheap laughs or raunchy sophomoric humor. It is a mature look at mature people acting immaturely. ( Even teenagers, like Cal's son, Robbie ( Jonah Bobo ), who has a crush on his babysitter, Jessica ( Analeigh Tipton ), who has a crush on Cal, are handled with respect and poignancy. By the way, both young actors excel in their roles. )<br/><br/>The film has a biting sense of irony with its clever and witty dialog throughout most of the film until it veers into sitcom territory with some of the absurd circumstances foisted on the characters. Yes, there are also some nifty unexpected twists towards the end, leading to a totally improbable situation of farcical proportions, that, while played for laughs, is a tad illogical. Also, some of these characters' excessive reactions become a bit cartoony with silly responses that undercut the deeper and more heartfelt moments that the film successfully captures due to the well written script by Dan Fogelman and the fine acting from the gifted ensemble.<br/><br/>High praise goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as the divorcing parents, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the young lovers. Carell displays a piercing vulnerability that commands the screen and I was even more impressed by his dramatic acting skills than his usual everyman droll persona. Moore is his perfect counterpart, a woman conflicted by age and complacency, caught in a marital middle ground of uncertainty. Gosling takes an unlikeable Lothario role and layers it with fresh humor and impeccable comic timing. Stone adds an easy charm and poise to her cynical professional character. The roles of Cal's and Emily's rebound lovers, played by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, though well acted, seem to be from another film and are played for much broader laughs, one of the few missteps in this fine comedy.<br/><br/>￼Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a humorous and insightful film that sees our crazy stupid human flaws and celebrates them with laughter, love, and much wisdom.

"OrsonLannister","7","2","4","1 August 2011"," A Healthy Addition to a Sappy Genre
","I had three reasons for originally seeing Crazy, Stupid, Love this weekend. 1. I heard bad things about Cowboys and Aliens. 2. My girlfriend said so. 3. Emma Stone is gorgeous.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised with the end result. The scriptwriting was clever, witty, and never stiff, while the directing was top-notch. However, no matter how you play it, this is a character story. <br/><br/>Steve Carell plays Cal, a likable middle-aged man whose wife, Emily, (Julianne Moore) suddenly requests a divorce after 20+ years of marriage, along with an announcement that she has cheated on him. Heartbroken, Cal eventually turns to the rich womanizer Jacob (Ryan Gosling). His story of ""re-discovering his manhood"" (read: seducing women in a bar, including the wonderful Marisa Tomei) soon intersects with the story of the young, smart, and aspiring lawyer, Hannah (Emma Stone) as well as a deranged love triangle between Cal's middle schooled son, his babysitter, and Cal himself.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see Mr. Carell play a not COMPLETELY incompetent character for a change, and he plays it well. Needless to say, all of the actors and actresses played their parts well, but surprisingly, I was most impressed by Ryan Gosling's performance, a man who I previously viewed as pure woman's eye-candy. <br/><br/>For the most part, the on screen relationships were honest and endearing, with the exception of the middle schooled infatuation with the babysitter (call me cynical). The ""bedroom"" scene with Hannah and Jacob is especially engaging (even though I usually hate montages). Steve's love for Emily never seemed silly, and the babysitter's crush was played out just long enough not to be tiresome.<br/><br/>I also liked the ""twist"" (are twists allowed in romantic comedies?), which I didn't guess earlier on. The laughs were also plentiful and hearty enough without being too lowbrow/slapstick.<br/><br/>However, I have yet to see a perfect romantic comedy, and Crazy, Stupid, Love has its share. For instance, Hannah and Jacob's relationship is squeezed in and never given time to develop. They are given one scene to fall into unconditional love for each other, and although the scene works great, the relationship feels distanced. Also, Emily's reason for divorcing Cal is never fully explained. Yes, she cheated, and he's apparently boring, but she seems to want Cal back from the moment she leaves him. <br/><br/>I won't harp on Cal's son's wince-inducing endeavors for his love, but lets just say some of it was over-the-top. And of course, no movie in this genre escapes clichés (note to screenwriters: climax scenes of public embarrassment/expression of love where the on screen audience has no relation are NOT funny. Please stop). Finally, the first half flowed much better than the second, and guys will feel conned by the necessary Hollywood ending. <br/><br/>All in all, I found myself laughing, smiling, and enjoying this flick much more than I thought, and that's what entertainment is all about. I recommend Crazy, Stupid, Love. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and there's Kevin Bacon."

Mind you, very few actors could match Thomas as a cad.<br/><br/>Most modern rom-coms are awful and this one is only slightly above that adjective.

","Couldn't watch past 30 minutes of this movie. I found it very offensive (to men but especially to women) from a woman's perspective. It sells the idea that every woman will go to bed with any guy that is suited up and has nice shoes and slick hair. It becomes pretty predictable that Cal will deal with his failing marriage by becoming a womanizer and going to bed with random women he will 'learn' to pick up thanks to a stranger. <br/><br/>The little backstory we get as to why his marriage falls apart is incredibly shallow. He actually refuses to even talk about it. Very empty, unlikable characters. Not a romantic movie, not a comedy movie. <br/><br/>I hope this is a satire towards relationships and women/men and I just didn't get it, because if not, there's something really wrong with it."

","This movie starts out as a great divorce movie - sets up some complicated characters, and you see how these two people could truly love each other and yet stumble into a divorce.

Some funny little love triangles form, and dramatic tension slowly builds as you wonder how much they might blow up (and the payoff is good). There is a surprise third act twist, and then the movie just gets stupid. It ends up with some disappointingly sexist double standards made about casual sex. I recommend setting an alarm for the last 15 minutes of the movie - make up your own ending, and it will be better than the schmalz you see on screen. What a waste of great actors. Gosling's character in particular remains 2-dimensional."
"raeqxue","4","3","10","10 August 2011"," Crazy? No. Stupid? Kind of.
","The love in Crazy, Stupid, Love is not that crazy. But the movie is kinda stupid indeed. After watching the trailer, I thought I was gonna see a romantic comedy that can actually tell me something about love. However, it didn't touch me or tell me anything at all. Especially the directors completely loses control of the movie when Emma Stone brings Ryan Gosling to parents. I'm giving 4 points. For the first one, it's the minimum for a movie. The second one for the director telling a story. Nowadays a lot of filmmakers even fail at this part. The third point goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore for their chemistry while they totally don't look like a couple in person. The last one is given to Ryan Gosling for being so hot. As for Emma Stone, I had a lot of expectations for her. But she still looks like the high school girl from Easy A and not attractive at all. Ryan is just too sexy for her. Anyway, it's still a good movie to kill time."

","The movie suffers perhaps from too many characters and subplots but all the actors appear to have fun with their characters. The script, by Dan Fogelman, is unusually and gratifyingly bisexual - i.e., it boasts scenes from both the male and female points of view. And the The movie's biggest surprise is the revelation of Gosling as cunning comedian. The complexities of the heart are given a dispiritedly glib once-over in Crazy, Stupid, Love., a comedy-drama that pretends to be a honest look at relationships when it's really just burdened with simplistic characters and sitcom set-ups. Star and producer Steve Carell provides a dependable soulfulness to this story about a troubled marriage, but the increasingly preposterous plotting makes the film hard to love or even like."

","Crazy Stupid Love is a bright new comedy with a fresh script and better-than-expected performances. It's a good film, but in no way a classic.<br/><br/>We enjoyed it last night and I called up IMDb to enter a big thumbs up. BUT...but... before I could do that the film had already scored hundreds of 10-ratings, fully 40& of alleged moviegoers gave it the highest rating. As usually happens with Warner Bros movies, the amount of 10-scores is extremely lopsided and ought to be looked at with suspicion.<br/><br/>Corrupting the IMDb scores is easy, and I don't know any way IMDb can avoid it and still allow the public to score movies. Big studios have bought rave reviews from film critics for decades; now they are corrupting our internet scores.

","The trailers for this movie had me hooked, what with my being a Steve Carell fan already. My husband and I chose to see this on a very rare date night and I just loved it! Steve Carell is an Everyman-type guy who is hit hard by the news that his wife wants a divorce. Ryan Gosling sees him hanging around the bar and takes pity on him, teaching him how to pick up women. There are a few surprises in this movie and some of the twists and turns had the audience around us gasping, but mostly we were gasping for breath from laughing ourselves silly. This movie goes from serious to funny very quickly, but the switch doesn't adversely affect the flow of the film. Emma Stone was an absolute delight and I can't wait to see more from her in the future! Because of some language and a lot of sexual references, I wouldn't take anyone under the age of 18 to see it, but that's just my opinion. I think it's rated PG-13 and if I'm right, I'm not sure how they got that rating because I wouldn't take a 13 year old to see it, much less an younger child."

"Niko_Ramses","7","1","2","7 April 2019"," It's Definitely Crazy.
","""Crazy, Stupid, Love,"" a film directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, definitely lives up to its name of being crazy and sometimes stupid, however I wouldn't say I loved it, but I liked it quite a bit.<br/><br/>At first the plot of this film may seem rather simple. It follows the story of family man, Cal Weaver (Steve Carell), who is living the perfect life; he has a wife and a couple of children. But his world comes crashing down when his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), declares her desire for a divorce after confessing to an affair that she had with her colleague. Feeling down, Cal finds himself in a single's bar sulking about his current situation. It is there that he meets playboy Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), who offers to take Cal under his wing and help him regain his lost manhood. Accompany this plot with many intricately woven sub-plots and you are in for a wild ride.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" uses common genre clichés and use them to their advantage to the extent that the film resembles a British farce more than a romantic comedy. In most films, drastic changes in tone may seem out of place and sometimes, can even ruin your viewing experience, but in this case, it makes for better storytelling.<br/><br/>The cast of this film is noteworthy as well. Carell provides an entertaining performance, and brought a lot of energy to the film, yet I couldn't help but notice the similarities to his other works such as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and NBC's ""The Office."" Although he recycles his usual gimmicks, his performance never seems to get stale. Gosling also takes a fresh new take on his acting career. He is unexpectedly hilarious and steals every scene that he is in. This is not something that I expected from an actor that tends to take on a more dramatic pallet of films. The chemistry between Carell and Gosling mustn't be overlooked. It was very genuine and sincere. Even the child actors in this film were pretty good; their performances were not unbearable like some other child actors their age.<br/><br/>The dialogue and characters felt so lifelike and fleshed out. I applaud the directors for being able to pull off such a complex task so well. You can tell that a lot of care went into these characters.<br/><br/>Of course, this film is not without its flaws. There were times when the pacing slowed down and caused the film to drag on. It is understandable why the directors chose to do this. This choice made room for some of the best character development that I have seen in any romantic comedy. I simply wish that it had been executed more effectively. The soundtrack in the film was also bland and forgettable. It was simply a compilation of 80's pop songs. They rarely served relevance to the plot or scene at hand, and when they did it was so on the nose and blatantly lazy.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" was a great take on an often worn out genre of film. Solid performances, some witty comedy and a heartfelt script make it better than most modern American comedies, and is definitely worth the watch."
"markcalway","10","1","2","5 March 2019"," One of my all time favourites
","There are many good romantic films, but this one just feels different.<br/><br/>It starts with a broken relationship and Cal (Steve Carell) is the broken man. He finds comfort in a local bar and alcohol, telling all who listen how his wife had cheated on him. The same bar is the playground for Jacob (Ryan Gosling) and seeing the pitiful Cal takes him under his wing.<br/><br/>It is an interesting look at how how middle age love is different from young love, how in time we can lose our ways and sometimes we need to look at ourselves and fight for the one we love. It also reveals the weakness of casual relationships and the rewards of commitment and true love."

"arthur_tafero","9","1","2","21 November 2018"," Top of the Line Comedy/Drama - Crazy, Stupid Love
","Delicate subject matter handled in an intelligent way is really not the trademark of most Hollywood films; however Crazy, Stupid Love transcends that problem in several ways. Divorce is one. How can you make divorce bearable; or even funny at times? This film finds a way. How should we handle our first disappointment with love? How much should we trust our children with adult relationships? How should we reconstruct ourselves after a divorce (or should we)?
One issue the film avoids, however, is how the children we lived with every day no longer live with us every day if you are a man (most likely). But it does tackle those difficult issues mentioned above. It also tackles making new relationships and the bar scene. It has one hilarious scene with Tomei as a teacher at a bar, and she NAILS it. I have been with a few of these teachers many years ago; and she got it right on the nose. Steve Carell is perfect in this film, as is the supporting cast. The script is as crisp as a late Autumn breeze. The film reinforces the idea that love is possible; but not easy. Love is not just for idiots; it can be for people of character as well."

"bowmanblue","7","1","2","12 October 2018"," A rom com worth watching
","I'm not much of a fan of 'rom-coms' (maybe being a guy?!), but I am a big fan of Steve Carell, so I figured I'd give 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' a go and, I'm pleased to say, that I wasn't disappointed. If you've ever watched one romantic comedy then you've pretty much seen the formula, i.e. boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc. And, 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' doesn't really deviate from this (is that a 'spoiler?'). However, just because it doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, doesn't mean it isn't fun.<br/><br/>In this case, 'boy' has already met 'girl,' as the film opens with Julianne Moore telling Steve Carell that she wants a divorce. From there on he goes off the rails, spending his nights in bars, drunkenly lamenting his failed family life, until he's taken under the wing of (near 'professional!') pick-up artist, played by Ryan Gosling, who then helps him learn the ways of the Force (in 'Star Wars' terms), or at least talk to women.<br/><br/>The distinctly A-list cast makes up for the tired format and the bottom line is that 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is funny. Yes, if I was going further I'd say it was 'uplifting' and has a 'positive emotional message.' However, ultimately I was looking to be entertained and this film did just that. The characters are decent enough for you to care about them without ever becoming caricatures or cliches. It mainly focuses in the three stars I've already mentioned, but you also have Emma Stone and Kevin Bacon in there as well (who aren't used possibly as much as they could have been). <br/><br/>If I can one main criticism it's that the film is actually quite long for a romantic comedy (I even thought it was coming to a close around the hour mark!) and it does slow down in a couple of places (in fact, it was around the hour mark that Emma Stone's character - properly - comes into it). The ending is what you'd expect, so if you can forgive the lulls in pace here and there, it is actually quite good fun - especially if you're happy with plenty of sexual gags and situations."
"cathylr","8","1","2","16 September 2018"," Love, Actually, but the American way
","For those who have already watched ´Love, actually´, it is the same idea, only the American way. We are following several ´love´ stories in parallel that in the end are linked. It is just as refreshing, with a great cast, and a good sense of humor (not cumbersome as in so many American comedies).
For those who did not see ´Love, actually´, this film is about the different forms of love: the one for a lover, a friend, a relative, and so on. And of the difficulty of finding the perfect match, for the romantic ones. It is probably for an audience from 15 to 50 year old as to better identify to the characters."

","This is Crazy, This is Stupid, This is Love.
With its dynamic mechanism, story, acting and soundtracks, ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is one of the best films of romantic, comedy and drama genres. It is a film of good feelings and happy thoughts. It focuses on good, bad, sad and happy parts of relationships and love. From time to time, it takes you by surprise and, from time to time, you have the feeling like you are watching your own life. ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is a piece from everyone's life. Each and every character in the film represents a feeling, therefore, interactions of the characters are meaningful, funny and highly entertaining. There are no bad characters in the film. When you think about it, nothing bad actually happens. There are only confused adults who find themselves back after wandering around for some time. Each character wishes only happiness for the other one. The characters are the strongest point of the film. They are not very deep but they are very meaningful and their stories are carefully crafted. Conversations are great and there is not even one character who stays out of the line. When these characters fit in the well-structured design of the film, you get to see a highly entertaining production. From main characters to the supporting roles each actor and actress contribute to the film with all their enthusiasm.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is about love. It focuses on the problems of the routines of the marriage. It focuses on the struggles about finding true love or keeping it when you find it. It teaches us to fight for your soul mate and never give up on them. We learn this piece of advice from Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily's (Julianne Moore) son Robbie (Jonah Bobo). He is 13 years old and in love with their babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who is 17 years old. As I said ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is about all kinds of people, love and feelings. ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is led by Steve Carell, he is the star of the film. Julianne Moore, as his wife Emily, she is cold and distant most of the time because of the phase she is going through, but as an actress she is successful in reflecting this phase to the audience. Ryan Gosling is a brilliant actor who can play any role without difficulty. He is not only handsome, but also extremely talented. When you look at his filmography, you are going to see that he has played diverse characters. He is not one of those actors who has limited talent and plays only one certain type of role. In ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" he plays Jacob, who helps Cal find his manhood again. In the meantime, he unexpectedly falls in love with Cal's oldest daughter Hannah (Emma Stone) and things get more complicated for everyone in a very amusing way. With her little role as Kate, Marisa Tomei is playing the role of a recovering alcoholic teacher, who is passionate and sexy. Her presence in the film has a direct effect on the success of the film. I just love the way she smiles, I just love the way she talks. That being said, Kevin Bacon as David Lindhagen, plays the role of the co-worker of Emily, who slept with her. He also has a relatively small part in the film but just like Marisa Tomei, his presence manages to change the course of the film. When you look at these actors, you are going to see that, ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is full of well known, famous actors and actresses. Even from this, we get to see that this film is based on characters. Their performances make the difference in the film. When these brilliant performances are accompanied by a delightful story, you get successful film like ""Crazy, Stupid Love"".<br/><br/>The film opens with Cal and Emily in a restaurant, when they try to decide over a dessert, Emily says she wants a divorce. After that, Cal moves out, he starts to hang out at a bar where he meets Jacob, a highly stylish womanizer, and starts to shape himself up and fights to get his wife and life back. Cal's transformation shows us the fact that even in marriages like his, where the couple love each other, you need to change yourself. You should always renew yourself, because when a relationship falls into routine, it is very hard to recover from it. You can pretty much guess how the story is going to end, but, because of the great techniques used by the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, you get a lot of surprising turnings in the story, because the directors don't reveal everything from the beginning. We get to know the characters like they are not related and this is the reason why ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is a surprising and therefore a funny film.<br/><br/>From soundtracks to the performances, from story to its structure, ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" is one of the best films of its genres. It is both funny and real. This story can happen to anyone, that's why ""Crazy, Stupid Love's"" level of credibility is as high as the success of the film."

"Floated2","6","1","2","9 July 2017"," Different type of Romantic Comedy
","Crazy, Stupid, Love was a mild success at the box office due to it's ensemble cast and clever trailer. The film is a romantic comedy but not as much as the typical soppy ones where it first starts off as a somewhat innocent typical comedy then shifts towards romantic and finally more so depressing and expressive. This is a decent film and quite entertaining due to the cast, lead by Steve Carell (playing a similar character as he did in the 40 year old virgin) and Ryan Gosling who arguable steals the film. The other lead characters of Julianne Moore and Emma Stone come off as completely unlikable, but eventually get better as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Containing with several flaws, such as the wife Emily played by Julianne Moore wanting to get a divorce from Steve Carell's character Cal because she cheated on him, after being married for over 20 years was sketchy. It was a surprise as it was the first scene in which it occurred,but as the film progresses we realize it was only her character going through a midlife crisis and did not actually want a divorce. The film contains other subplots, one which dragged on too long and dragged the quality of the film down. Which involves their 13 year old and their babysitter. This subplot folds towards the end but it was easily the weakest link and wasn't funny, sweet or all that interesting. At fist it was okay, but seeing as it became an entire subplot and part of the film held it down. The best scenes are the ones involving Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell together, with Gosling teaching Carell his ways of picking up woman at the bar, simply because the comedy is loose, and it's refreshing. Their chemistry is what made the film.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love has its moments since it is quite a long film but a lot of the film appears to be as a fairy tale and very coincidental. Such as Cal successfully being able to attract Marisa Tomei's character then later finding out she is their son's teacher at a parent conference meeting (when the meeting appeared to be at the end of the semester- since the son was about to graduate). It's plausible but a little sketchy that the parents would just now be meeting with their child's teacher that late in the semester. (Spoiler) The other coincidental is of course the concluding twist in the near finale of the film. This was well executed but very coincidental and far fetched but played well. Involves Ryan Gosling's character of Jacob appearing to fall for Emma Stone's character then turning out that she is the daughter of Steve Carell. This scene appears within the last 30 minutes of the film at their backyard when everything comes into place and is well played for laughs. Elevates the film from that point on. <br/><br/>Otherwise this film isn't as great as considered but overall one can tell why this film did well with critics and movie goers as it isn't a completely typical rom-com but a bit depressing and very honest in the least bit."
"blumdeluxe","7","1","2","21 February 2017"," Blockbuster with heart
","""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" begins like one of these typical Hollywood comedies. A couple that's about to divorce, a man exploring himself, a dysfunctional family, nothing we haven't seen a thousand films about already.<br/><br/>And in a way it is one. It convinces through a massive cast, throws with cheesy monologues and ""Aw""-moments. But that's just half the story. This movie is more. Not only is it actually quite funny, much more so than many of the comparable films, it also develops a very intermingled plot that leads into a both absurd and beautiful ending.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, maybe not very multidimensional, but still somewhat heart-warming. There are some pearls in the soundtrack and small gags in the right spots. Sure, there are also features that are a bit too much the typical cinema release and in many ways, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not a very creative film.<br/><br/>But nonetheless I really liked it. While I was still a bit unsure during the first half, the second half could even increase the paste a bit and entertained me just as I hoped for. Nothing to change your mind or worldview. But something to change your evening or mood maybe."
"davispittman","10","1","2","25 May 2016"," Might be the best romantic comedy ever made
","I saw this movie some time ago, but never got around to reviewing it for some reason. Anyways, like I said in the description, this is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I think has ever been made. The actors portray their characters wonderfully, and the characters themselves are just so well written and gave depth to them. The dialogue in and the writing is hilarious where it needs to be and touching and heartwarming where it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Steve Carell have undeniable chemistry between each other, and that chemistry is definitely electric and alive. Also Julianne Moore is so hilarious here, she made me cry with laughter in several scenes. Steve Carrel is perfect here, no other actor could've done this character justice like he did. Also Marisa Tomei was very funny even though she wasn't in a lot of the movie. This movie is definitely not shallow, it's very deep with a lot of that subject matter and it really shows how intelligent the writing is. The comedy is top niche and the writing and acting is also of the highest possible quality. Ryan gosling and Emma stone do their jobs well and carry their characters all of their own. Stone and gosling also have great chemistry with each other, and that works well. There really isn't any downsides or negatives to this movie.

","Overall this is a terrible romantic comedy. But jokes and acting carries you through.<br/><br/>The plot is really stupid, and at times very unpleasant. Some will object to the underage sex angle, some to the stalking, some to the womanizing. What I found most grating was the idea of a sex-class system, where a girl should date someone not on her class level. And the story hinges on a girl dumping a guy for not realizing he is not on her level.<br/><br/>On the plus side though, the acting is mostly solid, and there are a lot of really funny moments scattered about. And I do like seeing a womanizer teach another without being a complete Barney Stinson copy. The ending though, Jesus... It is really bad."
"edmunds-18017","4","1","2","8 November 2015"," Boring stupid movie
","I was disappointed, maybe expectations was too high because of high ratings. Almost nothing was funny. I find there are very few good comedies from Hollywood during last years, probably there are some problems in this genre. To make a good comedy must be way harder than chunks full of special effects. Another one dumb... I can't call it comedy, a romantic film neither. Waste of your time. Nothing in this movie was plausible. A middle aged man, who's wife is vice president in some company, wears dirty running NB shoes matched with too big suit at his office (and restaurant) and when he finds out his wife wants divorce throws himself out of running car. Then comes the Saver and helps to get appropriate dress and the whole trite story begins. Really boring."

","Crazy,Stupid,Love is an excellent,hilarious,underrated Romantic Comedy-Drama that combines solid direction,a wonderful cast,terrific laughs,a great script and a memorable score. All of those elements make Crazy,Stupid,Love a fantastic and entertaining Comedy-Drama that is worth the time.<br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles,California,Crazy,Stupid,Love tells the story of Cal(Steve Carell),a man who's wife and High School sweetheart Emily(Julianne Moore)wants a divorce. Heartbroken and emotionally scarred,Cal receives advice from Jacob(Ryan Gosling),a smooth talking ladies man who that not only becomes Cal's friend but also teaches Cal to and to pick up woman at the clubs and bars and become a new Cal that is more confident and self-assured.<br/><br/>Most would agree that Romantic Comedies,while successful at the Box Office are predictable,sentimental and sappy but every once in a while there is a gem or a diamond in the rough to be found in the Romantic Comedy genre that stands out from the crowd and gives viewers a fresh take on the genre and one of those gems and diamonds in the rough is Crazy,Stupid,Love,a wonderful,hilarious and truly bittersweet Romantic Comedy-Drama that was a Box Office success but was overlooked because most people thought is was going to be another Romantic Comedy but the film is very underrated and is one of the best and better films of the Romantic Comedy genre. Crazy,Stupid,Love is a great movie that seems like from it's title is going to be a typical run-of-the-mill Rom-Com but the movie gives viewers something that is a little different from the norm and showing us a film that is very funny and heartfelt as well as fascinating and observant about love,romance and relationships because in Crazy,Stupid,Love themes of love,romance and relationships can come in all shapes and sizes with an hilarious and very interesting look at concepts and subjects such as failing relationships,beginning romances and unrequited love that effects people of all ages. This is a movie that just keeps you glued to the screen and will give viewers many emotions and feelings such as laughter,sadness and heartbreak while telling viewers to have a good time with this bittersweet tale of love and romance. The Comedy and Humor in CSL is funny and amusing and does a fantastic job striking a balance between going over the top and playing it straight because there is moments throughout the film that will make you laugh out loud while there are funny scenes that are more subtle. What also makes CSL funny is how unpredictable it can be at times and the twists and turns you won't see coming at all. The movie not only gives viewers the main plot involving Cal and Jacob but subplots involving other characters a subplot involving Jacob falling for working girl Hanna(Emma Stone)and another subplot about Cal's young son Robbie(Jonah Bobo)who's in love with his babysitter Jessica(Analeigh Tipton)who in turn has a crush on Cal. The many story lines and plots all mesh together well in CSL and there is not a wasted scene in the entire film. What I also enjoy about CSL is that the film is not afraid to be a little serious and dramatic especially with some of the characters giving them depth and tons of weight which makes the characters real and sympathetic while at the same time being over the top. The screenplay by Dan Fogelman is terrific and well-written,with Fogelman giving each of the main characters great dialog that is funny and interesting with many memorable scenes. The ending of Crazy,Stupid,Love is wonderful and a good cap-off to the film although some will find it predictable and obvious because of the genre and it's conventions but I like the ending. A fantastic conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Steve Carell is excellent and hilarious as Cal,with Carell being funny and serious. Ryan Gosling is brilliant and funny as Jacob,with Gosling being cool and charismatic. Julianne Moore is wonderful as Emily,Cal's wife. Emma Stone is terrific as Hannah,Jacob's love interest. Analeigh Tipton is amusing as Jessica,a babysitter who has a crush on Cal. Jonah Bobo does a fine job as Robbie,Cal's son who's in love with Jessica. Kevin Bacon(David Lindhagen)and Marisa Tomei(Kate)are fun and memorable in their small roles. Beth Littleford(Claire),John Carroll Lynch(Bernie),Liz Lapira(Liz),Julianna Guill(Madison),Josh Groban(Richard)and Joey King(Molly)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa is great,with Ficarra and Requa always moving the camera and giving the film and nice tone and visual style. Wonderful direction,Ficarra and Requa.<br/><br/>The score by Christope Black and Nick Urata is fantastic,quirky and matches the bright tone of the movie. Fine score Black and Urata.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Romantic Comedies or Comedies in general,I highly suggest you Crazy,Stupid,Love,an excellent,hilarious and underrated Romantic Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","There's a sad routine going on with romantic comedies nowadays. Bad ones, like ""Life as We Know It"", enjoy a wide release and a fat box office, while good ones, like ""Flipped"", remain unknown to many. But then, to our surprise, we are introduced to ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Here is a romantic comedy written with intelligence, driven by its story, and delivered with actors who are both competent and charming. And, what do you know, people actually know about it.<br/><br/>The movie is about a set of individuals who have, in their own personal way, lost track of true love. A few of them may have never even experienced it in the first place, but their story is about how they get there. Let me tell you about them real quick. Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore) are a middle-aged couple whose marriage has hit a major bump. Emily has confessed to being guilty with adultery, and is now requesting for a divorce.<br/><br/>Cal, in obvious shock, is swift to break the news to his children. Most affected is 13-year-old Robbie, who is in the middle of his quest of winning the heart of his 17-year-old baby sitter, Jessica. Kids, at the height of their hormones, can be relentless in their romantic pursuits. There is a lot of comedy between their encounters.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/crazy-stupid-love-movie- review/"

","Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) starts struggling with life when his wife of over 20 years Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce. When he meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) at a club however, he starts to look at life in a whole different way.<br/><br/>Crazy, stupid, love is crazy. It's also diverse, humorous, contains tremendous comedy performances and is superbly written. Starting off with a wonderful scene between Moore and Craell the tone is set for a bittersweet tongue in cheek lash out loud comedy drama. This is wonderfully balanced, taking into account Cal's emotional dilemma and the conflicting decisions of his wife.<br/><br/>Steve Carell, renowned for his more slapstick style of humour expands into a great main role in this film, playing a dramatic styled performance but giving the grown ups some great one liners. After he gets over his first hurdle there is a scene where he walks into the pub, like he is the king of the world. This is fantastic and you will be smiling, pure comic timing genius. <br/><br/>Julianne Moore fits her role well as well, playing off the other characters with ease and necessity. <br/><br/>But Ryan Gosling is the real star of this 2011 picture. His bravado out for himself protagonist is cocky, is arrogant is whatever negative adjective you want to use. And yet he manages to seduce every woman he sees, making him the envy of everyman and the eve candy for every woman. This film for me excels through its drama rather than the comedy. Taking into account the situations the characters find themselves involved in, the story plays out slowly, getting deep into the character's minds and expanding to deliver a pinch of comedy at the appropriate moments.<br/><br/>In many ways the film may have exceled more if there was more screen time for Kevin Bacon and Emma Stone. The stories involving Weaver's son and his crush is rather stretched and playing off on last ditch attempts to win one another's hearts only takes the film so far without giving the viewer anymore hope.<br/><br/>This story also contains some great observations on love and what it means for people of all ages and who should know what love is and how to go about proving your love from someone. Adding to the family and lustful dramas elsewhere with a couple of excellent plot line twists, Crazy, Stupid Love is a film you will definitely want to see."
"rbap","Null","1","2","25 December 2012"," A nice twist to the Ro-Co
","I hate to pigeonhole it to the Romantic Comedy genre, but I gotta call a spade a spade.<br/><br/>There's a twist though.<br/><br/>This is no 'boy meets girl' story of magical romance with cheap laughs thrown in. Crazy Stupid Love packs a tightly written script along with some great performances. Obviously, there are plenty of 'only in the movies' moments. The quirky parts also tend to miss the authenticity mark, but the laughs don't always come when you'd expect either.<br/><br/>I liked the fighting for love theme. It provides a reminder to all those who watch traditional Ro-Cos and might idealize those stories, that this is a much more likely ending -or rather, that we don't really know the ending nor do we ever find the perfect love, but nonetheless, it's still worth fighting for. That was nice to see in a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>The gloss is there, but there is something more for those of us who look for that kind of thing in film. It's a well made film and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"amelbourne95-43-3421","9","1","2","30 November 2012"," This is crazy, unashamedly stupid, this is love - just a shameless but hilarious portrayal of love
","Well, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Like other films of similar genre, though, it was still clichéd. I wouldn't find this among the Hollywood cheese, but I wouldn't find it as a classic. It still had that small spark that let it down, which I appreciate because it wasn't major, and it didn't try too hard to be funny. In fact, this film was pretty relaxed and like people say, the unabashed humour just made it a feel-good as well as a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>I loved the actors who played their characters, I like Steve Carell for his dry humour, Ryan Gosling was supposed to be the lady-killer who was actually quite funny, but I wasn't as attracted to him as much as the rest of the characters. As well as Emma Stone, I really enjoyed Kevin Bacon's little role – I mean, who can get more awesome than him, especially with just such an awesome name? <br/><br/>I was right, this is a great ensemble of characters, it was extremely funny, and because of the shameless (quite) realistic portrayal of how love works, this wasn't your usual romantic comedy from Hollywood. It was crazy, unashamedly stupid, and it was certainly love."

","Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell) is happy in his marriage and dotes on his two children. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is dedicated to the pursuit of one-night stands with beautiful women. And Hannah (Emma Stone) is a soon-to-be lawyer in love with a man who her best friend believes is beneath her but who Hannah (Stone) is genuinely hoping will propose. But Weaver (Carrell) is blindsided when his wife of more than 20 years, (played by Julianne Moore) confesses she's been unfaithful and wants a divorce.<br/><br/>We soon find Cal Weaver living in an apartment spending an inordinate amount of time at a local pickup joint drinking heavily and repeatedly stating the particulars of his wife's infidelity to the establishment's clientele. This puts a serious crimp in Jacob's evening and so he offers his advice and services as a life coach, of sorts. Meanwhile, he's made several overtures to Hannah only to be rejected every time.<br/><br/>I'll admit, there are few moments where the characters find themselves in situations so embarrassing, that I can't bear to watch. That said, this is easily the best comedy I've seen this summer, and perhaps this year. Good premise, great characters, and amazing twists you do not see coming. Loved it."

","This is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. It's a strange film in a way as it's billed as a Rom-Com but is far edgier and much funnier than that. <br/><br/>I am not a particularly big fan of Steve Carrel but here he excels as a man left bewildered when his wife admits to an affair. What follows is slightly surreal as he is taken under his wing by the charming Rylan Gosling and taught about how to woo women. The results are hilarious as both men change the way they think over the course of the following months. <br/><br/>An excellent cast featuring great performances from Gosling, Julianne Moore and the impressive Emma Stone make the very funny script come to life. This is a Rom-Com that no guy can be ashamed of watching and liking and the best of it's kind since Four Weddings and a Funeral."

Not sure that's the message I'd want to send to my kids. But besides that, it's fantastic. Completely unpredictable, bizarre and extremely true to life. I was fangirling like crazy throughout the entire film, which was a first for me. Everyone was perfectly cast.

"HelenMary","8","1","2","26 August 2012"," another Ryan Gosling triumph although that's hardly a surprise
","Aside from the superlative Mr Gosling (God Bless Canada - and here I'm referencing his nationality not a movie he made previously) which makes it a given, this movie is both great and good, and easily one of the best rom-coms I've seen in a very long time (Friends with Benefits the only other one recently). Described by a friend as a ""modern day Parenthood,"" if you remember that ?80s Steve Martin masterpiece, it too is a look at an extended family/social circle and how it falls apart and comes together again. Carell plays it straight and leaves his silly characters behind (much better than Date Night) and this is the first thing I think I've seen him in that I really enjoyed. He was perfect as the hapless cuckold, opposite the under-utilised but memorable Julianne Moore. Gosling and Carell seemed to have good chemistry (as did Gosling and Stone but who can blame her opposite Hollywood's rightful goldenboy du jour), with Gosling being the comedy-timing genius of the piece, and he was perfect. Flawless. Marissa Tomei often over-acts and is a little too samey but here she pitched it just right, and showed her superior quality for such a small rather silly/crazy role, Kevin Bacon the same bringing quite a bit extra into his few appearances. The younger cast were surprisingly good and I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Bobo, who showed maturity and confident delivery in quite a complex child part. In short, all the cast were great - also mention the actress who played Stone's best friend; very funny.<br/><br/>Well scripted, acted and with a lot of heart as well as humour, CSL is up to date and relatable. A great family movie, or just for the eye candy that is Mr G it's worth a peek; if you can watch the Dirty Dancing scene without making an impromptu squeaking noise when he takes off his shirt - or react like Stone does - its time to call the paramedics - I'm just saying, as he is startlingly lovely. Overall its an interesting look at dating psychology, a rather cynical look at it actually, but also looks at true love and friendship too, and what matters in a relationship. Heart warming, and enjoyable, I prefer Parenthood although this one has Ryan Gosling (Parenthood has Keanu Reeves) so it's a close run thing. Loved the surprising garden scene - didn't see that coming, shock - was a little distracted."
"shamontielvaughn","7","1","2","22 July 2012"," Less kid love, more adult love
","This film should've gotten 10 stars. My only problem with it is it spent too much time focusing on the 13-year-old boy and his 17-year-old babysitter. It was amusing at the beginning of the movie but overdone for the rest, and all of those scenes could've been stripped to get to the good parts. I will forever be a fan of Steve Carell because of ""The Office"" and regardless of Michael Scott being removed from the TV show, Carell is just all kinds of funny. I never knew who Ryan Gosling was before seeing him on ""The Notebook"" (and a co-worker telling me a guy who looked like him from a side profile asked her out -- made me wonder, ""Why in the world would you say no to that?"") but after that movie, I decided to check out his other work. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" was in the 2012 MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss (""Twilight"" one although after seeing this film I think ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" should have) and I was wondering why Emma Stone was dripping wet and running in a bar. I got my answer and I rewound that entire scene (from the bar to the bed) four times. I liked Ryan Gosling paying the down-home character in ""The Notebook"" and like Michael Ealy, I just didn't take him as much of a comical character. But like Ealy did in ""Common Law,"" Gosling pulled it off, slaps included. I didn't just watch the bar-to-bedroom scenes for the romantic parts. I watched it again and again because Gosling's and Stone's comedic lines were as good as their flirting ones. Same goes for watching them at the beginning of the movie with the lawyer jokes and terrible pick-up lines. I had zero sympathy for Julianne Moore's character Emily Weaver, but I'm always entertained by Marisa Tomei (been a fan of her work since she played Maggie Lauten on ""A Different World"" and later on with ""My Cousin Vinny"").<br/><br/>Great movie. I'd watch it again and fast forward past all the babysitter stalking. By the way, Carell looked HOT in this movie and I don't mean good looking. I mean ""where's the air conditioner"" hot. He really was wearing way too many clothes. The ""scuba"" line cracked me up."

","I thought this movie was hilarious. It made a bit of a mockery of the 'PUA' lifestyle, which if you don't know what that is, you wont get some of the jokes. There was a few rude things in there, but it wasn't over the top like the disgusting and unfunny movie, 'Ted.' I found myself laughing out loud, Carells sense of humour is like an art, and he is just so natural. I read some people complaining about the story line, editing and humour. They claim there's no romance or humour. Trust me, there is. If you find certain sexual topics a bit uncomfortable to watch with you family, be warned. They aren't graphic or disgusting, just a bit awkward. Overall, very funny movie, well worth the watch, and not a second of boredom!"

There was a cast in this that I really enjoyed watch in this and they did an incredible job. (Kevin Bacon was also a very good edition as well) Emma Stone tries to hesitate Ryan Gosling's charm, but when things don't work out with another guy she finds her way with him and I like that. I mean who can't resist Ryan's charm? Don't Know... Steve Carell did a great job himself. He gets advice from Ryan once his wife cheats on him and at the end some weird results go on. Amazing romantic comedy."

","I never once thought I would give a film such a high rating but this film truly deserves it! I never once wrote a IMDb review before but this film was too amazing so I just had to write one! <br/><br/>I love how it has separate story lines but cleverly intertwines towards the end. All the cast were perfect and could not ask for a better one. I thought it was a great idea to mix all famous 'in' actors/actresses that usually appear in one particular genre. For example, Emma Stone and Steve Carrell usually appear in comedy films whereas Ryan Gosling usually appears in more serious films but oh no, the film has everything. It's funny, sexy, sassy, smart and really sweet all mixed into one which rarely pulls off but this film truly did pull it off. <br/><br/>Furthermore, this is a great story, giving a moral message about soul mates and love and how age doesn't have to be a limit.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet, go watch it now!

"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","21 May 2012"," Acting out feelings
","This had potential, after the best of the Apatow cycle. It has wide appeal, charting relationships and sexual conundrums from the ages of 13 and being caught giving yourself a handjob under the covers to being 50 and getting a divorce. Each level is anchored by a charismatic performer who stops somewhat in advance of being a parody of their age, and has some chemistry with the others. The whole thing is nicely packaged as mature humor.<br/><br/>Now Apatow's solution to comedy of the previous generation, is that as soon as we had settled down and been prepared to laugh with a predicament, hues were quickly sketched that revealed human beings in actual pain; the rest of it was drama that was resolved in as much organic ways as the specific world allowed. So far as structure goes, it was usually a light scaffold in the back, say routines of a stand-up comedian dying from cancer or writing a puppet musical about Dracula while heartbroken in Hawaii. It was not original but provided a chart for emotional growth.<br/><br/>So this has chemistry. It has a more clever structure than usual from Apatow; several situations that riff on scripted seduction and acting out feelings instead of being yourself, all of them more or less disastrous in the end.<br/><br/>There is a teacher who rewards honesty with sex, she is the only blatant caricature here, the only one out-of-place, as though being frank in a world of manipulative lovers is enough to drive one to hysterics.<br/><br/>In the amusing climax, all the different performers and stories they have woven are brought together with explosive results.<br/><br/>What it lacks and is really sunk by, is organic drama. Every moment of some emotional resonance is stressed a little too heavily, analogies are forced, the result suddenly feels a little mawkish and contrived instead of a real world. There is much talk about soul mates and true love. <br/><br/>This needed a European touch, preferably Spanish; visual imagination, plus a more gentle drift of dreams into fate. A simple gesture would do, say the son buying the girl of his dreams an ice-cream, like his father did 30 years before."
"GrenvilleKoala","8","1","2","9 April 2012"," Very enjoyable on so many Levels
","Let me start by writing how much I enjoyed this Movie. It is funny, quite original, stylishly directed and the acting of the main characters are very good. Jacob(Ryan Gosling) and Cal (Steve Carell) do make a very good team and they add to every scene they have together in their very own way. Ryan is the confident and handsome young man and Cal is the at first quirky and awkward yet funny older guy. I also liked that both Characters are getting enough screen-time of their own and also that we see where Jacob is coming from and how he can actually afford his lifestyle which was something that I was dying to find out. I gave it 8 out of 10 points for the simple reason that it had too many resemblances to 2 other movies which kind of robbed this movie of being its very own piece. The first movie is obviously ""Hitch"" starring Will Smith which follows a similar story-line but more on the ""funny chick flick"" side. The second movie is ""40 year old virgin"" which coincidentally also stars Steve Carell and he also gets a lot of help to (re)discover his manhood.<br/><br/>One point bothered me a little bit. I would not go as far and call it a plot hole but it makes you think. How come that Ryan Gosling has to dress smart, be extremely confident, has an incredible upper body, has to ""do certain moves"" and throw money around to get girls and on the other hand there is this lawyer guy who managed to score EMMA STONE'S character with none of the above mentioned. Think about it ;)<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments, a great cast throughout and very entertaining twists. If you are looking for a great movie night in, not only with your girlfriend but with your friends and family, this is the movie to watch as it will have something for everybody. A lot of pretty ladies for the guys, Ryan Gosling for the ladies and a very witty and entertaining storyline for the whole family."

","I don't deliberately look for rom-coms in movie listings for the same reason I don't try on pairs of high heels before settling on my latest Nikes; I am not the potential consumer they had in mind when they manufactured the product. Put another way, I don't think ads for Crazy, Stupid Love were in high rotation on sports channels or in the pages of FHM.<br/><br/>But I have a 5 foot tall bundle of pent-up aggression that I must periodically pander to <br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carrell) and Emily (Julianne Moore)are a married couple in their mid 40s on date night at a plush restaurant. After perusing the menu for a moment Cal asks his wife of 25 years what she wants, she replies ""a divorce"". So the restaurant is not exclusively a la carte then? (I would also ask why date night seemed a good time to break out the news. I mean really, enjoy your meals guys.) Cal obviously had no inkling of the impending bombshell despite Emily previously admitting to a fling with a work colleague, and he seems to have understandable trouble in processing the news that his last quarter century has abruptly ended. Upon moving out he takes to drinking alone in a plush nightclub, annoying anyone who will listen with all too detailed specifics of the reasons behind his malaise.<br/><br/>Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling *SWOON*), a younger man who similarly frequents the same club, but a man cut from decidedly different stock. Jacob is everything Cal is not, he is bold, smooth and aggressive, the kind of man women only see in slow motion. The kind of man that seems to command the attention of all eyes in the room. The kind of man that can calmly eat dinner at the bar of the nightclub, wipe his mouth and immediately approach a woman sitting two tables away with the express intent of picking her up. For reasons unknown to anyone but the scriptwriter Jacob pities the older lion and he promises to 'reawaken the man in you', cue the lengthy montage where he does just that, and Cal is systematically reinvented from the New Balance sneakers on up.<br/><br/>Now normally that would set the scene in a typical rom-com, with the ingredients in the bowl it would simply be a case of playing out time in the unnecessarily complicated dance of inevitability, with whichever couple is deemed worthy of enjoying the purest form of bliss smoocherooing for the final few seconds before the credits roll.<br/><br/>But Crazy, Stupid Love is a deal more complicated than even that. There are numerous subplots and peripheral characters dancing here simultaneously in an out of proceedings. The proliferation of characters is a strength of the film – Col's son in particular is hilariously awkward and clumsily blunt – but it also requires a suspension of disbelief larger than more out there films such as Source Code or Limitless. The spoiler-free version acknowledges that a rom-com demands coincidences and twists, otherwise where is the muted suspense to come from? But this film calls for far more than mere coincidence, the karma forces at play here are so very strong that I would suggest the chances of actual occurrence would be the equivalent of winning the national lottery three weeks in a row.<br/><br/>But ultimately this is neither rom nor com, Crazy, Stupid Love has its share of romance (I guess) and is generally amusing without moving too far into either twee or gross-out territory – a line that seems to be getting harder to navigate – and although there are precious few laugh out loud moments on the plus side I never hated myself for sitting there, predominantly due to the strength of the leads, Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore are so likable that it seems a shame that their fake movie marriage ended, Emma Stone is rapidly making her name as the down to earth chick that threatens neither male nor female and it would be hard to resent Kevin Bacon even if it was your wife he was hunting.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Ryan Gosling, the current dreamboat for thirty-some women everywhere, nice and non-threatening enough to introduce him to the folks yet ripped enough to leave them weak at the knees.<br/><br/>I actually like the guy, but I don't really understand the allure of a softly spoken man who constantly slurs his speech like Gosling does, regardless of how hot the boy is. I'm pretty sure that the drawl thing is a turn on when he's whispering in your ear, not so much when you're asking – for the 6th time – why he hasn't managed to take the bins out even with those great heaving muscles.<br/><br/>I guess that's the beauty of the rom-com genre, for a couple of hours the normally unlikable becomes likable, the illogical somehow logical and the reprehensible strangely 'hensible'. Crazy, Stupid Love takes several disparate individuals and has them variously hurting each other in many ways, yet we as an audience can't help for some if not all of them to get together in the traditional male/female marital unit sense at least.<br/><br/>While I still haven't seen The Notebook (and hope I never will) I think Crazy, Stupid Love is a more palatable alternative for guys, and about as bearable as the rom-com genre can dish up.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. I will never watch this film again, but my first viewing didn't hurt as much as I thought it would."
"Notorius2","9","1","2","29 February 2012"," Funny and sweet
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is definitely on my top 3 Romantic comedies of all times, with the other two being Love actually, and Kate and Leopold. (The first two are much more superior in every way than Kate and Leopold but someone had to be third at third place). And this comes from a person that don't usually watch Romantic comedies but prefer action films.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love except from being funny in a sweet way also has a team of interesting characters that makes you wish the movie was 3 hours long just to see those characters expand more. Its a film that gets your attention from the first minute and that surprises you with an incredibly funny ending and makes it a movie to watch with any of your family and friends."

","This movie at first I thought was going to try too hard to be funny. However, it was way better than I ever expected. It has the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and romance. The best performance would have to be Ryan Gosling playing Jacob. There are no weak links in the movie though. The plot flowed nicely with very few holes. The soundtrack has a very good mix. The lighting and editing were both top notch. There were a few moments where the acting was over the top but really didn't take away from the movie.The ending wasn't all that great but that's the only reason I really took 1 star away from my rating. This movie is perfect for a laugh and a movie that isn't too predictable."

","Funny and intriguing at the same time is what I have to say about this movie. It's interesting to see how dots connect in a different field of our society, where a younger person teaches a middle aged man how to discover something he is not familiar with.<br/><br/>Definitely a thumbs up for the comedy which although not always ""laugh out loud"" type comedy, but definitely puts a smug grin on your face. The screenplay was vivid with no sense of interruption with aspects diverting away from the point of the story. One is glued really to the screen as it curiosity is raised as to what happens next.<br/><br/>Casting for the roles could not have been better. With Ryan Gosling playing a more jocund character than normal and Steve Carell being himself, the combination is ecstatic.<br/><br/>This movie cannot be missed for those comedy aficionados and neither for the fans of these two stars. To put it a better way: This movie cannot be missed unless your looking for a horror movie concept to lurk into this movie!"

","Good date movies, or RomComs as they are called, are getting rarer these days. Sure we've regular barrage of typical Jennifer Aniston and Katherine Heigl movies, but a good RomCom, we haven't seen in years. The kind that peaked in 90s with Meg Ryan movies( You've got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle), Love Actually, and Notting Hill. This is why Crazy, Stupid, Love comes as a breathe of fresh air. It covers all the basics. I know it is not realistic, but RomComs are not supposed to be so. They are supposed to fill you with a bittersweet feeling, they've to be in words of Notting Hill: ""Surreal, but nice"". CSL is story of Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, as they try to fight their mid-life crisis, story of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, as they find love in one night stands, and story of teenagers as they experience their first love. And it goes beyond depicting love at different life stages; it shows how they are inter-connected and love, despite of what is your age, is just love. And finally music. Any good RomCom has a great score and CSL is as previously mentioned, has a great score for a RomCom after many, many years. Songs are beautifully woven in the fabric of the movie. You begin to sense bitterness of a divorce in ""Alamanc"" and ecstasy of a great closure in ""Blood"". Shakespeare invented RomCom genre with his plays. It has romantic element and is a comedy because it ends with a positive closure for characters we've begun to love. CSL is RomCom of true proportions, where comedy is not used as a cheap selling point, but a smile on viewer's face comes from the subtlety. Here is where CSL scores. 10/10"
"switchrat","8","1","2","2 February 2012"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I watched this movie on the back of viewing Drive (also starring Ryan Gosling) and was not expecting anything particularly groundbreaking. I'm a big fan of Steve Carell and greatly enjoyed Easy A mainly due to Emma Stone's performance so the film did offer some possibilities for me. I watched it half-grudgingly, as I usually try to avoid any form of romantic comedy due to their usual formulaic nature.<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which didn't follow the usual formula of crass romantic comedies of the past few years. It made great use of its actors comedic skills, and predictably Carell comes off the best. However, Stone gets some great lines and delivers them like a seasoned pro. Gosling even manages some great subtle reactions, full of suave raised eyebrows and casual charm. I even managed to not hate Julianne Moore's bizarre facial expressions as much as I usually do.<br/><br/>I wonder if it would be possible to turn out a decent a film with just this cast and nothing else, even the lesser known actors do an incredible job and in the case of the kids and teenagers, often show up the adults. The bar scenes between Gosling and Carell are the best in the movie, but the climax at the school graduation and the showdown in the garden are so incredibly well written its hard not to be impressed no matter what your taste is.<br/><br/>As far as I could ascertain, everyone is either related or in love with each other, but the complex relationship web is easy to understand and you really begin to root for the struggling lovers and even the not-so- struggling in the case of Gosling. Carell manages to dispense of the Will Ferrell-inspired random shouting for genuine awkward hilarity which shows he only continues to grow as a comedian. The young cast also turn out impressive performances and Marisa Tomei's role is not only perfectly cast but magnificently played.<br/><br/>For anyone who has felt the sting or unrequited love, or the problems that can arise from a stale marriage or a relationship that seems dead, you'll find an extremely accurate portrayal in one of these plot threads. They really do speak from experience and the ways in which the characters come full circle and tie together so beautifully at the end of the film is inspired.<br/><br/>The story is nothing magical or particularly inspiring, but it has a great pace and is effortlessly told. My only issue with the film from a business standpoint is the title, it will turn off a lot of guys won't want to watch it because it sounds like another standard chick film. It shouldn't be a surprise of a good film, but it is. I watched it as an agreement with my girlfriend and it turned out to be win win, my advice is not to be put off by the sugary title and ridiculous cover shot and watch it, as there really is a different movie underneath the saccharine that is so easy to enjoy."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","15 January 2012"," Really terrific dark comedy that is a gem!
","I had heard from several people that Crazy Stupid Love was good so I had some decent expectations when I saw it for the first time but it met those expectations easily. This is the perfect movie for everyone because it is definitely a romance movie but also part comedy and heavy drama. Women and men can enjoy so many different aspects of this film but the key to it is the characters. This is absolutely a character driven film and you will laugh and smile and cry and just truly be enthralled by these people and their life.<br/><br/>Steve Carell proves once again what an incredibly versatile actor he can be. He is truly outstanding as the suddenly jolted Cal who has to basically find himself again. This is a coming of age movie for a forty something year old man. Carell has this way about him that is so emotional and funny but has this dark comedic element to him. Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as the smooth talking ladies man Jacob Palmer. Gosling and Carell have such amazing chemistry in this movie that they bring out the best in each other. I'm not usually a big fan of Julianne Moore but she is pretty good in this. I don't think she lives up the level put forth by Carell or Gosling or some of the other cast members but she fits into the cast well and has good chemistry. Emma Stone is terrific in her role. Her and Gosling have great chemistry and they seem odd for each other and yet they fit so well. Her character is fantastic and the twist to the film will leave you shocked! Jonah Bobo deserves mention because he is also absolutely excellent as Carell's son Robbie who is having a coming of age of his own. His role isn't big but its effective and he is great in it. Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon round out the supporting cast and they're decent in their roles though they don't stand out.<br/><br/>If I had to nail one genre to Crazy Stupid Love I think I'd call it a drama and yet there are so many scenes that are just truly funny, whether its dark funny, or awkward funny, or slapstick...this movie has it all. One of the best scenes I have seen in a film in a long time is the scene in Carell's backyard when everyone shows up and a fight breaks out, it was absolutely hilarious and yet heart wrenching all at the same time and that pretty much describes this whole movie. This is the perfect Saturday night date movie, or just a movie you can watch again and again and just truly enjoy some outstanding performances by some truly gifted actors and an ensemble cast. Crazy Stupid Love is really great! 8/10"

The story throughout the movie is great, and the plot is funny and well-thought. You cannot do anything else than loving this movie because it has so much heart and personality. <br/><br/>Sometimes a romantic movie can be too corny or too crazy and too stupid to love.

","After their ill-fated director debut, I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2009), duo filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa comes back with this sleeper hit in the lukewarm summer last year, it is a G-rated rom-com, composed of run-of-the-mill scenarios, but exquisitely draws me head over heels for it. <br/><br/>It took 6 years for Steve Carell to upgrade his 40-year-old-virgin status to a 44-year-old- loyal-husband honor, whose sexual object has remained as singular form with his soulmate (then high-school sweetheart, now the wife for 22 years, who is submerging into a quotidian middle age crisis). Steve exudes a tremendous bent of poker-face acting in this film, flavored with a whiff of sarcastic and knowing jokes; it is also a delight to embrace Julianne Moore back to a mainstream rom com since LAWS OF ATTRACTION (2004), her role is well-measured and no one will ever doubt her capacity to be competent for it. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pair suffers from a shorter screen time for their corresponding story about an invincible womanizer meets the girl of his life; but Gosling has the qualification to stride swaggeringly in the Hollywood now because his filmography proves that he is the next George Clooney with a much earlier inception (judging fairly by his three films coming in 2010). There are a third love lateral in the film, a 13-year-old boy's puppy love, could have been a filler, but owing to youngster Jonah Bobo's precocious strain, it parallels immaculately with the main artery. Another two big names here Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, the former's short appearance is the most hysterical part of the film and the latter is unworthily unprepossessing. <br/><br/>Near ⅔ of the film, there is a sterlingly concocted plot twist which could be a gratifying surprise, which attests not only Dan Fogelman's well-structured script but Ficarra-Requa's ingenuity as well, I have seen a budding spark from this worn-out genre of Hollywood film industry."
"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","5","1","2","25 December 2011"," Could have been...
","I kind of liked the movie, but it could have been so much better. Acting for this type of movie was above par, especially because of some of the convoluted aspects to the script. Must have been difficult for the actors to keep a straight face with all the shenaingans going on. SPOILER ALERT: What drove me crazy about STUPID, CRAZY, LOVE was the 'twist'. Come on now. Don't the screenwriter's read what they write? How could it be possible that the character of Ryan Gosling doesn't connect the name WEAVER with the characters of Steve Carrell and Emma Stone? How come we never see or hear of Steve and Julianne Moore talk of their grown daughter. Don't even know they had one until the big denouncemnet scene. Sloppy writing for sure. Also, how ironic is it that Steve's one-night stand with the Marisa Tomei character just happens to be one of his sons teachers!!!! Speaking of his son and that of the babysitter...that whole plot should have been nixed. Very creepy and strange. Too, bad, because this movie had potential, but someone really blew it. And what about the scene with Steve falling asleep in Ryan's naked crotch??? Very homoerotic and did not belong in this movie at all. One of the best things about the movie, however, is Marisa Tomei. Too bad she was short changed into just a cameo. The movie need more of Tomei and less convolution. Still an OK to spend 118 minutes if one has nothing else to do."

","Another fantastic comedy did 2011 produce with Crazy, Stupid, Love. Too bad, I don't flock to see comedies in the theatre too often or I would've enjoyed this one a lot sooner.<br/><br/>Some old concepts rolled into one movie get a breath of fresh air thanks to fantastic writing, humor, characters and acting. Everyone involved put their 100% in; everyone had realistic reactions and moved this almost two-hour movie to feel like it flew by.<br/><br/>Most notable was Ryan Gosling. He plays the clichéd womanizer, but does it with such depth and ease; you'll both love him and hate him simultaneously. It's no wonder he recently was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance.<br/><br/>Too bad Steve Carell was snubbed, though. Sure, he plays his typical mopey self, but he does make you feel for him every step of the way. And though his scenes with Gosling were great, his comic timing and lines with Julianne Moore were priceless. She laughs at his lines – that's her character queues – but it almost seems genuine, like she didn't expect them and laughed like the rest of us did.<br/><br/>This isn't to take away from everyone else. I always have a special place in my heart for Emma Stone. Let's just say: everyone, including the love struck son, Robbie played by Jonah Bobo, did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>Immediately into the feature, it's announced Emily Weaver (Moore) wants a divorce after 20+ years of marriage to Cal (Carell). He flips, literally – out of a moving vehicle, moves out of their home and begins anew at the bar. There he's courted by Jacob (Gosling) into the art of picking up women.<br/><br/>The movie's a lot more complicated than that with multiples layers and other characters and how they love their own interests as well as react amongst themselves. And despite the web spun from one corner to the next, the movie masterfully never strays too far and stays on track.<br/><br/>Great movie, incredibly funny and touching, it's an absolute must see. One of the best of 2011."
"Bob-45","7","1","2","10 December 2011"," Contrived, but surprisingly believable.
","Looking at all the plot contrivances in ""Crazy, Stupid Love,"" I can't believe I found this movie so engaging and believably. I don't much care for Steve Carell, nor did I find his character very likable or sympathetic. Julianne Moore, while a fine actress, is not one of my favorites, either. However, the ensemble cast is good, especially Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Analeigh Tipton, Jonah Bobo and, in an incredibly thankless role, Marisa Tomei, that I found myself carried along by this broad, sometimes farcical story.Writer Dan Fogelman's screen is so eccentric, it drew me away from obvious conclusions with snappy dialogue and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa make no mistakes, as even one would have caused ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" to come crashing down.<br/><br/>Some don't understand WHY Julianne Moore cheated and HOW Steve Carell changed. The answer is that Steve Carell took his life for granted and never developed his innate romantic skills. He had to discover his dark side before finding out WHO he really is. He reveals this in his climactic speech.<br/><br/>While production values are top-notch, they are also suitably forgettable. The important thing for me is I watched the closing credits with a smile on my face, new found admiration for Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei and discovered what a fine comedic actor Ryan Gosling can be."

Steve Carell, the same character in every movie.<br/><br/>Gosling, Stone and Tomei (whose screen time is criminally short) are really the highlight of the movie. The three of them are fantastic.

"jburtroald95","7","1","2","1 October 2011"," A cut above the rest
","Over the past few decades, comedy has become a devilishly treacherous genre, accumulating numerous convolutions for both the audience and filmmakers ever since the word ""comedy"" semantically shifted from ""lightweight drama with a happy ending"" to ""a nonstop rollercaster ride of laughs at the cinema"". <br/><br/>Story, characters, and even technical cinematic merit are usually pushed aside, either by demand of the audience or the laziness of the filmmakers, to make way for a riotous barrage of unevenly handled gags. In the event of a misfire – which, due to the unpredictable subjectivity of humour, could happen at any time – the humorous smokescreen is suddenly lifted from the eyes of any sophisticated cinema connoisseurs and the sight of the big, fat, filthy, empty void of a film that has been placed in front of them immediately disengages them. On the other hand, the more laidback moveigoers sitting around them will most likely still be recovering from the excitement of the previous bout of witticism and content to stare at the sexually-charged scenery whilst waiting for the next funny moment. However, if there is a long-term humour drought – such as one that last throughout the entire movie – then both parties will completely lose interest, with the former referring to the film as ""pedestrian"" and the latter calling it ""gay"".<br/><br/>Fortunately for all, Crazy, Stupid, Love. does not even take the gamble in the first place. It delivers multiple multi-faceted and secretly interlocking stories and many genuinely interesting and entertaining characters for it to fall back on, and which provide the film with real substance and a reason for the gags to be there. Without such things, comedy movies are simply stand-up routines and movie musicals and merely concert films – not that any members of the general public really care about this, but a film that goes down this lazy alleyway will almost always become bait for pompous critics and hypocritical everyday cynics. These movies are all forgettable, momentary phenomenons and huge and financial successes, but they also became subject to decades of relentless slandering after the fuss has died down, whereas films like Crazy, Stupid, Love. continue to have accolades and retain their popularity long after their release because they are uninhibited by a safe use-by date.<br/><br/>Popular comedic actor Steve Carell is at the centre of the piece playing Cal Weaver, one those familiar down-on-his-luck middle-aged recently divorced men, but Carell and the adept screenplay writer Dan Fogelman, against expectations, manage to render Cal in a way that feels fresh. In one of the most quick-witted and instantly engrossing openings since last year's The Social Network we see him dining awkwardly in a restaurant with his wife, Emily, and are as shocked as he is when she unceremoniously tells him that she wants a divorce. Yet, once again, a character that could easily have been a clichéd romantic comedy staple is imbued with a satisfying complexity. Played by the very graceful and prolific Julianne Moore, she adores her husband and the cute chemistry between them remains very much alive, however much it falters, for the entire duration of the movie, but after twenty-five years of marriage, beyond the point of the sugar-coated uplifting declaration of young love that concludes most romantic comedies, she is beginning to find that chemistry insufficient. <br/><br/>The devastation reduces him to a sad, sorry, pathetic little drunk spending hours moaning about in a bar, a loser that quirky and charismatic womaniser Jacob Palmer (a sensational Ryan Gosling) takes pity on and decides to take under his wing. Under Jacob's guidance, Cal successfully woos and enjoys steamy one-night stands with nine pretty women, no small feet considering he had previously only slept with one woman. Among these seductions is a hilarious double-encounter with spirited tigress Kate (Marisa Tormei having an absolute ball). After a while, Jacob starts to let his talented pupil play freely as he makes some big scores himself, most notably the lovely Hannah (Emma Stone) who has him particularly excited.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Emily is toying gawkily with the wispy upshots of her adulterated love affair with her oft-mentioned arrogant work colleague David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), a fling which Cal and Emily's incredibly precocious and uncannily perceptive son Robbie (talented Zathura alumni Jonah Bobo) can see put in the spanner in the works of the marriage, and always gives the evil to. He too is getting in on the romantic action, having developed an irrepressible infatuation with his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and, despite her obvious resistance, pursues her with astonishing. Despite the ridiculousness of this 13-year-old's actions, he is just as aware of how it all seems on the outside as the jeering adults are, and one cannot help but empathise and identify with a character so reminiscent and truthful to the frustratedly never taken seriously child that we all once were.<br/><br/>These interconnected scenarios are developed naturally and quietly, yet entertainingly, in the end producing a hugely satisfying, electrically comical and genuinely surprising culmination at a point which would ideally be the film's explosive finale, but as always precedes a less high-spirited and gloomier last few concluding scenes that are usually a maddeningly tedious and painfully predictable failed attempt at creating pathos where it is neither wanted nor possible. However, in this case it is perfectly possible and not entirely unwelcome, but it does still leave one feeling that the film was overly long.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is brilliant work and makes for a highly enjoyable trip to the cinema."
"writers_reign","Null","1","2","24 September 2011"," Checkov DID Write Comedies After All
","Anton Checkov was wont to describe his great plays - Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, The Seagull, The Cherry Orchard, as comedies but in England directors tend to stress the melancholy and there's a nice link here inasmuch as Julianne Moore appeared in arguably the best film adaption of Checkov that has so far appeared, Vanya on 42nd Street, a play in which, not unlike Crazy, Stupid, Love, characters are apt to fall in love with love objects who are themselves equally unrequitedly in love with someone else. It's further referential in the sequence where Gosling takes Carell's wardrobe in hand which echoes a similar sequence in Come Blow Your Horn where Sinatra, a swinger-about-town, takes strait-laced kid brother, Tony Bill, on a similar shopping and grooming expedition. Referential or not this is still an exceptional feel-good film albeit one with more of a spine than others of the ilk. The acting is uniformly up to snuff with Marisa Tomei making a strong bid to steal if from under the nose of Julianne Moore. Aimed at the Multiplex crown it is close to the crossover point between Multiplex and Art-house and well worth seeing."

","¨I'm so mad at you; I'm really mad at you for what you did, but I'm mad at myself too; because I should not have jumped out of that car; I should have fought for you, because you fight for your soul mates.¨ Once every year out of the dozens of formulaic romantic comedies that come our way, one or two manage to stand out above the rest. Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those films that manages to remain fresh and original, and balance the comedy and romance well enough without relying on the usual rom-com formula. It is one of those films where the chemistry between the actors feels real, and love is actually depicted like it can be in real life. It is one of those movies that manages to surprise us by remaining fresh and never letting us know for sure what direction it is going to take on every turn. You can predict how most romcoms are going to end from the very opening sequence, and even if you might do the same in Crazy, Stupid, Love; you will definitely not expect some of the twists that come your way. It also has the perfect emotional balance that will bring you to tears at some points and laughter at others. The cast is absolutely amazing and everyone does a terrific job. This is Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's second feature film after last year's critical success with I Love You Phillip Morris. That film was very risky, and in a way so is Crazy, Stupid, Love because it doesn't follow the basic formula that other romcoms do. There are several scenes that could have been a total disaster, but really worked because they served as transitions from comedy to romance to drama and so on. The script by Dan Fogelman (Cars, Bolt, and Tangled) is another highlight of the film because the dialogue in this movie was great. The actors were given great characters to work with so every piece seemed to fit in perfectly for this film.<br/><br/>Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have been married for 25 years; they live with their two children: Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King) and they seem to be living the perfect life. That is until Emily asks Cal for a divorce because she seems to be going through a sort of mid life crisis. She tells Cal that she slept with another co-worker, David (Kevin Bacon), and that is more than enough to end the marriage. Cal moves out of the house and begins frequenting bars and moping about his miserable life. At the bar Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a playboy who always gets the girl due to his charm. Jacob promises Cal that he will help him recover his manhood with a few lessons. The first thing they do is change Cal's wardrobe, then he teaches him how to pick up girls in the bar, and pretty soon Cal becomes an expert on seducing women. Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone) one night in the bar and can't seem to get his eyes off her. Hannah doesn't fall for Jacob's charisma at first, but Jacob will soon discover what being in love is really about. All the characters seem to intertwine with each other at one point or another making the movie all the more hilarious. For example we have Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the 17 year old babysitter who has a crush on Cal, but at the same time Robbie, his 13 year old son, is in love with Jessica.<br/><br/>It's these love triangles and confusions that actually prove that love can be crazy and stupid at times, but wonderful at others. There is a great amount of time dedicated to each character, and the focus isn't solely on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore. There are several more relationships that the movie deals with, but it never loses the main thread. The film balances the romance with the comedy really well, making this a very emotional film. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The entire cast was just brilliant. I loved the mope performance from Steve Carell, although we've seen it before in other films like Dan in Real Life. Julianne Moore is always a talented actress and she brings her game. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are very talented young actors and the chemistry between both of them was really believable. Gosling has to be one of Hollywood's best modern young actors around. The actors who really surprised me however were the relatively unknown ones: Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo; they share the funniest scenes in the film. Marisa Tomei also has some screen time, and she is great as always. Crazy, Stupid, Love is just a complete film that manages to deliver on all levels. It is my favorite romantic comedy of the year so far, and will probably be on my list of best films of the year. This is a movie you will want to go see.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"phd_travel","8","1","2","12 September 2011"," Good story and funny just a little slow in parts
","This movie is good. There are a few faults, but overall it is one of the better movies about relationships and different kinds of love. It's not a laugh a minute film but it is a laugh out loud film when it is funny. The silly title suggests a more comical plot but it has more of a laid back not over sentimental feel. Enjoyed Steve's makeover that wasn't too extreme. The different aspects of the plot lines come together very nicely. One part I found very realistic but amusing was the take on divorce from the man's point of view and the relationships that fill the void. Julianne Moore is a bit haggard looking. Steve is his usual self - lucky the movie doesn't rely too much on him looking helpless as usual. Ryan is cool, good to see him out of his usual serious role he could do more comedy. Emma isn't very beautiful but she is expressive so interesting to watch. The kids who played the baby sitter and son could have been more endearing - they were a little bit unappealing. A few faults: It is a bit draggy in parts. Some scenes could have been shortened and cut. Some cringe inducing parts could have been left out. I think the director needed to tighten the story and cut about 15 minutes or so. Also there are some times when the characters reactions could have been toned down. There are some over reactions eg Marisa Tomei's. Overall still very enjoyable."

","I... I loved it. Guess I can end my review right there. But I'm not going to.<br/><br/>I... was mind-blown, literally. I went into the theater all happy because I was FINALLY gonna get to see ""The new Emma Stone movie"" (I'm a huge fan), and I came out with a HUGE grin on my face. I literally walked around with my teeth sticking out for about 10 minutes... literally. The movie was... well to quote myself when my friend asked me, ""DUUUUUDE, IT WAS SOOOOO F****** AMAZING"".<br/><br/>Hilarious... a few twists... heart-filled drama (I almost cried, ALMOST)... and Emma Stone. I give it a 9/10 for awesomeness but a bit (A BIT)of a bad script, some of the lines weren't great, I was expecting a few love quotes and also Emma Stone didn't get enough screen time (in my opinion)... but I guess that's what make's this movie so great, it wasn't what I expected."
"hotspur75","8","1","2","28 August 2011"," Not what you might expect
","On the surface that trailers supply for us, this film looks like a run-of-the-mill How Cal Got His Groove Back. We follow Carell's character (Cal) after his wife, Emily (played by Julianne Moore) blurt's out over dinner that she wants a divorce. It's not a stunning hook, since we kind of already knew it was going to happen from the trailer, but it works well. In a Rom-Com, that's basically what you are looking for. New ways to freshen up a cliché, or fresh takes on familiar situations. Crazy, Stupid, Love essentially lives in the latter as we find Cal as the perfect dad who's only real sin here is that he is content with his life and family, and it is the wife who gets cast in the shallow role.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, we get the story of young Hannah (Emma Stone). She's an aspiring attorney who is about to take the BAR exam and really hoping that clean cut, gosh-golly-shucks Richard (Josh Groban) will ask her to marry him. If you want foreign, here it is. The sexy, brilliant girl wants Ned Flanders instead of smoking hot Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Totally a dude crush here. He's cut, he's not a high school football player who loves country music, and he's definitely not hanging around some lady with Alzheimer's. He's the ladies man who considers himself a gentleman because he knows how to get her home, and get her to want him so much she basically begs for it.<br/><br/>On the outskirts, a puppy love story between Robbie and Jessica. Well, sort of. Robbie is Cal's son and Jessica is his babysitter. Hilarity and awkwardness ensues. Honestly, this is one of the greatest treats of the film as Robbie (Jonah Bobo) carries the scenes between he and his dad, and there is palpable tension between Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and Cal's ex, Emily (Moore), as Jess has the requisite crush on the dad, and thinks Emily is crazy for leaving him.<br/><br/>That is your basic set-up. The comedy style is little bit Carell, and little bit Americanized-British humor (awkward situations and social faux paux). The main reason I didn't give the movie 9or ten stars is because we have rich characters to play with and they barely scratch the surface. We get an 80s montage of verbage from Jacob to explain why he hunts women the way he does, an unexplained purpose for the mentorship of Jacob toward Cal (other than some character development for Jacob), and some mind-blowing insight from a junior high student (Bobo) that we have no idea where he picked it up. The main point is to say, if you like Carell, you'll like the movie. If you like romantic-comedies, this one will twist you up and leave you delighted. If you are a fan of things like love and marriage, this film will remind you of some reasons you think people are crazy for not getting married and taking a chance that this person might just be your soul mate. The characters are crazy, they do some stupid things, and, for better or worse, it is all for the glory of love."
"EUyeshima","8","1","2","27 August 2011"," Smart, Dexterous Roundelay of Love's Labor Lost
","I tend to underestimate Steve Carell on the big screen probably because of titles like ""Dinner with Schmucks"", ""Evan Almighty"", and of course, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", but when given the opportunity as he did in 2007's ""Dan in Real Life"" and as he does in this grown-up 2011 comedy, he can provide unexpected dimension to an otherwise put-upon, sad-sack character. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.<br/><br/>The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.<br/><br/>Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's ""It"" girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check. This is one of the better comedies released this year."
"tappingjeff","8","1","2","11 August 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, Love: Review
","Like a breath of fresh air, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE rises above the heap of lifeless, senseless romantic comedies, and presents us with something more. What the directors mainly focus on iswait for it: love. But not just love, but adolescent infatuation love, teenage infatuation love, guilty love, regretful love, real love, fake love, all of these different types of relationships and feelings, that are not simply displayed, as in most other entries into this genre, but truly felt, and that's where the movie gains a heart that not only makes it fairly believable, but makes it alive and more than shallow. Above all, it focuses on two very specific thoughts on love: the one of the one true love (cliche at best) and then the sexual love. And the strength of the film is when the characters (who do in fact have feelings that are adequately portrayed) gain clarity on the difference. It's not the most sensitive or poetic way that the message has been portrayed in the past, but the movie never tries to be an art film, just a smart, character driven comedy. We get a series of different situations, which at first seemed too fragmented to make an impact. On that matter, I still believe the film suffers from not letting us spend enough time with, say, Emma Stone's relationship with Ryan Gosling, and though I don't believe it tries to cram in too many plot points, I do think that the balance is slightly off. Not enough, of course, to jeopardize any enjoyment of what's going on. All of these fragments pay off in the third act of the movie, when they come together in a way that might have seemed predictable, but actually made for some great character moments and hilarious scenes. It is this fact that the directors and screenwriter Dan Fogelman can take the clichés of the genre and use them to advance the emotional storytelling that's taking place. This doesn't work all the time: an almost cringe worthy moment happens towards the end of the film that strays into an area far beneath its smart writing and wonderful performances. Speaking of the cast, they were incredibly assembled and are what makes this film what it is. Steve Carrell's best performance, slick work from Ryan Gosling, another example of Emma Stone's throning as Queen Bee of Hollywood, and, most importantly, the always sublime Julianne Moore, who starts off this comedy with heartbreaking sequences featuring Carrell that make this more than just a feature for laughs. The best romantic comedy since 2009's 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, this film presents the very nature of it's main subject. Love IS crazy, love IS stupid, and we love it. A-"
"jewishboy98","8","1","2","10 August 2011"," One of the best of the genre
","This is not an all time great in the overall category but for the ROM-com genre it really is one of the best. The difficulty with making a good ROM-com is that it is difficult to stray away form the formulaic, and this is not exactly a new type of ROM-com. This film combines a mixture of a quick and witty script, fantastic performances and a story that is actually engrossing. Cal (Steve Carell) is stumped when his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce seemingly out of the blue. He goes through stages of depression until he is approached in a bar by Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a serial womaniser who takes pity on Cal and offers to spruce him up and bring back the confidence and manliness that Cal has lost over the years. This is a cliché but I really don't want to say anymore as you need to watch it basically blind (and the trailer in my opinion gave too much away). I rarely laugh out loud while watching a film and it does take quite a lot to make me laugh but I found this film absolutely hilarious and at the same time very heartfelt. This has to be accredited to, as previously mentioned, the script and acting. Steve Carell was perfect. He steered away from his typical ""Steve Carell"" type character in this role a lot more than usual and possessed streaks of brilliance. Julianne Moore was very good as expected. Ever since ""A Single Man"" the actress has been on fire. But what can you say about Ryan Gosling? He is a incredible talent who is getting bigger and bigger every year. His presence was felt throughout the film and he put in the kind of performance when you missed him when he wasn't on. Emma Stone did very well but her part was sadly too small. The youngest member of the cast put in a really memorable performance portraying first love which was both nostalgic and very funny. Seriously watch this."
"dresslercourtney","7","1","2","6 August 2011"," Romantic Comedy with a Crazy Twist
","**No Worries, No Spoilers** Crazy, Stupid, Love is a perfect title for this movie! It's all about love obviously, and how it can vary between gender and ages. In the beginning, I thought it was funny, but was kind of wondering where it was going. Well, if you go to watch it, don't worry about it, because the end shows all the connections in a hilarious way. It has to be one of the best endings to a movie that I've seen in a while. Steve Carell is a great actor and shows his softer, sad side, but does it in a quirky, funny way. Ryan Gosling also plays his character to perfection! It's a fun, light-hearted movie, with an outstanding cast. I would and have recommended it to friends! Worth your money just for the ending and to see Ryan Gosling with out a shirt!"
"bjones","Null","1","2","8 August 2011"," Very entertaining ... eventually
","This film is a little offbeat as comedies go. It starts on a somber tone and then tries to build something humorous as it meanders along. There are some places where the pace slows to a slow walk and it can almost lose it's interest for fans of the faster pace of a lot of modern film. But I found that I liked that quirkiness and it added some depth that may have otherwise been lacking in the typical comedy. However, I feel it may be too much of a pendulum for some as it swings from serious to comedic. I've noticed that a lot of time, people looking for a comedy can do without the seriousness. But given those mood swings, the directors do manage to make it a comedy, after all.<br/><br/>When it comes to comedy the cast here is very entertaining. The central characters are Steve Carell as Cal and Julianne Moore as his dissatisfied wife Emily. She announces that she wants a divorce after a tumble in bed with Kevin Bacon as her boss David. Bacon's character clearly has a solid thing for Moore's character and commences to pursue her, but this angle is just a diversion. The film makers missed chances for funny things that might have supplanted the more serious ones by neglecting to capitalize on this pairing more.<br/><br/>A good deal of the movie revolves around a friendship that builds between Carell's character and Ryan Gosling as the smarmy, girl-crazy Jacob. That term is often followed by the descriptor ""hound"". After meeting in a bar, Gosling takes on Carell to fashion him over into his own image. That's when the more fun aspects of the film start as we watch Carell try to crawl out of his shy, suburbanite shell to become more appealing to the opposite sex.<br/><br/>One encounter Carell makes is with the stunningly talented Marisa Tomei as Kate; a school teacher. When she's on screen she's a huge lot of fun to watch. I don't think I've ever seen her give as much as a mediocre performance and she won't disappoint here.<br/><br/>Another pairing that may surprise some people, but not me, are the encounters between Gosling's character and Emma Stone playing Hannah. Gosling has turned into one of moviedom's more superior actors; who can be expected to always deliver a stellar performance. But the real treat here is Stone. She has become a superb comedienne with a timing and delivery that is as close to perfect as you can get. In fact, Gosling is really playing a straight man here to Stone, ala Abbott and Costello; it's that good.<br/><br/>But the one who really illuminates the screen is Emma Stone. Each time I see Stone in a film she is better than the last time and she is nothing less than enchanting. She always comes across as smart and funny. I am especially drawn to the smartness. It is amazingly refreshing to see a female character who actually has brains, beauty and a lot of good old fashioned humor. It's not that ""brainy"" parts aren't written for other actresses; it's just that the others almost never quite pull it off (with a few notable exceptions such as Gwyneth Paltrow in Proof, but that was decidedly unfunny). Emma Stone is a real treat to watch and I find I can't take my eyes off of her every time that she's on screen. Her very large, luminous eyes run a thousand expressions a second over an even more expressive face, all of them unerringly faithful to the character while, at the same time, feeling very fresh and original. To top it off, she's a stunning beauty herself in that slightly unusual way that normally makes girls off of the street into supermodels. Stone and Gosling are so good, so entertaining, that I could effortlessly watch an entire film, perhaps several entire films, of just them bouncing one-liners and smoking sexuality off of each other. I found myself actually disappointed when the spotlight left them.<br/><br/>But the film doesn't end with just those fine actors, either. There are some surprising, disarming skirmishes between Jonah Bobo as Carell's thirteen-year-old son Robbie Weaver and Analeigh Tipton as his seventeen-year-old babysitter Jessica who, herself, has a thing for Carell. Young Bobo gives a surprisingly good performance as a love-and-thunder-struck young man struggling with some very real, grownup emotions. The height disparity between them made it more enjoyable as we watched and even rooted for Bobo to succeed. I also enjoyed Tipton (could lips be any more sensual), who's face I last saw as a model; but she's a model who can apparently act. She had a hard part to play, straddling a fine line between funny and what could have easily been seen as tragic or even perverse. I hope she feels good about the job she did here and I hope to see more of her in the future.<br/><br/>Finally, the very fine actor John Carroll Lynch as Tipton's father Bernie did a fine job with a small part and certainly injected comedy when he was given the chance.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was expertly staged and photographed so it's top quality there. I also enjoyed the musical score, skillfully blending old favorites into the story in a way more noticeable than usual.<br/><br/>All-in-all, Crazy, Stupid, Love teeters on the brink of sappiness without quite going too far that way and does a good job of appealing to the usual sentimental themes of love stories throughout the ages with some unexpected, modern twists. If you've ever been in love, see it. If you ever want to be in love, see it. Or, if you just like love stories, see it. It makes for a very good night at the movies. Thank you one and all.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

The target audience for this movie appears to be 12 year old girls or any males who are very feminine. The whole movie is just a repeat of other boy/girl love stories with a faint attempt at, what the writer must have thought, was humor. The quality of the acting is right up there with middle school thespian attempts. The music and cinematography is also at a level that would appeal to young teenage girls. Honestly I don't know how any of the adults in this film can stand to look at themselves in the mirror without being embarrassed after performing in this film.

","I had higher expectations of this movie based on the actors involved. The first part is not that bad, but it goes downhill after Steve Carell's character stops playing the miserable and cheated on husband and becomes a womanizer. This movie offers an extremely moronic view of human relationships, since Gosling's character eventually decides to stop chasing skirts after he meets Mrs. right of course and Julianne Moore's character all of a sudden wants her husband back after cheating on him (the reason for this is never spelled out, the same with why she felt the need to have sex with another guy in the first place). The icing on the cake of stupidity is the relationship between the son of the family and the nanny, that concludes with the latter offering some photos of her posing naked to the former as a means of compensating (???) for the fact that he is still very young and she is not into him. In a nutshell this movie manages to offer some of the silliest romantic clichés about adult relationships, while it piles up on the creepy factor about the teenage ones. Not a mean feat by any means!!"

I didn't really laugh, only a light giggle once or twice. It says that this movie is a comedy/romance and drama and it fails in at least two of the genre's as a minimum, I'll let you guess which ones. Steve Carell stars as a middle aged man whose wife, Emily (Julianne Moore) asks him for a divorce. He then goes to a bar and complains about his problems, enter Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a ladies man who acts as a fixer of sorts. The three main actors try their best not to overact but end up just doing it a little bit and I would normally say if an actor is underused, Emma Stone is as the film would have benefited from just a little bit more of her but in this case, Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei were a waste of space as the film could have done without them, Bacon looked way out of place and Tomei hammed it up just a bit too much for my liking. And let's not even get started on the plot which seemed so contrived.

Going to a bar, he learns to pick up girls from Ryan Gosling, who sheds his usual tough-guy image in films and turns in a gem of a funny performance.<br/><br/>It just becomes a story of coincidental love with the inappropriate people, such as your son's 8th grade English teacher-Marisa Tomei and Gosling unknowingly falling for Carell's 17 year old daughter.<br/><br/>Everything seems to come to a favorable conclusion at Carell's son's graduation.

","Great cast, but so many things borrowed from other films. Steve Carrell might as well be the 40-year old Virgin again, because he's pretty much just reprised his old role, only instead of having 2 friends tutoring him about how to pick up women - he has Ryan Gosling. Speaking of whom, either he is wasted on his role here, or the other way round. Either way it doesn't work. Good looking guy, but about as funny as a wall. <br/><br/>Another borrowed item from the past - the Dirty Dancing lift-the-girl- into-the-air dance scene. The fact that it's blatantly obvious that this scene was completely unnecessary for the movie, it becomes even more obvious that it was only stuck in to hopefully get some of the magic from that iconic scene to somehow rub off into this movie. Desperate attempt, and very unoriginal.<br/><br/>The scene where Ryan Gosling is standing naked in front of Steve Carrell in the gym. I urge you to watch Simon Pegg's ""Run Fat Boy Run""from a few years ago. In it you will see the IDENTICAL scene between Simon Pegg and Hank Azaria. Daylight robbery, once again.<br/><br/>The plot itself is preposterous. Everything from how they built up Ryan Gosling to be this single, lothario, pick-up artist who somehow makes Steve Carrell his best friend - just because he saw him a few nights in a bar whinging about his cheating wife. And the climax where they all realise what's actually going on, is actually the most ridiculous scene of all. It's almost as if the writer and director thought of that scene first, and then thought ""Okay, now let's go backwards and write a story from that "". It's the equivalent of someone thinking of the punchline first, and then coming up with the joke. Never works.<br/><br/>2 hrs of my life wasted. Well, 1 hr and 40 mins anyway.

The actors seem to do the best they can with what they have to work with or with the characters they are representing. I didn't agree with some of the actor/actress playing some of the characters. Some just didn't seem to fit the role of the characters. But still OK. This could be one of the top 5 funny movies, IF the edges were sharpened some..."

","Unlike many romantic comedies, Crazy Stupid Love manages to leave audiences satisfied with a smile.<br/><br/>Another predictable comedy with few laughs due to cheesy lines and little relation to the characters is not what we need and thankfully not what you should expect. One of the main aspects that makes this film so watchable is the acting. All the actors play their parts convincingly and with the right comic uniqueness their character requires. Julianne Moore, not exactly queen of comedy, delivers her lines with perfect comic timing as do those more familiar to comedy such as Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell. Jonah Bobo playing Robbie and model Analeigh Tipton as Jessica also play their parts so hilariously together as young teen crushing on the innocent babysitter. It is clear characters have been perfectly sketched to make them so diverse in contrast to each other for not just successful comic effect, but also for the audience to relate to the characters which is done with great ease. Another thing that makes this film so much better than most typical comedies is how unpredictable it was. Throughout the film realistic surprises you would never of expected pop up which is both shocking and comical- its comically shocking. Those who have not seen the film, I would recommend not to watch any clips that have been released, but should wait for the film to grasp the full comedy the film offers there and then. Overall, without giving any of the plot away this slick smart comedy is a must see, not just for the all star cast but for the perfect contrasting characters, comic timing, hilarious script and crucially, the different and unpredictable plot that makes this film so hilarious. Without a doubt, a must see."

I might actually go watch it again. The story was heartfelt, moving, entertaining and very well directed and acted. Initially I thought I would be bored by the whole stranger-gives-sad-sap-a-makeover-to-make- him-cool bit but it was done in a very refreshing way. I thought the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell was terrific and they should honestly do another film together. <br/><br/>Emma Stone's scenes with Ryan Gosling were very romantic when I least expected them to be.

","I do my best to support my neighborhood, single-screen movie theaters, theaters such as the Vogue: they charge reduced admission for mid-week screenings, they don't run commercials, and they usually only make you sit through a couple of coming attractions. So when I saw the cast for this movie, I figured ""what the heck, why not?"". I suppose maybe I need to see more movies; this one seemed curiously under-baked to me. As I waited for the laughs to start, I found myself pondering random thoughts: cinematically, are noses as incompatible as Julianne Moore's as Steve Carrell's indicative of doomed relationships?; is there only the one bar in all of Los Angeles?; would the Giants line-up work better with Orlando Cabrera batting lead-off?; and is there a chance of my actually picking up Prince Fielder on a waiver claim in my fantasy baseball league? It's that kind of movie; the pace is somewhat leisurely. There are subtle rewards: the high school girl saying ""my lips are *seal clapping*"", which provided the only laugh for me (and made me want to listen to the Go-Go's), and seeing John Carroll Lynch (who I always think of as Norm Son-of-a Gunderson) in a movie is always rewarding. But for the most part, I fear that I'll remember this movie as a squandering of some very estimable acting talent; it's the only movie I can think of that has ever made Marisa Tomei seem ridiculous."

"Turfseer","4","1","4","24 December 2011"," Occasionally amusing tale of bad boy mentor devolves into sentimental romance
","'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is billed as a romantic comedy but ends up much more as a sentimental romance. The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.<br/><br/>After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?<br/><br/>'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.<br/><br/>While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.<br/><br/>Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film—and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.<br/><br/>'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending. Try this once but see it a second time at your own peril!"

"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","5","5 March 2017"," Some terrible moments destroy an occasionally really solid mix of comedy and drama
","""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is an American movie from 2011, so it had its 5th anniversary last year. It runs for almost two hours and was directed by Ficarra/Requa, who have collaborated on quite a few projects in the last two decades. The writer is Dan Fogelman and he was mostly busy with animated films before this one here, but it may be his most famous work now. One reason for that is the cast that includes so many known names, three Oscar winners even. I will not say the names as you can check the list for yourself, but what makes this one interesting in 2017 is that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone from ""La La Land"" play a couple in here as well. The core subject in this 120-minute movie is love and the complicated ways into and out of it. Divorce is involved, unrequited love, parental love, love that isn't really love because it's all about sex etc. So you could think that this is a decent movie to watch with your significant other. Yes and no I would say. It is without a doubt entertaining to watch from start to finish and it is easy to care for what happens next to the characters. Also the film does not take paths in terms of the unrequited love segments I mentioned earlier that would have felt unrealistic.<br/><br/>But all it does right there, it does wrong on other occasions. For me a good comedy/drama always has to fulfill at least a basic component of realism (unless it is a fantasy film, I guess) and there were 4-5 moments when this one doesn't and the people who made this sacrificed realism for entertaining/crucial plot twists. The worst example is probably when we find out about the parents of Stone's character. Another example would be Carell's character's final speech at the school that feels really as if it takes itself way too seriously and it hurt the film. What is also crucial is how important these moments were for the movie itself and that's why it was even more devastating to see how things really went wrong there. Another example would be when the teenage girl finds the younger boy's comments at the end actually flattering after being annoyed by them throughout the entire film or when he starts talking in front of the entire school about his masturbation techniques. It is American Pie level (I mean that in a bad way) there and these moments really destroyed all the good from other scenes. It's such a shame how it turned out eventually and I cannot give this film a thumbs-up because the lowest lows are really much more significant than the highest highs (if there were any at all). Also Ryan Gosling was definitely not deserving of a Golden Globe nomination here. He is forgettable in the first half of the film and mediocre in the second. Also he is clearly supporting. Overall, a thumbs-down from me. Pretty overrated film that does not deserve to be half as popular as it actually is."

","Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic Circumstances<br/><br/>Three love stories nay, situations, are explored in Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") ""Crazy, Stupid Love"". It is a drama masked as a comedy fueled by awkwardly realistic circumstances and a handful of highflying actors and actresses that know how to own it. The first story concerns a couple of high school sweethearts, Cal (Steve Carell, ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore, ""The Kids Are All Right""),that have been married for twenty-five years. However, when Emily tells Cal that slept with a man she works with named David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon, ""X-Men: First Class""), divorce is on the horizon. Inevitably sending Cal to the bar, Cal meets the player in the second love story, Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling, ""Blue Valentince""), who is infamous for his lady-wooing swagger. Jacob sees and hears Cal ranting about his failing marriage and takes him under his wing to help him move on with other women. Even so, Cal may not be the only one changed by their abnormal friendship because of Jacob's hang up on a girl named Hannah (Emma Stone, ""Easy A"") he was rejected by the previous night. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's thirteen-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo, ""Zathura""), is in love with his babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton, ""The Green Hornet"") who in turn is in love with Cal. Everything is more connected than you may think and with a flamboyantly annoying performance by Marisa Tomei (""The Wrestler"") things get crazy and stupid in this multigenerational love story.<br/><br/>The Good: Steve Carell's Post-""Office"" years could not of had a stronger start as he conjures the second best performance of his career. However, it would be unfair to say that he is the only reason the film succeeds because of the superb performances of his costars Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Together the cast will keep you on edge as the story unravels in an obstinately realistic manner. And while Scriptwriter Dan Fogelman's (""Bolt"") plan was not visible at first by the end his twisty-turny storytelling culminates in grade A fashion with the unification of the three love stories into one full of smart comedy<br/><br/>After the aforementioned culmination of plot unification, the film loses its momentum. dragging on for twenty minutes. The film could have ended anytime during its climatic scene and it would have been perfect (I guess you can't always get what you want). It takes twenty extra minutes to get to the actual sloppy and impractical conclusion. Even though everything seemed to be previously settled, this second fallout to set up a preachy ending creates unnecessary forced conflict. Lastly, the inability to avoid predictivity may irk some viewers and makes characters like Josh Groban's as pointless as their casting.<br/><br/>The first act of ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" creates a series of situations that setup a remarkable amalgamation at the peak of its second act, making the stars in the film (most notably Steve Carell) into even bigger stars with the power of sharp comedy."
"nnumber9","4","1","6","3 November 2012"," Dumb teen flick in disguise
","This film is now floating around HBO and my 13-year-old son continues to tune in. Each time I overhear it, I am reminded how disappointing it is. We ran to theaters when it came out based on good reviews and admirable cast. When this happens it make a film like this even more hateful.<br/><br/>The thing that bothers me most is it leads teens and young adults to believe that casual sex, as it appears in this movie, as totally acceptable and the norm. That young women are desperate and go like lambs to the slaughter with anyone who buys them a drink. Also that pick up bars are filled with glossy, expensively dressed women and that everyone can afford an endless supply of $12 cocktails.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell gets tossed out by his unfaithful wife (Juliane Moore, really?, shame on you) and is set up in a new separate life and apartment in a day. Anyone who has been through divorce or separation knows that, logistically alone, it is 100 times more complicated and difficult.<br/><br/>Most infuriating in it's male cluelessness (spoiler) is the twist that they are the ingenue's (Emma Stone) parents. Couples who marry at 17 to raise a child do not come out as college graduates with high-paying jobs and lovely homes. If they do, that fact should be the remarkable center of the story, not a taken for granted plot point. And the daughter completed law school too! <br/><br/>As a high school teacher and a mom, this is sending a message to kids that you can make mistakes like high school pregnancy and you can get rewarded for it. It hardly ever works out this way, and the economic strain of young people managing these stresses would have killed the marriage way sooner anyway.<br/><br/>I guess it was not the filmmakers job to educate and protect youth but do they really want to look so dumb and uncool to people who appreciate intelligent movie and film making?<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a 4 was for the love scene between Gosling and Stone which was great in and of itself. (Except the lift was obviously using a double--no disrespect to Stone personally)<br/><br/>Also, love Gosling as a fashion model. P.S. Miss you Michael Scott. I hope you didn't leave us to continue making bad movies."

","I saw a movie that was completely unbelievable. And the unbelievability not only kept me from caring about all these characters, but I found I started to really dislike them.<br/><br/>This is a movie about love. 95% of the movie doesn't show us why these characters fall in love--the one exception is the two minutes when ryan gosling and emma stone's characters finally socialize. Otherwise, for a movie that revolves around how we love others, we are never shown why. At least tell us why, which would be bad filmmaking, but at least it's something. But from the onset of the movie we know certain characters love other certain characters, only because they tell us that they do. Never do we know why. There's no meat added to the bones. In the movie, love is a defined thing. Not as ambiguous as it is in real life. But although it's a singular defined thing, they never define it! Secondly, these characters have no motivation to do any of the things they do. Or let me rephrase: the motivation that's offered is shotty, unbelievable. Why is ryan gosling helping steve carrell? I don't get it. Why does Steve carrell change the person that he's been for 40+ years? I don't buy it. Why does Marissa Tomei become attracted to Steve Carell, because the plot needs her to. Why does Emma Stone walk into a bar and kiss a guy who just happens to be there after a 3 minute conversation she had with him over 1 week ago? And why does she grow to hate her boyfriend? Why does the son build this huge thing, somehow lug it to a high school, cut school himself, and stand up in front of kids much older than him to profess his love? Why does the seventeen year old love an older man? To be clear, motivation is offered for most of these scenarios, but it's unbelievable. And in some cases no motivation is offered. That's bad writing. Not even in a ""it's so bad it's fun"" kinda way. It's just bad. And it makes the movie totally uninteresting.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell attempts to save this mess with a few punchlines that do push out a chuckle and there's a funny little farce at the end of the movie (also with half-assed motivation, but you'll give it a pass). But in the hands of creatives with something interesting to say and who don't have the pressure of a major Hollywood studio backing the film, this movie could have been very good."

","I am always in favor of a good comedic family drama and thought that this one looked as good as any. I was also interested in this story because it struck an accord with someone such as I, who has been married for more than two decades, and begs the question where can it go wrong? Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) has reached a comfortable complacent point in his life when he is then blindsided by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore), as seen in the trailer, with her declaration of wanting a divorce and her confession of a transgression. I have seen Despicable Me so many times now with my grandson Three, that when I see Steve Carell all I can think about is Gru, yes sad but true. I digress. The situation with Cal and Emily leads to Cal spending a lot of time in a bar where he then meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gossling) a slick womanizing pretty boy. I was not convinced by the whole premise that led to Jacob and Cal bonding, but decided not to give it too much thought. But the fact of the matter is that if Jacob were as self absorbed as he was shown to be he would not have given Cal two minutes of thought, let alone try to help him deal with his circumstances. The most endearing character throughout this whole movie was Robbie (Jonah Bobo). I loved his determination and his honesty regarding how he felt about Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), it was so adorable. And he was right about the four year age difference in a few years it would make no difference at all. I found myself after sitting through approximately forty minutes of this film, slumped down in my seat, yawning while I wondered where it was headed and then started to think about the Whodini song, When We Gonna Get To The Good Part, Get Down To The Good Part. And finally we did get to the good part, when all the outlandishness and asinine behavior brought everything together. And to be perfectly honest I did not see it coming. I sat up took interest once more and thought that the film had taken a very clever turn. I liked the bottom half of the film, but I felt as if the top half was overindulged. I give this film an amber light for taking so long to get to the good part."

When Ryan Gosling struggled in both Half Nelson and Blue Valentine, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a movie. With those two statements being said, I really wanted a light romantic comedy, I was tired of all the sadness. I am glad to report I actually did not get that, at least not out of Steve Carrell's plot. I could have never imagined this film working as a drama..but now I could never imagine it working as a comedy. While Gosling is charming and does create a good amount of laughs in the film, the main focus is on Carrell's character, who's just a sad sack character. That being said, I loved not only Cal (Carrell's character), but I also loved Carrell himself in the film. Now that James Spader is joining The Office, and now that Carrell is throwing himself into a dramatic role, and doing a very good job at it, I could see myself really not missing Michael Scott much at all. Also, there are a lot of attractive women in this film, such as Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, and Marisa Tomei. They all have really good plots as well, especially Marisa Tomei. Kevin Bacon is also quite funny as Moore's co-worker/new boyfriend. To end my review, I must mention Robbie (Jonah Bobo) falling in love with Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), which I may have even liked more than Gosling or Carrell's plot. It's such a sweet plot, and Tipton and Bobo are rising young stars. Overall, don't go into Crazy Stupid Love expecting Carrell's next Date Night or Gosling's next Blue Valentine, go in expecting something in between those two. If you wish for either of those two and not the other, you're going to be disappointed, otherwise, just like me, you'll love it."

One can buy the initial premise, of a boring and predictable office worker (Carell), taken in hand by a predatory Romeo (Gosling) and turned into a a playboy after Carell's wife (Moore) asks for a divorce. Alas, alas, this movie has so many subplots and unnecessary complications one gets the feeling that a bunch of scenes from other movies were simply dropped into a Cuisinart and taken for a spin. Nothing seems to hang together. The eminently watchable Emma Stone appears to be performing in another movie for all the relatability her character has to the main plot. One sits there baffled as to why she is in this movie (although having said that, she is an absolute delight to watch -- and the reason this viewer went to see this flick!) Admitted, there is a final payoff for her character -- totally unbelievable -- but the interminable journey to get there is exasperating. As is another subplot between Carrell's underage son and his baby sitter that leaves one longing to fast forward every time either character shows up. The acting talent on display here is wonderful but oh, what a waste in a godawful script. (And did I mention Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei?

Examples of this all only in the first introductory 20 min: Cal's son Robbie keeps on pushing to get Jessica to love him back when she has told him clearly and directly that she isn't interested in him and is even uncomfortable with him continuing. The same thing happening with Jacob and Hanna. And on the other side you have Jessica crushing on Cal, who doesn't acknowledge her advances as inappropriate at all. Then you have Jacob who is just a copy of Barney Stinson and Charly Sheen, culminating in teaching Cal sexist ways of thinking of women. Not no mention the lack of communication between Cal and his soon to be ex-wife Emily, where does the divorce come from? Why is Cal just accepting to leave his wife from one day to the next without barely acknowledging it?<br/><br/>I tried to go through with the movie by thinking about those highly incoherent decisions as plot-tools to arrive at the improbable situations that make up interesting stories, but scene after scene the movie wasn't improving.

What's more, without a doubt, I was gotten off guard.<br/><br/>One reason for this, is on the grounds that ""Insane Stupid Love"" fills in as a lighthearted comedy and a dramatization. Most lighthearted comedies, I find, are unsurprising, stale, and basically one duplicate after another, of the equivalent careful story, happened in a somewhat changed way. You presumably won't think about where ""Insane Stupid Love"" is going. While the consummation itself is a ton like I anticipated it, there's a major unexpected development that introduces itself in the peak that I truly didn't see coming. Also, that is reason enough to see this film.<br/><br/>In any case, there are some (better) reasons. One of the main reasons is that it abstains from making any of its characters exaggerations. Each character is genuine, and imperfect, messed up and manages their issues in a very grounded and adult way.<br/><br/>It spins around Cal (Carell), a man who has been hitched to Emily (Moore) for a long time, and is shaken by the disclosure that she needs a separation, in the wake of laying down with an associate (Kevin Bacon). Cal starts hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes an alternate lady home each night. He gets on Cal's downturn, and causes him transform into something of a womanizer. In the interim, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old child Robbie really likes his more established sitter, who has her very own little pulverize. Additionally, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a youthful legal advisor who has heard each pickup line, and along these lines, has a very fatigued attitude toward affection.<br/><br/>Also, it is the principal film or TV show to depict Steve Carrell as a person. He can act! Who knew? I really enjoyed him in this job, since I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that person from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", however a normal person whose life didn't turn out as he had trusted. I got him in this job. He more than stays aware of the remainder of the film's heavenly cast.<br/><br/>Another disclosure here is Ryan Gosling. I've for the most part observed him in discouraging emotional jobs (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he demonstrates himself to be a finesse comic. He has fantastic comedic timing, and unmistakably has a ton of fun here with different entertainers. He is by all accounts the shallow funnyman from the start, and, similar to the remainder of the cast in this staggering film, opens up, and astounds the crowd.<br/><br/>While Julianne Moore is constantly extraordinary, her character and Carrell's character work such that causes you to accept that their marriage endured 20+ years. Emma Stone is ablaze at this moment, doing an extraordinary job in ""The Help"", she sparkles the same amount of here, if not more. Her character is in a flash adorable, and I can hardly wait to perceive what she does straightaway.<br/><br/>This film additionally includes Marisa Tomei, who gives a furious, and interesting execution as a recouping alcoholic teacher who dates Cal for a little while after his separation. Kevin Bacon additionally made me snicker, as Emily's associate, who was her post-separate from bounce back. While these two have brief jobs, they are extremely entertaining and capitalize on what they are given.<br/><br/>What makes this film noteworthy for me, is that it is reasonable. It doesn't paint love out to be this enchanted thing that will naturally fulfill anybody. It realizes that adoration doesn't generally work out, and every so often finishes in deplorability as well as savagery. And keeping in mind that it's to some degree wake up call, it closes ideally and generally speaking, sort of cheerfully. It made me cry a bit, and it made me giggle a great deal. And keeping in mind that it could have been somewhat more, and given its characters some more space to develop, it was a delightful by and large bundle that I would prescribe to somebody who's attempting to get away from the late spring of superhuman flicks and continuations."

","There are few romantic comedies released in the past twenty years that I would watch multiples times, but this is one.<br/><br/>It starts with a couple headed for divorce, but there is no bitterness or name calling. This is a good-natured film filled with likable characters trying to cope with the difference between love's dreams and love's disillusionments.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect for a comedy: Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, and Ryan Gosling, for starters. There is not a lot of mugging for the camera, like you might find in other comedies. And there is a marked absence of humor about bodily functions (which has brought many recent comedies down to the seventh grade level).<br/><br/>The film is punctuated by laughs, touching scenes, and even a few moments that elicit a pleasant mistiness. This can be credited to both the script and the actors. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa deserve credit as well.<br/><br/>Carell plays the disappointed husband who is forced to re-examine his life after many years of marriage. Gosling is a ladies' man who exudes confidence and savoir faire. Stone plays a young woman whose future revolves around her predictable and bland fiancÃ©. In a smaller role, Tomei is a school teacher who frequents bars, desperate for any semblance of authenticity from the men she meets there.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. And the final act feels like a traditional farce, complete with revelations and well-timed interactions."

","Well, this is a romantic comedy, so with that expectations I watched it. The story felt for me pretty original in this kind of movies. Cal (Steve Carell) gets very upset because his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for the divorce and he is later helped by Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to rediscover his manhood so he can feel well again. Jacob also meets a girl called Hannah and falls in love with her. There is also another thread on the story with the babysitter of the sons of Cal and Emily, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who is taking care of Molly and Robbie who falls in love with her, but she loves another person.<br/><br/>Well the story might look a bit full of characters but all of them get a proper screen time, enough for their stories to develop well. Steve Carell has a good chemistry with Julianne Moore and you can care about their marriage and so, and also Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling have very a good brother-friend relationship, but for me the highlights of this movie are all the moments Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone share together on screen, which are worth watching this movie. They have such a great chemistry that they feel like a real-life couple. They are so lovely together that I wish this movie had been only the story of them, because, for me it would have been perfect. The story of Steve Carell helped by Ryan Gosling is also great and funny, but what for me ruins this movie a bit is the part of Jessica and Robbie, not also because it's very unrealistic (a thirteen age boy falls in love with his seventeen year old babysitter, but she is in love with his father and takes herself nude pictures for him? C'mon screenwriters, who had this idea?). This part of the story is not also unrealistic but very odd and a bit useless. And as their plot line, also the characters of this part felt a bit flat and without any charisma. But also, it's a romantic comedy you cannot ask that much for it.<br/><br/>This movie is a very funny romantic comedy with many hilarious moments but also other moments full of emotion and romance. I recommend you the movie if you want to be entertained for about two hours, laughing and smiling without nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>And finally I have to add this: ""Emma Stone is the perfect blend of sexy and adorable"""

","I am a big fan of the rare flower that is the original rom-com. Crazy,Stupid,Love is such a film, and it is remarkably well-rounded with a cast that I would easily follow into much choppier waters than these.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling shines as the man he naturally looks to be, Emma Stone is deliciously mature and naive at the same time. The best scenes in the film play out between these two highly-talented hotties.<br/><br/>The mature pairing with Steve Carrel as the boring guy who's been married too long is a trope I have seen before (by him), and while well executed it is still not enough to rise above the cliché.<br/><br/>The juniors in the film add an edge to the humor that is distinctly uncomfortable at times, and the scene where conflict is to be found (I'm being vague for spoiler reasons) is far too convenient and feels shoehorned in. Especially our main characters seem to step out of what they have been so far in order to push the plot forward. <br/><br/>This is a brilliant film in many senses, yet lags in so many others really have trouble deciding if I like it or not - it is over- stuffed and at a run-time of two hours over-long...perhaps another viewing is merited...oh JOY!"

And while it's busy getting all of that right, it hits you with a twist that's arguably Stupid, but it is so Crazy how the directors hid it in plain sight that, you just have to Love it.<br/><br/>Steve Carell I've always felt, is an actor that possesses many of the qualities I rarely ever admire in an actor, however, every time I see him do what he does, I inexplicably respect him that little bit more.<br/><br/>The plot is mainly around a couple named the Weavers, and fittingly, the subplots are so nicely woven in, that the final spouts' explosion came together almost like soulmates.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. Gosling's opening scene at the mall is so smooth, you can't wait to see what he's going to do for Cal's transformation. Carell is fun to watch throughout, and he doesn't drop the ball. Moore, Emma and Marisa are also a wonderful addition, to a script that does a really sterling job at mixing laughter, sadness, and drama, with a subtle, but nicely expressed sense of humility.<br/><br/>This movie was crazy, a little stupid, and about love; and it did it all without being too excessive, and pretty well grounded."

"ReelBrew","8","0","1","12 December 2015"," After getting a divorce, one man must navigate the single scene with the unexpected help from a bachelor.
","Love is many things; it's encompassing, beautiful, painful, and ever changing. When it first begins to build inside us, we tend to stand on the shoulders of giants, embracing the world as this wonderful and tiny organism. After a while that love changes; sometimes for the better, other times for the worse. When it does take a nosedive, we often shun it all together. Crazy, Stupid, Love shows us that no matter how unexplainable or heart wrenching love can be, it will always be within our reach to hold and cherish when we need it the most. Love can come from many angles, and that's where the sincerity in not only the pieced together title comes from, but where the plethora of characters really shine. Showing the relationships between unlikely friends, a boy and his babysitter, a womanizer and a romantic, Crazy, Stupid, Love paints a ray of colors over a simple palette, providing that sophisticated touch to a well-worn genre.<br/><br/>Telling the story of multiple characters that interweave throughout the film, Crazy, Stupid, Love focuses on Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell), a married man that suddenly finds himself cast out into the single- peoples social sphere, ultimately out-dressed and out-numbered by the young and the restless. Holding up in a bar catering to those twenty years younger, Cal finds himself taken under the tailored wing of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), an inheritance rich womanizer that has just about every woman stumbling under his well-crafted and meticulous spell. As Cal begins straying away from but never forgetting his soul-mate Emily (Julianne Moore), we are shown loves game from the eyes of Cal's optimistic son Robbie (Jonah Bobo), and confused romantic Hannah (Emma Stone). As Cal tries to hold onto what he refused to fight for, Jacob begins to realize that there is something worth fighting for, something that will prove just how crazy love can be.<br/><br/>Coming off the heels of 2009's quirky prison-love tale I Love You, Philip Morris, screen writing/directing duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa know how to handle the multiple facets that come from budding romances. The way they handle love is akin to lighting a bunch of sleazy romance novels on fire atop the roof of a fine adult book store, sending smoke signals to those worn and withered romantics out there. Just like Francois Truffaut's epic love-triangle Jules and Jim, Crazy, Stupid, Love works best as a meditation on the hetero-fueled relationship between its male focal points Cal and Jacob. As we see each one in their individual state, it only adds to the bond they develop later on, providing that true essence of masculine friendship. Though not quite capturing the crazy side of love, Ficarra and Requa manage to add just enough charm and wit to their characters for us to feel attached to, showing just how powerful any relationship can be.<br/><br/>Bringing all of these characters to life is an ensemble cast that feels surprisingly fresh considering they have all been in these roles before. It doesn't feel too long ago that we saw Steve Carrell as the down on his luck forty-year old, Julianne Moore as the confused and cheating wife, Emma Stone as the desirable take-charge woman, or Kevin Bacon as well, the villain. These are all actors that have been through the motions their characters go through multiple times, though it all feels so pure like a new love. Taking a prominent position amongst the A-listers is Jonah Bobo as Cal's son Robbie, and Analeigh Tipton as Jessica the babysitter who both bring a raw emotion to the screen that feels as if we're watching our self fall in love all over again for the first time.<br/><br/>Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those films that shouldn't work as well as it does, but succeeds in almost every regard. While the title falls a bit short in showing us just how crazy and stupid love can truly be, it does provide a beautiful take on love gone bad and love that has yet to even start. Dan Fogelman's script injects the romantic comedy genre with a vibrancy that hasn't been seen for years, causing us to embrace our youthful woe with nostalgic fondness all the while embracing what we have. Rarely do we get to revel in the marital misfortune of others with such gleeful wit than with this rare treat, ranking high amongst modern romances."
"oliverwilliamknight","6","0","1","7 December 2015"," Atypical
","Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling AND Emma Stone all in one movie together?! First and foremost this movie has a fantastic cast. Ryan Gosling plays womaniser 'Jacob Palmer' who lives a lavish lifestyle picking up girls at bars night after night, and one night in particular he meets Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) who has just found out his wife has cheated on him. Long story short, Jacob teaches Cal almost how to be a true man if he wants any chance at getting his wife back. After sleeping with several women, whilst also being on the fence with rekindling his love with his wife, Cal and Jacob form a light sort of 'bromance'. One issue I have with this movie is that some parts of the plot are all kinds of messed up. I mean, a 17 year old girl giving a 13 year old boy nude pictures of herself?! The first half of the narrative seems very slow and almost depressing but of course, being a romantic comedy, the movie has an almost 'uplifting' and happy-ever-after ending. Nevertheless, this movie is hands down entertaining and really sets itself apart from your traditional rom-com. Worth a watch."

No, I'm not talking about a trip to the toilet. No, I'm talking about love. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore play a married couple of many years but on this evening she desires a divorce. She has had an affair so he moves into an apartment. Unknown to them both, their son is infatuated with the babysitter. Ryan Gosling plays a young playboy who witnesses Carell's drunken rants and decides to help him change his life. This is all done with wit and observation by directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who touch down on situations that are common. Carell is taken from despair to repair as his new dating life takes an unexpected hilarious turn when arriving at a parent teachers meeting. He will eventually have to man up and represent the father he always wanted to be. Moore's role is more predictable but her confusion with regards to a relationship with a co-worker works best during her son's visit. Gosling goes from teaching Carell to meeting a woman who takes his expectations to blunt face value. Analeigh Tipton plays a babysitter who actually has a thing for the Carell character while the kid she babysits crushes on her. Emma Stone steals her scenes as the woman whom Gosling cannot figure out, and who ends up being a big surprise revelation during the over the top climax. This is where things get crazy and stupid until love finally renders victory. Score: 8 / 10"

After the sequence of events leading up to this scene, it feels like the filmmakers could have given us a more offbeat ending that would do justice to the overall tone of the movie. <br/><br/>Apart from a few blemishes, most of the movie is hilarious due to some good acting and intelligent dialog.

I have only bought a handful of movies without seeing them first, and sadly, there has only been one that I really enjoyed and one that I liked. This was the one I liked. It has a good storyline to it and the cast make it a very enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>This movie is about a middle-aged man. His life changes dramatically when his wife, out of nowhere, asks him for a divorce. He tries to rediscover his manhood with the help of a new friend. Jacob, is a guy who is very good with woman. He can pick them up so easily. It helps that it's really Ryan Gosling and he's got really nice abs. Anyway, Jacob tries to help our about-to-be-divorced man, Cal and the results are just hilarious.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Good."

"Gideon24","6","0","1","8 April 2015"," A solid cast but a screenplay all over the place.
","Crazy Stupid Love is a 2011 comedy that has some funny scenes, some clever dialogue, and a charismatic cast, but suffers from a rambling screenplay that tries to encompass a little too much and takes way too long to get where it's finally going.<br/><br/>The film stars Steve Carell as Cal Weaver, a man rocked by the announcement from his wife of 25 years, Emily (Julianne Moore) that she has slept with a co-worker and wants a divorce. From there, the story expands into so many unexpected directions that it becomes a little dizzying to keep track of everything that's going on. It begins when Cal begins getting advice on getting back into the dating scene from a player named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) whose interest in helping Cal doesn't really make any sense.<br/><br/>Jacob eventually gets involved with a woman (Emma Stone) who only shows interest in him after her co-worker/boyfriend (Josh Groban) breaks her heart. The story becomes even more complicated and murky as we finally learn who Stone's character is, but by this time, we really don't care because to be honest, Gosling has more chemistry with Carell than he does with Stone. <br/><br/>The storyline involving Cal's son and his babysitter also walks the fine line between good taste and perversion, despite a superb performance from Jacob Bobo as the boy. But what this film does contain at its heart is a vividly human performance from Steve Carell as Cal, an actor with a lovely Jack Lemmon-ish everyman quality whose mere presence on screen evokes immediate sympathy and the desire to put your arm around him and tell him that everything is going to be all right and he is well-matched by Moore, who brings a calming center to the insanity that is the rest of the proceedings here. The screenplay is well-intentioned but goes horribly off-course, despite an extremely likable cast."
"troyputland","8","0","1","4 April 2015"," More of a man-flick than a chick-flick.
","A formidable cast have come together and provided us with what can only be described as a man's chick flick. It doesn't follow the formula seen so many times before. The main couple's relationship has already hit its peak. It comes crashing down within seconds when Emily (Moore) says to her husband Cal (Carell) that she's slept with someone else and wants a divorce. This is a punch in the gut for every loving couple out there. Crazy, Stupid, Love follows Cal dealing with what's hit him and the relationships that surround him, including his son's love for his babysitter (he's 13, she's 17) and Ryan Gosling, the womaniser he meets at a bar he drowns his sorrows in. Gosling's steers Cal into the world of the single man. Gosling is at the forefront of every scene he's in, up until the point he falls in love. It's lighthearted and fun up until it ups the severity. Smaller parts from Tomei and Bacon add flare to this heartwarming film. Apart from a little straying off, CSL is strong enough to be the best romantic-comedy out there because of its differences and loving characters.<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk"

","The overwhelming experience of this tedious drivel is of having dined out on a meal of caster sugar and saccharine. But what a cast! How to make sense of these first-rate actors - Moore, Carell, Gosling, Tomei and the rest - agreeing to lend their talents to this sort of teeth-grindingly irritating dross? It can't be just for the money.<br/><br/>Did Julianne Moore think it was perhaps another THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT? Did it remind Steve Carell of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE? Please tell me Ryan Gosling didn't consider it on a par with LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. Believe me, this movie, so formulaic it's almost geometric, is not in the same class as those three. The only comparable idiocy I've seen in the past decade that sinks to this level is the Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn vehicle THE BREAK-UP.<br/><br/>OK, OK, enough venom.

"brchthethird","8","0","1","14 November 2014"," Oh, what a tangled web we weave...
","In real life, love can be messy and irrational, but in the end it's still worth fighting for. At its heart, I believe that is the message that this film tries, and mostly succeeds, at conveying. Romantic comedies have never really been my cup of tea, but few have managed to keep me rapt like this one managed to do. This film was filled with lifelike characters told a compelling, relatable story that, while messy and overstuffed at times, still wrangled the many threads and brought them together in an interesting and completely unexpected way.<br/><br/>The story is centered around Cal Weaver (Steve Carell, playing his usual schlubb character), whose wife just asked him for a divorce. Completely blindsided by this development, he descends into self-pity, starts frequenting bars and venting out loud to anyone within earshot. This desperation eventually attracts the attention of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a suave ladies' man who helps Cal recapture his manhood and sense of self. This leads to all sorts of misadventures and awkward situations, but where the story ends up is both expected and unexpected at the same time. Rounding out the cast is Julianne Moore as Cal's wife Emily, Kevin Bacon as the man who Emily cheats on her husband with, John Carroll Lynch as a family friend and Emma Stone as Hannah, an up-and-coming lawyer who gets involved with Jacob. Despite having such a large cast, they do end up spending enough time with each character, although the movie's pacing suffers at times and ends up feeling a little disjointed. They all give great, naturalistic performances, even the younger actors. On a more technical note, the film was well-shot, even though comedies tend not to have distinctive filming styles or cinematography. The eclectic soundtrack is also worth mentioning, even though a few cuts were a little too ""on-the-nose."" <br/><br/>Stepping back a little bit, at first the movie felt like it was trying to accomplish too much. It starts off where a lot of movies start to end, so I thought to myself where it could possibly go from there. The answer is pretty far. It took a rather labored premise and did something fresh with it, and the chemistry and likability of the cast only made things that much better. My feelings might have been mixed towards the beginning, but as the film progressed I only grew to appreciate it more. Sure, it might not quite live up to its title, but it put forth such a great effort that I have to applaud it for that. It's proof that there is some life in the romantic comedy genre yet. I highly encourage you to see this, if only for the pleasure of seeing its incredible cast at work, but hopefully also for the intimate and honest exploration of love and the human condition."

","Crazy, Stupid Love is one very funny romantic comedy that pokes fun at the dating lifestyle and longtime marriages. Sub-plots involving teenage love and jilted lovers create a tangle of funny complications. While the plot is contrived, the entertainment kept me laughing. Julianne Moore, Steve Carrell, and Ryan Gosling delivered in their roles as well as Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who get caught up in the family conflict. Steve Carell, as Cal, was the husband who reacted with the cold, silent treatment when his wife and lifelong love, Emily (Julianne Moore), asked for a divorce. He then embarked on a freewheeling lifestyle with advice from Jacob, self-proclaimed dating expert, played by Ryan Gosling. Marital problems lead to outside love interests that overlap families, neighbors and work associates. The middle of the movie sagged a bit but was redeemed by some very funny scenes. All in all, a family situation fraught with a maze of hilarious complications."

The actor Steve Carol plays Cal Weaver a middle aged man,going through a tough divorce until Cal meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) who plays a charming, mysterious, ladies man. Both roles were performed perfectly, which only helped highlight the magnificent storyline.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we see it turn from a sad typical romance that you'd expect, to a surprising, great and highly laughable romance comedy, which keeps us entertained until almost the very end.<br/><br/>The end ruined it for me, if only the movie had ended a little sooner it would of been so much better everything up until the final ending is perfect. The ending for me turned this movie into what should of been spectacular, to mediocre at best. The ending is what you'd expect from every other romance movie you've ever watched. Which for me just ruined this movie because, I thought it was more then just your typical chick flick romance.<br/><br/>SPOILER! It's ruined for me when Robbie Weaver, Cals son gives his 8th grade graduation speech and says how he thinks love is a scam, and as expected Cal stands up in front of everyone gives a great big speech wins back his wife then Robbie re confesses his love (seen time and time before) for Jessica and finally wins her over.

"Stompgal_87","7","0","1","19 June 2014"," A different kind of rom-com although somewhat disappointing
","I wanted to see this film when it came out at the cinema with a member of support staff who worked at the house I moved to shortly before it was released but due to staff shortage, I didn't get to see it until today when I rented the DVD. The reason I wanted to see this film in the first place is because there aren't many romantic comedies that focus on couples getting a divorce, so its theme of Emily wanting a divorce from Cal was one of the film's strongest points. While this has more strengths than weaknesses, I was somewhat disappointed with the film's length being a little too long for my liking, the dialogue being clichéd in parts, particularly within the first half, and the uneven pacing.<br/><br/>Further to the film's concept, the acting was well done and mostly subtle. While the script had its clichéd moments and pop culture references to Twilight and Dirty Dancing, it had sound funny parts, especially about a female character's PG-13 life (possibly a fourth-wall joke relating to the film's certification in the USA); the film had some creative cinematography, particularly the shots of Cal's head covering Jacob's privates while they're in a locker room and the close-up shots of Jessica applying her make-up before taking nude selfies; and there was also a decent soundtrack with funky, contemporary and emotive snippets of incidental music and some pleasant if forgettable songs. The best songs for me were Goldfrapp's 'Ooh La La,' 'I've Had the Time of My Life' from Dirty Dancing, Spandau Ballet's 'True (also featured in the 2000 film remake of 'Charlie's Angels') and Middle East's 'Blood' that played into the closing credits. As for the story, I liked how the subplots of certain characters were revealed such as Bernie turning out to be Jessica's father and Hannah being revealed to be Cal and Emily's eldest daughter. The cast includes some well-known stars such as Steve Carell (Cal), Julianne Moore (Emily), Ryan Gosling (Jacob), Zathura's Jonah Bobo (Robbie) and the face of the EE mobile network Kevin Bacon as Emily's work colleague David.<br/><br/>All in all this film has some enjoyable, engaging and memorable moments but it also had some aspects that left me slightly dissatisfied. 7/10."

","Crazy, Stupid, Love follows Steve Carell as Cal, a married man of 25 years to Emily (Julianne Moore). The couples come across a hurdle in their marriage when Emily announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Cal drowns his sorrows in a local bar, telling anyone that will listen about his predicament. Jacob, a bachelor rightly played by the gorgeous Ryan Gosling takes Cal under his wing and makes it his mission to help him become a new man and appeal to new potential love interests.<br/><br/>The narrative also follows Jacob's relationship with the stunning Hannah (Emma Stone) and even has a sub-plot of Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) who is completely infatuated by his older babysitter Jessica, played by Analeigh Tipton, who also has a huge teenage crush on Cal. The film is packed with different stories and characters in a huge triangle of love, but Crazy, Stupid, Love navigates between all of them with ease and intelligence.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the film most definitely delivers. Carell gives one of his best performances yet moving between depression, shame, and completely hilarious. His unique facial expressions are shattering in some scenes, and ridiculously comical in others. He displays a dramatic depth unlike much of his other work such as The 40-year-old Virgin. I have mostly seen Gosling play depressing dramatic roles such as Blue Valentine and The Notebook, but here he proves himself as a comedian, giving a hysterical performance nailing every line and mannerism. He is flawlessly groomed with twinkles in his eyes and sly grins, perfect for his role as a ladies man who has all the money and swagger. Moore and Carell's characters combine in a way that makes you believe the pair really are in a long-term marriage. Stone shines throughout the movie and her character is promptly lovable. Moore and Stone do not have such big parts, but give just as great performances, balancing the humour and drama, holding their own on-screen.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei also stars in the film giving a fierce but very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal briefly after his divorce. Kavin Bacon also humours the audience as Emily's co-worker, who was her rebound too. Although they are very brief roles, they are hilarious in the scenes they were given. There can't be a more likable combination assembled together for a film. They gel remarkably well and even when one character tries to become unlikable, the actor depicts him or her with such talent that it is impossible not to like them. <br/><br/>What I love most about this film is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love to be a magical thing that makes someone happy all the time like in fairy tales; it knows that love and relationships do not always work out and occasionally ends up in heartbreak. It's a heart-warming and somewhat painfully honest depiction of three couples and unfolds with such a twist it's a massive, yet hilarious shock to the audience. It provided me a few tears but a lot of laughs; definitely a must-see."

With the exceptions of the agreeably smooth Gosling and the warm and witty Stone, everyone has done better work: they seem lost in all the talk; Carell, in particular, alters between cowering and manic but always just happens to be articulate enough to hammer home the literal points Fogelman is intent on making.

","Is that right if 99 out of 100 people said it is right? Not really. Does having sex without your partner means you are not commit to your marriage? Absolutely. But does this mean you do not love your partner anymore? Obviously no. Is that possible a man sleeping with 100 women cannot find his true love? Ignorance. Believe or not, these are what this movie tells us. Please don't watch it with bias. It is a lovely film, just relax and laugh during the projecting if you don't take it seriously.<br/><br/>I believe 90% of individuals in our communities are like Cal, going through their own small life, only struggling within office and home, never having sex with other women but the partner, still dreaming to try something beyond the red line especially when feeling unfair in daily life. However I don't believe there are many people like Jacob who can successfully sleep with different girls every couple of days. At least if these people were exist they are the very minority, I mean maybe 1 out of 10000 or less than that. <br/><br/>After trying to think over the real life again I found actually Jacobs are not definite minority as the lost individuals are not minority. The reasons why they are lost are diversity, such as a failure of marriage like our Cal, bankrupt, getting hurt in love like Hannah and so on. Anyway they find an excuse to abuse their life, trying something new, something dreamed but never got a chance to go and something makes feel cool or can release themselves.<br/><br/>After experiencing the fantastic new life, someone maybe turn back and plug into their life with a new and mature attitude, others maybe keep enjoying their new life without ending. In the end we see the aim of this movie of course is appealing to get ourselves back, stand in a new level to think about our life.

","Irony Makes The Movie<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies that will not only keep you laughing but have you constantly guessing, then Crazy, Stupid, Love is the movie for you. The story in short tells of a family going through some very odd but logical stage of life crises. The movie starts off with the main character experiencing a midlife catastrophe after his wife not only cheats on him but then divorces him. He then moves out and begins to realize how lonely he is. While becoming a consistent drinker, he finds and befriends a self-achieved young man. A man who has it all: women, money, great job, nice clothes, big house, etc.. The self-achieved man takes the main character under his wing and teaches him ways. The main character adapts to the teachings and starts picking up women left and right, getting a better position at work, and gaining confidence. But after some strand of time he finds that although this is satisfying at the time, it is not what he truly wants. He then goes to bizarre lengths and experiences some obstacles but in the end regains his wife and family. Crazy, Stupid, Love will be worth your while because its irony will keep you giggling and mind boggled for the length of the film.<br/><br/>The movies first act of irony is the son being in love with his babysitter. The boy writes her notes and poems ad nauseum. He is always trying to convince her that age does not matter and that he is mature enough to be her man. He even goes far enough out of his way to lock himself inside of a glass box at their school and profound his love for her in front of the entire student body. She on the other hand cannot date him. She tells him over and over that he is too young for her, that it is wrong, and that the shenanigans he is pulling has to stop. This back and forth battle over age goes on for quite some time until she finally explodes and lets out the fact that she likes someone else. This crushes the boy and kills his view and hopes for love. He stays subtle for awhile not pulling anymore stunts but is still madly in love with girl. She then proceeds to take nude pictures for the man and hides them in her room until she is ready to deliver them. The girls mom one day goes to put her laundry away and comes upon the pictures, shows her husband the pictures, then the husband goes to attack the man. The man was not only the dads bestfriend but the little boys dad as well.<br/><br/>The second act of irony is when the self-achieved man finally decodes to settle down. In his teachings to the main character, the main reason he is so successful is because he has nothing holding him back. Not family, not a girlfriend, not a single aspect could bring him down. He goes through women without a care in the world about their feelings because he knows he has no intention of staying with them. Then there was the night he met ""the one."" This is the only girl he had not slept with on the first date, they connect instantaneously, and their feelings flourish. This one night then develops into a relationship causing them to be all wrapped up within each other. In the process of getting caught up the man seems to forget about the main character, so he is forced once again to face the world on his own. After a little bit of time they come in contact again and he tells the main character about this woman and it gets the main character thinking about his ex-wife. The main character then goes to see his ex-wife on a day in which she was having a family dinner with the kids and their significant others. The main characters daughter just so happened to have the self-achieved man as her significant other. The third example of irony involves ""the other man."" This was the man that the wife cheated on her husband with further leading to the divorce. After the divorce she stops seeing the man to regain control of her life. But after waiting for so long she becomes lonely and decides to go out with him one more time. On this one time, she just so happens to forget her sweater. Then there was the day of the family dinner. On that day, the ex-husband gets attacked by his best friend over his daughters nude pictures, the ex-husband learns his man whore friend is now dating his daughter, and then by all chance the other man comes to bring the wife her jacket. This insane amount of tension then causes a sad but funny mauling of middle aged men.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is completely worth its two hours of film play. It is a great movie for all ages and has a little bit of every element to keep all spectators entertained. From its high points of comedy to its low bits of sorrow, this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen. This movie hit a homerun in my eyes because the cast connected well and the situations were very realistic. The irony was perfectly placed in the acts they were shown. I really recommend this movie for all movie goers."
"D_Y_Evans","5","0","1","11 September 2013"," Great in parts but horribly flawed in others.
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is almost a brilliant film, but it misses the mark so heavily on one of its main elements that is is dragged down into the mud. To it credit it does the 'Com' bit fantastically, Steve Carell plays the awkward 40-something part brilliantly, as he does whenever he is cast in this role. He is a pleasure to watch and this movie would be lost without him. Gosling is even pretty watchable, and at times funny, his character has little depth however, and the parts of the film that are emotional or romantic he fails to put any real feeling into his character. <br/><br/>The films biggest flaw is its women, I am not one to shout the feminist agenda from the rooftops but you get the feeling the Writers had a complete contempt for the female sex. Moore sometimes emerges from these shackles and you start to emphasise with her character but mostly she is the cause of the breakup and has little on screen time with her family. Emma Stones character is simply awful, and her friend in the film played by Liza Lapira is downright sickening. If we take one thing away from this film it is that if a woman is better looking than her partner he better know it, and he better know that he is lucky to have her. It is such a pathetic and shallow view of love an relationships and it jibes so sharply with the message this film thinks its trying to communicate that it not only taints the film but destroys it. As if this wasn't bas enough Stones character for the rest of the film goes from mish-mash-crazy to completely uninvolved, its a real shame.<br/><br/>The film still has its laugh-out-loud moments, and some great writing, but it cant recover from its fatal flaws."

","Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those movies I can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have great on-screen chemistry and it shines through in this movie. Although the story line is somewhat predictable with the bad-boy- changes-his-ways-because-of-a-girl and the typical the-babysitter's-in-love-with-the-father storyline, it's nice to see the development of the characters through their hilarious experiences. I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedies but Crazy, Stupid, Love is definitely an exception. I always picture Steve Carell to be one of those awkwardly funny comedians because of The 40-Year Old Virgin and The Office, but his role in this movie opened up a new perspective. He still has his Steve Carell charm but brings in a new side of him as a man who has been broken by the love of his life. I have a newfound love for him after this movie. There's a lot going on with the plot of the story but it's easy to follow and I was never left uninterested. Good job!"
"mg174","8","0","1","10 August 2013"," The boy is creepy and Julianne Moore's character isn't great. Apart from that it's swell.
","Liked this movie a lot. Thought Ryan Gosling's chest was great and his suave way of dressing was ace. I loved the Dirty Dancing scene with Emma Stone and the banter when they first met. My main beef is about the little boy Robbie: I assume he is meant to be portrayed as cute and winning because he doesn't give up on true love but really he is a serial killer in waiting - completely creepy and a total stalker. Never blinks, masturbating to her, telling her every five seconds. In real life the girl should be disgusted and freaked out - especially given her age. The movie just lost it for me when Jessica (the pretty teenager who is the object of little Robbie's unceasing desire) gave the little creep naked photos of herself. It's meant to be touching and kind I guess but it's not - it's just wrong. Anyway, moving on... the movie is excellent - there is lots of humour and pathos. Emma Stone is excellent in everything she does. Steve Carell was amusing and engaging and sympathetic. Another qualm is that there was nothing that interesting about Julianne Moore's character. The movie didn't explore her midlife crisis if that's what it was. It was pretty shallow - it seemed like she decided not to go for Kevin Bacon because he loved sushi and she didn't (or words to that effect). She seemed like an object between the two guys rather than a real woman. It's not a feminist movie by any means - at one point Steve Carell's character says to Kevin Bacon's ""She's all yours"" and I would have loved for Julianne Moore to tell them she was nobody's. Anyway, a fun and well made, fairly clever movie - with flaws - and not so lovable ones."

","Like so many other movies I have seen, it started out great but ended weak. Gosling was perfect in his role and Carell was hilarious as always. Emma Stone was also very good, and crazy hot. The problem I had was that the situations between everyone became more unbelievable as the movie went on. But those situations, while not great, weren't terrible either. The one thing I did have a major issue with was the son. Every time I saw him I wanted to slap him and shave his head. Maybe that is a little cruel for a child that can't act to save his life and has an absurd haircut, but whatever. Still, if the movie had wrapped up nicely it would have all been worth it. But the speech at the end went from dumb to just plain ridiculous. And if what's her face's dad was mad before, I wonder how he will react to being the father of a registered sex offender. You know, the polaroid deal. I mean, seriously!?!?!"

","I just ended up writing a review on Silver Linings Playbook and I know this review on Crazy, Stupid Love comes a little late, but guess what? There's no problem, it's probably new for many people and just made sense for me to review this two movies right now (probably because I wasn't very nice with SLP and I felt like showing that I'm not a Romance/Comedy/Dramas hater) . This movie really worked for me! It has the funny parts, the more sad ones that make you wonder and the regular ones that just brings you into the characters world. In CSL you get why they're doing what they're doing, you get compassion with them and you route for some situations. The best is that the movie occurs in a natural way and yes, in the end sort of goes the happy ending stuff to everyone but not so much in the obvious way that we're used to and in a way that you realize that is not the end. It is like it was you're life and you know life doesn't just end when you get want you want: there's more to it and CSL shows there's more to it after marriage, after kids, after our first love, after things going really bad. All of this with a funny touch and a modern way of seeing romance (nothing like Romeo and Juliet big drama/passion)."

"g-bodyl","9","0","1","10 March 2013"," Sweet and Enjoyable!
","I am starting to become a bigger fan of rom coms precisely because of movies such as Crazy, Stupid, Love. This movie despite some normal clichés we see in rom coms has a heart and is just too sweet to pass on. After you get to know all the characters in the film, you really root for them. They all have good intentions even if they don't make the right choices.<br/><br/>Glenn Requa and John Ficarra's film is about a guy, who after being married for 25 years, is asked for a divorce by his wife. Suddenly being free, he tries to move on but is unsuccessful. Suddenly he meets a younger guy who is about to teach him all he needs to know about women. But will that get him over his wife? The cast is a really good one. Steve Carell plays another sweet, likable guy. He is starting to grow on me as an actor instead of just a comedian. Julianne Moore as always delivers a strong performance as well as Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. I also liked the subplot that involved the two teenagers.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good film that rises above the other romantic comedies made recently just because it's so memorable and has strong, good-hearted characters. I also liked the fact that the funny moments and there were many, didn't come from any raucousness. If romantic comedies are getting made like this, they may have a brighter future. But, unfortunately these kind of above-average rom-coms are very rare. I'm glad I got to check out this gem. I rate this film 9/10."

The husband admits that he may have taken his foot of the gas pedal and let things slide. He goes to a high-end bar to drown his sorrows.<br/><br/>The rich playboy, who surprisingly does not have AIDS or STDs despite his innumerable conquests, takes the loser husband under his wings and transforms him into a suave, Bond-type guy, with the help of the loser's credit card.<br/><br/>I must now admit to readers that the main reason I got this DVD is because of Emma Stone, who is delectable, ravishing and downright fun in 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Stone's laughter and cheery personality can melt hearts made of stone, and she gets to display her vivaciousness in a few scenes with the playboy.<br/><br/>The two fall for each other, and not just because of their sexual attraction to each other. The playboy's pad is impressive, and he says it was bequeathed to him by his rich dad. Tell me, dear readers, would the two of them have stuck together if the guy was not filthy rich????<br/><br/>I like Carell's easygoing, loser demeanor. Viewers will feel sympathy and tenderness towards his character.<br/><br/>The climax is surprising, and I first thought it was smart, but I then realized that the filmmakers had deceived us by not revealing beforehand that the bubbly Stone is the daughter of the divorcing couple. The movie focuses on the couple's two other children and conveniently forgets to mention about Stone.<br/><br/>Also, the part about the female teen who takes nude pictures of herself is unnecessary and silly."

","Imagine Cal Weaver's surprise at the end of what appears a nice dinner at a good restaurant. For dessert, his wife Emily, undecided what to order, asks him for a divorce. Cal's world collapses right under his feet. After all, having been married to a woman for twenty five years and whom he considered his soul mate, it was not in his book. The reason for Emily's request is she has been seeing a man from her office. The Weavers are well off. They have three children, but the person most affected by the news is Robbie, a teenager going through some changes.<br/><br/>As Cal decides to move from the house, he must find a bachelor pad for himself. Cal, who is an uncool man, must find himself a way to continue with his life, something he finds inconceivable at his age. Cal begins frequenting a singles bar. He cannot get over the suave guy he watches picking up women every night. It appears to him, the man always scores. One night, the man, Jacob, approaches Cal with a proposal: stop whining and get a life. In fact, Jacob agrees to guide Cal into uncharted territory.<br/><br/>What follows is an almost miracle transformation of Cal. His luck with women is assured with his hew attitude. Cal scores big with Kate, a teacher, who is a sex animal. Cal cannot get his mind from Emily and the family in spite of his new social graces. We watch him going at night to tend to the garden without being seen by anyone. Robbie, his son, has a crush on Jessica, the baby sitter Emily insists in engaging. <br/><br/>The newly found life style does not bring happiness to Cal. Unknown to him, Jacob met and fell in love with his grown up daughter Hannah, something that shocks him, knowing well about the reputation of the man. In reality, Jacob had a change of heart as he met the young woman. He is a new man, but Cal does not see it that way. It takes a lot of convincing for Cal to accept his former mentor as the boyfriend of Hannah. In fact, at Robbie's graduation from middle school the whole family comes together, as Emily realizes her mistake.<br/><br/>A fun comedy directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Recqua, following their success with ""I Love Your Phillip Morris"". The screenplay is by Dan Fogelman. Although a bit formulaic, the film keeps moving at a great pace as the situations keep the amusement. The creators have stayed away from dwelling on Emily's deceit as well as Cal's sudden exploits, making it more real. The teenage angst of Robbie is examined in a light mood.<br/><br/>Not being a Steve Carell's fan, one has to recognize he does a better job, helped no doubt, by the direction he was given. He is an actor that works perhaps too hard to be liked. The real performance in the picture is Ryan Gosling, usually seen in more dramatic roles. Mr. Gosling keeps getting better all the time, doing an excellent turn as the nice predator who always gets lucky. Julianne Moore has not much to do. Her relationship is not played too much. A wonderful small part for Marisa Tomei as Kate, the teacher. Emma Stone is also notable for the sweetness she brings to Jessica. Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton do a nice job as Robbie and Jessica. Kevin Bacon has little to do as the home wrecker.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" was one of the best comedies that came out in 2011."

Nearly every actor in this film performs well and it is obvious they all got along well whilst filming. The roles of Julianne Moore and Steve Carell worked well but I particularly liked scenes with Ryan Gosling and Carell talking in the bar because there are some points where you can see they are both trying to hold in laughter and I love seeing that in films. I like to know they enjoyed acting as much as I enjoyed watching this film. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the film it begins to get cheesy but not to the point where you start to lose interest. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this film and it can leave you in tears with some comedy sequences. <br/><br/>Emma Stone's role in this was probably the best. She was hilarious as usual in this with her storyline being quite bizarre. That was my main objection to this film, everyone's storyline was great or at least really funny despite being unbelievable but, the story between Carell and Moore's son and his babysitter was just ludicrous. Not even funny, at some points it was just awkward watching it - especially at the end. I of course will not give anything away but it is the main factor of this film which wasn't really needed, it did provide some laughs but it got to the point where you just didn't want to see them in the film at all.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really good film. It's been a while since I saw a really good girl's film. I would recommend it to those who like comedies but particularly romantic comedies.

They are out for dinner, looking at the menu, when he asks if she knows what she wants she looks up and says ""I want a divorce."" This is a great surprise to him, a devoted husband and father.<br/><br/>The husband is Steve Carell as Cal Weaver in what amounts to a mostly serious role for the funny man. His wife is Julianne Moore as Emily Weaver. This quickly results in his moving to an apartment, and their 10 and 13 year old kids struggle with the new developments.<br/><br/>Despondent and confused Cal goes to a nightspot and meets Ryan Gosling as Jacob Palmer whose sole purpose in life appears to be picking up pretty ladies for one-night stands.

The movie is filled with established actors, many in small roles, including the likes of Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and Josh Groban in a non-singling role. As the movie nears its end the entanglements get more and more complicated, and funnier and funnier. Entertaining movie! <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The Emma Stone character, a newly minted lawyer, is actually the daughter of Cal and Emily, they were only 17 when she was born. She meets the dastardly Jacob and brings him home as her new love, which startles Cal, who it turns out had a one-night stand with his own 13-yr-old son's teacher who didn't know he was married. And on and on it goes. All seems to end well though as Cal and Emily realize they are soul mates and will get back together, forgiving each for unwise transgressions."

True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love—and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his ""soulmate"" and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway—except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know—and ""click"" with—another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place.

His 13-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), also overhears — and he's got a crush on Jessica.<br/><br/>Once again, with generic rom-com mainstays in place, bringing a sense of realism to this convenient and nearly farcical romantic chaos would've been almost impossible. Carell has his character on lock down, blending his ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Dan in Real Life"" characters into an earnest yet loony portrait of a middle-aged man learning to float after his lifelong stability gives out on him. Moore deftly navigates the territory of a woman in midlife crisis who's emotionally unsatisfied but completely unsure how to handle it. In contrast, Robbie is so completely far from a typical 13-year-old boy it's insulting. If his relentless pursuit of Jessica ever finally clicks in any form of the word, it's not until the very end and the fact that it basically works at that point is nothing short of magic.<br/><br/>Then there's Jacob (Gosling), the handsome (I'm underselling him) womanizer who takes a dejected Carell under his wing and teaches him the ways (""Karate Kid"" references abounding) of the bar pick up. He's such a smooth natural in his role he could pick up someone watching this movie despite their knowledge of being played. Jacob's backstory (why he's at this bar every night picking up women) ends up a casualty, which was really a big mistake, but Gosling has such a strong way with transparency that we believe all Jacob says or does. There's no doubt that he actually feels something for Hannah (Stone), even if it materializes way faster than it should.<br/><br/>Quickness and exaggeration are two of the chief factors of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" that threaten to derail it in the eyes of those looking for grounding to their romance. Cal's gut reaction to his wife's divorce request, not trying to rectify the situation instead of bailing for the bar, seems hasty. After learning well from Jacob and becoming a ladies' man himself, his attempts to get Emily back don't gel, perhaps because they come at the ushering of his unrealistic 13- year-old son. Especially when the film reaches it's big revealing climax, the rash reactions and failures to communicate get really frustrating.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" dashes willy-nilly between moments of emotional realism and romantic exaggeration and realistic humor and comedic exaggeration, enough to make your head spin. After all, this was directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the team behind ""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You, Phillip Morris,"" both of which go extreme and dark places for laughs yet try to stay human.<br/><br/>So how does it all — for the most part — ever manage to unscramble? The performances are truly the key, but the film's success comes down these intimate, down-to-earth moments throughout, like when Emily calls Cal without knowing he can see her from the backyard. These quieter moments give the actors a chance to shine and Fogelman's dialog has some real bright spots too. These moments help build support for the characters, a support and general liking that mostly doesn't tear apart throughout the absurd and unrealistic moments. It's a completely wild ride between two drastically different approaches to romance, but considering that all the contrast and paradox only bolsters the title ""Crazy, Stupid, Love,"" it has to be considered a success.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com!"

","Once I read a review where Roger Ebert mentioned how for the entire movie he sat there with a stupid grin on his face. That is similar to how I felt about Crazy, Stupid, Love. Only this had moments of outbursts of laughter, a few tears at the end, followed by an ear to ear smile.<br/><br/>This movie is magical in the sense it is a true over achiever, a warrior in the time of 'sloth-ness' in the world of film. It seems as though the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were given a script that could have been your generic Hollywood romantic-comedy and through great understanding of love and pain as well as adept skill they transformed it into something far more grandeur.<br/><br/>All of the performances were outstandingSteve Carell and Ryan Gosling were knockouts. Steve Carell is able to shift between his usual comedic prowess to earnest empathetic drama. Meanwhile Ryan Gosling continues to prove himself as one of the most talented actors of the neoteric age. All of the side performances were great as well. I was quite impressed with young Jonah Bobo, Emma Stone shines through with her charismatic charm that I am growing fond of, and Marisa Tomei is absolutely hilarious in this.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting another generic cliché love story, but there is so much care put into the characters here, and the concepts are fleshed out so skillfully that it is so much more than that.

"nickmesafilms","9","0","1","1 December 2011"," Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011) - This is Crazy! This is Stupid! This is Why I Love this Movie!
","Taking a new twist on the classic romantic comedy, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" features an all-star cast including Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and 13-year-old Jonah Bobo. The film starts with Carell portraying Cal who is getting a divorce after his wife Emliy, portrayed by Julianne Moore, cheats on him with Kevin Bacon. Now single and hopeless, Cal gets advice from professional bachelor Jacob Palmer, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, to become a ladies bachelor. Then the story leads into unexpected moments, hilarious clichés, and some heartwarming messages. Now, I have to say that ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is easily one of the best movies of the year. The script is beautifully well-written, and Dan Fogelman does an excellent job of visioning his script to the screen. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa do magnificent work by creating a unique romance with lots of great camera work and writing. Now speaking about the cast, Steve Carell does a brilliant job in this movie, and he's one of those characters where you want them to succeed. Ryan Gosling brings a sexy, golden attitude to his performance, and he delivers in every scene he is in. Wonderful as always, Julianne Moore delivers yet another satisfying performance. Emma Stone was completely awesome in this movie, and she really stands out. Marisa Tomei was pretty funny as the psycho-insane teacher. But, Kevin Bacon was okay as Julianne Moore's affair lover, but they neither share any great chemistry together. It's the scenes between Carell and Moore that make the movie stand out. But, out of all the cast, Jonah Bobo made me laugh the most as Carell's love-struck son, and he's my absolute favorite role in the movie. Aside from a cleverly written script, beautiful directing, and great acting, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" takes all the clichés that are frequently used in romantic comedies nowadays, and is presented in a different and more unique perspective, while making fun of the fact that the movie itself is a romantic comedy. In a year filled with rated-R raunchy comedies, 3-D animated features, and box-office fantasies, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is neither of that, but instead, a fresh and unique comedy that delivers heart warmth, cliché moments that really work, and laugh-out-loud humor, since all the laughs in the movie are deserving. Let's also not forget that the final twist in the movie, without revealing any spoilers, is both funny and unexpected. With a charming script and wonderful cast, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is not just one of the best comedies of the year, but it's also one of the best movies of the year. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."", in my review, ""a fun and delightful romantic comedy""."

","This movie will keep you guessing throughout. It's a funny and sweet story of life mixed in with all types of love. Steve Carell plays a great sullen character (as always) in reaction to his chaotic surroundings. He is mentored by a mysterious, wealthy, and handsome young man, in which he learns a thing or two about picking up women, and fulfilling his inner man self. You're never too old to learn something new, and you're never too young to love. This movie is filled with surprises, leaving the audience in dumbstruck in some cases. Love isn't always clear; sometimes it's crazy, and stupid. The journey of love is always surprising; especially when you re-evaluate your life at the same time."

I've been on a very good movie streak. A possible best movie of the year streak. And that streak continues with Crazy Stupid Love.<br/><br/>Crazy Stupid Love is one of those rare romantic comedies that is actually good. It's poignant, funny, engaging, and romantic, like anything Woody Allen has done. It's the 500 days of Summer of 2011. That movie blew me away. So did this one. The genre was losing touch until this one came along.<br/><br/>The film's hero is played by Steve Carell. He is Cal Weaver. After Cal's wife Emily(Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce, he meets Jacob(Ryan Gosling) a suave smooth talker who teaches him the ways of women. <br/><br/>Jacob is a bit of a jerk. That is, until he meets the right girl. Throw in Kevin Bacon as Emily's other man. There's also Emma Stone as a nice girl who's boyfriend won't propose. Then there's also Cal's son(Jonah Bobo) who seems to know a lot about love. He has a crush on his babysitter, who has a crush on Cal.<br/><br/>Crazy Stupid Love is funny, sweet, romantic, and real.

"phuongaloha83","8","0","1","23 November 2011"," Humorous, exciting, and deep
","I am always a fan of Steve Carell since the movie Forty Year Old Virgin which was released in 2005. In this movie, he is played as Cal Weaver who is going through a divorce and trying to get back with his wife. I like this movie because it is quite unpredictable. Usually a comedy romantic movie is very predictable, you can just guess what will happen next. However for this one, it is quite interesting. Not until the very last part of the movie that you know what will happen. The movie gives you a picture of the American society where teenagers are going through the teen phase and how they want to express themselves as adults and want to be treated equally to an adult. A woman (by Jullianne Moore) who has been in marriage for 25 years with three children is going through a mid-life crisis and struggling through it to find herself and want to find the same voice with her husband again. She and her husband were each other's sweet hearts since the first time they met in high school. Through the years, I guess work and children have come between them. The husband (Steve Carell) lost his self-esteem and somehow became alienated to his wife. They could not share their feelings and laughters became less in their house. It was interesting and exciting to watch this movie because you don't know if they are going to get back together or not. I also like how Ryan Gosling (as Jacob Palmer) is being portraited as a play boy, good looking, so skillful in knowing how to charms girls at the bars that he meets to get them into bed. The scenes keep switching between Jacob Palmer trying to hit on Hannah and about Hannal and then to Julliannae Moore and Steve Carell. It makes you wonder what are the relationships between these characters. I am not going to tell you to spoil the movie, you have to find out for yourself. But that is something that makes the movie interesting. <br/><br/>I love every single character in this movie, especially the little boy and the baby sitter. The only thing I thought a little bit cheesy is the end of the movie, the graduation ceremony. It is such a motif, so typical of American movie. I don't want to say much because it might spoil you if you have not seen the movie."

","DVD rentals' friends might have noticed this new release. Although I'm not a romance flick type of guy - my opinion is that it's all downhill from the release of Before Sunrise in the genre- I wanted to watch this film. Specifically, after watching its trailer, I believed that it would make fun of the other recent chick flicks. Oh boy I was wrong, the only thing that mocks is itself. For example, a lot of similes are being used in it, one of which was about how Emma Stone's character's life resembles that of a PG-13 movie. This is a PG-13 movie so every sequence is done in that moderate way. You'll get bullcrap like the '' soul mates '' theory, preteens talking about love (a feature probably adopted by another shitty movie '' Love Actually '') and how not being steady is lowlife. Basically it's a Disney like movie with a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>But let's analyze its plot... There is this married couple, Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, who seems to be going through a dull time. Hence, Moore wants a divorce. Carell then stumbles upon Ryan Gosling, a player, who volunteers on teaching Carell the ways he rolls with girls. So far so good, then comes the fairy tale part that'll make teen girls moist and nostalgic. It turns out that no character in the movie is getting what they really need, which apparently is '' love '' as described in the film. Therefore, characters start behaving irrationally, '' crazy '' which is unrealistic, unreasonable and plain '' stupid ''.<br/><br/>Its humor blows, with heavy overuse of the trending slang phrase '' Seriously? '' and other repetitive jokes. At some point, Twilight is being mentioned as a bad movie but comparing it to this it's way better. For the followers that have watched this, I want to share that I felt pity for Kevin Bacon's character. In addition, I enjoyed its soundtrack and Ryan Gosling's pugnacious moments. There is a twist in the end, that's played really bad by the screenwriters and succeeds in making you even more mad with the film. If you got nothing else to do and feel like raging in front of your TV set, this movie is for you. Let me just inform you that it gets worse as time goes by.<br/><br/>It seriously owns in the pointless meter, along with other applesauce by scoring a five out of five.<br/><br/>See the original post of this review here: http://tinyurl.com/ctbedb6"
"webmaster-3017","7","0","1","22 November 2011"," HK Neo Reviews: Crazy Stupid Love
","Crazy Stupid Love works because it put a lot of focus on characters, casting the right people and pure cynical-ism in the mix. Steve Carell is outstanding as the tormented soul turned player/father and Emma Stone steals scenes like she always does. As for Ryan Gosling, he is almost unrecognisable as a ladies' man. One of the best pick up line involves responding to a female target with ""boring and impress me"". Still, this film isn't about picking up, but rather about life and more defined – the process of life in general. Unlike most films, the ending here does not really matter, but rather the long process of getting there.

"jeromec-2","8","0","1","19 November 2011"," Not Citzen Kane but a thoughtful unexpectedly good movie
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a movie about 3 couples and 2 educations. It is not an ordinary comedy because people are allowed to say and do things which reflects our times and our society more than it does the wishes and dreams of a segment of our society.<br/><br/>Couple Number One ================= Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) and Emily Weaver (Juliette Moore) are out celebrating when he asks her what she would like (thinking the answer might be something like pumpkin pie) when she announces she wants a divorce. <br/><br/>That's quite an opening line for a ""comedy."" <br/><br/>Because he loves her, he immediately though very reluctantly agrees. He's read all the modern truisms about separation ""If you love someone let them go."" So he lets her go. All very cold and civilized. But he doesn't respond that way; he's not civilized at all.<br/><br/>Reliable straight arrow Cal has a response that his 13 year old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) would understand perfectly. He goes to a bar, drinks too much, and announces to the people in the bar just how sad, hurt, unaccepting he really is. He lives the 21st century but he feels the 1950's. <br/><br/>The Educations ============= The education is in two parts. There is Cal's education and then there is Jacob's (delightfully filled out by Ryan Gosling – a terrific actor who can do just about anything). The first one is easy. It is all fantasy. Jacob convinces Cal that there is a method to dealing with women: Right clothes, right lines, right attitude and right tone of voice; that's all it takes. Jacob is shallow, and who knows but his shallow methods might work on a certain type of woman. Cal sees it works like Alternate Medicine. People around you say one thing and Dr. Jacob another. Who's to say Jacob isn't right? <br/><br/>So Cal is a good student. He goes from an uncertain bubbling incompetent to a clone almost as good as Jacob himself. In one of the minor sub plots, he seduces Marisa Tomei who plays her absolute best over the top recovering alcoholic who has bought into our view that sex is therapy. That is the height of Cal's career as 21st century lounge lizard. It also is a wake up call for him. He knows how shallow all of this is.<br/><br/>The second education is that of Jacob, who discovers that for all her brilliance, Hannah, (Cal's oldest daughter played by Emma Stone) is grounded in something far better than meaningless sex. She believes in love and though she is distracted by her reaction to the cold stupidity of a coworker, she is not so blinded that she can't see where Jacob will lead her even though she thinks that's what she wants. Hannah demands underneath that frustration, that Jacob do more than get her fixed. Perhaps because some of Cal's virtue rubs off on him, Jacob realizes he must comply with her values.<br/><br/>The Second Couple ================= This is really intended as either comedy relief or a spoof on the ""Nerd"" movies. <br/><br/>It is the puppy love of a thirteen year old (Jonah Bobo who plays Robbie Weaver) and his baby sitter (Jessica startlingly well done by Analeigh Tipton). It is a real over the top presentation, but its not unrealistic. It is the way a young teen would act, if not over someone then something. There is commitment, there is enthusiasm, there is desire, there is single mindedness, there is the willingness to do anything it takes to succeed. And there is wisdom. He is smart enough and practical enough that Cal (who both loves and admires Robbie – a rare combination) admits out loud that sometimes Robbie scares him.<br/><br/>In the meantime Jessica is in love with Cal. She's older but really just as inexperienced as Robbie. In our century sex knows no real boundaries (it's love that's the problem), and she's willing to take the advice of a much more knowledgeable ""older"" woman – a classmate that knows how to deal with ""older men."" Jessica accepts the advice and does what she is told. The trouble is that she cannot get up the nerve to give what she does to Cal and her parents discover it. That's when parental love comes in contract with sexual ease. Hell hath no fury like an inflamed parent.<br/><br/>Robbie, faithful and very truthful observer that he is, gives up on her. How can he compete when a woman does not recognize him to be on the same playing field? We have just killed the 1930's and 40's notion of one girl many beaus.<br/><br/>The Least Convincing Couple =========================== I was least convinced by Emily and Kevin Bacon. Of all the people in this movie, she learned the least. Once she was convinced how much Cal had learned, how he could cope and how much he was dedicated to the idea of her, she wanted him back. She's Harlequin at its best. <br/><br/>What this movie did =================== The director and actors rejected any notion of anything less than a good strong marriage. With all its troubles and disadvantages it is still our best option. This movie makes any of us who are in committed marriages very uncomfortable because it is bleak and at the same time rich, powerful and yet people get to snivel, it knows its society, yet it dares to choose a value as old as the beginning chapters of Genesis. It shows our vulgarity, but chooses modesty. <br/><br/>Like it or hate it, Crazy, Stupid Love at least has the courage to stand for something that is critical of our revolving divorce door and shallow discontent."

Now I'm not saying you won't guess where the film is heading as it pans out but there will definitely be a couple of surprises along the way.<br/><br/>After finding out his wife has had an affair and wants a divorce Cal (Steve Carell) is taken under the wing of ladies man Jacob (Ryan Gosling) and shown the ropes of being a single guy again in the modern era.<br/><br/>The cast is strong and everyone gives a solid performance but the key to this movie is in the writing, rom-coms lately have been in a bit of a slump and getting kind of boring but Crazy, Stupid, Love breaks away from the norm and shows us exactly how entertaining the genre can be when done correctly.

When you watch the movie, be sure to note that the main actors are always GENUINELY INTO their partners throughout the movie/as soon as they meet. ***Please do not go chasing a partner who has mistreated you/used you/abused/tortured you because you deserve better.

","**Spoiler Alert** OK. I get it now. Steve Carell is handsome, talented and cute. He was at his best in this funny, romantic comedy. Ryan Gossling was hot, as usual. Emma Stone was adorable, as usual. Julianne Moore was great, as usual. Annaleigh Tipton was gorgeous. However, it was strange to see Josh Groban come out of nowhere, and it was sad to see the beautiful and talented Marisa Tomei, and the talented Kevin Bacon and John Carroll Lynch relegated to such small, clownish roles. Overall, a romantic comedy worth watching. Carell needs to keep churning these out with greater frequency. Roles like this really shine a spotlight on how he can be tender, funny, witty and touching all at once. And, dang, his good looks just sort of creep up on you when you least expect them to."

","Cal (Carell) learns his wife Emily (Moore) wants a divorce from what he thought was a happy marriage. He meets Jacob (Gosling) who changes Cal into a ladies man, sort of. <br/><br/>I thought this was going to be another lame chick flick with no-laughs, dirty sex talk, raunchy language, no clever sight gags along with silly and stupid things that are mandatory in a Hollywood comedy. And, I was foaming at the mouth just thinking about how scathing a review I would write. I couldn't wait for this to be over to start writing. <br/><br/>Well, I was wrong. This had none of that except the no-laughs part still held true (and, one F-bomb was uttered). This is not a comedy although billed as such. This is lite-drama and was well acted. Quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>And, it got complicated: Cal is getting a divorce from Emily who is seeing David Lindhagen (Bacon) at work; Jessica (Tipton), the baby sitter, is in love with Cal; Jacob teaches Cal how to pick up women now that Cal is single; Cal's 13-yr old son Robbie (Bobo) is in love with 17-yr old Jessica; Cal picks up Kate (Tormei) who is also Robbie's teacher. Emily is surprised that Cal knows Kate and has dated her. Then Jacob says he has found true love, for the first time, and Cal is impressed until he discovers that Jacob is in love with Hannah (Stone). Now, Cal is angry because he knows about Jacob and how he behaves around women. Then Jessica's father Bernie (Lynch) is shown naked pictures Jessica's mother found in Jessica's bureau that were of Jessica that Jessica took to interest Cal in her (Remember Jessica is in love with Cal. Keep up). Got it?<br/><br/>Then they all meet, somehow, in the back yard of Cal's (now Emily's) house and a fight breaks out. Cops are called who tell everyone if they are going to fight, do it in the house and keep it all in the family. This was the closest we came to some actual humor. <br/><br/>I saw many places for good lines, some comedic facial expressions and some rather good sight gags, but none showed up and I wasn't consulted. Just the normal stuff as I described above. Kind of like a slice of life within a family that went off center for a while.<br/><br/>The name David Lindhagen was mentioned many times in the movie and acted almost like a punch line in some conversations.

","As many other reviewers wrote, I was surprised by the movie. The storyline did not lead me to expect anything new and I am not a Steve Carell fan, though I've seen several of his movies, I'm sorry to say. I was going to see this with some detachment and I at least hoped something good thanks to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>There was the comedy I did expect to see but more than that, there is a maturity in the subject and more than a half decent script. Carell did have the best part he's ever had and that was the beginning of a good movie going experience I did not think I would have. I'm not going to go bananas and say this is an outstanding motion picture but it probably won't disappoint most of you. Those easily impressed are going to rate it higher than it deserves, but so what.<br/><br/>The character of Cal Weaver played by Carell is not overly acted; the part of Emily Weaver played Julianne Moore makes for a perfect match on screen. The sub-plot with Jacob Palmer and Hannah Weaver, played respectively by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is what made the movie worth watching for me. Then when the two stories meshed into one, well that sealed it for the audience."

","This film is about the love life of a man after his wife asks for a divorce, as he gets groomed by a lady killer who can get any woman he wants.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a lot of fun, with loads of really funny scenes. Steve Carell acts great as a romantically inept man, his social skills in a bar is so bad that it just makes you laugh.

There are many romantic entanglements between the characters, and at the end, the whole situation is so crazy that it is just outrageously funny.<br/><br/>""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" has got this other side as a semi-serious drama about love and how we treat our loved ones. The film seems to be happy and mischievous, and yet there are a few very touching scenes. I find the scene when Julianne Moore calls Steve Carell about the heater very touching. The scene where Steve Carell makes a speech at the end is even more touching. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a rare romantic comedy with substance and heart. I really like it."

But lighten up your expectations for this one folks, because it is possibly one of the best romantic comedies of the year. The film not only has it lighthearted hilarity, it has a touching romantic side to it too. The balance between it was perfect for anyone suspecting either of the two. I must point out Ryan Gosling's performance as well. If you compare and contrast his performance in this and Drive, you can tell the actor has substantial range. Some parts of this movie are a bit over-the-top, possibly being the ones that lowered the score, but nevertheless, I was actually taken surprise by its unexpected heart. So that about wraps up this one, I seriously recommend this to the romantic-comedy lovers. It'll definitely become possibly one of your favorites.

","When I first saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't excited to see it or anything like that since romantic comedies seemed to be just heading towards just toilet humor a lot of times now a days. And just by seeing the trailer I could sort of tell what the story was about and it turns out I was wrong...And that is a good thing this time. Since the premise isn't entirely original but it's much better than the direction it could of went. A lot of the scenarios had a bit of the Asian drama vibe to it with everything that is going on, well a very condensed version of it and with more of a American flare to it. The main positive thing about this movie is that just about everything from the premise, the direction, the characters and the jokes...It just works for the most part. I couldn't help but be entertained by whats going to happen next, I mean it's sort of predictable but it's how it's delivered that makes this movie fun and enthralling to watch. The humor in this is actually witty, it's more of the serious but funny humor and doesn't rely on toilet humor. It has a bit of sex humor than and there but it wasn't annoying and for the most part it was sort of clever how it's delivered. Another thing that makes this movie work is the cast, almost all the cast fit right in with this movie and premise. Steve Carrell did the whole mixture of comedic/serious thing almost perfectly and Ryan Gosling played the ladies man really well, although sometimes it seemed like he was playing himself. All the rest of the cast put on a great performance and I guess it's because of the performance but the chemistry although short at times was believable for the most part. Overall this is a dramatic romantic comedy that just about anyone would enjoy. Unless your one of those annoying teens with a single digit IQ that just makes stupid noises, take random pictures and hide behind chairs constantly while other audiences are trying to watch a movie. Which happened when I was watching this movie, to sum it up this isn't a stupid comedy and isn't meant for stupid people that doesn't have the courtesy to just enjoy a movie while not bothering other people. Anyways it may not be the funniest comedy but the direction of it all is what makes this movie great.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver who has a marriage crisis and Ryan Gosling plays Jacob Palmer who sees Cal Weaver in a bar and tries to help him. The move is filled with comedy and emotion, one scene is filled with comedy and the other with emotion overall the movie is good to watch. It's not your usual Steve Carell movie with a lot of laughs, it's one of those movies which has some funny scenes and gives a nice message.

You keep on trying no matter whether you are unreasonably out of the way.<br/><br/>You got nothing to take away from the movie except the message that find your soul mate and stick with them. The slow motion shots just make the movie more cheap.

However, I rated the movie 8, not because of the actors or the somewhat enjoyable plot, but because there where some moments that were really GOOD. And not 'romantic comedy' good, but truly 'fresh', funny, and well played. Of course, it didn't manage to avoid all the banalities which we in one or another way see in most romantic comedies, however, it did stand out with those small moments that really made me smile.

","Wow. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one of the top comedies this year. Depicting the story of a mid-aged father amid a marital crisis, this film prevails as both as a drama and comedy.<br/><br/>The first great thing is the unpredictability of the plot. You never know what happens next as the story unfolds. There are a lot of twists for dramatic and comedic effects and they unravel very well as the storyline develops. With its appropriate pace and distinctive style of portrait, it has the ability to make the audience burst out laughing and sobbing.<br/><br/>The second plus is that the film is very realistic, full of moments that a lot of people may actually experience in their lives. It is an excellent drama because it takes you through a roller coaster of emotions. What's better is that it makes you feel everything in a relaxing environment most of the time. Sometimes, it can be depressing, and sometimes cheering, but most vitally, it is nothing too serious and deep. After all, this is a comedy and even you are supposed to feel the sadness of the characters you can laugh at the same time. <br/><br/>The message is clear and a great one too. Love is uncertain and unpredictable, but that does not mean we should give up on it. It's quite the opposite. Once you find the one true love, you must hold on to it and keep trying despite the hardship.<br/><br/>This is highly recommended. It's a realistic drama with loaded fun moments and along with a great message and lesson for us all."

But anyway it has enough of both features to make it agreeable to watch though on the whole it has too many funny scenes to be considered serious and too many serious scenes to be considered funny. But it has some witty dialogues and a few powerful sentimental scenes along with funny ones. The story tells us about a few crossed love situations: a 13 year old boy in love with his 17 year old babysitter who is herself in love with the boy's father, a husband and a wife who seem to be on the verge of a divorce which appears not to be wished by the husband and maybe also not fully for the wife despite of her confessed adultery, a husband who tries to take lessons of seduction from a professional philanderer and a few confusing situations that finish with a great surprise in the end.

You can't say this for a whole lot of movies each year, unfortunately.<br/><br/>It doesn't start fast, it's rather low key until you get your run through the whole exposition. But it gathers momentum, scene after scene situations become crazier while never spinning out of hand, and characters are consistent and likable all along.<br/><br/>With such a nice movie, delivering on all counts, you should be plenty happy. Yet, if you really insist, typecast is Julianne Moore as the neurotic suburban wife (but she does it very good and with some nuance from previous assignments) and typecast is Marisa Tomei as the crazy funny spicy litmus gal.

","My first movie review on here. So I'll try my best to give you guys and girls an objective review, influenced by my subjectivity ;)<br/><br/>I went to the movies that day to see 'The Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. To my disappointment they didn't played that movie anymore. So out of the few other movies to choose from we picked 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. It may come over as we forced ourselves to see that movie. But we had in mind to wait until it came out and buy it eventually, instead of watching it on the big screen. Why? Because I expected it to be a typical romantic chick flick and I rather see bigger productions at the movies. <br/><br/>But I must admit that the movie surprised me on a few levels. Actually on many levels. It's nice to see Steve Carell in a more mature character, but still combined with his kind of humour. Ryan Gosling was great in performing as the 'gigolo'. Julliane Moore showed us that she really is a good actress by showing us the wife in a crisis period. Although Emma Stone her part wasn't that big, she still popped out as the charming girl with the funny, but nice voice and laugh.<br/><br/>The story itself was well written. Especially the different story lines and how they come together at a certain point. I, myself, had no idea to expect such a twist in the story until it happened. The twist came at the right moment, because right before that I started to feel a bit bored. Not that the movie was boring, but I was afraid that the movie was leading to nothing, only the typical end: 'And they live happily ever after'. But luckily it didn't went that way. Instead you got the great twist in the storyline, you were constantly amused and had to laugh. Although it ends all well and almost as expected as it does in every romantic comedy these days. Yet with this movie it felt right and didn't felt so typical.<br/><br/>So people who like to see something romantic, funny, but are also keen for a story with a twist. Go and see 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. I know I enjoyed it, as did my friends. And I know I will buy the movie when it's out on DVD.<br/><br/>(ps. Sorry for me English, native language is Dutch)"

","I have nothing personal against Rom-coms, it's just that sometimes a film really surprises you in a good way or it falls flat on its face. Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately belongs in the former category. If there was anything that lets Crazy, Stupid, Love down, it was that the film stumbles a little in the final act.<br/><br/>Everything else however works, and the result is a surprising and hugely enjoyable Rom-com. The filming is never cheap and often stylish and pretty and the scenery is very striking. The soundtrack also compliments the film very well, as does the direction. The story is very clever too with seldom a dull part, only the final act has signs of inconsistency.<br/><br/>For me, what lifts a Rom-com especially is the cast, the chemistry and the quality of the script. Luckily, Crazy, Stupid, Love succeeds in all three of those areas. The script is funny in a witty, droll and infectious sense, with plenty of moments to warm your heart and touch you too. The chemistry of the actors is also there and very believably done.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell is brilliant here, while I do consider him talented with good material, I don't think he has been this good in a while.

","As the movie opens Cal Weaver's humdrum but comfortable life as an accountant in Beverly Hills is rudely shattered by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore announcing in a crowded restaurant that she's being having an affair with a workmate and wants a divorce after 25 years marriage. Cal (Steve Carell) moves out and drops in to the single bars scene where for reasons not entirely clear (""you remind me of someone"") lounge room Lothario Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who beds a different gorgeous woman each night takes Cal in hand and trains him to be just as successful. Meanwhile Cal's 13 old son Robby (Johna Bobo) has fallen in love with the family's babysitter, High School student Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who in turn has a crush on Cal. Then Jacob actually falls in love, with young lawyer Hanna (Emma Stone) and Emily starts to yearn for her discarded husband.<br/><br/>This all sounds like a conventional romantic comedy of the feel-good variety, but directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and writer Dan Fogelman have a few surprises up their sleeves. The performances are first-rate and the dialogue crackling. There is some reliance on slapstick but also some real emotion conveyed. Ryan Gosling's Jacob might perhaps be too shallow to be true (""you look like you've been photoshopped"" says Emily, on seeing his torso), but it turns out that even he has a credible backstory. As the principal lovers, Steve Carell and Julianne Moore exhibit a realism seldom seen in romantic comedy and there is some fine comic work from Maresa Tomei as one of Cal's lounge bar conquests who pops up a bit closer to home. At 120 minutes the film is slow in places – I would describe the direction as quirky rather than slick (how else can one explain the cinematographer's penchant for shoe-level shots) but more rewarding than the average rom-com, and although the ending is contrived it's still satisfying.<br/><br/>The directors, whose best known previous works, ""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" were decidedly quirky, have toned things down a bit here, but the characters are credible and sympathetic. I also liked the way the deep seated prudery and overdeveloped sense of decorum that afflicts middle class Americans are sent up. After an unseemly though perfectly understandable brawl in the Weaver's picture perfect back yard it falls to Vietnamese-American Officer Huang to tell the warring parties to do their fighting inside where the neighbours can't hear. I also liked Cal's line as he is rejected again by Emily outside Robbies' high school after a disastrous parent teacher interview and it starts to rain: ""This is such a cliché"". Well I suppose anyone going to see a rom-com ought to be prepared for clichés, but here they are cleverly handled, if a little sugar-coated."

Factor in Gosling's interest in lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone), Cal's son's yearning for babysitter Jessica (who is herself infatuated with Cal), and some additional wrinkles...<br/><br/>It is fair, I think, to call this film a romantic comedy - it features at least six romantic relationships and is, at times, very funny indeed. But it is also deadly serious at times, and contains some deep truths about people and their relationships, romantic or otherwise.<br/><br/>While the eventual resolution is no surprise, there are a number of surprises on the way, and these are very welcome (one, in particular, leads to a very funny physical sequence on Cal's lawn). There are a number of places when you are laughing one moment and all choked up the next.. And there are some terrific payoffs, in particular the storyline between Cal's son and babysitter Jessica.<br/><br/>Let me say that this is a wonderful part for Steve Carell, and he picks up the ball and runs with it. His performance here is mesmerising at times, particularly in the early stages where you see a decent man who wants nothing more than to do the right thing, hurt, bewildered, angry, shocked, and completely unable to process what has happened to him, and all conveyed in a performance of quiet and stillness.<br/><br/>Pleasingly, the bad language is kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>I rate this film very highly, and recommend it thoroughly."

","Crazy Stupid Love<br/><br/>Yes it's a rom- com, and I can hear the sound of guys being dragged to go see yet another one just to please their partners. Well guys, you're in for a shock and a good one too! As finally after a long time, Hollywood provides a romantic comedy that is actually funny, smart, charming and one that men will actually enjoy rather than just pretending! <br/><br/>The plot is as follows; mid-fortys, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is living a dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal blinded by love learns that his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his happy life quickly unravels. Worse, in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wingman and protégé to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).<br/><br/>The humour is family suited; running gags with no toilet humour in sight. Its refreshing that its predominately dialogue that is funny and peoples reactions rather than slapstick falling over etc.<br/><br/>A stand out feature is undoubtedly the cast as each actor provides laughs in their own characterised way. Even the additional cast never falter as Liza Lapira aka Liz is the no nonsense quick witted bff of Emma Stone and not forgetting scene stealer Marisa Tomei adding the 'crazy' to the title whilst Emma Stone- who may not be utilised a much as she is cable of – is still beautiful and solid as ever. Young guns Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo also provide positive acting abilities but it's the two leads the movie hangs on. Steve Carrell brings his perfected dry wit to the proceedings but also a range of emotions which we don't normally get to see from him. Playing the socially awkward character is second nature to him now and he does it so well that throughout crazy stupid love you may miss the glimpses of his ability to be serious when we see him in this adult 'dad' role. There are strong indications there that he can gain stronger roles in different genres if given the chance. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is the 'player', who takes it upon him self to transform the luck of Cal, inject some mojo and bring back his ""lost manhood"". To describe his character it would be that girls want him and guys want to be him. The personality he shows us is on a perfect line of confidence without the arrogance and makes his uber cool persona seem achievable to the everyday man. <br/><br/>Another element for the audience is the films nicely balanced soundtrack, one for those interested in finding some unheard of bands, jazzy pieces and songs of soft delight. The screen play is clever in that it shows the picture as if to be admired from afar and not to be subjected up-close. The individual stories are to be taken on the surface, lightly and not questioned because its not a deep movie, the strength lies in the believing in good hearted people overcoming life's obstacles. <br/><br/>In summary, Crazy, Stupid Love is all about the love, laughs and life. While it may not be magical, it's fully worthwhile and produces a golden 'OMG' moment! The length is near the two hour mark which admittedly the pace / tone dips in the middle but it does pick up again and leaves the audience with hope that even though love make us crazy and stupid, we wouldn't want it any other way! <br/><br/>(my ratings are based on 6 average 7 good 8 very good 9 superb 10 epic)"

","It is a movie which has shown love in all forms, that is why the title. Love is crazy and stupid. From the middle aged character of Steve Carell to the love story of his son of about 13 yr old. The movie has many layers of stories in it. <br/><br/>Steve Carell gets to know that his wife needs a divorce in the first scene of the movie. Then on the movie starts about what he does trying to raise two kids alongside. Ryan helps him shred his old style geeky look and helps him to get a makeover. I will not divulge any more details as it is better you watch the movie without any more pointers from the reviews.<br/><br/>The comedy element is kept alive through out the film by its wonderful screenplay,also giving it a heart and touchy feel when needed. The huge star cast of brilliant actors all holding there own in this must watch romantic comedy of this year 2011."
"Braindead09","Null","0","1","23 September 2011"," Should make the break from The Office
","A romantic comedy that actually works. Steve Carell picked a good enough script to convince me that maybe leaving The Office is not career suicide. The plot plays like a French farce. The break-up is delivered immediately and the audience are allowed to watch Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as a middle aged couple work their way through the situation. OK Moore is placed as the villain, but its not hard to believe that she had a do or stay mission. <br/><br/>The film doesn't lag and though the actual time span is difficult to gage, we are spared the stereotypical scenes of weeping maladjusted children playing cupid. The son is only interested in his own agenda and only lets rip about his parents marriage with his synopsis of The Scarlet Letter.<br/><br/>The plot contrivances were pleasantly delivered on their premise and Marisa Tomei carried her performance with a vengeful glint in her eye right up until her final scene. Thankfully Kevin Bacon short appearance worked, even though his characters pursuit of a married woman was morally dubious his heart seemed to be in the right place.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the subplot with the 13 year old son and his crush on the babysitter and thought it ended on both a sweet and disturbing note.<br/><br/>The only false note was the late revelation of Emma Stone background. This was more than made up for with her first night with Ryan Gosling as he experienced the joy of a woman for company instead of a sperm deposit.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling was able to give his friendless character a lot of charm, and when the film needed to make a plot leap it worked well enough to take Steve Carell on his journey.<br/><br/>Overall easily this years second best dysfunctional rom com after Bridesmaids."

","We are familiar in seeing Steve Carell in all round crazy comedies like, Get Smart, Date Night and others. This movie drops in a different category all together as we see him play a comic role but had to put some serious dramatic energy in it, to make the character not look phony. If you are not a huge fan of the whole, romantic comedy flicks, this movie is a set aside for all. Starting all cliché-ish, Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver a Mr. Nice guy who's wife cheated on him and to add insult to injury, she tells him this to his face on their way home from dinner which ended abruptly when she dropped the divorce bomb. Cal all bumped out starts to hang in a bar gets drunk and talks on and on about his wife (Julianne Moore) cheating on him. He meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who takes him under his wing and turns him to a lady magnet. From here the movie goes through the same tunnel as others, the hunk mentor falls in love and protégé ends up not wanting to quit the game, the movie then adds twists and turns with an enlighten ending. The scripts from Dan Fogelman and direction from ""Bad Santa"" writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, we are presented with a perfect ensemble cast, which delivers in both comedy and drama to keep you watching to the very end.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movie is just the fact that it is predictable, as we have been dealt in various dosages of romantic movies going in this trend, but known has a 13 year old boy who was insanely in love with a 17 year old, I will give the writers that. Also to add the 17 year old was in love with Cal.<br/><br/>Marisa Tomei, joins the cast as the first girl Cal, lands in the sack.<br/><br/>The thing about reviewing a romantic comedy is trying not to reveal all the plot and at the end , killing the fun, so you want to go to the cinemas with your girl?

","It's true, the high average review for this movie is somewhat warranted I'm happy to report as I enjoyed this movie when it was at it's best, pulling out the stops and (spoiler) heaping on the surprises. And this movie exceeds at doing that. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a movie which packs in quite a few laughs while managing to mostly veer away from the crude humor, something that in-and-of- itself deserves praise. The whole Steve Carrol and Ryan Gosling character relationship and development was a hoot. This is probably Steve Carrol's best movie to date and thanks in no small part to Gosling. Carrol is more or less in a reprieve of his usual character, but the script helps uplift him. Thereare unfortunately the occasional almost forced scenes of sentimentality too that feel mis-placed. Especially a lot of the Dad-to-Son talks, and wife and husband talk - which I patiently waited through as the heavy-handedness of those scenes would abate. Still let me emphasize the occasional nature of those scenes, not enough hurt my recommendation of a rental or check-out."

","Sigh, things would have been so, so different if this reviewer had met someone like Jacob Palmer the last time he visited a bar. You see, Jacob is a dude who manages to charm women with the slightest effort, so much so that the somehow manages to bed different women on different nights. Not that this reviewer wants to be a promiscuous creep, but things would be so, so different if Jacob had taught him how to pick up women, like how he dished advice to Cal. <br/><br/>Ah, Cal. Cal is a middle aged man who just learnt that his wife had slept with her colleague. She asks him for a divorce and his world comes crashing down. His once perfect life becomes a mess until he meets Jacob in a bar. Taking pity on the down and out Cal, the Casanova agrees to teach him how to pick up women. Somewhere in this is a pretty law student, a horny teacher, a lovelorn boy and a, well, without giving too much away, creative babysitter.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, this movie directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (screenwriters who went on to direct their self penned I Love You Phillip Morris in 2009) has the intention of showing its audience how crazy and stupid love can get. Or at least, how crazy and stupid people can get in the name of love.<br/><br/>Looking at the movie's leading man, one would expect a gross out comedy with toilet gags and fart jokes (sorry, Steve Carell, but your character in The 40 Year Old Virgin will never be etched out of our minds), but the comedy drama turns out to be a pleasantly sweet take on love which will have you smiling at the end.<br/><br/>Carell plays the middle aged man who is faced with the biggest crisis ever – life. He manages to give a nuanced and affecting performance, nicely complementing his on screen wife Julianne Moore's (The Kids Are Alright) ever perfect portrayal of a career woman. Then there is Ryan Gosling (All Good Things), who takes on the role of the playboy. Watch out for his amazing six pack abs (how long did the dude train to get a hot bod like that?) and an amusing, err, bed scene with his co star Emma Stone (Easy A) which is one of the charmingly lovable romantic sequences we've seen. The wonderful cast also includes Marisa Tomei (The Wrestler), Kevin Bacon (X Men: First Class) and a certain crooner we know as Josh Groban.<br/><br/>Written by Dan Folgelman (Tangled), this 118 minute movie may feel a little stretched at times, but thanks to its agreeable cast and a down to earth story, its viewers will gladly sit through the romantic comedy without complaining.

"Sharicespieces","Null","0","1","25 August 2011"," Finally, a smart feel-good movie. (even if you're not a fan of Steve Carell)
","I originally didn't want to see this movie because all I knew about it was that Steve Carell was starring. But my friends (two guys, mind you) insisted that it was the only worthy-looking film in theaters. Probably because they think Steve Carell is hilarious, and not because they're die-hard ""rom-com"" fans. When they told me Emma Stone (the coolest person ever) was in it, I agreed to go.<br/><br/>This movie starts out a bit depressing, while staying in-tact with the humor that's found in our every day tragedies; divorce, unrequited love, etc. The story starts from hitting rock-bottom and going forward with life. Things are getting better and worse at the same time for Cal (Steve Carell) when he deals with his high-school-sweetheart-wife (Julianne Moore)'s infidelity and her decision to divorce him. At the bar where he goes to look pathetic every night, he befriends an over-confident, over-stylish pick-up artist (Ryan Gosling) who oddly feels responsible to give Cal a make-over. The objective is to make his wife jealous by building his confidence and ""game"" with other women.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling gives a great performance, even though he's semi-ripping off Robert DeNiro's trademark persona. And Emma Stone is as cool as ever, winning his heart by being curiously honest and poking fun at what she sees. She effortlessly makes the inner pain of Gosling a little lighter.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with fun scenarios. Did I mention that their 17-year-old babysitter is in love with Cal? And that their over-romantic younger son is in love with the babysitter? I know this movie sounds cliché, but it's the good kind of cliché. The kind that has built on romcoms before it, and made the genre better and more appealing to both sexes. After all, it wasn't me who pushed us to see it."
"puffball97","Null","0","1","24 August 2011"," One of the Better Romantic Comedies in Recent Years
","""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a romantic comedy that is less predictable than most romantic comedies of modern days. It doesn't have the old formula of boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl break up, boy and girl run into unexpected place and reconcile at end, which we have seen numerous times that it's like we already have seen the movie. Here, we are seeing a more mature comedy with some serious undertones and plenty of surprises. Too bad there aren't too many movies like this around.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is most restrained and controlled here in his role as Cal. He does not overact or try hard. He acts cool all along, and when he shows his emotions, he does them more internally than externally. He is in sudden shock when his longtime wife, Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce rather than dessert during dinner. Emily is bored and just had had an affair with her coworker, David (a sly but restrained Kevin Bacon). Cal moves out and heads into the singles scene. Ryan Gosling, a very serious and choosy actor in his generation where most men act like boys and he always acts like a man, is Jacob, a ladykiller who gets the girl every night, but has never kept one yet. At the bar, Jacob coaches Cal on how to get girls and tries to change his wardrobe in the process. Cal and Emily's children are deeply affected by the breakup of their parents, and each show their own emotions of it without resorting to overacting.<br/><br/>13-year-old Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is hit the hardest, and acts out more lustfully than his older sister, Hannah (the ubiquitous and reliable Emma Stone, a hot property of this generation and currently doing well this summer in ""The Help"" and other movies). Robbie has a secret crush on the alluring babysitter, Jessica, who takes a nude picture of herself and blackmails it to Cal. Hannah, an aspiring lawyer, already in love, has an affair with Jacob, who doesn't realize that she is Cal and Emily's daughter. Molly is underused, but like any other product of divorce, feels the pain of a broken family. Another surprise - Cal has a one-night-stand with Kate (Marisa Tomei, hilarious and heartbreaking, and shows her emotions the most externally), not realizing that she is Robbie's teacher, and gets angry when meeting with Cal and Emily, which adds fuel to the fire of the breakup.<br/><br/>All the secret affairs unfurl at the third act of the movie. All is restrained in comedy until the family reunion scene when everyone finds each other out. Naturally, happy endings occur. The only thing about this movie was the pacing was on the slow side at the beginning, but gets faster as the movie goes on until the third act. But thanks to a talented cast, Steve Carell, who some say is a ""junk actor,"" doesn't get to overplay the comedy loudly. He is quieter, and he shows that side very well. If you are expecting his shtick from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Get Smart,"" and ""Dinner With Schmucks,"" you will be pleasantly surprised when you see his most mature performance yet. He is playing against type and real actors, not comic virtuosos like Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell. It's not crazy, it's certainly not stupid, and you will fall in love."

"Queer-qatfm","Null","0","1","23 August 2011"," I'm breaking up with it because I think I can do better.
","I've been looking forward to Crazy, Stupid, Love for a couple of months now. While the TV Spots haven't been very good, the extended trailers seemed to promise a real visceral and gut busting romantic comedy that was full of heart and laughs. I've been yearning for a nice drama I could rally behind in the midst of the Summer Movie Experience but unfortunately that's not quite what I got here.<br/><br/>Steve Carell plays Cal, the sort of hub which all the other players revolve around. There's Julianne Moore who's divorcing him, Ryan Gosling who mentors him, Kevin Bacon who replaces him, Jonah Bobo who's his son and looks up to him (but is obviously not important enough to be included on the poster in spite of being about 1/3 of the movie's focus) and then there is Emma Stone who plays a role along side Ryan's character and more, but that'll be kept secret for spoiler concerns.<br/><br/>It's a stacked cast, to be sure. It's too bad that most of them aren't very funny. Carell tries his improvisational routine which often really only means he keeps repeating the same phrase over and over using different weird voices. It's clearly one of the only comedy tools he knows and was best used during the superior film 40 Year Old Virgin. The fact he's pared with Ryan Gosling makes little since, but what's even more shocking is just how much funnier Gosling ends up being in comparison. Even Emma Stone seems to miss her funny mark in this near disaster which eventually pulls out madcap hijinks when the whole time it's been more of a mental comedy. And then when it comes to the sincere moments none of the actors except for Julianne More really pull it off. I guess they all just wanted to do what they're known for and not really that well.<br/><br/>The whole thing is overloaded. There is bloated and disjointed plot everywhere. Too many characters who have too much that needs to be done so they can wrap it all up in a neat bow a number of times in the overextended denouncement. Kevin Bacon is a good example of this. There is no real good reason he's in this picture. His character could have been just referenced and left off camera since he adds nothing to the show. Simiarily, Marisa Tomei's crazed school teacher role seems like it belongs in another movie entirely. She provides such a jarring clash of misfit comedy that doesn't work here. And after those parts are cut, a general overall snippy snip snip would have helped tighten things up as well.<br/><br/>So really what we have here is a romantic comedy that is not nearly as romantic or funny enough. It's too long. It's too populated. And doesn't seem to know just how crazy or stupid or lovely it wants to be. To be honest, other than some nice scenes here and there (Ryan giving Steve a manly make over was in the trailer) the only real satisfying storyline is that of Hal's son and his crush on his babysitter. But even that gets a kind of disturbing conclusion."

Hard to see her character and forget you are looking at Julianne Moore. Marisa Tomei is great,""Cute and sexy"".<br/><br/>Like mic shots, when the sound boom shows, this movie had obvious writer shots. Why did she want a divorce? The only reason she was driving the car was so Steve Carell could jump out. One couple photo in the house to break, no family photos to spill the beans?<br/><br/>Why the boring too long talk scene in the school hallway except to set up the Marisa Tomei twist. How about have another couple walk out of the class to give the hallway wait credibility. The order of things at the graduation ceremony was convenient. The nude photos, in this day and age, would have been sex text and not printed as needed. Of course the parents didn't tear them up as they were used again late in the movie.<br/><br/>Don't sweat the details. There are plenty of chuckles and one hysterical scene that ties everything together. At nearly two hours, it's a tad long for a romantic comedy and you'll guess the resolution in the first five minutes. Don't think too much. Go with it and enjoy."

This is shown as a silly way of living when he finally meets a girl who ridicules his tactics. On the other hand, Cal has been in a marriage for 25 years and considers himself to have found his soul mate. But there seems to be no basis for why he should be together with his wife - they just reminisce and talk to fill the empty space. There are several scenes in the movie where the idea of a ""soul mate"" is made to sound incredibly silly. So if both these kinds of love are silly, where are we left to go?

It is very idealistic, a little over the top at the end, but I really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>This was definitely a comedy. It was really funny with lots of one liners to keep you laughing! It is also very romantic, you are striving for these couples to make it through. But it was very different from other romantic comedies. This is mainly because the story is told from the men's perspective. The men are the ones cheated on and damaged trying to pick up the pieces. This made the whole dynamic of the movie very different. It also was not happy-go-lucky through most of the movie. There was a lot of down-in-the-dumps moments, but yet again, somehow misery is hilarious!<br/><br/>My favorite part was the acting! Steve Carell perfectly portrays a 40- something man who's let himself go a bit. He hilariously shows this character that is downtrodden and the opposite of hip trying to turn his life around. His chemistry with Julianne Moore is questionable at times, but I think you are still fighting for these two throughout the movie. Ryan Gosling was also perfect as the confident, studly, womanizer who takes Carell's character under his wing. These two have great chemistry perfectly showing a man's perspective of relationship struggles. The casting of these two is great for a movie centered on the men! Emma Stone did a great job also. Her chemistry with Gosling was believable and romantic. This is a more mature role for her. She plays a mature woman about to begin her law career, much different than a high school hottie.<br/><br/>This movie, like many romantic comedies, was very idealistic! Everything is grand gestures and ends conveniently. But we have our own lives for depressing story lines, a little idealism won't hurt while we are at the movies. The ending is over the top. I do think it could have been wrapped up in a way that was a little more believable. I don't like to reveal too much, so that's about all I can say about that.<br/><br/>Overall, I had fun watching this movie. It was funny! It had some great acting and hilarious lines and moments. It is idealistic and doesn't have the best ending, but all this is forgivable. It claims to be the best comedy of the summer, which I don't think it quite achieves. There have been a lot of comedies this summer, and a couple really good ones. But I enjoyed it a lot!<br/><br/>Redbox/Netflix It!<br/><br/>For more reviews go to burningreview.blogspot.com"
