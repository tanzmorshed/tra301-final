"joey-ziemniak","7","141","157","11 October 2015"," 'Beasts of No Nation' has the best performance by a child actor that I've ever seen.
","Child actors are a dime a dozen, yet Abraham Attah is something else. He transcends the category and remains such a demanding presence throughout the entire film, matching even Idris Elba's poise. His character's transformation is just one of the remarkable feats of storytelling that Beasts of No Nation graces us. A gripping account of modern day war seen through a child's eyes, Beasts of No Nation is easily one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is how beautiful the film is. The stark landscapes of West Africa draw you in, and the color palette for the film is quite something. Director and cinematographer Cary Fukunaga makes sure you remember the reality of this not-so-fictional story, paralleling Agu's family life and how his world was flipped upside down when he joined a group of mercenary fighters. Initially, Agu has no choice and uses them as an escape and a way to reunite with his mother, but the ruthless commandant (Elba) changes him.<br/><br/>The writing is fantastic as you see the war through Agu's eyes, and it's not pretty. This kind of situation is almost completely unfamiliar for most audiences, and Fukunaga manages to supplement fear for grace. He never lets us forget the harsh realities of war, touching on familiar themes like family but going a step further by making it personal for Agu. As the film is his story through and through, the adult details of war are kept to a minimum. The audience is just like Agu, unaware of exactly why there is fighting but rolling with it because it's his only choice. There's no strategic battle scenes, no planning on a map or signing peace treaties, as we are thrust into moments just like Agu is.<br/><br/>When the violence does break out, it's brutal and harrowing. Young actor Attah is ferocious yet sympathetic, and he brings these battle sequences down to earth. The creative risks that Fukunaga takes with these sequences might come across as pandering, yet they make sense cinematically and come across as action poetry. There's a certain lyricism to the war torn villages and jungles of the continent, and it's beautiful and unforgettable.<br/><br/>There isn't much dialogue in the film, but when there is it's brilliant. The unnamed commandant's ideology becomes clearer as the film goes on, and it reaches a disturbing peak. Fukunaga contrasts him with the initially innocent Agu and the two are at odds yet retain respect for one another. There are times when Agu could simply point a gun at the commandant and be done with it, but there's a humanity to the film that respects all lives. War isn't pretty, and Beasts of No Nation knows that. Yet this risky piece of entertainment remembers to be a film first and everything else second. The result is a rhythmic work of art with one of the best young performances I've seen."
"bradencn","10","139","156","16 October 2015"," Raw and Real
","I was sceptical of watching this film at first. It looked like a low budget, and amateur attempt for Netflix to get bigger in their original film business. I went to IMDb to see what people had to say, noticed it got decent reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me say, this is one of the best films I have ever seen within this genre.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is about the general civil warfare that exists in Africa, something most western, shelterd Americans have never even fathomed and have only learned about through movies. The film doesn't specify what part of Africa it is, but you know it is something that is real.<br/><br/>Netflix doesn't hide anything about the realities of what happens to families, children, fathers, and brothers, as well as the numbness the war leaders (on both sides, really) have toward excessive and brutal violence. Imagine: the film shows all of this through the eyes of a boy, probably only 12 years old. He is forced into a mercenary squad after his family is torn apart, and he experiences something that is even darker than hell itself.<br/><br/>That young boy, played by Abraham Attah, puts on a performance I have never seen before in a child actor. Given the mature content of the film, it is quite unbelievable that the torn emotions any child would have, given this situation, is so clearly displayed and authentic. Every scene just tore at my soul; I wondered if it was really acting. And he wasn't the only one; women, children, and the ""extras"" in the film: are these people really doing their first major film? Each scene left me speechless.<br/><br/>The emotional involvement I had with this film as a viewer is astonishing. I felt ashamed at myself for thinking my life had problems, for thinking my life was hard. I felt foolish realizing my immaturity in life, and felt embarrassed for us as America in general, for caring so much about things so materialistic and shallow, when people in Africa (and other parts of the world, no doubt), are fighting for their lives every day, being torn apart by corrupt leaders and greed.<br/><br/>To compare this film, it is similar to The City of God and Blood Diamond, but in an of itself, it is certainly unique. It's a masterpiece."
"toby-brace","10","52","58","18 December 2015"," Rare event
","It's not often that a film induces a genuine change of heart in me, but this one did. I used to simply hate and despise the raggedy rebel armies of West Africa with their child soldiers, their cruel atrocities and apparent primitive mindless violence towards civilians in general. But this film showed me a side to them that I had never considered. I found myself feeling sorry for them, and the cynical way in which they were used. I realized that they must also have courage, and discipline, and belief in the cause. Like any fighters, they must advance into deadly danger. The lead actor is a child, yet more than holds his own with Idris Elba, a great actor by any measure. By the end I was shaken. I will not forget this film. And I will never think the same way again about the tragic and pointless wars of Africa."
"themadmovieman","8","68","80","16 October 2015"," A harrowing but fascinating story, and one of the best war films of the century
","This is quite simply one of the best war films of the 21st Century. Netflix's first outing on the big screen is a huge success thanks to an absolutely harrowing tale of conflict that makes for one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking movie experiences you've had in a long time.<br/><br/>The story follows this young boy, Agu, as he becomes deeper and deeper involved in the rebel army under the wing of the Commandant, played by Idris Elba. Both of these performances are simply excellent. Elba is often terrifying as the warmongering troop leader, and his unnerving performance is key to making this such an unsettling and disturbing film.<br/><br/>However, even Idris Elba is outshone by the stunning performance given by the young Abraham Attah, who plays Agu. Attah does a brilliant job at showing his character's transformation over the course of the story, from an innocent young boy to a hardened warrior in one of the most brutal wars on the planet.<br/><br/>This ties in perfectly, then, with the main theme of the film, which is all about the way that war destroys innocence entirely and replaces it with only doom and despair. In that, you can see that this is clearly an anti-war film, but it fortunately doesn't present itself so much as that, only giving you its powerful message if you concentrate hard enough and look for the details telling you about the destruction that war has brought to this place.<br/><br/>I say that because this film is, on the whole, not the most fast- paced, and if you watch it with your brain turned off, you'll likely be bored, because it's quite long, and hasn't got much action at all, it's the power and emotion of the underlying themes that provides the horrifying punch that makes this so compelling and upsetting.<br/><br/>Cary Joji Fukunaga's directing is also stunning. As well as making a simply beautiful film to look at, the way he directs every scene works brilliantly in tandem with whatever the film is trying to say. There are so many astonishing long shots of individuals' faces, particularly focused on Agu, and they just have such an incredible emotional power when you really look deep into their situation.<br/><br/>Abraham Attah's performance as a young boy who has clearly been through hell is of course integral to making that emotion clear, but the inventive and beautiful directing really aggrandises that feeling of total despair and loss of innocence, which is why this film is just such an incredible one to watch."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","74","89","15 October 2015"," To be remembered as one of the better war films of the decade.
","Originally known for his first two films Sin Nombre and Jane Eyre, Cary Fukunaga was put on the map for most by his audacious work on the first season of HBO's True Detective last year, unconventionally directing every episode. He got all-time worthy performances from Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey and boasted a palpable bleak mood from his photography, earning an Emmy for the episode ""Who Goes There"" with that captivating long take. He could do whatever he wanted after that, and so, tip toeing past comfortable studio gigs that may or may not have landed on his desk, he ventured out to the African jungles with Idris Elba for the most stressful shoot since Apocalypse Now. Catching malaria, filling in for an injured camera operator, and constantly rewriting the script due to the actors dropping out, the haphazard conditions shows on the film for better and for worse.<br/><br/>Coppola's film is an apt point of comparison for the effect of Beasts of No Nation, as well as Platoon and The Thin Red Line. Battered by explosions and gunfire, you come out of the film wearing the same thousand yard stare as its characters. At that point, it's easy to forget the delights of the first ten minutes as Abraham Attah's Agu playfully hustles his living, selling shells of television sets with his friends. It's not a perfect life, but the energy is reminiscent of the less dangerous sections of City of God. It's only from that light that the darkness hits hardest and invests you in Agu's plight and losses. However, this is as rocky as the roller-coaster gets. The next 2 hours is an absorbing barrage of misery and brutal dilemmas. The narrative thread is very loose, and perhaps some is lost in translation with the character's thick accents, but this is part of its point, especially in utilising child soldiers who won't know the ins and outs of what's going on anyway.<br/><br/>This aimlessness of the mission and the way that the war is so much bigger than the soldiers and battalions demonstrates that there is no way into peace from war. The kids are fighting for a future that they won't be able to find solace in, neither from eventual living and economical conditions, nor inner peace from the atrocities they've committed. These bleak ideas hit hard. And like Malick's The Thin Red Line, a relationship with God in war is challenged. It's questioned whether it's possible or fair to have spiritual happiness after such sins. There is very poor foresight in war, and after only briefly touching a jarring scene where they visit the higher ups, it benefits no-one on the battleground. The film never preaches these messages, instead relying on the fact that we know how heartbreakingly true it is despite how far removed most of us will be.<br/><br/>Abraham Attah absolutely disappears into his role. He's not showy, but just completely immersed in the film whether he's soaking in events or lashing out against them. He's easily the biggest discovery here. However, I expected great things from Elba after the hype and while he is good, it wasn't the tour de force performance I anticipated. That's just not how the character ended up being written. He has memorable moments but he teeters undefinably on the line between a manipulative villain and a manipulative mentor. He's no doubt an opportunist, but the film doesn't explore his character to the full extent, and the most dramatic moments are quite familiar as they're staples in other war films. Beasts stands out by having such a young boy other end of those dilemmas. Elba is perhaps too polished to go with the inherent rawness of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Fukunaga's cinematography is quite good, not boasting the same tricks as True Detective, but also clearly battling against the elements. It certainly has atmosphere. The style favours ambient music over montages of the war scenes and while that makes it flow together it also means that its surprises fall by the periphery. I can imagine that this will play well on Netflix, granted you give it full attention on a big HD television. The cinema projection does suffer from added graininess but that is rarely a problem via the internet and should compliment Fukunaga's cinematography a little more. I imagine that it will garner a divided reaction, with some finding it too hard to bare through the whole thing, but I can't imagine it getting much Oscar traction based on passion alone. It will be a pleasant and worthy surprise if it does score any nominations. At least an admirable effort that will be being remembered as one of the most notable war films of this decade.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)"

"ferguson-6","8","37","45","15 October 2015"," Not like a baby, like an old man
","Greetings again from the darkness. Cary Joji Fukunaga has quickly established himself as an expert storyteller with his previous writing and directing of SIN NOMBRE (2009), JANE EYRE (2011) and the fascinating and conversation-sparking first season of ""True Detective"" (he did not direct the much-maligned Season Two). He goes even deeper and darker this time by adapting Uzodinma Iweala's novel about a child soldier.<br/><br/>When first we meet Agu, he is but an enterprising and fun-loving kid who thrives on mischief such as trying to sell ""Imagination TV"" – the empty shell of a console TV, complete with Agu and his buddies acting out scenes for those who peer through the picture tube opening. Agu describes himself as ""a good boy from a good family"", and we believe him.<br/><br/>Somewhere in Africa is all we know about the location, and soon enough Agu's village is under siege and he is separated from his mother, and forced to stay behind with the men – including his father and big brother. More terror forces Agu alone into the forest until he is brought into a mostly young group of rebel forces led by the Commandant (Idris Elba). It's around this time that Agu begins ""talking"" to God through voice over narration that allows viewers to understand what's going on inside Agu's head – often quite contrary to what is happening on the outside as he transforms from mischievous kid to dead-eyed child soldier. When Agu stops speaking to God, we understand that he believes he no longer deserves to be heard, but his words to the universe (directed to his mother) let us know, this boy has not yet lost his soul.<br/><br/>Though we never understand the war, or even who is fighting whom, this uncertainty is designed to help us better relate to Agu. He may be a tough-minded soldier, but we also never forget that he is mostly a little boy hoping to re-connect with his mother. Idris Elba plays the Commandant as part father-figure, part war lord, and part cult leader. He is a menacing presence one moment and a soothing voice of reason the next. When we (and Agu) learn the full story of his multiple sides, we are both sickened and disheartened. It's the performances of both Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah (as Agu) that make this such a devastating and fascinating movie to watch, and it's the filmmaking of Fukunaga that keeps our eyes glued to the screen when we would just as soon turn away."
"label1177","10","38","52","16 October 2015"," A story to take with you
","Compelling with beautiful shots and music. Watched on Netflix where other options and distractions are a abundant, but I did not put this down. It is quite the untold story about such a huge political and inhumane problem within Africa today. Casting was great, very memorable faces. I would say this is what American Sniper should have been like. The changes in characters was gradual and smooth, PTSD and other issues were presented much better. Eye opening in a way old stories used to be. This was much more than entertainment, but more of a virtual experience like Saving Private Ryan was. Quite gritty as well, which doesn't bother me, but for those that are sensitive this will be a hard watch."

","This is one of the best films of the year! Cary Fukunaga swings and hits the ball out of the park and the ball hit a windshield! A film with so much savagery that it also makes you feel for this boy and what he is going through! A must see and one of the many reasons to go and get a Netflix account! Idris Elba gives the best performance of his life as the Commandment! Abraham Attah is amazing and has one of the best child actor performances ever! It is as good as True Detective and one of Netflix's best pieces of entertainment! Hopefully those Adam Sandler movies don't ruin their perfect line up(which it probably will)."
"mpolans","10","11","13","20 March 2016"," Call the Cops, This Movie Was Robbed...
","The fact that Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah, and Idris Elba weren't even *nominated* for Oscars is criminal. This was a moving story that shines a light on the sort of things going on with child soldiers in Africa. While set in an unnamed fictional African country with fictional characters, it clearly draws inspiration from the fighting in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In fact, at one point, Commandant call a soldier ""SBU,"" possibly a reference to the ""Small Boys Unit,"" a child soldier unit of the Revolutionary United Front militants who fought in Sierra Leone. Commandant also has similarities to Joseph Kony of the Lord's Resistance Army.<br/><br/>While Idris Elba is the big name and was extremely convincing as Commandant, it's Abraham Attah as Agu who stole the show. Attah's strong and nuanced performance, particularly in light of the emotionally difficult material, was mesmerizing. Hopefully we'll see a lot more of him in the future.<br/><br/>To the Academy, shame on you for overlooking this movie and its performers, particularly Attah and Elba!"
"KobeCryant","8","25","34","16 October 2015"," Overall Good
","From the beginning I had high hopes for this movie and it lived up to my expectations. From beginning to end The Child goes through his stages as he is more exposed to violence. He was at first a very innocent kid scared to be apart of the fight but when circumstances force him to join the violence he has only one choice. The children acting in this movie are amazing, it is one of the best movies where a child grabs your attention. The director did a great job on here. And can't Forget Idris Elba, not an outstanding performance but still great. Idris's character also goes through his stages on this one too just like the kid. The Scenery was beautiful and it wasn't really nothing special but it's hard for me these days to come across a movie that I can rate over a 7 and this one is a 8 in my book. With this one Netflix proves that their originals are one of the best nowadays."
"swilliky","9","11","14","25 October 2015"," One of the best films of 2015
","I guess it's time to start talking about awards season with this new amazing film Beasts of No Nation directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga starring Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah, the powerful child lead. <br/><br/>Though I am glad Netflix is entering the arena of producing major motion pictures, I wish there was a theater near me that was brave enough to show this film because this movie deserves viewing on a large screen. As it was on Netflix, I often paused it and did other things before coming back to it because life is busy, not because this film ever lost my interest. The Revenant is going to have to be one amazing film to compete with this masterpiece.<br/><br/>This story needs to be told and I applaud Netflix for taking this brave step, not only in cinema distribution but in the topic at hand. Abraham Attah plays the young boy Agu and almost immediately reveals himself to be a talented, charismatic young actor. I am curious to see the behind-the-scenes to see how he handled such complicated shots and intense sets. I've heard some amazing stories about the filming but that the film fell heavily on this young man's shoulders and he pulled it off so well is really a credit to everyone involved and should signal a bright future for Mr. Attah as actor if that is his pursuit. His voice-over pleas to God throughout are chilling.<br/><br/>Idris Elba delivered another powerful performance, something we've all come to expect and possibly take for granted. At this point, it's his supporting actor award to lose and I'm not sure what other performance has generated as near enough buzz to compete. Surely not Seth Rogen but I should catch Steve Jobs later this week so we'll see. As the Commandanat, Mr. Elba has the opportunity for powerful speeches and intensely personal scenes and he plays them all like a true professional. I am rooting for him to go all the way with this one.<br/><br/>As for the plot, this movie is so harsh and unrelenting and Fukunaga's camera style captures every detail with his signature tracking shots and tragically powerful images that give you no place to hide from the violence that plays out on screen. This was a great follow up choice to True Detective for this director. <br/><br/>I don't know what the reception will be for this film over time as it has taken such an unorthodox way to be distributed but I do believe this is the future of cinema and theaters will have to adjust. It is really telling that such a powerful film serves as the pioneer for the popular streaming service. I hope it does receive the recognition and accolades it deserves."

"charleswjoke","6","14","21","30 October 2015"," An interesting movie
","The problem about a film on a child soldier in Africa is that child actors are hard to direct and are usually not good actors. That cannot be said for Abraham Attah who embodies his character and makes us feel all his pain as the movie progresses. The first part of the movie where everything is good is all the more heartbreaking when everyone gets shot down. We slowly see how a child's mentality can be twisted and controlled by a charismatic but ultimately shallow Idris Elba who as always kills it in his role. The action sequences remind me who directed the movie as the controlled chaos is very Fukunaga and he excels at those scenes. They all have emotional motive and impact and are very realistic. The problem that the movie has are too many minor plots and minor characters take too much screen time. The commander's second and command and Agu's foil/ friend are well utilized but extend the movies long screen time. The ending was a bit of a letdown as Agu and the army leaves the commander in the jungle without any real payoff."

"t-viktor212","9","3","3","26 August 2018"," A must-see Netflix Original
","Beasts of No Nation is an essential film to see: the first Netflix Original ever produced is also a very good film about modern african warfare, and the ultimate film about children soldiers. <br/><br/>Beasts is a very hard pill to swallow. It isn't particularly gory (The Last King of Scotland, for example, is way harder to watch in terms of gore), but much of the violence that can be seen is utterly crude, especially because it is often performed by brainwashed children. It is definitely a very hard R, mainly due to its theme.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Beast doesn't focus much on battle scenes. There are a few, but not very long or massive, mostly guerrilla-style battles. The focus is on the development of the main character, Agu, rather than on action scenes of sort. <br/><br/>I assume the role of Agu wasn't a particularly hard one, but the child-actor playing the character gave him much gravitas, especially in some of the final scenes. Idris Elba also performed with intensity as the Comandant of the Battalion. <br/><br/>I loved Season one of True Detective, and Fukunaga again orchestrated wonderfully quite a set of single-take scenes here aswell (though not as long as the famous one from the tv show). Photography sometimes brought eccellent imagery to look at.<br/><br/>While the final 15 minutes or so didn't completely feel conclusive, I would say that, as of the date of this review (August 2018), Beasts is perhaps the best Netflix Original film so far released. The only other film that might compete for the title is Hell or High Water. <br/><br/>Following this first release, there have been very few outstanding Netflix films (to list some good ones: Hell or High Water, Mudbound, Annihilation, The Meyerowitz Stories) and tons of very bad releases (Spectral, Death Note, Mute, The Cloverfield Paradox and so on). Let's hope that the 2018 fall season brings many such good Netflix Original films as Beasts of no Nation."

Beast of No Nation is quite the untold story about such a huge political and inhumane problem within the African nation. Beast of no Nation painted vivid shots of what life was like for these child soldiers, so it can be a little hard to watch. I consider this movie to be an eye opener to African's culture.

The movie follows all of the struggles and horrors that the boy, Agu, goes through, and his mission to get revenge for his father and brother, and get back to his mother and sister. The movie goes through all aspects of being a soldier, like the cruel commandant and the killings that a kid has to do. The movie is very sad and emotional and is a very good movie for learning about what happens in some African countries, and the brutality that happens there. <br/><br/>The movie is not based on real events that happened, but it is a fictional story based on real life accounts of the civil wars across Africa. Since it is fictional, the filmmakers took a few artistic liberties with the film. One of these things is the fact that Agu sold a TV to a soldier in the beginning of the film, and he found the same soldier some time later in the film. Also, the commandant disobeyed his orders and left the supreme commander, which caused them to run out of supplies and eventually surrender. This mostly did not happen in reality, and they likely would have stayed together with the rest of the army. This probably happened to advance the plot, and add another internal story line. <br/><br/>The theme of family was very prominent in this movie. Agu being separated from his family and trying to get back to his mother, the entire squadron being one big family, and even the brotherhood between Agu and Strika all show how family is very important in the movie. God and Christianity is also very important. Agu is always speaking to God, and the soldiers all pray to God when someone dies. God is a very prominent figure especially to Agu, and he feels bad about all of the sin he commits, and eventually even feels that he can't speak to God because of all the wrongs he has done. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was very interesting and well-made. It keeps the viewer watching and builds so much emotion that it seems impossible that this kind of thing could even be happening somewhere in the world."

","Beasts of No Nation is a Netflix original movie about Child slavery and its role during an African civil war. It is not known in which African country this movie takes place in but the idea was to show that situations like this movie happen in virtually every African country. The film takes us through the life of an African village boy named Agu (Abraham Attah). He is just a normal African boy in a buffer zone at first. What seem to be African rebels come through the village and start to kill anything that moves. Agu witnesses his father and big brother get assassinated by these rebels but he manages to escape. He then gets captured by the rebel group that he would end up joining. The Commandant brings Agu under his wing along with the other ruthless savages and he slowly becomes a rebel, like the ones that killed Agu's brother and father. Agu basically gets brainwashed into something he hated aka African Rebels. Overall, this movie does a fantastic job showing how child slavery really can effect a Civil War. It does a great job showing the psychological brainwash of making a child soldier as well. Abraham Attah aka the actor that plays Agu did an exceptional job as his role as the little African boy. Personally one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The film itself surprised me. I thought this movie was gonna be maybe a little boring but, it was the opposite. I really enjoyed it. The picture was phenomenal. The acting was pretty good as well, headlined by Abraham Attah's portrayal of the fictional Agu. If i had to rate this movie I would give it 8 or 8 and a half stars out of 10."

","Agu is a young boy in an unnamed African nation in the midst of a civil war. There are no services or school for him and his young friends. His father is a local leader. He lives in a buffer zone protected by Nigerian peacekeepers until the peace collapses. Government forces massacre the local population. Agu escapes as his father and brother are killed. He is captured by a rebel force led by Commandant (Idris Elba) who grooms him to be a child soldier.<br/><br/>This is a methodical depiction of the brutalization of a childhood. Idris Elba has a commanding powerful presence. The kid is an appealing performer. That's why his corruption is so demoralizing. It's a harsh, heart-breaking movie. It's a Netflix movie that is cinematic in quality. The plot is pretty simple and the kid's journey is relatively straight forward. Fukunaga delivers an unflinching look into this slice of the world."

","I've always wondered how the process of filming THIS type of movies is organized, because, you know, for actors from the so called first and second worlds it might be very difficult to imagine how they should act, what exactly should they do to make the audience believe in their characters. Probably it's even harder to do when you are acting together with kids. Beasts of No Nation actually made me BELIEVE in horror, in disgust, in monsters among us and so far away at the same time.<br/><br/>I definitely liked this movie. Idris Elba in the unusual (for me) role of a despicable, dangerous character – was really good. He's like Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, but in Africa, and probably worse...<br/><br/>Abraham Attah (the leading role) maybe is not quite a charismatic talented professional actor yet, but I'm not in the habit of criticizing too much our younger generation. I truly believe he did everything possible and at times it was amazing!<br/><br/>Watch this movie, it's worth it.<br/><br/>Think afterward... if necessary."

","I kept putting this film off when I would see it listed on Netflix. I am not sure why, because it was very enjoyable. I won't claim to have very much knowledge in the area of African civil war, but the movie seemed to convey the story in a way that was understandable for me. The relationship between all the characters was full of an unsettling comradery, which for me definitely made the movie. It was well filmed, well directed, and well acted overall. The only negatives, and they aren't even that negative, are that in some parts I had an issue understanding the accent and had to rewind, not that often mind you. The second was I felt it could have been just a little more dark in regards to the culture of the rebels, I have seen some documentaries on the subject, and those people are/were ruthless. They did touch on some of the things, drug use, cannibalism, etc. So it was gritty, but I prefer super gritty, maybe just me though. Therefore it gets a 7/10 check it out."

","This movie is about child soldiers in an un-named African country, and it manages to show both the horrors of (civil) war and the beauty of Africa at the same time. Its biggest achievement is convincingly showing the human side of kids who end up doing horrible things in war. Despite seeing them being brutally violent, you are also able to recognize them as victims.<br/><br/>The performances from everyone involved are fantastic. A lot is said by the expressions of these kids, and it's not hard to believe that the movie cast people who had been involved in a civil war like this. Idris Elba does a great job playing a terrifying character, that could easily have been overplayed by a lesser actor.<br/><br/>I also very much liked how the movie doesn't really have a character that serves as a moral compass. Abraham Attah's character is obviously not happy with everything, but one of the points of the movie is that these kids don't initially choose this life, but rather end up in it due to circumstance."

Once Agu is taken under the wings of the villain, the sequences tend to repeat & what follows also, doesn't turn out to be gut-wrenching. Fukunaga's Writing needed to be more harrowing. His Direction, however, is realistic to the core. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Idris Elba as Commandant, is terrifying. This is a performance that Elba can boast for a long, long time. He creates a human in the monster he portrays & that's a really big achievement. Abraham Attah as Agu, is tremendous.

The film does not shy away from depicting the sickening barbarism of war, and the aimless cycles of revenge that keeps it going. Viewers should be warned when watching this film. What blew my mind the most about this film was the speech made by the African warlord toward the end of the film as his soldiers are abandoning him. I have *absolutely no sympathies* for this character, but I feel his speech hit it on the head not only for veterans of this historical fiction conflict, but for US Veterans as well (minus the war crimes). In my opinion, I feel that the US has some of the absolute poorest attitudes towards its veterans when compared with many nations in the world. What you see in the US is absolute insincere, shallow, fakery in terms of its public 'support' for veterans (my opinion). Also, the speech made the by main character, a child soldier, during his therapy after he surrendered, could not have said it ANY better for US Veterans....COMPLETELY different circumstances between the wars of US Veterans and the rebels depicted in this movie, yet the final realities for both veteran groups are depicted in similar and disturbingly accurate ways.

But it's extremely well made, with excellent performances from child actor Abraham Attah and Idris Elba, as the child protagonist and the leader who recruits him, respectively. This young child experiences a multitude of things, any one of which would permanently scar virtually anyone. And the film doesn't offer a contrived happy-ish ending to reward us for sitting through the suffering, which is one of the things I most appreciated about it. Because let's be honest; is there even a remote chance that stories like the one told here could end happily?<br/><br/>In this year of bickering about the whiteness of the Oscars, this film and its lack of nominations being held up repeatedly as an example, I can at least feel like I did my part -- you don't get much further away from white Hollywood and the stories it likes to tell than this film.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","The problem with Beasts Of No Nation is a problem familiar with all depictions of Africa - the absence of any kind of context.<br/><br/>Things happen for no reason, allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with previous propaganda, making the viewer believe that their previous misconceptions have now been confirmed.<br/><br/>Beasts Of No Nation was made by Cary Joji Fukunaga, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow. The Rockefellers own among the world's largest extractive industry corporations owners/founders - ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, United Fruit/Chiquita, and many more. A similar family started Royal Dutch Shell, which exploits the people of Nigeria for their oil.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the decontextualization - this story is set 'in a fictional African country', however the writer of the book is a Nigerian national. If the Idris Alba character would have been working for someone, it would have been Shell, maybe Anglo-Ashanti Gold, or his direct superiors would have been working on their behalf.<br/><br/>This is lost in the war porn, as it always is. Because Beasts Of No Nation is just one in a long line of 'mood setting' rather than informative movies about Africa, all of which are funded by the same extractive industry corporations and the families that own them.<br/><br/>Blood Diamonds was made on behalf of the Kimberley Process, which tried to restrict diamond exports from Zimbabwe and the Congo DRC. It was driven by Nicky Oppenheimer of Anglo-American De Beers, the world's diamond monopolist in the 20th century, and even today the world's biggest diamond miner with 40% of global diamonds mined and traded.<br/><br/>The Interpreter, with Nicole Kidman, another movie 'set in a fictional African country', however clearly based on Zimbabwe, where De Beers covets the huge Chiadzwa and Marange diamond fields, which could supply 20% of the world's diamond supply and crash the world's diamond price. Mugabe And The White African is in a similar vein, trying to demonize the government of Zimbabwe, while extolling the virtues of Rhodesia.<br/><br/>Then of course there was the propaganda of Eve Ensler, trying to hyper-focus the destruction of Eastern DRC by the Rwandan government's M-23, into 'the Vagina Monologues'. Again, leaving the actual culprits out of the picture, and focusing on mercenaries/soldiers and war porn instead.<br/><br/>De Beers lost 117,000 hectares of land in the land redistribution of 2000, and they want it back. And if that means portraying Africans as psychotic 'Beasts Of No Nation', well that's what they've been doing for over 100 years."
"lewilewis1997","9","9","15","18 October 2015"," Woh!......I Wasn't Expecting This...(breathless) BRAVO!
","I am stunned, turmoiled, and loving film again. Ever experienced a film so captivating that all becomes deathly still and silent and no one dares to move? Bladders agonisingly clenched, popcorn unmolested, lovers ignored? I've seen it twice before; Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Meet #3. To think I nearly ducked out of this in favour of a computer game?!<br/><br/>This film opened my eyes in a way a thousand news reports could never do. I'm still reeling from the raw, unapologetic story told to me through the eyes of the heartbroken protagonist, Agu (Abraham Attah). I felt his pain. What an accolade for a child actor,'I felt your pain'? This kid has a naturalness rarely seen in even the most seasoned of performers. Just recounting it a few hours later is bringing an aching lump to my throat. A brave and accomplished film. And now I know of the hardships and difficulties experienced in the making of it my hat comes off and I bow to a master; Screen Writer & Director Mr. Fukunaga. I hope the years to come recognise this as a true work of the story teller's art. The original novel's author, Uzodinma Iweala, must be proud and gratified that his message is now out there? He's written a fable of real worth and power that has been thoughtfully rendered. The respect I have for Mr.Fukunaga has grown massively. I've just read that some of the cast were a nightmare that forced constant rewrites by having tantrums, getting wasted or disappearing half way through the scene or shoot; and that locations could be 'chaotic'on a good day. <br/><br/>To get through this film is tough, many will cry, I did. Most will be shocked. If not they could be the 1% that are psychopaths, call 999, NOW! <br/><br/>I met Agu's family and loved them. I wanted to invite myself 'round and join in the fun. Their decency and values shine through in a relaxed, un-schmaltzy way despite recent hardships. A distant civil war that can't quite be ignored is perfectly captured in little snapshots of daily life that bring a knowing smile and a chuckle. They're in The Buffer Zone, they're protected by the UN troops based right outside, they're safe...<br/><br/>The manic free-fall into chaos and bloodshed is immediate, brutal and frightening. Just as it would have been for Agu and his family. Plans and best intentions are destroyed; random evil and bad luck are the only constant. Imagine being a child of about ten finding yourself bound and kneeling with a few surviving neighbours? You're about to be executed? You're so scared you can't breathe from panic? Those that protected you are dead or about to be murdered with you. All within an hour of life being good; you laughed with impish glee moments ago, peeing on your older brother's head from the roof. This is where Agu's descent into hell starts. Every bit of decency and respect instilled by a strong family and their love aren't just eroded. They're smashed, trampled, gutted, spat on and ground into the mud with a rifle butt and sadistic grin. <br/><br/>For some reason he's spared death. He wanders the forest, alone and starving, eating leaves and poisonous roots, he IS going to die, and soon. Rescue arrives with the foulest of deals. The very same evil that inflicted this suffering and stole his family finds him, and it's recruiting. <br/><br/>An abused, toughened, obedient and brainwashed Agu is let loose on the world. His family is now 'The Battalion'. His brothers are skilled butchers in a planned campaign that becomes one of attrition and terror. They're well trained and willing killers, all of them. Each dragging the others further down into a seething pit of rape and summary murder. Rewarded, cajoled and abused by their new father 'The Commandant' (Idris Elba) in equal measure. Idris' own unraveling and end is left wide open but we can guess his fate was probably quite karmic. I hated him. Again this is testimony to the skill of the performances and Mr. Fukunaga's direction. Some of the jungle shots echo Terrence Mallick's close up's of the pure, innocent wildlife in The Thin Red Line. Natural tranquility filled with exotic birdsong and mating calls, life is happily thriving....and about to be torn to shreds and silenced forever by the horsemen of the apocalypse at full gallop and backed up by artillery. <br/><br/>Are we left with any hope at the end? Maybe. But for Agu all hope has been lost, along with his once sensitive and happy soul. The cold unblinking eyes of a predatory shark stare out from a small boy and size up an orphanage's counselor. She gently digs but he doesn't hurry to speak, the counselor calmly questions but gets no answers, just silence..........all the while the spoken narrative in Agu's head is scathing and dismissive (Not verbatim, just the essence)""You have no idea about what I've done, how could you,stupid b1tch ? I could rape and kill you"". Then more silence....... <br/><br/>""....I saw terrible things, I did terrible things....I am some sort of beast and a Devil, I am all of these things....but I also had a mother, father, brothers and sisters......once.....they loved me........"". BOOM! I cried like a baby.<br/><br/>After seeing this milestone I read some reviews. Most loved it, however some were so scorning I wondered whether they'd actually seen the same film? Ignore the snobs and Academy. This is a must watch film, I promise....<br/><br/>Feb 2016; As expected, the Hollywood 'Empire' ignored this, so no Academy back scratching. Other 'big' awards tip the slightest of nods with 'best supporting actor' nominations for Idris Elba. I think they're too dismissive of internet companies like Netflix creating good independent TV and Film. They can't control it so ignore it and hope it'll go away.'Empires' decline and die by ignoring the new competition."

","A film about political and civil unrest in Africa (the specific country is never named) and as heartbreaking and terrifying as you'd imagine. Wonderfully made, the camera work puts you right in the centre alongside these people having their already tough worlds torn apart. It's not easy to watch, the depiction of callous disregard for life, especially seen through the eyes of a child is often too much to bare. As if that's not harrowing enough, what follows is beyond horrific. Incessant killing, exploitation of children, power hungry people with complete disregard for life and any moral standard. In all the confusion it's not always obvious who the real monsters are. As the film goes on though, is seems everyone is and as things escalate, it's hard to except that despite this being dramatised, it's no doubt based on a sad harsh reality. Elba is frighteningly good, so much so, you wonder if you were able to reach into that world, would you kill him and become a monster too. Abraham Attah, who plays Agu, the child who leads us through this brutal world is amazing. This is his first outing and it's quite incredible, I've no doubt he'll go on to even greater things (although he's signed up for a Spider-Man film). The music is the only true positive element of the film itself, be it the traditional stuff or the ethereal score, it's outstanding, but never masks the turmoil of the characters and their existence."
"TheDonaldofDoom","8","2","2","27 October 2017"," An endless cycle of violence
","I've always wondered what it is about Africa that makes it the most unstable continent on Earth. So much poverty, so much fighting. Beasts of no Nation shows why, through the eyes of a child soldier. It starts charmingly, with poor but happy children acting their age. But fast enough, Agu's world is torn apart as his family is killed or escapes to be never seen again. He is then manipulated to be a child soldier to, as he sees it, revenge those who killed his family. And at first, it looks like these are the good guys. But what this film is great at showing is that there are NO good guys. The first scene that causes us to question how different Agu's group really are is a scene in which Agu is persuaded to execute a captured enemy soldier. His acting is phenomenal here and you can tell that he will never be a child again. Then another shocker comes when the NPD, the rebel group Agu is fighting for, mercilessly and indiscriminately kills innocent villagers just like Agu's relatives. In a powerful moment he realises a woman they want to rape could easily be his mother. Yet these are all slaughtered for the crime of being at the wrong place. What makes this film even more heartbreaking is how beautiful the scenery is. The cinematography really captures this. How could something so evil happen somewhere do beautiful? The only gripe I have is with the ending. It's optimistic, which makes you feel hopeful for Agu but that doesn't mean it was the right way to go. In a more realistic scenario he would have ended up becoming a soldier like all the others, brutally murdering and raping villagers. There could have been a flash forward to an adult Agu doing this. Instead the makers chose the safer way out and had Agu rescued by the UN.<br/><br/>Beasts of no Nation is a must-see. It makes you understand the never-ending cycle of violence happening in Africa in a distressing way, through the eyes of someone who has seen things he should never have seen and done things no child his age should ever have had to do."

","I watched this on Netflix (where it exclusively available). It's the story of a child soldier fighting a civil war in an unnamed African country (filmed in Ghana). It's terrific. It features two wonderful performances. One from Idris Elba, as the commander of the boy soldiers, transforming them from children to killers; he's terrifyingly charismatic, and really makes you believe the relationship between him and his chargers. The second is from Abraham Attah as the boy at the heart of it all, taking us on a mesmeric and heartbreaking journey. <br/><br/>Horrifying as it is, we are spared many of the real horrors of war whilst still letting us feel the impact of the atrocities on both victims and perpetrators. The cinematography brings the colours of the bush to life, the dust almost seeping under your fingernails as you watch; the music is beautiful and, along with the almost at times poetic script, this both offsets and points up the horror of events portrayed. It's a brilliant and urgent film, without a white saviour in sight, which Netflix (who put up the money for the production when it was threatened with going under) are to be commended for taking a risk on it. <br/><br/>The reasons for it being overlooked in awards is obvious and twofold - endemic racism in the film industry and fear of the future as a streaming service trumps the film's very limited cinema release. If you have Netflix, search it out; if you don't, it's one of many good reasons to fork out for a subscription."
"msantos1116","8","2","2","8 May 2017"," This is a story of loss and rebirth (SPOILERS)
","The movie starts out following a typical middle-class family living in a small village in what appears to be West Africa. The movie then expands the context and shows us that the town is in the middle of a battle between the corrupt and violent United Nations backed government forces and the ragged pack of rebel fighters. <br/><br/>As the peaceful townspeople decide to ship away women and children to allow the men to stay back and fight, there is no room for some of the younger boys, so they are also to stay behind. Agu, the film's protagonist, ends up witnessing the United Nations backed government forces senselessly execute all of his family members that remained in the village. Fortunately, Agu is able to flee these mentally disturbed, deranged, blood-thirsty, war mongering United Nations backed government forces as he runs deep into the bush.<br/><br/>Now orphaned, Agu is on his own in the wild. It appears that he will have no chance of survival, as he can not even light himself a fire and is not sure of what he can eat. Fortunately, the story's hero, known as the ""Commandant"" (played by Idris Elba), has managed to save many other UN backed government created orphans. Commandant's crew of orphaned boys stumbles upon helpless little Agu. Much of the movie is related to how Commandant takes little Agu under his wing, teaches him survival, feeds him, clothes him, and allows him to exact his revenge on the evil UN backed government forces. <br/><br/>Commandant is shown to be leading a pack of what appears to be 20 to 30 other boys and young adults, all presumably orphaned similarly to Agu and all with a thirst for revenge on those that murdered their families. Throughout the film, Commandant is first shown as a heroic warrior, then a wise leader, and then devolves into an ordinary human being. Although he is a true leader, he also answers to an authority. When he finds out that his authority cares more about political aspirations than providing justice, he tries to oust Commandant from his post. Commandant then goes rogue and takes his orphaned boy tribe with him. It is somewhat similar to Colonel Kurtz's situation in ""Apocalypse Now"", with the exception that Commandant does not really have a clue on how to lead a group of rogue dissidents.<br/><br/>Ultimately, his orphans desert him due to lack of food, water, and hope. Commandant's demise can be attributed to the corrupt nature of war and the western world's political influences. Deep down, he was shown to be a genuinely good man, fighting for justice, all while being a protector and guardian of many orphaned children.<br/><br/>Many will see this movie from a different perspective. One of the themes of the movie, which is something that plays out every day in real life, is that the subtle authoritarian rule of western governments is both the cause and solution to many of life's problems. First, they were directly responsible for the bloody and senseless murder of the families of many of these children. Secondly, as we see toward the end of the movie, these children are placed in a government-run school to learn and survive. Government creates the problems and then attempts to fix them. However, they did achieve their main goal. The villages they needed to eradicate are now gone, with all remaining residents under the guardianship of the state.<br/><br/>This movie is a great example of how innocent lives are taken, families are destroyed, and entire communities are eliminated due to the military involvement of western societies. There is no doubt that this story is being played out for real in the Middle East and all over Africa due to both the United States' and many European countries' perpetual foreign intervention campaigns."
"rbartoli-20842","9","2","2","20 March 2017"," Agu the Child Soldier
","The Netflix movie, Beast of No Nation, directed by Cary Fukunaga, is about a young West African boy named Agu. The specific setting is unknown, but it is somewhere in Africa. Agu lives in a village that is protected by Nigerian soldiers. Since it is a buffer zone, many things are run down, so there is no schooling. The families inside are suppose to be safe, however the village gets ambushed by rebels. Unfortunately, Agu's father and brother are executed by the rebels. Agu manages to escape into the forest just to be captured by another rebel group. He will later be brainwashed and become a child soldier for the Native Defense Forces, NDF. The director's background includes a couple of movies and a TV show. He is definitely qualified for motion picture production since he has won a Primetime Emmy along with 25 wins and 22 nominations. The budget he had to make this movie was 6 million dollars. This movie's settings were realistic because it was shot in Ghana. SInce there was not many special effects needed for this film, viewers got a great visual for how these West Africans lived and what they went through. Although the places the movie takes place are beautiful, the conditions many of the people lived in are horrible. The village Agu was in at the beginning of the movie was rundown and dirty with lots of garbage around. On the outskirts, refugees would surround the village pleading their way to get in. There was not a lot of money to be made inside the village, so the kids made a buck where they could. For example, Agu took apart the shell of the TV in order to try and sell to someone in the village. Another way Agu and his brother made a few dollars was by purposely blocking the roadway and making people pay to get by. These two examples show how rough it was for kids to be living in this village because there is simply no schooling and money. One of the camps that the commandant and the others started for themselves was extremely unhealthy. One of the promises of the commandant was to give the kids better than what they had. Instead the kids were left digging trenches and cleansing themselves with muddy water. The living condition was not the worst thing for the boys though. It was the fact that they were child soldiers brainwashed to fight and kill who they were told. The movie does a great job with these scenes, especially with the acting from the kids. Agu definitely did a great job persuading the audience that he went through a mental change from the commandant. After the brainwashing, Agu's attitude toward everything changed. He turned into a soldier. One example of is true change was when he killed an innocent man. This shows how he was manipulated into thinking he was doing the right thing, but in reality he was turning into the type of person that killed his father and brother. Since this movie is not strictly based off of a true event, rather based on general true information, it is hard to know what the purpose of the film really is. One way to look at why it was made is how it portrays the brutality children went through during these war times in African places. Also, there really is not any factual or historical errors in this film. This is because there is no answer to base the movie off of. This movie was produced by Netflix, a company famously known in the United States. This can show who the movie movie was made for. It was made for the audience of the United States because that is the audience it is mostly targeting. Overall, the movies overall filmmaking and performance of the actors was top notch. The sequence from the beginning to the end was very clear and fluent. The acting from the commandant was excellent. This is because he plays the strong leader during a war while being able to be somewhat of a ""father figure"" to the kids. For a child, Agu's actor did a great job narrating and acting out the different emotions of his character from when he was with his family to when he was a soldier. In conclusion, this is a great movie to have have open ideas as to what is the true events it is based off of because there is no backstory to it."
"nagrinzone","8","2","2","15 March 2017"," An amazing view into the war culture in Africa
","The film ""Beast Of No Nation"", directed by Cary Fukunaga, was set in West Africa and highlighted the popularity of children soldiers in the war. Agu and his family are off to flee to the country's capital, since the government is being run over by rebels, however on their way to escape, their family gets stopped by the rebels and Agu's family gets killed right in front of him. Agu then runs into the bushes and meets up with a rebel faction named NDF and he is trained to be a child soldier. From there, he and his rebel faction murder not only part of the country's military, but go on a killing spree through the country even when the people have done nothing wrong. When the Preacher becomes the new lieutenant, he recommends that all the soldiers surrender to the UN since they will either starve to death or be murdered, however the Commandment refuses to give up. Agu and the other child soldiers join the preacher in giving up and are sent to a missionary school, in which they receive food, shelter, and education.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely well produced and really showed the effects of revenge and how the war scene that was taking place in Africa. The acting was phenomenal, especially the young children and how they presented their drainage of themselves after they have become young murderers, so to speak. The camera angles when they are killing the men and women are very impactful, especially in the scene where Agu makes his first kill along with another child soldier with a machete. When the boys are chopping the soldier's head in slow motion and the blood splatters onto the camera lens, it really emphasizes the brutality of the war and how these once innocent children were being introduced into blood thirsty savages. Overall, the film does an amazing job showing the inhumane conditions children and adults have to go through during the war and the effects it has on people in general."
"memons-83705","8","2","2","15 March 2017"," Beast of No Nation Review
","The Netflix original movie, Beast of No Nation, directed by Cary Fukunaga is about a young boy, named Agu, that joins a militia group and gets brainwashed into killing people on his journey. During this film, children are being recruited to be child soldiers and are fighting for this Commandment and this rebel group. They don't really know why they are fighting and who, but they get orders from the capital. The movie starts by Agu and his family living peacefully, but then there is a warning that troops are attacking so the family splits and the father, brother, and grandfather stay. The family is captured and Agu watches as his family is slaughtered. He then joins a rebel group and takes revenge and brainwashed by this group. He does these terrible things and at the end the group surrendered to the UN and Agu lives in this missionary school. This film mostly focuses on revenge and brainwashing children to become these child slaves. The director of this film is Cary Fukunaga and he is an American director from California. Some of his other films and TV shows are True Dectective and Jane Eyre. this movie, Beast of No Nation was picked up by Netflix for a reported 12 million dollars and had an effort to make it into original films. He directed and wrote the script after working on it for 6 years. He then came across the Beast of No Nation novel and was inspired by the Sierra Leone Civil War. he wanted to translate what happened in the book and base the ideas into movie to people that never read it. The film is a historical fiction because it is not set in a real place and just says a western country in Africa. Some people might find that annoying because like the settings and why this is happening. The movie escalated quickly with the family enjoying life and then all a sudden is war torn and the kid family dying. The audience doesn't have time to recuperate what is happening and the movie keeps going. You never get the age of the kid or why there is a fight going on. During the film, the audience get to know that the group is the NDF and are getting orders by the capital. Then, it leaves the audience to guess if Agu joined the same men that killed his family because it never specified who those men that killed his family were. But, past those points the plot was amazing and the actors portrayed those characters well. They had the best of the best actors like Idris Elba, who played in Thor, Star Trek Beyond and The Jungle Book, and Abraham Attah, which was casted in the new Spiderman movie. These people made the audience feel like they were in the moment and felt the intensity. The action in the movie was suspenseful and horrific. The graphic scene with the machete captured the brutality of the moment and what was going on then. The director tried and he succeeded into making this movie as realistic as possible and gave the audience a brutal, but meaningful movie. The movie is not biased in any way because there weren't really a good guy versus bad guy. The audience couldn't really tell and that is what audiences are going to guess about since it it is in a unspecified war and country. The director goes on both sides when it comes to picking a side for the biased. He does capture Agu's side, but also deals with the NDF side and why they are killing. The director does a very good job trying to twist the story a little from the actual event. This movie was inspired by the book he read about the Sierra Leone War. If you look at the history of that there was a civil war and rebel groups just like the film. Also, in the film a lot of people died and in the true event over 50,000 people passed away. So the director does base this movie off that event and some may say that it is from that Civil War, but no one is for sure. It might be a mix of countries due to the geography or even their history of wars. Also, in the film they were mining gold and if you look at the history of the Sierra Leone War they were also mining for minerals and gold. That is why this film is called a historical fiction because of the events and the fictional characters. Therefore, overall this film did an amazing job capturing the events and the brutality Agu had to face and also the acting didn't disappoint. It made the audience feel the intensity of this war and the emotional roller-coaster of the hardships people faced in the country where they lived. I would give this movie a 8 out of 10."
"solsen-20031","10","2","2","8 March 2017"," This Film Was Amazing.
","Beast of No Nation directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga tells the story of a young African boy named Agu who is living in a village during the time of a civil war. The boy is separated from his mother and sister after they are relocated away from the violence. Agu, his father, and brother are forced to stay behind when the resistance attacks killing both Agu's brother and father. Agu, now alone must find a way to survive alone. He wanders through the woods and is picked up by the resistance and is trained to become a child soldier. On this journey, Agu is faced with unimaginable horrors such as, witnessing people be murdered, getting raped, and getting brainwashing into a killing monster. The film closes with Agu and his platoon surrendering and being placed in a refugee camp for rehabilitation. <br/><br/>This film is extremely powerful and leaves quite an impact on the audience. The acting is very well done especially the character of Agu who was played by Abraham Attah, about 13 at time of filming. He's acting skills were superior beyond his years, giving a very dramatic, believable presentation, even including a strong accent. Other acts that played their roles just as well included Idris Elba who played the Commandant as well as Kurt Egyiawan as one of the fellow soldiers. Their strong, believable acting played a big part in making this film as amazing as it was. <br/><br/>Cary Joji Fukunaga also did a wonderful job with the creation and filmmaking of this movie as a whole. He, himself has created several other films in the past such as Jane Eyre or Victoria Para Chino, both of which also containing some historical content as well. He also even received the Nigerian Entertainment Award for Best Picture Making and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series among other awards for his work in cinema. With his filmmaking history and numerous award winnings, Fukunaga is very qualified to create this movie. Beast of No Nation was filmed in Africa in Accra, Ghana, aiding in setting the tone and mood of the film, since the actual setting in the film is Africa as well. The director included extremely powerful scenes to truly get the whole purpose of the movie across, how child soldiers come about and how traumatic and scarring of an experience it can be. Scenes such as Agu getting ripped away from his mother at the start, being pressured into splitting an innocent man's skull, having to witness his friends die all left the viewer speechless. The final scenes of Agu having to now attempt the almost impossible adjustment back into everyday life also shows the audience how Agu's struggles will never really cease since he had seen and done such horrible things at such a young, and impressionable age. The impact of this film creates is indescribable. The amount of detail that Fukunaga put into this movie in order to make Beasts of No Nation such a gripping and catching film is extraordinary. As the watcher, you are pulled in from the start and immediately sympathize with this poor young boy who was once playing in the street with his friends, and now is fighting in a war that he doesn't even know the cause of. The film was also fairly accurate. Children being abducted and morphed into child soldiers happens all across Africa far too frequently in areas such as South Sudan or northern Ugandan. Sadly this is a reality that can be seen all across Africa, children being separated from their families and being forced to join the fight, stories very similar to that of Agu's. All in all, this movie is a must see. Right from the start the audience is hooked, eager to see what becomes of this poor, unfortunate boy. It gives a clear statement and purpose of child slavery and its effects while also still keeping the viewer entertained. The filmmaking is fantastic as well as the acting making is overall just a great film. Beast of No Nation will leave you speechless and in awe."
"pacoundouriotis","10","2","2","10 December 2016"," Touching
","I'm not exactly sure why, but I really enjoyed this film for some reason. It starts off following the daily life of a boy named Agu. His village is a buffer zone protected by ECOMOG troops and his father helps any refugees that enter the area by letting them live on his large plot of land. They are then informed that the government has fallen and rebels begin wreaking havoc. Agu's father manages to buy a safe transport to the capital for his wife and youngest son, but Agu must stay behind with his older brother and father. When the government invades his village, they round up all of the residents thinking they are rebels and Agu's father tells him to run right as they are all shot. Agu runs into the forest and is taken under a rebel group's wing led by an unnamed commandant. As time progresses, Agu takes part in many murders, pillages, takes over many villages and vantage points. He becomes strong and respected, particularly by the commandant who then rapes him. His good friend Strika had the same thing happen to him. The commandant is then summoned to the rebel headquarters expecting a promotion but instead gets a demotion. He and his battalion escape to an abandoned gold mine to look for refuge and money for supplies as they have run out of bullets. The battalion begins to protest against the commandant and leave. They are captured by UN troops and the children taken to a rehab school where Agu is reborn into a new human being. The message this movie portrays is very powerful and it gives the viewer a very in depth look as to what it's like being a rebel. It very accurately shows what they do as well as how they do it. It shows them capturing UN convoys, taking over villages, and defending their territory. It also shows very well the psychological effect all of this has on the children that fight. At one point when they enter the house of a mother and a baby, Agu remembers his mother and latches onto the woman as he cries. The fellow soldiers remove him and begin to rape the woman. He then yells at the kid raping her to stop and kills the woman after the rapist refuses. Another touching moment was near the very end when Agu was at the rehab school talking to a counselor. She asks Agu to tell her what he did and he replies by saying he did many horrible things. He doesn't go into detail because he fears that he will be regarded by all as a ""beast."" Agu finally accepts himself and runs into the water at the beach and begins playing with all of the other boys. Overall, the movie was hard to watch at some points, but was very powerful and exposed one of the world's greatest problems."
"olrovin","9","2","2","9 December 2016"," Very well done but very intense film
","Beasts of No Nation is really well done when it comes to the characters, scenes, and overall mood of the film. It begins from the perspective of the main character, a young boy named Agu, who is living with his loving family in a ""buffer zone"" of his country during a time of civil war. After his mother and baby sister leave for safety, Agu is left with his brother, father, and the other men of the zone to defend their goods; however, tragedy strikes, and Agu is left to fend for himself in the forest. He stumbles upon a rebel group that takes him in and trains him to be a child soldier. Under the guidance of the Commandant, Agu learns the ways of a soldier and sees and commits some horrible acts on others. Cary Joji Fukunaga did an amazing job of showing violent, dramatic scenes without showing too much. His unapologetic, raw scenes showed how easy it is for such a young child to become desensitized to death and become a trained killer. At one point in the film, the color of the entire scene shifts to blood red and gray. Fukunaga used this change in color to show the shift in the attitude of Agu as he sets out to kill the innocent people of a seemingly peaceful village. The story itself is difficult to watch, yet it is very real, and I think it is important to see. Overall, I really liked this film and would give it 4.5/5 stars."

","Somewhere in Africa, a boy (played by Abraham Attah) and his family are caught between warring factions in their country. Most of Attah's family are killed, and the boy barely escapes, running into the jungle until he is lost and alonebut not for long. Attah is found by a rebel faction led by a brutal and charismatic leader played by Idris Elba. Instead of being killed, Attah is offered to join the rebels and fight the soldiers who killed his family. Not having much of a choice, Attah joins the rebels who are mostly children.<br/><br/>With little training, Attah is thrown into the fight, first as an ammo bearer, then as a full-fledged fighter armed with an assault rifle. He experiences combat on a regular basis which desensitizes him to the brutality of warfare; but somewhere deep in his heart, a bit of goodness remainsa goodness that may be extinguished when Attah discovers a terrible secret of Elba. Like his fellow child soldiers, Attah will find himself trapped in constant battle as Elba goes rogue against his superiors. Not part of the main rebel force, and not part of the nation's army, Attah and his group are ""Beasts Of No Nation."" <br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Beasts Of No Nation"" is the scene when Attah is given a machete to make his first kill: a man on his knees, pleading for his life, telling his captors that he is not a soldier but an engineer who is going to build a bridge.<br/><br/>Taking second place for my memorable moments of this movie is the scene when we see one of Elba's soldiers, a fully naked man carrying a light machine-gun. No, he wasn't taking a shower; no, he wasn't sleeping and got caught off guard in a surprise attack. This dude went into combat naked with his weenie proudly swinging back and forth as he engaged the enemy! <br/><br/>""Beasts Of No Nation"" is a terrifying look into some of the horrors that still go on in some African nations.

This certainly the case with Elba and Attah. Nothing seemed over-the-top in their performances. Both portrayed the right amount of darkness along with the appropriate amount of humanity. Storytelling: This film managed to keep my attention with a great plot, dynamic characters, and masterful pacing. What could be better: The irrevocable effect on this movie is that it breaks hearts. The end of Attah's story arc is shown. I'm happy for him, but I know he still has a long road ahead. I don't think there should be a sequel showing his recovery, but the ending of the film seemed abrupt. Maybe that was by the design of Fukunaga."
"bscrivener-50810","9","2","2","7 August 2016"," War- through the eyes of a child.
","Without a doubt one of the best films to be released by Netflix. Beasts of No Nation presents the realistic and brutal portrayal of poverty, war and vengeance all through the eyes of a young boy. During a fierce civil war in an unspecified West African nation. Agu's family is brutally murdered after their village, initially in a buffer zone comes under a ferocious attack from both rebel and government forces, this forces him into the jungles to fend and survive for himself until being being captured by rebel soldiers and forced into their ranks, as a child soldier. As the film progresses Agu becomes more and more psychologically and physically scarred by the horrors of conflict. Beasts of No Nation stars Abraham Attah as the young, trouble Agu and Idris Elba as the power-hungry, merciless Commandant who leads the battalion. The story of Agu while tragic presents a thoughtful and powerful evolution from boy to soldier and back to boy. The gritty realistic portrayal of war is a definite praise for the film and it's smart use of cinematography (to point out a particular scene) magnificently shows us the depths and context of war. It's intense and gripping action again captures the feeling of a real life battle and the mix of contemporary and tribal music both motivates and pays homage to ancient elements of conflict. My flaws with the film are a few pacing issues, generally in the first act and a few audio issues, especially in understanding Agu's narration. Beasts of No Nation runs through all the themes and emotions and presents us with a masterpiece of a film, that while uses common elements and themes of war, overall gives us a whole new perspective and point of view of war- through the eyes of an child. 9/10"

","This is a thought provoking movie that leaves you pondering on very sensitive issues. Not many movies, in fact 99% of movies these days cannot evoke such a feeling and so I recommend this movie.<br/><br/>The child soldier theme explores the suffering and agonies of children in war zones. While the likes of Kylie Jenner spends money on meaningless things and live fake lives, most children are denied basic love, care and the protection of their innocence. The time has come for us to say no to war. The children suffer more. <br/><br/>The actors, especially the young Agu and Idris did a fantastic job. I was so surprised to learn Agu was cast a week to production. I commend the director, writer and crew members. Whatever sacrifice they made was worth it. Beast of no nation shares one similarity with Blood Diamond - the pain of losing a loved one or family, and although Agu never saw his mother again, the movie still ended on a good note."

It is a fictional tale and a specific country is not mentioned but any of the numerous central African civil wars in the 90's could nicely represent the film.<br/><br/>Presented from the viewpoint of a child, forced into picking a side that he doesn't understand, the story nicely weaves in the realities of war.

"russel-58230","8","2","2","30 April 2016"," Filming style and sound editing accurately reflect film theme.
","Beasts of No Nation is a Netflix original movie that was filmed in Ghana Africa with the plot of the story taking place in West Africa. The main actors of the film are Abraham Attah who played Agu and Idris Elba who played the Commandant. Agu is the main character that watches his family flee and die his home village as it is taken over during civil war activities. He wanders off on his own until he is rampaged by the NDF. They end up taking him in as one of their own and we as the audience get to see Agu's childhood and innocence slip away as he is transformed into a child soldier.<br/><br/>The Director, Cary Joji Fukunaga, uses a staccato filming style near the beginning of the film. The quickly changing scenes gives the audience a feeling of confusion and uncertainty to mirror the feelings of Agu as he struggles to adapt to his new and ever changing lifestyle. As the movie goes on and Agu grows accustomed to some of the things that used to make him nervous, this style of film is reserved for only new events that startle him. Fukunaga also uses the changing of scenes to show contrast. Most of the film is shown in a subjective point of view or an indirect-subjective point of view. This allows the audience to see everything up close and personal in the eyes of Agu. However, occasionally the movie will change to a scene that pans across the vastness of the forest they are in as an objective point of view. This emphasizes to the audience that the Agu and the NDF, no matter how big and loud they seem, are seemingly insignificant compared to the vast jungle they inhabit.<br/><br/>The Director also makes great use of sound effects throughout the movie. There is never any silence in the movie. The quiet moments are filled with the sound of leaves rustling, the wind blowing, animal sounds, insects buzzing and water flowing. These sounds may seem trivial in the grand scheme of the movie with all the gun fire, yelling and explosions that take place, but these sounds are actually the most important. The presences of these background noises allow the audience to understand that Agu's environment is a place where he must always be aware of his surroundings. As the movie progresses and Agu's innocence slowly disappears, the natural background sounds are replaced with background music to show Agu's disregard for his surroundings and his slow progression into his own head. His surroundings are no longer abnormal to him as he walks through the forests of West Africa which the Director accurately reflects in every aspect right down to the simplicity of the background sound.<br/><br/>This movie is recommended to anyone who values movies that show harsh reality rather than pleasant fantasy. The loss of Agu's innocence in anything but pleasant, but it is worth watching to understand what a child soldier endures when exposed to the harsh truths of war."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","18","40","28 October 2015"," Fukunaga is not ready to join the big boys just yet - a disappointingly hollow film
","What to take away from this film - Cary Fukunaga wants to play with the big boys, but he shouldn't just yet. There are a number of questionable directorial choices made in Fukunaga's film, but the biggest problem is that the good choices aren't nearly as effective as they should be. Child soldiers, rape, murder, grenades stuck in people's mouths - this should have turned my stomach but I watched the whole thing with indifference and the main thing I've taken away is its excruciating run time and poor pacing.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation's first act is very promising - a group of kids are playing with old junk. Its necessary in films like this to establish innocence before we can establish that it has been lost. It goes on a bit too long but we meet our main character Agu, played by the exceptional Abraham Atta, a young actor who excels whenever Fukunaga gives him the opportunity. When his village is sacked by government forces during a civil war, Agu flees and falls in with a battalion of soldiers (including children) led by the fierce Commandant. Idris Elba has been gathering Oscar buzz for this role - he is certainly a good actor, but the Commandant fails to leap out of the screen and be a manipulative father figure like Steve Carell in Foxcatcher or a commanding leader like Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland. Besides Atta, the other highlight comes in the form of Jenny Eagan's costumes - everything ranging from the Commandant's distinctive blue to the warrior who wears nothing but a jockstrap to Agu's evolving outfit are noticeable and do a great deal to telling apart all these interchangeable characters. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, we watch Agu smile as an innocent, and then smile in spite of war, and then smile because of war. It corrupts him and soon he begins to do unthinkable things and almost relish in it. The story has a great deal of potential, but Fukunaga's questionable choices undermine it in places. Battle sequences are shown from multiple angles but from only one side's perspective, making them almost impossible to follow. Bizarre scenes of Elba and his men dancing before a battle and children singing played in the background while the atrocities are committed are tonally inconsistent and make the film messy.Characters are either paper thin or never fully explored - some implications that the Commandant is a pedophile or the mystery of why young Strika doesn't speak are never explained or revisited, instead giving cinematographer Fukunaga more time to frame shots of grass and trees. I could have easily shaved half an hour off this film in the form of unnecessary conversations and framing shots. We get it Cary, we're in Africa. Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan make you feel filthy just watching the characters roll around in the dirt. The dirt and stink doesn't radiate here like in that movie, just highlighting again the Fukunaga isn't ready to join the big boys like Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>More than one ""artistic"" scene ends up making the whole movie confusing - if Agu hallucinated his mother here, did he hallucinate his brother's girlfriend later? There are some very nice scenes - including a silent empathy extended from Strika to Agu after Commandant molests the latter - but for the most part the film is completely hollow. The film's third act - during which Commandant goes rogue from his leaders and takes his men into the wilderness - is one act too many and wastes its potential. Even its climax, where Agu and the others turn on Commandant and leave him alone and sad, feels completely lacking in feeling and there is no feeling of relief as Agu finally breaks away."

The story follows a young boy named Agu (Abraham Attah) who finds himself thrown into the war by the Commandant (Idris Elba), throughout the film Agu must face situations that no one in their lifetime should ever have to experience.<br/><br/>One of the most stunning aspects of this film is the atmosphere in which all of the events of the movie unfold. The detailed and unique costume design paired with the dynamic scenery results in an unbelievably realistic setting, tied together with the ingenious sound design and visionary camera angles greatly contributes to the amazement that this movie is. The unique camera angles helps keep the action sequences fast-paced and intense and added to the gritty realism of the movie as a whole. This film has a hand-full of disturbing scenes that not all viewers may wish to see, however, are invaluable to the development of the main character Agu.<br/><br/>The narration of Agu maintains the focus on this character throughout the movie, and makes the movie more interesting by narrowing the focus of the movie onto the story of a single character. As the film progresses Agu is faced with tougher and tougher situations, and his reactions to these cruel situations are part of what makes the film so emotional. Abraham Attah does an incredible job playing main character Agu, especially for this being his premier acting experience. Abraham's subtle body language and facial expressions do a great job of displaying the emotions Agu would experience in such scenarios.<br/><br/>Supporting actor, Idris Elba, had several very impressive performances throughout the movie. His role as the Commandant reinforces the movie's fast-paced, dark and intense tones. Elba's bold and 'larger than life' acting style keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats the entire time. The role of the Commandant also played an important part in the development of the main character Agu; some of the darkest and most emotional scenes of the movie are a result of the conflicts and struggles the Commandant forces Agu through.<br/><br/>Overall this movie does an incredible job of showing the variety of impacts and effects of war. It doesn't just show the destruction of land and property, the disruption of communities, and the massacre of lives, but also the lasting impacts on the lives of the innocent people affected by war. ""Beasts of No Nation"" shows all of this while retaining its fast-paced, intense, and dark tone. This movie might just redefine the genre of military- action films; because of how well it displayed the overall scope of civil war and the rippling cultural effects of war."

","Definitely not a film for the timid or sensitive. College campuses airing the film will require safe zones. The film would have had more poignancy I believe, if it were actually based on a true story, though I have no doubt the atrocities shown in the film are representative of warring factions in opposition to each other in various places on the planet. The inhumanity and barbarism that one group of people can inflict on another convinces me that there is no possibility for the cherished 'peace on earth' that many of us dream and pray for.<br/><br/>For an independent film this picture features exceptional cinematography and outstanding performances. It's probably a toss up as to who delivered the stronger portrayal, Idris Elba as the Commandant or Abraham Atta as the child soldier Agu. Principally told through the thoughtful narrative of Agu, the viewer agonizes along with him as his band of mercenaries terrorizes opposition forces and grow disillusioned over a never ending mission. The hopelessness of their cause is best expressed through the dying words of Two I-C - ""This was all for nothing"".<br/><br/>There is value in watching films like this so one does not grow complacent in a world that can often be brutal and discouraging. However the film offers only the slightest of consolation for it's principal protagonist Agu, who detachedly relates his story as a child exposed to unimaginable horrors. The challenge he issues to the viewer is to hear his story without imagining him a beast or a devil, as the circumstances of his life have unintentionally trapped him in that corner."
"rblenheim","10","3","4","4 March 2016"," One of the most visceral film experiences of 2015
","""Beasts of No Nation"" is one of 2015's most realistic and visceral films, an unforgettable drama detailing the experiences of a young boy named Agu who is forced into joining a group of child soldiers trained into become guerrilla killers during Nigeria's civil war. This shattering film, beautifully shot in Ghana and starring Idris Elba, was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, a Californian born to a Japanese-American father who had been imprisoned in an internment camp during WWII. Fukunaga uses an uncompromising style that pulls no punches in showing the explicit brutal violence these children are brainwashed into committing. Although extremely graphic, ultimately it moves the viewers' hearts toward deep compassion over the children's loss of innocence, but also toward the hope for their redemption.<br/><br/>Fukunaga also photographed the film himself when the original DP sustained a serious injury. He not only brought a beauty to the horrendous Nigerian war-time settings, but based its look from photojournalists' coverage of the Second Liberian Civil War, and coloring the film personally to reproduce 1970's photo-chemical film stock.<br/><br/>Without question, this film is an important document of man's inhumanity to man that we should not cover our eyes and ignore. Fukunaga's past directorial work includes ""Sin Nombre"", the 2009 critically-acclaimed feature of Honduran immigrants trying to illegally cross the American border, and the first season of the TV series, ""True Detective"", but this film is his finest work to date. Fukunaga spent over seven years working on it, and its best sequences visually bring to mind a young Stanley Kubrick, especially in its latter scenes of great colorful poetry. Because it premiered on Netflix (it bought the worldwide distribution rights), most of the big theater chains boycotted it, so it only had a limited theater release but that's where it should be seen, and on the biggest screen possible, but you'll probably have to watch it at home."
"glittercrush","10","3","4","30 January 2016"," Near-Perfect
","Cary Joji Fukunaga's adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala's novel is a potent study of one child's survival as his country, culture and family are victimized by war. One of the first films actually co-financed and released by Netflix, it has not received the credit it is due.<br/><br/>At times this film is almost impossible to watch, but it presents a story that with which we must become familiar. The fact that these horrors continue into the 21st Century without any real intervention to stop or provide essential assistance is even more impossible to ignore.<br/><br/>Fukunaga is a deeply talented filmmaker who has never been allowed to steer a near-perfect production until now. Idris Elba's work as one of the film's producers and as a pivotal character in the story is amazing. It speaks volumes regarding the ignorance of The Academy Award that these two artists and this film have essentially been ignored. Abraham Attah may only be a child, but his performance serves as the heart and soul of the film.<br/><br/>Not to be missed or undervalued. ""Beasts of No Nation"" is very near perfectly made.<br/><br/>As a note of advice: This film is brutally realistic and contains scenes of horrific violence. Parents should be aware."
"petergrump1","8","3","4","27 January 2016"," Hope on the Battlefield
","With the 88th Academy Awards embroiled in controversy over their exclusion of non-white actors in the nominations, it seems to be Beasts Of No Nation that is on everybody's tongue as the vital exclusion. Beasts of No Nation is said to have been excluded for two reasons: it features an all-black cast, and it is one of the first mainstream films to be released on a digital platform (something that the film industry and large theater companies are very worried about). However, looking past the controversy, how does the film stand on its own? The film follows the story of Agu (Abraham Attah), a young West African boy who gets involved in his country's civil war after joining a rebel military battalion headed by the powerful Commandant (Idris Elba). Most of the film follows Agu's increasing role in the battalion, the loss of his innocence, and his relationship with the Commandant. Now, the reason why Agu is no more specific than an "" West African Boy"" is because the film itself never reveals what country it takes place in, and this is part of what makes the film so great and different. Unlike, many other Hollywood films that take place in Africa, Beasts of No Nation does not revel in showing the terrible conditions of West Africa and how bad of a place it is, one that is filled with savages. No, Beasts Of No Nation is a war film that does not clearly indicate whether one side is good or bad; it shows a destructive, confusing, manipulative war that consumes all who partake in it, and it is not one that is automatically twenty times worse just because it takes place in West Africa. Abraham Attah does a great job as Agu especially for a child actor. He successfully shows the transformation of Agu from an innocent child to a hardened soldier. However, the real crime was not nominating Idris Elba for an Academy Award. His performance is one of the best of the year, and he dominates this film. From the first time on the screen, he creates a fearsome, yet father-like role. He is willing to do the worst things to his enemy, sometimes killing entire villages, but still he shows so much love to Agu and the rest of his troops (for the most part). His presence at times is almost like a cult-leader, forcing his troops to shout chants at him. However, at no point in the movie does it seem like he thinks what he is doing is wrong. He expresses how much he wishes his troops to live in a better world and that they will live in a better world when it is all over. In fact, hope is one of the elements that truly sets this film apart from many other war films. Things always seem to be getting worse and worse, but at the same time Agu and the Commandant hold hope that one day things can get better. Without giving anything away, this holds true until the end of film, where time is not spent lingering on the destruction of the past, but the hope of the future. One final thing that really helps the performances is that the actors speak in a broken English that is similar in structure to the African language: Twi. It really helps create a sense of immersion in that they don't speak perfect English, but the audience can still understand them. The cinematography and shot composition also create a very beautiful, but deadly environment. Many of the shots contain juxtaposition between the bright colors that are found in the jungle and atrocious acts of war. It corresponds very well with Agu's loss of innocence and makes every scene something you want to look at and look away from. Conclusion: Boasting one of the greatest performances of the year, Beasts of No Nation is an original, thought-provoking anti-war movie, that is oddly optimistic."

I have followed these conflicts in international news. I have known immigrants here in the U.S. who were displaced by these conflicts.<br/><br/>The film is a bit generic. By that I mean it has the super-realism of bloody violence but maintains the feel of a stage play. Scenes tend toward tableau rather than a blend of related events as they might occur. This is fine, but felt like a buffer between me as a viewer and the horrors portrayed. <br/><br/>The perversion of children by poverty and violence is very well represented. Agu, the central character, conveys the process of descent into hell from a nurtured and deceptively secure childhood. I think the film could have contained more inner-voice commentary on his experiences. His voiced thoughts were very compelling. <br/><br/>I was most impressed by the end of the film. The straight forward portrayal of his trauma while in a refuge for child warriors was stunning.

Haunted by Come and See's Florya the protagonist becomes a spectral presence, the replication of his perspective bridges the gap between a child- solder's psyche and our own. For me one of the strongest scenes was the religious ceremony where film Agu's old identity was broken down and he was recast as n efficient tool of war.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you're interested in modern conflict from a perspective of its most overlooked victims."

It is a real lesson and insight to us all of what the situation is really like in these countries, how they evolve and why factions break away.

It brings many thoughts that while I am relaxing there could possibly be some one suffering in Africa. The motherland of what made every country great with their natural resources. This is truly heartbreaking. I loved seeing Idris Elba in this movie his acting was really awesome.

The fact that we live in such an horrible world where in some countries kids can not be kids anymore, but brainwashed killing machines is maybe incomprehensive for some people that have no clue what's happening outside their cozy neighborhood, but it's the hard reality. Child soldiers used by power hungry fools to do their dirty job is not an illusion anymore. The actors, especially the young ones were sublime. Very powerful acting.

","I was very impressed by director Cary Joji Fukunaga's Sin Nombre, a powerful film about illegal immigration and gang culture in Mexico and Central America. Conversely, I was stupefied by Fukunaga's lame attempt to adapt Jane Eyre to the silver screen.<br/><br/>I am happy to report that Mr. Fukunaga is now back on solid ground with the adaptation of the novel Beasts of No Nation, a searing meditation on the fate of child soldiers in war torn Africa. Although most of the film was shot in Ghana, no specific country is referred to as the narrative unfolds. Some critics found fault with Fukunaga's generic portrait but as he himself pointed out, the story has a universal application with its focus on one particular child who is emotionally damaged after forced to become a soldier under the tutelage of his psychopathic commandant.<br/><br/>There have already been a number of novels and films on this very subject (the recent film ""War Witch"" comes to mind), so was it necessary for Mr. Fukunaga to cover similar ground once again? The answer of course is yes, provided this child- soldier genre is handled in a non-derivative, unique way.<br/><br/>While the focus here is on black Africans, one should not come to conclusion that the ""beasts"" of the title (child soldiers and their adult commanders) are a problem exclusive to the African continent. Recently there have been reports of children being employed by ISIS to fight in some of their bloody battles. <br/><br/>It is also wrong to conclude that Africans are savage people based on what one sees here. In fact, the victims in this film are all black Africans. Our protagonist Abu's father and brother are murdered when soldiers from a newly installed junta accuse them of collaborating with a rebel group.<br/><br/>The story breaks into the second Act when Abu is kidnapped by a group consisting of both adult and child soldiers who call themselves NDF, led by the ""Commandant"" (menacingly played by the eminent actor Idris Elba). The Commandant intimidates Abu at first by referring to him as a ""thing."" But soon the Commandant allows Abu to join the group by undergoing an initiation consisting of running through a gauntlet of soldiers who thrash him mercilessly. One boy falls before making it through the gauntlet and since he has shown weakness, his throat is slit and then he is apparently buried alive as witch doctors perform a ceremony to ""cleanse"" the children's' ""souls.""<br/><br/>The horror only escalates as the Commandant forces Abu to prove that he's a ""real man"" by hacking an educated man (an engineer) to death after he's one of the few survivors of a convoy the Commandant's group has ambushed.<br/><br/>Abu cannot understand why the other youngest in the group, Strika, never speaks. It soon becomes apparent that the Commandant is a pederast who has been sexually molesting the boy for quite a while. Soon Abu will become another victim of the Commandant's perverse proclivities and he will fall silent too.<br/><br/>Later Abu participates in a number of battles, eventually leading to a skirmish in the capital. Abu clings to a woman inside a building they've just taken, mistaking her for his mother. Completely unhinged, Abu shoots an innocent victim to death.<br/><br/>Eventually the Commandant is summoned by NDF headquarters and learns he's being kicked upstairs by the Supreme Commander--his lieutenant will now take control of the group. In the evening, at a brothel, the lieutenant is shot and as he is dying, accuses the Commandant of being responsible for the shooting.<br/><br/>When the Commandant orders his group back into the bush, against the orders of the Supreme Commander, they come under helicopter fire. After a few months, they run out of ammunition and the group (including Abu) rebels against the Commandant, and agrees to surrender to UN forces.<br/><br/>The story ends on a bittersweet note as Abu, now haunted by memories of his experiences, reveals that he's still guided by the love of his parents and seeks to lead a normal life as best he can. He joins other children playing in the surf at a missionary school where they are staying.<br/><br/>If there's any criticism to be offered here, one can point to some of the harried battle scenes which I often found to be unclear as to what exactly was transpiring. <br/><br/>Mr. Fukunaga did well in casting newcomer Abraham Attah as the beleaguered boy, Abu. His transition from an innocent child to savage child soldier, is to say the least, upsetting. Beasts of No Nation is often hard to watch. But as with good films about the Holocaust, one comes out of the theater much more aware about what's going on in the world beyond the safe borders of our sheltered world."

","Writer-Director Cary Joji Fukunaga, the acclaimed director of the ""True Detective"" series, has demonstrated that he could be a beast in Hollywood director nation with his latest gripping movie ""Beasts of No Nation"". The film stars child actor Abraham Attah as Agu, a child whose family is murdered by an oppressed army of an unnamed African country. Agu is then sort of rescued by a rebellious group led by the domineering commander subtly named Commandant played fiercely by Idris Elba. Agu then transforms himself into a child soldier and is forced to kill many by the Commandant. That is a killer childhood no child should experience. Funkunaga transports us into a brutal African society where survival is just the matter of life, and rebellion forces becomes an unwelcome necessity. My only flaw of ""Beast of No Nation"" is that it was maybe twenty minutes too long. But the beastly performances from Attah and Elba more than make up for that matter.

It is a masterful mix.<br/><br/>Most people won't watch it because most people don't like to watch African war films. This isn't one of those gunshot and blood movies. Nor is it a sob story about African child soldiers. This isn't just an African war film. It is just a must watch war film. The emotional journey involved can hardly be rivaled by its counterparts.<br/><br/>I think most importantly they captured the motivations behind the people in these wars. The commandant(Idris) supports yet preys on these motivations. Making him a powerful leader yet a man you should constantly question. I myself was powerless against his presence.

Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation has a super average plot. Boy is separated from family and joins the army in a war that's been happening for a while. Nothing new here other than the fact that it's child soldiers, which really doesn't change a lot. Without the child soldiers it probably would have been the exact same movie, so it kind of feels like they were put in just as a way to 'bait' people into liking it. It kind of felt like it was saying ""If you don't like this movie then you support child soldiers which makes you a horrible person"". I almost always feel this way about a lot of these kinds of movies, but I think that this movie in particular had that scenario. Unfortunately for Netflix, I'm not impressed by the feeling of obligation over quality. <br/><br/>Everything else about the movie is pretty average. The characters aren't really all that good, the movie as a whole is very predictable, and not once was I surprised about a single thing about it. <br/><br/>I was a little irritated though that I couldn't understand a word anyone said, so I had to turn on English subtitles while they were speaking English. I know that it's part of the movie that not everyone speaks particularly good English, but it was just a little frustrating. If they'd been speaking in another language for the whole movie I could have cared less, but in this case it was just a little annoying how inaudible everyone's voice was. <br/><br/>The movie really isn't paced too well. The first hour isn't too bad. It's just predictable is all. But the last hour dragged on forever. I found myself relatively frequently checking how much time was left. Even when there were only 25 minutes left I felt like that would be too long to wait.<br/><br/>Overall Beasts of No Nation isn't anything special. Everything about the movie is extremely predictable, and the last half of the movie is extremely slow, which makes it more of a below average movie. While I still enjoyed the movie for the most part, it just wasn't done well at all, and ended up coming off as baiting people to feel obligated to like it. Thinking about it now, it's even more obvious than I originally thought. In the end, I can see why someone would like it nonetheless, but it really just wasn't for me. If your curious then give it a watch. If not, then it's probably not worth your time."

","Well, not exactly... I did like it overall, if maybe liked it a lot. But there was some disconnect between a lot of what I was feeling. Visually and directorially, I think it's a great achievement. Fukanaga really knows how to carry a scene, and he doesn't milk anything for sentimentality. Technically, the film is a marvel. But something about it was also making me doubt how much I was liking it. I was getting lost in its world and something kept nagging at me, and it wasn't until it was over that I sort of realized. Elba is great no doubt, but by making his character be the central conflict in the film, I feel like the film forgets what the real horror here should be, which is the war. It definitely comes down to the screenplay. There's nothing inherently bad about it, it's definitely not a bad screenplay by any means. But it also works around what its themes should be too easily. There's such a clear structure and formula at play here, and some of it (like I said previously, mostly revolving around Elba's character and the conflict there) just seems to rise from obvious tweaks and manipulations in the script. Yes, all filmmaking is a manipulation, but the key is to not make the audience notice. The second half of this especially felt like it was playing it too conveniently. I don't know how to exactly word what I am feeling, but all I know is that, thematically, what it did concentrate on should've been able to hit harder because of a connecting link to the atrocities of war and humankind. instead, that's not how the film comes across by the end. Something. just. didn't. click. Not to any totally debilitating manner, I still like the film. But something here wasn't handled as well as it should've.<br/><br/>Yes, Elba is totally supporting and that should be his Oscar campaign. He makes the role work wonders, hiding some of the script's weaknesses. Abraham Atta is amazing though.<br/><br/>Never overdoes any of it and the film is all the better for it. I definitely need to rest up more on my thoughts on this film to see if I have less (or more) of a problem than the one I mentioned here."

They sell the TV set as a box of imagination.<br/><br/>Before long in the country ravaged with civil war, they are abandoned by the UN soldiers, his father and brother are killed, he is separated from his mother and sister and under the tutelage of the Commandant (Idris Elba) in order to survive he goes from being a playful young boy to a brutal soldier as he is firstly forced to hack a man to death.<br/><br/>The Commandant is a sadistic mercenary, who trains the child soldiers and at night selects some of the boys to rape. Agu has a friendship with fellow child soldier, Strika who are both abused by the Commandant.<br/><br/>When it seems the rebels might achieve victory, the chief has little use of a savage like the Commandant who might now be a liability and a perfect candidate for the war crimes tribunal.<br/><br/>The film to me felt unfocused, I felt the issue was better dealt with in a film like Blood Diamond. By setting the action in an unnamed country we are at loss as to what the conflict was about. Was it tribal or religious?<br/><br/>The film is grim, some of the scenes are barbaric.

"jonahwp","7","4","7","30 December 2015"," A Touching War Film that Doesn't Quite Hit the Mark
","War is a tough time for any nation, and especially any child. War can be an even more brutal affair if this child is left to fight in it. Beasts of No Nation tries to depict this and does so quite well. From its disturbing visuals to its increasingly touching dialogue, Beasts of No Nation depicts an African Civil war near perfectly; except for a few crucial aspects. Beasts of No Nation poorly displays its characters and gives them an unrealistic mindset. I will touch on this and many of the things that director Cary Joji Fukunaga does magnificently in this review. (note: this movie isn't a casual Saturday night film to watch drunk in your fraternity house eating cold cuts off of your stomach, it is quite deep and VERY disturbing.)<br/><br/>This film follows a young African boy named Agu (Abraham Attah). His village gets attacked, and he finds himself in the middle of a full out civil war. He joins the anti-government rebels (which don't fly X-wings) and becomes a child soldier in a battalion led by the malicious yet caring character of ""Commandant"" (Idris Alba). <br/><br/>While Attah's acting was above adequate, certainly for a child, I found that in certain scenes he lacked the drama and raw emotion that a young child would have during a war. He does, however, deliver very touching narration. In some films, narration is the director's cheap way of telling a story. In this one, it really added some much needed emotion to Agu. Alba, while not being as likable or witty a character as in The Wire, still delivers as Commandant in this film. Towards the start of the film he is portrayed as a legend, immune to danger or fear. However, as this film progresses, Commandant's flaws begin to show, and Alba captures this perfectly (and rocks that African accent).<br/><br/>The action sequences are fine. They really brought nothing new to the table, but instead of seeing Bruce Willis taking down bandits left and right, we are shown fearful children with guns fighting for what they believe in, which was refreshing. Additionally, not every action scene was intended to gather pity, which I liked. If you are going to include an action scene in something described as a ""war movie"", it better be adrenaline filled. Beasts of No Nation delivers on this front.<br/><br/>This brings me to my favourite aspect of this film: the ""in between"" scenes. In between the large and tough battles that Agu's battalion goes through, Fukunaga does us the favour of showing us how these ""soldiers"" live life. Here we are exposed to what hints at slight character development (something this movie really lacks), the disturbing atrocities committed by both Commandant and the rest of the battalion, and the brilliant narration given by Agu.<br/><br/>With all of this in mind, it will be shocking to know that my biggest complaint with this film is it is hard to care about many of the characters. I don't mean to sound like a heartless Sith Lord, but I really couldn't get invested enough in Agu's character to truly sympathize with him. I did indeed wonder why I had this mindset, and even worried at one point. Then I came to a conclusion. Fukunaga's focus on creating disturbing scenes and decent action sequences led him to neglect character and context of the story. <br/><br/>I feel that had act one been slightly longer, we could have gotten to know Agu and his family a lot more. As a result we care for them a lot more. Had Agu's thought process been slightly more childish and innocent towards the start of the war, it would better highlight his loss of innocence as the war unfolded. I also feel that had we been given more historical background and information on the war being fought, we would better understand the situation of this African country (which I don't even remember having a name the movie!).<br/><br/>So do I recommend you watch this? Sure, if you are willing to excuse unrealistic character and accept it as more of a war story and less of a drama. (which I don't mind!) Hey, maybe I am a Sith Lord and have no heart, so if you enjoy the drama in this movie, I am jealous of you!<br/><br/>Grade: B+ (7.3/10)"

","""We are just like wild animals now, with no place to be going. Sun, why are you shining at this world? I am wanting to catch you in my hands, to squeeze you until you can not shine no more. That way, everything is always dark and nobody's ever having to see all the terrible things that are happening here.""<br/><br/>Netflix's first original film couldn't have made a larger impact on me. It is one of my favorite films of the year so far. Set in an unnamed West African country, director Cary Fukunaga, takes us through the turmoils of war as we experience it through the eyes of a young child who is forced to become a soldier. The script perfectly captures this young character, named Agu (Abraham Attah), as we witness the transformation he goes through from a sweet and innocent young boy to a fearless and brutal soldier. He is the narrator of the film, and I must say the script written by Fukunaga himself is very gripping. There have been many films tackling the terrible subject matter of child soldiers in Africa, but I don't think any of them have been handled with the grace that this script does here. It never feels forced or manipulative. We aren't forced to sympathize with these characters or feel sorry for them because everything evolves very naturally. Fukunaga detaches us from those basic human emotions and simply lets us witness Agu's horrifying story. The film captures the horrors of war with a lot of detail, but at the same time it contrasts with the beautiful landscape that surrounds the country. It is a film of two contrasting emotions facing off each other, on the one hand there are many horrors, but on the other there is a sense of hope. Despite all the horrifying things going on we are always left with a sense of hope that something good can come out of it all. The cinematography in this film is breathtaking and I simply fell in love with the imagery here. <br/><br/>There are several things that stood out for me in this film. First of all, Beasts of No Nation further solidifies my claim that Fukunaga is one of the most talented young directors working today. I was blown away with his 2009 feature film, Sin Nombre, which centered on a Guatemalan teen who was trying to escape his past with a violent gang and flee to America with his girlfriend. Then he surprised me even more with his direction of the first season of True Detective, which was one of the best shows I've seen on TV. Beasts of No Nation isn't just a showcase for Fukunaga as a director, here he proves to be an excellent script writer and cinematographer as well. The film is breathtaking. The other thing that stood out for me was the lead performance from Abraham Attah, and I believe his name should come up when award season arrives because he was simply amazing in this film. He delivers a completely believable and mesmerizing performance and we sympathize with him despite the transformation he goes through. He does some terrible things in the film, but there is still a sense that he hasn't entirely lost his soul and that somehow that innocent child wants to come out again. His performance in the final scene is the best I've seen this year. Then there is also the incredible performance from Idris Elba as the rebel Commandant. These leaders have always been captured on screen as fearless and terrible men, the Commandant is all those things, but somehow Elba also manages to bring charisma to his character. There is something about him that attracts these men to follow him and basically do anything he asks of them. Elba will surely receive a lot of attention during the award season as well. I'm even hoping for Fukunaga to not be overlooked when the time comes because he has crafted a mesmerizing film that will be hard to shake off. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"bschultz_the_pally","8","4","7","19 October 2015"," An emotional and visual assault
","Beasts of No Nation marks a historical time in film; whether it be for better or worse. only time will tell. Instant streaming has been around for some time now, but Beasts of No Nation is a special type of beast because it is Netflix's first original film. Instead of embracing this, all major theater chains opted to boycott the film, presumably digging their own graves. So, without having to make a one-time overpriced transaction to see the movie, and without having to leave the comfort of my room, I watched Beasts of No Nation.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the tragic journey of a young child, Agu, living in a nameless nation ravaged by war. When the war comes to his neighborhood, his family tries to escape, but it's too little too late, and Agu is swept into the chaos and recruited for war. Beasts is extremely graphic and merciless in what it shows; this small boy is not only given no choice in witnessing executions, but is forced to participate in them. Just as innocence and joy are bled dry from Agu, they are bled from the viewer. The only difference between this and an exploitation film is that the movie is not gratuitous for the sake of it. It shows a form of life that is very real for some on, while the rest of us sit in an air-conditioned room and watch on an HDTV. Beasts is an emotional and visual assault, and it's not easy to take. <br/><br/>Idris Elba plays the Commandant, a soldier who not only fights the war, but enjoys it. He takes great pride in his unit and in his leadership, and it's frightening. Idris Elba demonstrates masterful range without chewing the scenery. Credit is definitely due to the writing of this complex commander, but Idris Elba makes his insanity plausible and not just a showpiece.<br/><br/>Speaking of the writing, Cary Joji Fukunaga not only wrote and directed, but shot the film, and the cinematography is probably the strongest dimension. Beasts might be tough to stomach but it's also beautiful, a welcoming dichotomy in an otherwise gloom-and-doom world. The colors pop, the camera moves seamlessly about, sometimes without cutting for three or four minutes, and the framing only draws attention to itself on the rarest of occasions. In one particular shot, a drip of water on a table expands as gravity tries to pull it down, sizing up the frame and giving us the visual information we need to tell us where we are in this particular room. Interesting choices like these are only made by a masterful eye. On all fronts, Cary Joji Fukunaga does an excellent job.<br/><br/>However, this great film is punctuated by some really damaging flaws. For one, it's 137- minute run time feels closer to three hours. There is no way its script was longer than ninety pages, yet the film seems to stretch itself out. Halfway through the film, you're more than numb from the senseless violence, you're indifferent. It doesn't gain steam again until the final fifteen minutes, so about a half-hour could have been cut from the movie without impacting the story, and the pacing would have felt a lot smoother. And though the political turmoil is really only a vehicle to the for Agu's story, it is extremely unclear who is fighting who and why leaving enough to be desired in subplot. It doesn't need to be steeped in political commentary, it just needs clarity. The confusion isn't helped the extremely thick accents. In a country where people's English is very muddled, there's no real reason why they should even be speaking English, a typical error by American filmmakers time and time again.<br/><br/>So about halfway through the film, I turned on the subtitles. The luxury of the home- viewing experience is something that movie theaters currently can't compete with. If I hadn't been able to turn on subtitles, I might have missed some critical dialogue. If I hadn't been able to pause it to use the bathroom, I might have missed an important scene. Movie theaters choosing to pass on the film simply because it wanted to release it on the big screen and Netflix at the same time makes the movie theater chains feel like the 'cool kid' on the block who never leaves his hometown; irrelevant, pathetic, and soon to be forgotten while the rest of the world progresses on. Why bother with the movies if they don't put in an effort to enhance the movie-going experience?<br/><br/>Of course, I am playing devil's advocate, because to me, nothing beats the lights dimming down, the loud speakers blasting, and seeing everything unfold on a giant screen. That's something that's missed on Beasts. Sure the cinematography was great, but wouldn't it be enveloping in a theater? Wouldn't the soundscape be so much more exhilarating in surround sound in a room equipped to handle it? <br/><br/>As a movie, Beasts of No Nation is moving, numbing, then moving again. As an experience, it certainly caters to my individual needs, but it takes away all the magic and the escape. I'm still in my room, all the responsibilities of the world still surrounding me. It's a shame that the big chains turned this one down, because it is a great film, even with its setbacks. So I can't tell you to see this one on the big screen, but I can tell you to open up a new tab, or turn on your console, go to Netflix, and watch. It might be difficult to digest, especially for the squeamish, but it's worth your time. That's the respect all great films deserve, no matter the medium of viewing.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"sir_humpslot","Null","4","7","19 October 2015"," feature length version of Kony2012 for war pr0n loving ""slacktivists""
","Before reading this review, you should search the video ""Hollywood stereotypes of African men"" that's somewhat viral from a few years back. It exactly highlights Hollywood problems of depictions of Africans, and ""BoNN"" is another entry into the genre. Seriously, checkout some of the better ""Nollywood"" productions and see how Nigeria and some other African countries view themselves: modernized and with the same self-indulgent relationship problems as 1st world people.<br/><br/>Now then, I'm not trolling this movie with my review; I pretty much agree with the vast majority of reviewers here that it's an extremely well acted, shot and edited MoVIE created for audience consumption in order to generate more revenue for Netflix. It certainly is a masterfully crafted narrative of a FICTIONALIZED account of child soldiers during war.<br/><br/>However, after reading all the gushing reviews I have to agree with Red_Identity's review that there's just something lacking that other films have done better and with more emotional impact.<br/><br/>For starters, I think my review title sums it up pretty efficiently: this movie is for ""slacktivists"" who get a feel good moment about empathizing with FICTIONAL characters' harrowing war experiences; but ultimately it does nothing to actually do anything against child soldiers/slavery/sex trafficking, and only fills up Netflix's coffers without any NGOs getting any of that money.<br/><br/>Just like the Kony2012 viral campaign, it's a means for most of the US and UK reviewers to cry crocodile tears about the suffering of fictional characters (Hamlet's ""dream of passion"") when the current reality in Autumn 2015 is the REAL suffering of Syrian refugees who have no movies right now to show their plight? Yep, I'm just that cynical. And maybe that one reviewer was right: I'm probably part of that ""2% potential psychopath population"" who needs to get my head checked; but I disagree with another reviewer who wrote that this movie is for thinking people. And I don't like to be taken for a fool, so I'm gonna point out a few things in my friend dissenting from the other reviewers.<br/><br/>It's been like two days since I first saw it with friends on Netflix after falling prey to the media hype and I also saw several other movies in-between, so my brain isn't recollecting all the details; but I'm sure I can find many more ""plot holes"" if I watch it again some point down the line.<br/><br/>For me the biggest issue I have with the storyline is Agu totally ""pulls off a Luke Skywalker in New Hope"" with the loss of his family. He's afraid upon first meeting commandant, but very quickly ""accepts"" the reality of the rebels and doesn't even make any attempts at escaping the group to find his mother. For me, the drug induced sequence later of him missing his mother seems somewhat false because of this. Even when commandant tells Agu to kill the driver to avenge his father is kind of hollow when there aren't enough scenes of Agu longing for his past.<br/><br/>Speaking of the initial ""Act of Killing"" and loss of innocence of Agu, they totally went Disney with the machetes and hacking the driver. With all the other graphic violence and Netflix's Narcos, I can't but help think they didn't want to really traumatize the kid actor Attah - which is a good decision; but nonetheless the cutting away and upwards angle provided some sentimentality in this movie that's supposed to be ""raw and brutal to your emotions."" Another scenario comes towards the end where Agu reminisces about how he's a beast and speaks some very poetic lines about God and Satan. I was kind of rolling my eyes on how a kid without much education is speaking such lyrical lines if it's not the script demanding him to say it? Agu hardly has any education from the establishing shots at the beginning, but all of a sudden speaks like he's Wole Soyinka? Not buying it.<br/><br/>And as far Agu's ""Imagination TV"" goes, it seems like people forget that if the TV wasn't working and he has no exposure to Hollywood movie tropes, then how's Agu and his friends acting out movies? If the poverty is that dire then logically he wouldn't have seen that many movies at all, let alone act it out. That's a hammy moment from the writing and not even ""poverty pr0n"" level of romanticized poor people with hearts of gold. Seriously, go to some 3rd world countries and I can guarantee that poor people aren't naive innocent saints, but calculating and scheming like the rest of humanity.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are other moments in the movie I can point out with Agu, but these are the scenes that stick out the most for me.<br/><br/>Now as far ""commandant"" is concerned, the lack of an actual name and an actual conflict takes me out the most. Surely, somebody like ""supreme commandant"" knows his real name? But the fictionalized account just puts it in a vacuum and reminds me it's a movie for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>Seriously, the scenes of ""buck naked savages"" running along with commandant trying to pull off a Col. Kilgore is kinda laughable. I understand Fukunanga is going for a hardened soldier, but running straight into gun fire seems a bit out of left field.<br/><br/>Also, the initial camp sequence is logically impossible because they showed helicopters searching for them so they'd never in real life camp out in the open with fires and not get shot at.<br/><br/>Overall I think Idris Elba gives a wonderful performance, and Abraham Attah is the breakout acting prodigy of the decade. I think a movie like this would work better about some real conflict like ""Hotel Rwanda"" or even the insanity of ""Last King of Scotland."" But face it, at the end of the day Nick Nolte's line in ""Hotel Rwanda"" is spot on about the West's indifference to human suffering in Africa..."

You can literally sum up the whole 2 hour film in 20 seconds: Agu's Family are killed by the government troops, the rebels take Agu in, Agu feels uncomfortable with being a part of the rebels, Agu feels like he is part of rebels, Agu soon realizes killing people is wrong, Agu is rescued and put into a care home. The End.<br/><br/>Everyone just pretends that they really enjoyed this film because it is based on true events and is ""meaningful"". That film wasn't meaningful one bit, it didn't show the truth of what child soldiers. And why does everyone praise Idris Elba so much for his performance? There's a ton of people out there who can put on an African accent, pick up a gun and look intimidating. Really people Idris Elba's performance is nothing to get crazy about.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the fact that this film was a box office failure making only $90,000. Seriously, how can a film receiving this much praise make less than $100,000? Even some of the worst reviewed films out there such as The Emoji Movie have made more money than Beasts Of No Nation.<br/><br/>Beasts Of No Nation will never be any better than any other film based on civil war in Africa such as Blood Diamond and Hotel Rwanda with well thoughtout out plots."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","5","9 December 2015"," Powerful. Provocative. Compelling.
","I think the only way Hollywood views Africa is as an entire continent ravaged by nothing but conflict & suffering and Beasts of No Nation is another exemplification of that. That's not to say that the picture isn't impressive by any means for it is definitely a powerful, provocative & compelling piece of work but this movie industry's immoderate fascination with the civil war subject is slowly becoming unhealthy.<br/><br/>Set in an unnamed West African country, Beasts of No Nation tells the story of a young boy named Agu who, after witnessing his family being gunned down by soldiers, flees from the village but inadvertently runs into the rebel forces and is coerced to join them in their fight. The plot then follows Agu's harrowing journey as a child soldier plus the loss of innocence he undergoes after witnessing the brutality & hardships of war.<br/><br/>Written, shot & directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, Beasts of No Nation takes a very no-holds- barred approach to bring its script to life on the film canvas and is able to depict everything in an uncompromising manner. The camera brilliantly illustrates the transition our character undergoes from living in a bright, hopeful environment to a grim, disturbing one through its changing colour tones as the plot progresses, and it is effectively utilised by Fukunaga.<br/><br/>The plot remains gripping for the most part, thanks to tight editing, but the final act is more like a stretch and its runtime is slightly felt at that point. Coming to the performances, there are two standouts in Abraham Attah & Idris Elba, the former's input being a definite highlight for Attah carries the whole film on his own little shoulders, while Elba plays the leader of the rebels with comfort and the scenes between the two form the core ingredient that keeps the film glued together.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Beasts of No Nation is difficult to watch at times, is unflinching with its violent content, and is meant to be an upsetting experience. But where the movie really hits the mark is in handling the complexities of its lead character and apart from that, there isn't really much in the story that separates it from other Hollywood treatments of same subject matter and while these movies do bring certain issues to light, their exclusive focus on this one particular problem is also hurting an entire continent's image."

","It was only a matter of time before this would happen.<br/><br/>With all the success of TV series on on-demand streaming services, we now have our first ever Netflix original feature film.<br/><br/>It is also the first ever American film to be filmed in Ghana, which is certainly quite an achievement.<br/><br/>Directed by Cary Fukunaga who has lately found fame in television, decided to venture out into the African jungle for something quite daring. With stories coming out of filming that reminded me of the incidents during the filming of Apocalypse Now, this definitely sounded like a project that could emulate the success of the 1979 hit.<br/><br/>After a pleasant start, everything suddenly turns into into quite a brutal watch and we witness one of the biggest character transformations from an unknown child actor for some time. As we go into the second half, it reminded of The Thin Red Line, Platoon or Apocalypse Now in terms of working out that there will never be peace and that you can never find solace after war. That is a successful plot that the director and his team pulls off nicely.<br/><br/>After seeing all the brutality, it was easy to forget the sweet first ten minutes of our main character leading a normal life for an African child and playing with this friends.<br/><br/>I can definitely see this film get some Oscar recognition, especially in the performances and directing. Despite having no acting experience, Abraham Attah manages to be the most unexpected star since Barkhad Abdi in Captain Phillips. He really disappears into his role and we feel totally immersed. He is quite a discovery and it deserves to be publicised around the world. The only actor that is in it that we will know is Idris Elba as it seems the director hired locals that have either no or little acting experience. As for Elba, as soon as you see him, you know he means business.<br/><br/>It is what many would call a 'tour de force'. I think for many people, they will be going into this film hoping for Elba to make them care for this film. With Attah showing his qualities, Elba does manage to give us another memorable character that is well developed to its fullest extent. Thankfully, Elba plays the supporting role well and does enough to not steal the limelight from Attah and the many other child actors.<br/><br/>With all these strong positives, director Cary Fukunaga manages to eclipse both of them. Filling for an injured cameraman, colleagues catching malaria, constantly rewriting the script and dealing with various actors dropping out due to dangerous conditions, Fukunaga soldiered on to make his latest project came into fruition. When battling against the elements, Fukunaga's cinematography is pretty good. It certainly captures the atmosphere and made you look in awe of the African landscape.<br/><br/>Despite the tone of it being quite miserable, brutal and not holding back, it's character development makes you care for the events that are happening on screen. The raw feel this movie has makes this such captivating viewing. The acting by the locals is quite impressive and really puts you into that struggling part of the world. I can see some people forgetting who was who. But for me, I found it easy to separate the minor characters. Also the accents might need to take a while for you to adjust your ears too. But if you like films such as Apocalypse Now, City Of God, Hotel Rwanda and Platoon, then you will get the most enjoyment out of it. When I was thinking of other war films that have been released between 2000 and now, I was really struggling to think of a film that was superior to this. It was a shame that there was no cinema nearby showing this as this would look great on the big screen. But for it being a first for Netflix makes this a new experience that needs to be seen, not just for its landmark that has been stamped within the development of film, but for possibly being the best film of the year."

It's a heartbreaking drama that's hard, very depressing, touches on a controversial subject, but still manages to reward its audience. Yes, the film is a very hard watch, and there's some shocking brutality, but it's also extremely pertinent in today's times, exploring an eye-opening subject matter with clear thinking and respect for the complexities of the psychological damage done.<br/><br/>In an unnamed West African nation, the life of young Agu (Abraham Attah) is disrupted when his father and brother are slaughtered in a civil war, and he's separated from his mother and infant sister. After barely escaping with his life from the regime's military, Agu is involuntarily inscripted as a child soldier into a militia faction led by the sadistic Commandant (Idris Elba).<br/><br/>Fukunaga gives the film a visual grandeur that makes it feel like it's taking place after the world has ended, and all that's left for Agu, our unwitting protagonist, is this morass of endless, uncaring violence. The story, which is about just one of the 300,000 child solders currently exploited in combat worldwide, is given the necessary emotional heft and demands our undivided attention largely in part to the child actor and newcomer Abraham Attah who's an absolute wonder to behold. But if there's one actor on display who completely steals the show and chews up the scenery of every scene he's in, it's undoubtedly Idris Elba who metes out a high-powered and shockingly charismatic performance (given the circumstances) as the menacing militia warlord that has ""Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor"" written all over it.<br/><br/>""Beasts of No Nation"" is one of the most harrowing, mind-numbing, and emotionally draining war movies I've seen â€“ powerful and devastating to equal effect, showing us the horror humankind can commit through the eyes of a kid that's lost his innocence. Cary Fukunaga's direction and the performances by Idris Elba and the new kid, Abraham Attah, knock it out of the park. Perhaps, the most chilling thing about this child soldiers' eye view of Africa's endless civil wars is how unsurprising it all is amidst the savagery and emotions it engulfs us in."
"Argemaluco","10","3","5","3 December 2015"," Beasts of No Nation
","In this century, various movies which pretend to denounce the terrible social and economic conditions in Africa have been made (such as Hotel Rwanda, Blood Diamond and, to a certain point, Lord of War). More recently, Beasts of No Nation reminds us that the problem remains... even though it never reveals where the story is developed or what the ideologies of the factions in conflict are. That's an audacious strategy, because by omitting geographical or temporal details, the narrative gains universality and avoids the moral dilemmas of the conflict between ""good"" and ""evil"" ones. Who is right doesn't matter; the consequences are the same for the innocent victims who are absorbed by military (or para-military) machinery which requires a constant renewal of troops in order to perpetuate a hollow crusade in which violence seems to have become an end in itself. Sure, I thought about all that after Beasts of No Nation was over. While I was watching it, I found myself frequently confused, with the sensation that I had missed something important because I didn't understand who was fighting against who, and I didn't know the motivation of the rebels or the defensive troops. However, I later realized the fact that the point of the film isn't the political diffusion, but sharing the main character's naive perspective, who is one day into imaginary games, and the next one is brandishing an assault rifle to shoot people he doesn't know for reasons he doesn't comprehend. The effect is simultaneously devastating and curiously distant, coldly examining the events without contaminating them with moral judgements or cultural rationalizations... exactly like a kid would do. Abraham Atta brings one of the most honest and natural performances I have seen this year, not only when he shows up on the screen, but also during his brutally revealing narration. The rest of the cast also makes an excellent work, highlighting Idris Elba. The technical aspects are also brilliant, contrasting the horrors of war with the beauty of African settings. Dan Romer's music highlights some scenes, but, like Cary Joji Fukunaga's direction, it never tries to artificially exalt the audience's emotions. In fact, that can be considered the mandate of this extraordinary movie: portraying a sad reality without seeking solutions or offering false hopes. The situation exists, and it would have been disrespectful to seek Hollywood formulas to solve it. There is no happy ending, but at least, there's an ending. Sometimes, that's the biggest blessing."

Cary Fukunaga brilliantly directed this movie and he's also the same director of the first season of True Detective (Just in case you didn't know). Idris Elba delivers a menacing performance that's one of his best. Abraham Attah stole the show for me, I mean he was so freaking brilliant in this movie and he deserves an Oscar nomination (In my opinion). The movie is shocking and very real with some of the scenes, which I liked, because it never hold anything back and not once tried the Hollywood way of getting out of danger. Movies like this are great examples of film making.<br/><br/>Now for the flaws: I liked this movie, but I honestly can't see myself watching it again. It's one of those movies that you think it's good and well made but never again will you see yourself re- watching it.

","'BEASTS OF NO NATION': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Netflix's new critically acclaimed war film; starring, and co- produced by, Idris Elba. The movie was also co-produced, written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (who's probably most well known for helming season 1 of 'TRUE DETECTIVE'). It's based on the 2005 novel, of the same name, by Uzodinma Iweala (a Nigerian-American writer). It tells the story of an African child, forced to become a soldier in a brutal civil war. It also stars Abraham Attah, as the child soldier, in his film debut. It's a hard film to sit through, but well worth it.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in an unnamed West African country, where a violent civil war has broken out. Agu (Attah) is a young boy, living in a peaceful village, when it's attacked by the army; and the men are all viciously killed. Agu escapes, but he's quickly captured by the rebel forces instead. They're lead by their ruthless commander 'Commandant' (Elba). Commandant forces Agu to join his battalion, or be killed, and we watch as the young boy is stripped of his childhood. <br/><br/>The film is brutally violent, and heartbreaking to watch. It's so disturbing, to experience, that I have a hard time giving it a favorable review; but that's what some films are made for, and this one (impressively) still finds hope in the darkness. The performances of Elba and Attah are both fantastic, and the directing is superb.

"graymattermovies","8","3","5","28 November 2015"," Beasts of no Nation Delivers a Different Perspective on the Grueling Effects of War
","Cary Fukunaga, very much known for his work directing the HBO series True Detective, has us follow the shortly experienced childhood of Agu, a boy born in an African country during the midst of a civil war. The playful and outgoing Agu, played by Abraham Attah, lives with his family in a village that is supposed to be within the safe buffer zone from the war. However, this changes as Agu is then forced into the violent culture of a civil war that frequently makes him question his recently engrained belief that he is fighting to rid the country from corruption and evil.<br/><br/>This film presents similar elements that other war movies have presented. It shows the changes in a character's personality and beliefs as a result of particular the gruesome acts of war, and their ability to adapt back into peaceful society afterward. What Fukunaga gives us is an altered perspective of this, being a war that does not represent American soldiers, a war where the viewers (for a portion of the movie) cannot decipher which faction is fighting for the just cause, and most of all, is through the eyes of a prepubescent child. As a viewer, understanding that the main character still young to where sexual metaphors would go way over his head, it is easy to empathize Agu and understand how easy it is for him to be manipulated into committing traumatic acts to further his party's agenda.<br/><br/>The film presents great atmosphere and environment really sucks the viewer in. Through the battered villages, lush jungle, and muddy trenches, one can even feel humidity during a scene when Agu is drinking a soda while patiently for his party to be done sleeping with a house full of women. Fukunaga did well in surrounding Agu with secondary characters, such as Strika, that not only propel Agu's story, but serve as a reminder that war can affect people in many different ways. The film presented multiple elements of foreshadowing or would point towards something occurring in Agu's future, however not every one of them was fulfilled. Not knowing what future actions the protagonist would take at certain points of the movie elevates the experience in that the outcome is less predictable and can yield more emotional responses.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation will definitely not be for all mature audiences in which some would find certain scenes very hard to stomach. Also, depending on the viewer, the ending might not have been satisfying enough and some questions were left unanswered. The mentioned foreshadowing that did not end up taking place may as well present somewhat of a letdown to some who are looking for Agu to take an alternate path or for other events to take place. Despite the film being rather enjoyable, but not everyone's cup of tea, it will most likely be nominated for a few minor awards. However, this film's success would be more rooted in the deep discussions it brings about. Such as how environment, influence, and individual perspective can change a person's moral beliefs.<br/><br/>Beasts of no Nation, Directed by Cary Fukunaga, starring Abraham Attah and Idris Elba receives a: 7.5/10 More movie reviews and discussions at graymattermovies.wordpress.com"
"MovieHoliks","7","3","5","26 October 2015"," Netflix's First Original Film Is A Winner....
","I had been thinking to myself that Netflix had made other original films before, but this movie is being promoted as their FIRST original film. Okay- maybe I'm thinking documentaries-?? Well, anyway, I got around to seeing this film over the weekend, and it's a first-rate film about the war-torn experiences of such African countries where rebel armies rule the place, terrorizing local villages with murder and rape, while recruiting the local boys and young men. <br/><br/>One of my favorite actors right now, Idris Elba, stars as the charismatic rebel leader, who of course does not see himself as anything other than a hero of war, despite the atrocities he encourages. Abraham Attah is good in the lead role of the prepubescent boy who joins him after most of his family is murdered. I hope this movie is a good sign to come for Netflix original movies being made, especially after hearing Brad Pitt will be doing his next big movie there-?? But a big thumbs-up for their first major film!"
"Screen_Blitz","10","3","5","25 October 2015"," Very powerful and moving Netflix original
","This low-budget war drama that sadly failed to make a wide release in theaters, but gladly managed to stream on Netflix, stars Abraham Attah as Agu, a young child growing up in an unnamed third-world, country in West Africa. When his town is brutally attacked an African militia and his mother and brother are killed, he finds himself pulled into an army of child soldiers by a Commander (played by Idris Elba). Striking through the war-ravaged country, Agu and his fellow comrades experience the horrific realities of war. Directed by Cary Joji Fukanuga, this movie boasts an extraordinary storytelling, vibrant performances, and an ambitious direction.<br/><br/>As this film is partially based on true events, it tackles some interesting issues dealing with poverty and genocide. During the first ten minutes, we are introduced the main character Agu and his friends who try selling a TV with no screen and make playful action through the ""imaginary"" screen to fill people who watch it with imagination, I thought that was kinda cute. We then see Agu and other children in school in classrooms that easily resembles an abandoned garage. These scenes accurately portray the everyday society that citizens in African territory face. The plot takes off when the African militia arrives in town and launches assault and began kidnapping and killing hundreds of civilians in the eyes of young Agu. Hiding in the woods on the outskirts in his small town, he is found by the Commander of other children who are now trained soldiers and joins the team to fight as a soldier against the militia that kill his family and destroyed his home. From there on, the audience is treated with a gritty and harrowing atmosphere of war as these kids forced to fight for their lives and their poor country. The film does get undeniably bleak and violent , and is quite difficult to watch, but at the same time still manages to keep you glued to your seats. The film moves very well, even though there are some really slow moments, and this is all thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay by director Cary Fukanuga. Abraham Attah gives a wonderful performance as the main child, and Idris Elba shows a fair amount of charisma in his role. <br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation is one of the most vibrant and moving films of the year and definitely deserves some awards. However, due to its online release and short marketing, this film may have reduced its chance of being found under the Oscar radar, and is certainly making very very little at the box office because of it. Overall, this film is very powerful and a good choice for subscribers on Netflix."
"Matt_Layden","8","3","5","24 October 2015"," ""I just want to be happy in this life.""
","There is a lot of controversy over the release of this film. Not for content (per say) or any behind the scenes production fights, but for the actual release itself. This film was purchased by Netflix and is the first film from the streaming company. They have released the film both in theatres and on their streaming service. This is a big ""No, No"" for theatre chains as they typical request a 90-day exclusive window. So, a bunch of theatre chains have boycotted the film and refuse to show it. Luckily, some smaller independent theatres are showing it, thus making it officially eligible for an Oscar consideration. <br/><br/>Now let's look at those chances. Does the film have a chance? Maybe. It certainly has some powerful sequences and performances. Yet, what are the political questions in letting this film be nominated? We all know the Oscars are old school Hollywood and Netflix seems to be anti- everything. They are producing original content and changing the way people view television shows. Is this the next step for cinema? <br/><br/>Well, all that aside, how is the actual film? Netflix didn't produce the film, they purchased it. Unlike their television shows, so who knows what an actual Netflix film will look like. Cary Fukunaga wrote, shot, produced and directed Beasts of No Nation and if this guy doesn't have a bright future ahead of him in Hollywood, then I don't want to watch movies anymore. Everyone fell in love with the first season of True Detective. Why? Was it the writing? No, Pizzolatto proved that with the second season. What about McConaughey and Harrelson? They surely are a big portion of it, but most people talk about the look, the feel and the direction of it. Specifically the long take showcased in episode 4. <br/><br/>How good is Beasts of No Nation? Strikingly good. The premise alone gives me an uneasy tension that can't be shaken. The film tells the story of Agu, a child who finds himself as a soldier in a civil war in Africa. He's a captive. He's a killer. Is he brainwashed to believe everything or simply fighting for survival. The film is a brutally honest look at the lives and deaths of those who are stuck within this cruel world. <br/><br/>Fukunaga wrote and directed the film. They had a cinematographer, but due to an injury he had to drop out at the last second, which forced Fukunaga to shoot the film himself. Maybe this was a good thing, because the film is gorgeous. Luscious greens fill the screen from the jungle, bloody red fills the dirt they trek through, decrepit towns overrun by ruthless killers. One sequences Fukunaga stages for us is very reminiscent of a brutally shocking scene from City of God. Here, we have Agu faced with the task of having to kill someone. Fukunaga sets the stage, slowly ups the stakes and then revels in the carnage brought forth. Shocking and disturbing and would have been even more so had I not seen the aforementioned film. <br/><br/>Abraham Attah stars as Agu, the child robbed of his childhood. An undeniably great performance from a first time actor. A lot of times, first time actors are hit or miss. They can deliver a brilliant performance, or ruin a film. It's the lack of ""acting"" that delivers some honest performances sometimes. The same goes for children, who are unaware, often, of the nature of things. They have an innocence that sometimes gets lost as they grow older. Abraham Attah has the benefit of being both a child and a first time actor. The result is a truthful performance that I for one hope receives some recognition come awards season. If they can honour the performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild than they can do so here. <br/><br/>Idris Elba plays the warlord who destroys the lives of these children. He's ruthless in his manipulation of these young minds who are lost without their families. He imposes a fatherly figure all while towering over them with threatening levels of violence. He wants war, he wants bloodshed and will find a way to get it. The supporting cast, full of more first time actors and some actual former soldiers all fit nicely in this package. One character is known as tripod and walks around naked everywhere. Yes, there are some levels of humour here, mostly in the first act. Once things hit the fan, the sheer intensity of everything rises to unnatural levels. <br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation is an accomplishment. Clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film is a bit on the long side, but I never thought it dragged. I was engaged from start to finish. Attah had me from the beginning till the end. Beasts of No Nation is one of the year's best films."

","I first heard of Beasts of No Nation some time ago, being tipped that Idris Elba was to be portraying a Child Soldier General. Forgetting about it for a while, I ended up skimming through Netflix on the day of its release, and jumped in without hesitation.<br/><br/>This, throughout it's entirety, is an exceptional portrayal of an all too real circumstance. Hitting home from very early on, the film grows and adapts throughout, providing some excellent story telling.<br/><br/>BoNN is very similar to Thin Red Line, only more relevant to the current time. It's beautifully captured shots, intense colour and soft narrative are exceptional; something that I loved in Thin Red Line. Every scene is enjoyable and entertaining, which is in contrast to it's dark story.<br/><br/>Acting wise this is brilliant, not a single child in this film lets up. When introduced to Idris' character, I was sceptical at first – slightly 'Kony 2012/ stereotypical African General'. My opinion, however, was quickly erased and only down to the costume design – Idris gives a monumental performance throughout.<br/><br/>Not one to watch in the background, one to really digest.."

Beast of No Nation is a superb movie with excellent screen writing and a relevance story line with no flaws to the truth. Idris Elba was phenomenal and brought to life the tyranny in his character and the plague of destruction that has stricken a continent in turmoil. The child actors exemplified academy award worthiness. As a viewer, you will feel their pain and their sorrow of being a child deprived of your childhood and enslaved as a soldier to a war that only benefits military commanders aggressive autonomy.

"tomgillespie2002","6","4","8","16 March 2016"," Intermittently excellent but hampered by an exhaustive running time
","Since its release consecutively in cinemas and on Netflix - who hold the distribution rights - Cary Joji Fukunaga's Beasts of No Nation has been caught up in controversy. Feeling the traditional 90-day exclusivity to cinemas was being breached with Netflix subscribers also able to stream online, many cinema chains boycotted the film and reduced its circulation to selected independent theatres. This non-traditional form of release could also be blamed for its omission from the Academy Awards, with Idris Elba's Best Actor snub the most glaring eyebrow-raiser in the #OscarSoWhite debate.<br/><br/>Of the film itself, Beasts of No Nation is an intermittently excellent portrayal of child soldiers in an unnamed African country that works best when focusing on innocence lost and the relationship between narrator Agu (Abraham Attah) and his Commandant (Elba), yet hampered by pacing issues and an exhausting running time. Fukunaga has proved himself to be a skilled director already with Sin Nombre (2009) and the first season of HBO's True Detective, with the latter's awkward second season certainly feeling his absence, but while Beasts can be commended for ambition, he is perhaps not ready to join the big boys just yet.<br/><br/>One of the movies biggest strong points is the cinematography, done by Fukunaga himself. With a bleached colour palette that evokes old war photography, Fukunaga finds a way to keep the film grounded in reality while delivering delirious set-pieces. In one particularly memorable sequence, Agu and his comrades, all hallucinating from drugs, raid a village as the visuals turn a trippy purple, heightening the insanity and horror of the senseless brutality on show. Elba really is terrific too, careful to keep his monstrous character toned-down and believable. He is fair and unforgiving, tender and brutal, and his boys worship him. Attah as Agu is equally impressive, and the moments in which the Commandant's veil begins to break is when the film is at its most dramatically powerful.<br/><br/>The main question I had with the movie is why make this movie now? For the most part, Beasts is a series of war atrocities in which only Agu, the Commandant and Agu's mute friend Strika (Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye) are distinguishable in the crowd, so if the point is that various countries within Africa are routinely devastated by revolutions and government overhauls driven by personal greed or ambition, then I would point you in the direction of Johnny Mad Dog (2008), Jean Stephane Sauvaire's powerful piece tackling the exact same themes. The funny beginning and the gut-churning middle is where the film is most effective, but Beasts drags in its final third, struggling to round up Agu's story in a digestible running- time."
"BlackLemonTea","8","4","8","17 October 2015"," No One Is Born A Beast
","When the film was released on Netflix I couldn't help myself but watch it immediately. This brave, powerful and intense motion picture transmits real and genuine images and is a piece of brilliance.<br/><br/>""Beasts of No Nation"" tells the story of a young and innocent boy called ""Agu"" who lives under poor circumstances in a not-mentioned African country. The brutal civil war takes away his family and Agu suddenly finds himself in a group of child soldiers and becomes one of them. Throughout the movie the protagonist gets confronted with the meaning of death, morality and immorality and value of family and unity.<br/><br/>There is plenty to say and discuss about this stunning movie which is one aspect of the film I loved; it provokes the viewer's mind and dramatizes a huge issue that deserves awareness and importance. Children used for violence and criminal causes are an ongoing topic and happens right now and I doubt that I have to discuss whether this is right or wrong. Personally, I had to remind myself more than once that what I see on screen might be happening at this very moment.<br/><br/>The movie is perfectly depicting the ugly truth of war. Furthermore, it is shown how easy it is to manipulate a kid's mind and make them do anything by encouraging them, supporting/nurturing the wrong side of the human nature (violence), giving them a feel of brotherhood/unity/affiliation and partly by the usage of drugs to stimulate their senses and conciseness. The ""soldiers"" we are talking about are innocent children and not grownups. I enjoyed how the film bluntly confronted me with the obnoxious and horrific reality in a very atmospheric and intense way.<br/><br/>Although the movie relied heavily on the pictures we see, it contained beautiful writing, too. The main characters (the aforementioned Agu and the Commandant) are greatly written. They are genuine and show a lot of depth. One feels really connected and bonded to Agu, especially because of his innocence. He is just a normal boy having fun on the streets and enjoying time with his family, but when his father and brother are killed he must flee and ends up in that horrible army of underage soldiers. I call that great writing. In addition, the story contains a lot of irony which is always exciting to watch.<br/><br/>There are more reasons why the writing was stupendous. It was very well paced. You never felt boredom. The scenes were never too long or too short, it was perfectly timed. The movie never was dragging or moving too fast. You were hooked.<br/><br/>Naturally, a good character needs to be portrayed well, too. Abraham Attah plays the role of the protagonist. Agu is not the most complex character, but Attah delivers a more than solid performance (I also consider it very difficult to work with young actors, thus I respect the performance even more and rate it higher). Additionally, the acting of the children in the army was great, too. They reminded me of a wild pack of savages or animals and totally fulfilled their respective roles.<br/><br/>But the star of this movie clearly is Idris Elba. Wow - I cannot find words to describe how good he was. He absolutely stood out of the movie regarding acting. Despite knowing his name and face I have never seen a movie in which Elba had a significant role (except Thor) and neither have I watched ""Luther"", but now I definitely know what an incredible actor he is. Idris Elba plays the Commandant of the army and is a highly respected man amongst them and gets along well with everyone. You shouldn't like him at all because of the horrible situation, but Elba yet manages it to let the audience feel sympathy for him. As the movie moves on, we discover that ""The Commandant"" isn't quite the man we supposed him to be. He is a man who has an unhealthy abundance of pride and the urge to gain more power which eventually leaves him all alone. He is not a leader, he is a reckless ruler led by bad intentions. <br/><br/>Currently, I see Idris Elba amongst one of the biggest contenders for the ""Best Supporting Actor"" award and wish him lots of luck.<br/><br/>Another outstanding element of the movie is the cinematography. There are sundry shots that make you wonder what one person can do with a single camera and a vision.<br/><br/>Cary Joji Fukunga was not only responsible for the movie's spectacular cinematography, but he also wrote and directed this marvelous motion picture. This man is a genius, as simple as that. I consider him as one of the biggest aspiring filmmakers for the future, although he already has impressed me in the past with his contribution as director for the show ""True Detective"" (Season 1). I am looking forward to watch his other movies.<br/><br/>The only negative aspects I can mention are the following two: The climax partly disappointed me regarding how good the rest of this movie was (maybe the slight lack of suspense was the reason). Secondly, the movie underwent a few clichés in the ""war-genre"" (i.e. the protagonist having to kill someone for the first time although he is aware of the moral conflict). Other than that I did not find any other striking negatives.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Beasts of No Nation"" is one of the best movies you will see this year and definitely worth watching. The cinematography, the writing, the acting and the topic are either good or extraordinary. Judging out of my own perspective, it has been a unique experience and I can only recommend the movie. 8/10"

It's slow paced, which pays of,because it drags you into the emotions the main character feels, and gives you at times a sticky feeling who doen't disappears until the movie is over. On the other hand, the movie feels maybe 15 minutes too long but if you have time ,it's a must."

However some of the scenes and the things that the main protagonist, a child: Agu was put through and experiences is at times hard to watch. However unreal these things are it is hard to believe that in fact the film only reflects reality, the stone cold truth of some of these more rural regions in the world where political corruption, warlords, guerrilla warfare and child soldiers are a reality. <br/><br/>This is a visually stunning film, completed with powerful lines delivered brilliantly by the cast. Abraham Attah who played Agu was a definite highlight in the film. Along with Idris Elba who gave a wonderfully disturbing performance. I think that it is very interesting that this whole event is set in an unnamed country and Idris Elba's character was simply named, 'commander'. In fact other than Agu I don't think there are any characters with a 'real name' they are either unnamed or has some sort of an alias. This to me has very special implications, it is a very interesting choice made I believe to represent that these people are simply, 'the spoils of war' those who are never going to be known or seen by the world. Which makes all of them and their experiences all the more meaningful.<br/><br/>Oddly I would say that this film is a coming of age story. But instead of slowly gradually understanding how the world works through meaningful and enriching experiences, we have this character who is basically forced to grow up, he is thrown into a world of drugs, violence and death. At the end of the day he realizes that he can no longer return to his childhood he has lost that childish innocence. <br/><br/>""I saw terrible things... and I did terrible things. So if I'm talking to you, it will make me sad and it will make you too sad. In this life... I just want to be happy in this life. If I'm telling this to you... you will think that... I am some sort of beast... or devil. I am all of these things... but I also having mother... father... brother and sister once. They loved me."" This is a modern war film that reflects 'war' in this modern day and depicts the very true aspects that are ironically not seen or known by many. In many ways the character of Agu and the many child soldiers in these more rural areas are much more experienced. <br/><br/>This is a visually stunning film, completed with powerful lines delivered brilliantly by the cast.

What follows is hard to watch but simultaneously hard to turn away from.<br/><br/>A Zeitgeist issue was exploited for Hollywood in Oscar-baiting transgender form in 2015 for Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl. Zeitgeist in 2015 was used to a far better effect in Beasts of No Nation. The issue of civil wars' human costs and refugees strikes a chord with more and more people every day, so this gritty and realistic war drama is extremely necessary viewing. This should become the definitive film on child soldiers. Speaking of child soldiers, this film also features what is possibly the greatest ensemble of child actors that I have ever seen in a film, led by the spectacular performance by the lead, Abraham Attah, who plays Agu. Somehow lending gravitas and evoking pathos that even successful adult actors fail to do, Attah outshines even the SAG award-winning Elba. The Luther star steals his scenes, making grand war speeches before leading the children into battle and charismatically talking his way out of situations, but empty underneath - which the film delves into. This masterclass of acting supports Fukunaga's direction which, through the use of colour and cinematography, creates a dynamic, harshly beautiful African landscape. For example, a scene where a character takes drugs and becomes hallucinatory turns the busy into a nightmarish jungle scene soaked with red. The score is also good: pulsating, pounding notes set the tone of intense scenes. Realism and grit define this film.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the pacing is certainly off in this film. The first act is great, setting up Agu amongst his family in the village, and the lighter tone makes this sequence entertaining, with interesting characters. The second act is even better, as Agu flees and meets the rebels under the Commandant, and most of the memorable scenes (including a brutal standout scene involving a machete), but, without spoiling anything, the third act, after some characters leave a certain place, goes somewhat off the rails in terms of pacing, despite an unforgettable trench scene. Then comes the ending which feels stunted and somewhat rushed. There are several places where it seems like it's going to end, but keeps going uncertainly, before resolving itself with a wonderful final shot. The dark brutality is interspersed with moments of levity and, towards the end, hope, yet overall Beasts of No Nation is admirably realistic. The decision to have characters talk in their own languages, which was also on display in another Netflix production, Narcos, lends to this realism. Overall, it's an intelligent and uncompromising look at what really happens to people caught in a war, and is a great watch despite its flaws. 79/100."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","8","2","3","31 January 2016"," A journey that's hard to forget
","Beasts of no nation is not an easy watch. There are truly heart wrenching scenes throughout that are shocking to watch. It depicts the true horror of guerilla warfare in Africa and puts you through some uncomfortable viewing that leaves you with more questions than answers. How can this happen? The acting itself is really impressive. Abraham Attah stole the show for me. Utterly convincing in every aspect of the story line. Idris Elba was also great - I'm sure it can't have been an easy role to play but he managed and was convincing enough. The script was very well written and really helped to highlight a voice amongst all of the madness. There were times when the band of soldiers we watch made me think of a modern uptake on Apocalypse Now's Colonel Kurtz and his followers. There was a similar other worldliness to it brought about by it's unflinching horror. It all did move at a fast pace and I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something that would have made it greater. Or perhaps it all ended in too much of a hurry. But it is what it is - and that is a very good movie."
"jdkraus","8","2","3","12 December 2015"," Compelling and Powerfulbut not the best
","This is the movie that made me join Netflix. The trailers looked very promising, and the film does not disappoint. The plot is told from the perspective of Agu (Abraham Attah), a child growing up in an unnamed African country. The first fifteen minutes provides a sense of calm and general happiness, emphasizing the childhood innocence of this boy. He has a loving family and a wild imagination. The story takes a dramatic turn when war breaks out in Agu's homeland, resulting in the separation from his family. Agu is forced into the army as a child soldier. While films like ""Blood Diamond"" and ""Lord of War"" scratch the surface on child soldiers in Africa, ""Beasts of No Nation"" takes you down to its core level. It is brutal, dark, and inhumane. As viewers, we watch as Agu transforms from an innocent boy to a brainwashed killer, under the manipulative powers of the Commandant (Idris Elba).<br/><br/>Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does not sugarcoat the barbarity. There are several moments intended to make the viewer uncomfortable, including a harsh scene where a young girl is stomped to death while a group of child soldiers laugh. Despite the graphic violence, Fukunaga does not demonize the children. The director provides us moments where the child soldiers are simply children. They play games and question what their futures will bring. It cannot be said that we necessarily like them, but given their circumstances and the lifestyle that has been forced onto them, they are understandable characters.<br/><br/>While Idris Elba has been receiving nominations (including a Golden Globe & SAG) for his role, it is Abraham Attah's performance that makes the movie. He has a talent that most child actors, and many adult-aged actors lack, the ability to convey powerful emotion without uttering a single word. Though unlikely, I hope he secures an Oscar nom for his performance. Idris Elba is convincing as the manipulative and despicable Commandant, but his British accent breaks through on several occasions, pulling me out of several key scenes. <br/><br/>The technical skills and Fakunaga's direction are nothing short of remarkable. Fakunaga acted as his own cinematographer for this movie and he does an incredible job. In some instances, he seemed to shadow Terrence Malick's work from ""The Thin Red Line"" with his selection of beautiful landscape shots, close-ups of nature, high saturation and natural lighting. The voice-over by Agu adds another layer to this compelling film as he reflects on his past experiences as a soldier.<br/><br/>While this is a very good movie, it is not without faults. The last act feels drawn out, making it longer than necessary. The conclusion is particularly weak and withholds any catharsis from the character. A more glaring problem was the thick African accents. They made the English dialogue very hard to understand. It would have been more appropriate if all the characters spoke in their native language and then subtitles were added after the fact. The first fifteen minutes were mostly subtitled, as the rest of the film should have been. <br/><br/>2016 has not been the best year of movies. However, December is the month where the greatest films are usually released. ""Beasts of No Nation"" is a compelling and powerful film, and marks one of this year's best. But I would not rank it as one of the best of all time."
"Seraphion","7","2","3","21 October 2015"," Strong, nicely built, and also scary as a war movie
","The movie did a very good job in downplaying the starting hype the trailers had made that we bring at its start. It nicely elaborates on the background of the war, the background of the focus character, and the position of the warring parties; all while delivering funny images of children's creativity and cunning. The suspense escalation is built nicely stable in increments and made sure that the audience feels the difference between the fun opening scenes and the start of the war. Then, after the conflict sets in, the audience is confronted with waves of some what disturbing images of how uncontrolled war can really take a toll on not just a child person, but also on an entire generation. The acting may seem like a standard job in overall, but the overall direction is just great. Abraham Attah looks like he can really blend in to the rest of the adult cast fairly. Idris Elba did very well in depicting the ruthlessness of the Commandant."
"max-zenz0412","9","1","1","1 April 2020"," Sad that this movie went so under the radar
","I don't know much about war and even less about the guerrilla warfare, but this movie is in my opinion trying to show what is happening and how cruelsome war and especially for kid soldiers is. How it ruins childhood.
It doesn't hide awful things but also doesn't push you into some gore.<br/><br/>I'm more than glad that i watched that movie"
"gabekhs","10","1","1","2 March 2020"," Greatest Film Ever!
","This film is an eye-opening experience through the depths of hopelessness and child soldier enlistment. We watch through Agu's eyes as the world he once knew is torn apart by an apocalyptic-like war. The Commandant is one of the most memorable villains of all time. Agu's journey is unbearable, unbelievable, and even disturbing. In this war there are no winners. Those who are free from pain, suffering, and guilt are troubled survivors. In war, the demons come for everyone."

"user-744-703090","9","1","1","1 September 2019"," As close as it can get
","At any point in time one or more African countries are experiencing civil wars. This is a generic story of a innocent but enthusiastic young boy turning into a rebel, fighting against the government of his country.
The phases of personality changes are beautifully picturised.
Idris alba is no less than brilliant.
For Agu, there couldn't be a better choice."
"SharkByteAudioProductions","10","1","1","13 July 2019"," Harrowing, honest and impactful
","Beasts of No Nation is by no means an easy, satisfying watch but it's an impactful movie that reflects the current social political climate. While some of the visual content featured here is absolutely harrowing, it does feel very humantized and the cinematography and score is stunning and euphoric. The score manages to blend African percussion with lush synthesised soundbeds which felt fresh and unique. BONN also doesn't try to fit within genre conventions and felt very genuine despite the hard hitting situations characters are placed in to. This is especially reflective in the acting from the young male lead 'Abu' who excels in emotion and desperation. It felt familiar to Blood Diamond in a sense but arguably more subtle and stripped back.<br/><br/>Idris Elba also does a great job within the film to create a character unique to his acting tool set.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie is that some details are left short and I wanted to know more and have this expanded upon - especially considering this title is standalone and not likely to receive a sequel.<br/><br/>It likely won't satisfy casual viewers but those invested in the premise will experience a powerful film."

","This film can be supposed as a audio-visual masterpiece! I loved perspectives, proper dosage of music, visual narration; aesthetic wide views and close-up scenes.

"zyuanyuanwin","8","1","1","31 May 2019"," Frightening but Astonishing
","Frightening but astonishing. The pace of the film was nicely designed. The actings and set designs are so well done that for so many moments, I started to question if whether this is real or not. The story is nicely developed that it is not too fast or too slow. The pace of plotting the story allows the film to nicely give each character enough background stories for audience to feel fully immersed. This film was recommended to me after watching ""Liyana"" with friend. In contrast of ""Liyana"", ""Beasts of Nation"" showed a different perspective and eye into a similar situation and living environment. ""Liyana"" used a more gentle and settle way whereas ""Beasts of No Nation"" brutally displays the crucial real. Thank you filmmakers for making the decision of not trying to be nice toward audiences and viewers. This is what made this film frightening but astonishing and unforgettable."
"mathieudufault","10","1","1","29 April 2019"," A brutal and sad depection of war and it's devastating effects.
","Beasts of No Nation is my favourite movie at the moment. The movie contains many mature themes revolving around child soldiers and the terrible things they must endure. It gives a realistic depiction of these tragedies and most likely will have changed your outlook on the world by the end of the film. Beasts of no Nation has some of the best child acting I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is very slow paced with intense scenes every now and then to keep it interesting for the casual viewer. If you don't like movies that are long and not action filled this Is probably not the movie for you. But if you are looking for an emotional, realistic, disturbing, in-depth and intense movie, I highly recommend."
"mshackletonchavez","7","1","1","21 December 2018"," An Important Message Of A Movie.
","A most stark, grim but enlightening feature. Incredibly told through talented direction and performances.<br/><br/>This film has many strengths and is incredible heavy in many aspects. This films greatest asset is its masterful performances, must notably of course from Abraham Attah as Agu and Idris Elba as the Commondant. The juxtaposition between Agu'a innocence and Idris Elba's corrupting cruelty onto Agu and the other child soilders.<br/><br/>This film shines a spotlight onto a topic which is highly forgotten and overlooked by most world media. And this film hits hard into the commonality of all humankind, this film focuses on a child in the most desperate of situations, it evokes emotions of mother love, fatherhood, innocence and bemusement of a child learning the world. The film portrays these most fundamental themes to a superb level, and the message it portrays is so splendidly put to screen in a highly candid and realistic feeling and evokes great emotion from any viewer.<br/><br/>The screenplay and directorial class of this film are the fundamental seeds from which this feature stems. Unlike many Netflix features which seem to blur in monostyalistic tones and cinematography, this film has a distinct voice that I haven't seen from any other Netflix film, the fact that the director and screenplay differentiate themselves so much is a great achievement in and of itself, and displays the very unique voice this film portrays.<br/><br/>The performance of Abraham Atta as Agu is one of the best child performances I have ever seen, perhaps even the best. His portra displays the childhood innocence to tormented and tortured soilderhood which such prowess and emotion. Even only 30 minutes into the feature I was rooting heavily for him and the heartbreak of being separated from his mother. His performance never lets down or weakens, and is just as strong in both languages he uses.<br/><br/>Idris Elba as the 'Commondant' is also rather a unique performance. He is a highly intimidating figure who seems like a classic 'strong man' at first but becomes highly layered, he has fears for his position and yet acts like a 'father' to his men and yet still abuses them both mentally and physically in the most abhorrent ways. This is the kind of character who is present in mangy features but here is not clichèd, one feels true fear of him.<br/><br/>The cinematography as I had already stated is very distinct from most other Netflix motion pictures. It is extremely vibrant and deeply layered, the jungles feel dense and the towns compact yet there is so much sunlight and the colours are rich. This film doesn't feel bland at all, however some of the camera work is fairly standard in places. In parts it is truly magnificent, such as when Agu runs away from his town into the jungle or near the end in the trenches. But some parts feel fairly standard in particular towards the third act of the story.<br/><br/>This film has a very unique voice. And is a great achievement in raising awareness for a part of the world that is most overlooked and humanising those who suffer. The film deliberately does not give a specific name to where it takes place to not have the burden of pre-conceived opinions on what we think of Africa and is conflicts, this is a great strength into developing emotion within the narriative.<br/><br/>Although I must say that in parts the film it feels over stretched, and a little too long to where the focus is lost in places but still holds emotional weight. And of course some of the cinematography is fairly standard, along with a slew of secondary characters who have little effect on the narritiave and serve only to develop the main character but are weakened themsevelves.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 7/10, as I was not fully ready to brace the depth and emotion of the film, and the incredible weight it delivered, but this is not a flaw of the film. Some of the previously stated parts do weight against the film, it overstays it's welcome just a little too much. But overall is a must see for anyone interested and does a great service in humanising and raising awareness against the evil that takes place in our world as is often forgotten."
"nogodnomasters","10","1","1","8 January 2018"," It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times.
","Agu (Abraham Attah) is a young lad growing up in impoverished western Africa. He lives a somewhat idyllic life under the circumstances. The film builds his family life in the background involving a war zone between the army and rebels. Through a series of circumstances, the army kills his kinsmen and Agu manages to escape and reluctantly joins forces with the rebels and vows revenge. <br/><br/>Agu has some first person narrative. He struggles with cultic aspects of the rebel army and battalion leader. He discovers they have no respect for life, but he has no alternative and curses the sun for shining on him. He realizes with death all around him, he has been robbed of his childhood, perhaps with thoughts and language well beyond his years. <br/><br/>This is not a story of hope or despair. It is a drama about life, a life that doesn't have a Hollywood ending or twist. <br/><br/>Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. English subtitles in places. I would recommend watching the film with the subtitles as the English is difficult to understand at times."

"conkli","8","1","1","30 April 2017"," Beasts of No Nation action packed
","Beasts of No Nation is a drama war film made in 2015 was about a small town in Western Africa, where a civil war broke out by military rebels, take control of the town, and kill the people of the town because they thought they were rebellion. A young boy, Agu played by Abraham Attah is escaping with his brother. When his brother is shot, and killed by the military. After running through the jungle, Agu, a good native boy, encounters Commandant, played by Idris Elba, a NDF or Native Defense Force who takes Agu under his wing to be a soldier in his militia. Agu is joined by another native boy, Strika played by Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye. And after a rough initiation, both boys join the militia. Commandant, not such a great guy, calls for Agu to go to his quarters, where he rapes Agu. Preacher, played by Teibu Owusu Acheampong, knows of what happened to Agu and gives Agu brown-brown, a mix of cocaine and gunpowder, smeared in a wound to ""lift"" his spirits. Agu and Strika are lead into many bloody ambushes and fights to take over towns by killing the people of villages that they come across. Commandant takes his battalion to the Supreme Commander of the NDF because Commandant thinks he's being promoted but only to find out that he is being demoted to a staff position and his Lieutenant is actually going to be in charge. Commandant decides to take his battalion to brothel to have fun but things go horribly wrong. One of the women shoot the Lieutenant by ""accident"". But Commandant doesn't believe the woman and has a shootout in the brothel, killing all the women and then running. The battalion is now running from their own militia, UN, and the government. They were fighting airstrikes and ambushes, Strika is killed during the ambush. The battalion now taking cover at a gold mine. Leaving them with no ammunition to be able to defend themselves, Preacher who now is the Lieutenant speaks up and says if they don't turn themselves into the UN will starve to death or be killed. Commandant doesn't want to do this but ends up letting them go after Agu speaks up. Shortly after they leave Commandant, they are captured by troops who take the young fighters to a missionary school. Agu not mingling with the other children and having nightmares from his ordeal, is reluctant to talk to his counselor because he is afraid his counselor will think he is a ""beast"" because of all the bad things he has done. Instead he decides to tell the counselor about his life as a good boy and how much his family loved him. After talking to the counselor, he found peace enough to mingle with the other children by going swimming. This film used lighting and music to bring out the strong feelings of this movie. The sound effects make this an action-packed film, that leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat"
"austinrotella","7","1","1","22 March 2017"," good and accurate
","This movie does a very good job of showing the brutality of other countries and the way that they treat their children. Throughout the movie very little is held back in the sense of visually demonstrating the harsh conditions. As they follow agu on his journey not much seems unrealistic like in some movies where certain situations are blown up and made bigger than they could ever be in person. This is however not the case in this movie, the directors obviously did their homework and looked into real event similar to the one depicted in the movie. This situation does seem very similar to the ""KONY 2012"" situation that happened years ago. All the smaller details like the initiation of agu and what he was armed with and the conditions he faced when fighting were spot on compared to actual accounts of child soldiers in many third world countries. Overall this movie does a very good job at staying interesting as well as have many historically accurate aspects to it. I would recommend this movie to someone looking for entertainment or someone looking to gain more knowledge about the growing issue with violence and child soldiers in Africa."
"MartinHafer","6","5","12","28 February 2016"," About as unpleasant as any film can be.
","I have seen several documentaries about the insane fighting throughout Africa, such as in the Congo. Rebel forces often consist of little more than private armies of mere children brainwashed into committing the worst atrocities. And, they long ago lost track of their goals of freedom or power--and are simply bend on destruction and death. The Netflix film ""Beasts of No Nation"" is a dramatization of such an army but the exact countries involved are never mentioned...and it could be one of several across the continent.<br/><br/>The film centers on a boy who appears to be about 8-10 years old, Agu. When the film begins, he's living in a zone controlled by the UN, though true to form the UN troops soon leave and the village is destroyed by government forces. Agu runs into the bush and eventually comes into contact with the rebel group, the NDF. This group is run by the Commandant (Idris Elba)--an awful combination of father, prophet, guru, rapist and the Devil. The process by which Agu is brainwashed and turned into a killing machine makes up the most of this film.<br/><br/>So is this any good? Yes and no. The film is very well made and compelling. But, it is also hellish and awful--so awful I cannot imagine anyone WANTING to see it. Viewing the film is more an endurance contest than anything else. In other words, can the viewer even watch it to the end since it's thoroughly unpleasant...so unpleasant that it makes ""Hotel Rwanda"" seem like a Disney film by comparison!! Pedophilia, rape, brutal murders and death...this is ""Beasts of No Nation"" in a nutshell. Documentaries on the same subject are easier to watch and just as informative."

","Beasts of No Nation is not a film to be seen lightly. It will not warm your heart, or lift your spirits. But it should be seen. Because it reminds us of where evil comes from in the world.<br/><br/>The story opens with Agu, a young African boy playing ""imagination TV"" with his friends, looking through the empty frame of a television set at the world around them. It's both a perfect way to set up the character as playful and innocent, and a deft metaphor for what the movie itself is trying to do. We're looking through a frame at reality. The frame might focus our attention on one thing over another, but this is really happening somewhere out there, beyond the safety of our television screens.<br/><br/>Agu lives a happy life with a happy family, but there are rumblings of trouble in the distance. Soldiers patrol his seemingly peaceful town, and his father talks of a fighting force on the move toward their home.<br/><br/>And all too soon, the war is no longer a hypothetical thing happening out of sight, it is real and present, gunshots and explosions tearing through Agu's old life and sending him on the run into the bush.<br/><br/>Out in the wild, Agu stumbles across a contingent of men led by the charismatic Preacher. They recruit Agu into their fighting force with the promise of revenge against the men who attacked his village. They put a gun in his hand. They teach him to kill. They teach him to hate.<br/><br/>Agu becomes a soldier, in every possible sense of the word. He joins in the murders and atrocities perpetrated by his company with an almost religious fervor. And yet he is still just a little boy, who longs to escape from the endless horror of war to go and do little boy things once again.<br/><br/>With Beasts of No Nation, director Cary Jo Fukunaga once again proves his considerable talent, but aside from one or two notable exceptions, there is not an overabundance of style in the film. This story is rough and brutish and true, and Fukunaga wisely avoids using too many directorial flourishes that might detract from the weight of what is happening on screen.<br/><br/>Likewise the performances from Idris Elba and child actor Emmanuel Affadzi are heartbreakingly real. In particular Elba's portrayal of Preacher, a character who could have easily been a caricature of a villain, is instead terrifyingly human, yet another somber reminder that the evil men of the world are still men. And those men were once boys who played and laughed and loved and were loved.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation is a hard movie to watch, but it's message is critical. Ultimately it is not only a tale of child soldiers in Africa, but a warning to people of every country and in every time.<br/><br/>Evil is learned. Hatred is taught. But love and good can be taught as well.<br/><br/>Read more of our reviews at www.humanechoes.com"
"MoviesAreLife93","9","3","6","15 November 2015"," An unyielding, brutal film
","""Beasts of No Nation"" is a remarkably poignant film that leaves everything on the table. It's more than a war film - it's a portrait of human suffering, brutality, loss, love, and innocence. We see everything play out through the perspective of a child, and as such, we see the devastation that war brings to innocence. The movie takes the audience on an unrelenting journey through the eyes of a child soldier. This journey is incredibly emotional, heartbreaking, and brutal. Cary Fukunaga's masterful directing never loses focus on the affect that war has on the human condition, and on the corruption of childhood innocence by the brutality of mankind. This movie is difficult to recommend to just anyone; not because it isn't a great film - which it is - but because no one takes pleasure in watching a child's life fall to pieces. No one want to see a child brainwashed into becoming a monster he never wanted to be. But the reality is....this film is reality. Child soldiers are a reality. ""Beasts of No Nation"" serves as a painful - although necessary - reminder that war scars the human spirit. Don't turn a blind eye to this movie."

","Sometimes a movie gets going with a lot of blood and violence, and you start to wonder, ""Maybe I should back out and go for another one instead?"" That wasn't the case here. In order to truly understand the intensity of the situation in Africa, it needed to be in-your-face realistic violence. Child actors rarely draw me in to a character - especially if they're acting a part that has to experience something traumatic, and haven't experienced anything close or relatable to it in real life. Abraham Attah, from Ghana, was a street vendor, not a soldier. Nor has he been in a war-riddled area. But he blew my mind with his superb and completely believable performance as Agu. Complimented by supporting actor and Hollywood veteran, Idres Elba, and other fine actors, the characterizations were flawless. When you submerse yourself into the emotion of the story, the violence stops feeling like violence. You start to realize it's a part of Agu's change from a good Christian ""boy,"" to a soulless war machine/man. A definite ""must watch."""

","A UN photographer speeding by in a white van perfectly encapsulates Fukunaga's cinematography. Each frame is rendered with the copper haze of a 70s photograph, emitting a stimulating connection between our distanced Western perspective and the film's brutal realism. Shot on location in Ghana, though never referenced by name, the majority of the runtime organically gawks at the lush greenery based in earthy browns – blending the rebels into the dense wilderness like animals. Subsequently more jarring when the Commandant leads the troop to a meeting with the General, a position he's been promised, the furnished interiors, a man in a business suit, and a breakfast spread are as equally alien to us as they are to the boys whose crude attire gives way to the mauling of the prepared meal. And in these visually audible frames, we are reminded of the bigger picture. The purging of the country's specks of civilization makes us forget that entire cites, other countries exist, making it clear to see just how fruitless, how alienated these boys have become doing, at first, all they could to survive.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/10/21/beasts-of-no-nation-review-indie-adam/"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Beasts of No Nation"" (2015) won't win the Oscar for best picture of the year nor the good leading performance by Idris Elba. Nevertheless it is a very solid film, sometimes brutal about realities in Africa, were children have to become soldiers and they day to day life. Cary Joji Fukunaga does a great job in directing, writing and shooting this film - cinematography is very good in here, it could get Oscar nomination. Directing is very solid, movie almost doesn't drag and is involving from start till finish. Although it was a bit hard to get attached to these kids doing very adult things, performances by young actors (who many of them were real soldiers) were amazing. Movie was shoot on locations and you can clearly see it and feel it. I also loved couple of long and unbroken shoots (they weren't as jaw-dropping as it was in ""True Detective"" 4th episode of season 1, but they are great in here).<br/><br/>Overall, although ""Beasts of No Nation"" isn't very original (we kinda saw these stories before), it is a very solid film. It is sometimes bloody as war itself, but it's not gross. Craftmenship of this movie is very good in all directions, and although running time 2 h 13 min are a bit to long, this is very good and watchable movie."

","'Power is domination, control, a selective form of truth'. So wrote Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka. <br/><br/>When moral ceilings are torn down, beast-like things happen. This film shares the same principles of that literary masterpiece, Lord of the Flies. <br/><br/>The emotional control exerted on the minds and hearts of the hopeless, uneducated, nothing-to-lose beasts by a psychotic, militaristic leader, is harrowing portrayed. <br/><br/>Imagine: we were all just boys and girls, innocently laughing & playing. But this was stolen from Agu. His anger because of this, is the central theme of this terrific film. But he has a prevailing hope of redemption, to be human again.<br/><br/>Idris Elba is a brilliant actor. We know that. To pull of a convincing West African accent emphasises this. An Oscar nod may come. But it is the young boy who steals our hearts. Abraham Attah - how can a boy - so young - invest himself so deeply in such a tragic figure?! Sensational.<br/><br/>Fukunaga has the potential to become a true great. The colour, rhythm and wildness of Africa is magnificently delivered to the viewers pallet. He combines sound, cinematography and art flawlessly. <br/><br/>They were just boys, they became mindless beasts. And Agu screams out for the right to be a child again.<br/><br/>Netflix is here to stay. They are the future of cinema. But I cannot help but imagine how great it would've been to see this on the big screen!! On their first outing: 9/10."

It's a very complete story about being a solder too.<br/><br/>It was also a very well done look at the politics and economic purpose of war.

"jbroc62","8","3","6","28 October 2015"," Beasts of No Nation: ""One of the most haunting films that I've ever seen...""
","Beasts of No Nation is a bold, harrowing war story filled with incredible cinematography, excellent direction from True Detective director Cary Joji Fukunaga, and amazing performances from the film's incredibly talented cast.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this is one of the best directed and shot movies of the entire year. Through his direction, writer-director Cary Fukunaga offers his audience an uncompromising look into not only the literal destruction of war, but brilliantly captures the psychological breakdown of the human spirit and its transformation from innocent to beast, hence the name of the film. Fukunaga isn't afraid to show this appalling process unfold, and the end result is magnificently haunting. Fukunaga also served as cinematographer on this film after his initial DP was injured, and the film is absolutely breathtaking to look at. It's incredibly atmospheric, and when combined with Dan Romer's engaging and moving score, the film is elevated to this sort of epic scale that you simply can't look away from.<br/><br/>Idris Elba does a fantastic job in this film as the Commandant of the army that the film centers around. His presence in the film is almost palpable, even when he isn't on screen. But while his influence on the film is absolutely magnetic, Abraham Attah, who plays a young boy taken into Elba's army, is an absolute revelation. This is his debut performance in a motion picture, and the way he symbolically captures the transition into a child soldier is absolutely extraordinary. Both deserve Oscar nominations for sure, but Abraham Attah gives what is, in my opinion, the most emotionally resonant performance of the year so far.<br/><br/>While this isn't an easy film to watch, Beasts of No Nation's is definitely a story that needed to be told. The way the story is told through following the perspective of a child soldier is a truly sobering experience, a horrific view of war that will stay with me for many years to come. That is the way this story needed to be told, and I thought it was very moving, very powerful, and one of the most haunting films that I've ever seen, and possibly will ever see, in my life."

","When I heard that NETFLIX were making a movie I was very intrigued, I simply had to see it! To be honest I was worried that it would turn out to be one of those films where the makers try to hard to make a powerful, Oscar worthy movie that never quite manages to please the viewer. Surprisingly this movie hugely exceeded my expectations!<br/><br/>First let me start by saying the acting was absolutely sensational, the best from a child I have ever seen! Abraham Attah, plays main character ""Agu"", who at the starts off as a happy, innocent young boy who gradually becomes torn apart by the war and is exposed to such a nasty way of life. Attah delivers a superbly believable performance, which I could feel the sheer terror emitting from him out of the screen. But not to mention Idris Elba who really did make this movie and was brilliantly casted! Elba plays ""The Commandent"" a nasty and monstrous man who has been plagued by the dark sides of life, who accepts Agu into the rebel army and develops a fondness for him.<br/><br/>Director Cary Fukunaga perfected this film and has made an incredibly emotional, gritty and harrowing movie, which gives the audience a very good perception on child soldier ism. I will say this movie was extremely hard to watch and is definitely not for the faint of heart. It is a truthful and incredibly powerful picture that everyone should see! My rating: 8.8/10"
"jonruff108","8","3","6","26 October 2015"," Abraham Attah gives one of the best child performance's of all time and one of the best performances of any actor of the year
","Perhaps this film's biggest issue is its pacing and length at two hours and 17 minutes. A film's length must be justified in the content shown but unfortunately this feels more like a director's cut rather than 'theatrical cut."" But maybe that's the point, considering it's a Netflix exclusive with minimal theater release.<br/><br/>First off, the film is shot *gorgeously* with a lot of experimenting done with the saturation and hues of the colors. There are also multiple ""hidden"" long takes that are nearly as impressive as the one in the first season of True Detective, also directed by Fukunuga.<br/><br/>Idris Elba gives a great and subtle performance as usual but the real star here is Abraham Attah doing unbelievable work not just for child actors but actors in general. The amount of pain he's effortlessly able to express with only his eyes is astounding. Overall, the acting throughout the movie from everyone almost makes this feel more like a documentary due to how real everything feels. This is exemplified by the sets and battle sequences that use minimal special effects to create an environment that feels real and tangible.<br/><br/>As for the story it really isn't anything we haven't seen before in film, especially if you've seen City of God. Take note, City of God and Beasts of No Nation may be similar in theme and story, but the tones and style are completely different with each one being unique in its own way (I greatly prefer the deep emotional connection I got from Agu in Beasts over the distracting shaky cam in City).<br/><br/>Overall, Beasts of No Nation is an excellent film that at times can be hard to watch. It isn't overly gory and bloody but its subject theme is highly disturbing and the development of Agu slowing becoming accustomed to war is truly riveting and emotional. The final ten minutes completely relies on Abraham Attah's performance and he makes it some of the best film making of the year.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"eddie_baggins","9","3","6","18 October 2015"," A confronting masterclass of directing and acting
","While his early films Sin Nombre and in particular Jane Eyre marked him as a talent to keep a keen eye on, it was last year's first season of True Detective that catapulted young director Cary Joji Fukunaga to not only be one of the brightest young filmmakers in the industry but a unique storyteller with more than enough artistic vision to boot.<br/><br/>Riding the tidal wave of the HBO backed show's success, viewers have been eagerly awaiting Fukunaga next move, a move which has now been finalised with the Netflix led release of Beasts of No Nation.<br/><br/>A confronting, immaculately filmed and feverish war set tale that spans one of the many conflicts that has occurred in the heartland's of Africa, Beasts is very much a tale cut from the same cloth as war films Apocalypse Now and Platoon, no mean feat yet comparisons Beasts deserves.<br/><br/>Not only directing the film but working on script duties, taking a producing credit and doing his own cinematography work, Beasts is for all shapes and purposes Fukunaga's film. It's an impressively constructed effort and for all those that may have worried Fukunaga's work on True Detective was but a flash in the pan, they can rest easy on the basis of the product he has delivered here.<br/><br/>There's a wild, almost nightmare like quality to how Fukunaga captures much of the goings on in Beasts; from the jungle set camp of the warring soldiers, the fighting scenes (in particular a mind altered look at a village battle) and the way in which our main protagonist and child soldier Agu delivers a voice-over to let the audience into his inner mindset set, Beasts is a beast of its very own, and it's all the better for it for not conforming to usual resolutions or plot progressions.<br/><br/>At the very heart of Fukunaga's film also is the delivery of one of the best child performances your likely to ever see and another feather in the cap of Idris Elba whose quickly becoming one of his generations most powerful performers. For all of Beast's artistic merits it would've fallen short at the finish line had the acting been sub-par but thankfully Fukunaga shows himself to be not only a director of skill, but a director of actors.<br/><br/>Abraham Attah as Abu is Oscar worthy, there's no two ways about it. From mischievous child to cold blooded murderer, it's an incredible turn and a haunting one. Attah's intense final scenes in the film show an ability far beyond his 14 years and to think he was plucked from a school yard for this role just makes his turn more mind boggling. Alongside his seasoned co-star in the form of Elba's charismatic yet vulnerable commandant, Beasts features some of the year's best performances and it wouldn't be surprising to see these two at next year's Oscar ceremony.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation marks the beginning of a brave new world, a Netflix led charge on feature film watching and while it's a shame many of us will never get to see this devastating beauty on the big screen, we should be more than excited for what the future holds on the basis of this no holds barred tale that shows the loss of innocence in the midst of chaos and death.<br/><br/>One of the year's best films and in many ways most shocking (a few scenes are almost unbearable in subject matter and intensity), Beasts of No Nation is yet another reason to suggest Fukunaga could well become not only one of the best filmmakers of his generation, but one the most accomplished filmmakers in many moons.<br/><br/>4 ½ screen-free TV's out of 5"
"bigmystery23","10","3","6","18 October 2015"," A harrowing, yet breathtaking masterpiece
","I've always admired Cary Fukunaga's style of filming since his first feature 'Sin Nombre.' And I was so glad that people were able to experience the skills he has after his breakout hit in television with 'True Detective.' However, 'Beasts of No Nation' boasts more to Fukunaga that 'True Detective,' 'Sin Nombre,' and 'Jane Eyre' were not able to. Fukunaga shows his humanistic nature and masterful skill of film through the mise-en-scene. He utilizes the camera to evoke the darkest parts of humanity through the colors, the emptiness of the set pieces, and the vulnerability of the actors (particularly Abraham Attah). Though the structure of the script differs from the novel it's based on, the essence of Uzodinma Iweala's words are clearly present in the best way possible. The elements of the film are also exemplary such as the eerie synthetic score, the mostly hand-held camera-work, and the editing (particularly a sequence that dazzles when the natural color of the environment fades into a sobering pink). And it would be a crime to not mention Idris Elba's transformative performance (which will leave viewers eager to see more of his talent in the future). Much like 'Sin Nombre,' this is a brutally honest depiction of the nature of violence that never ceases to make you feel uncomfortable and horrified (though it it is not as explicit as 'True Detective'). Fukunaga is not just a talented filmmaker, but he is also a sympathetic anthropologist and a culturally-engaged humanist who seeks to learn more about people and to let the world know what they are ignorant of."
"jakee_duffy","9","3","6","18 October 2015"," The most captivating and breath taking film of the year!
","Beasts of no Nation caught my full attention after seeing its intense and captivating subject matter. Fukunagas third feature film tops all of his previous work by a long- shot. Cinematography was vibrantly colorful with all around great camera direction, many shots in this film were jaw-dropping with a few brilliant long takes. Performances by Idris Elba and Abraham Attah were no doubt Oscar worthy, Attah has given the best child performance I HAVE EVER SEEN without a doubt the best of the year. The score blew me away with its dream like but also sometimes intense sound, Dan Romer goes outside the sonic box and boy does he give this film the score it needs. The story focuses on a subject matter often forgotten by the world, this film shows the brutal reality of the world and how currently nothing is being done. Of course this film gets much deeper and philosophical but ambiguity is key in all great film making so watch this film! A story that will leave tears in your eyes but make you think deeper than you have this year."
"lakamel","8","3","6","16 October 2015"," Engaging and unique, a solid and timeless film.
","There are many moments it feels similar to Thin Red Line, having qualities of a Malick Directed film. I could also sense an underlying mood of Apocalypse Now. I doubt the director intended this, and I certainly take nothing away from the final product by comparing the style. If anything it stands on it's own as a very sensual and unique look at the elephant in the room. My understanding is the film was over 10 years in the planning and completion. Though references are made to particular groups, organizations, we still get the feeling that this could be now. The director, actors and crew have successfully made a film that brings an experience into your mind. It's difficult to separate fact from fiction due to the actors ability to convince. Idiris Elba has turned in a fascinating portrayal of a leader lost, a soldier that follows until it doesn't serve his purpose. Certainly some award worthy performances but I would nod toward the crew and/or director for this one. Netflix has definitely hit the mark and is continuing to give good reason to subscribe."
"littleging12","6","4","11","17 December 2015"," This is what you call a Vegetable Movie
","Netflix's first original film ""Beasts of No Nation"" explores the horrors of child soldiers in an unnamed African country. The film is akin to disturbing historical dramas like ""Schindler's List"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" by its bleak mood, horrific realism, and its matured, well handled filmmaking. Given the film's somber and depressing tone, you could expect this film to thoroughly intrigue yet mildly entertain. However, the film is well made but mostly feels repetitive, boring, and hollow with little payoff making it a vegetable movie.<br/><br/>The film featured some impressive filmmaking but lacked some kind of spark in the story. The story felt so gloomy that it seemed near impossible to actually get enjoyment out of it unless you are some kind of sociopath. The action sequences were shot strangely so you could not really tell who was who or even what was going on. Many moments and scenes seemed redundant and directionless. For example the child soldiers lead by Idris Elba's Commandant would attack villages and kill those who they saw as enemies. This is basically all that happened throughout the entire movie! It is all the same thing without proper pacing in the story, substance in the supporting characters, and maybe most importantly nothing innovative and thought provoking to say about the current situation of child soldiers. All these flaws are noticeable at the even more frustrating ending that mounted to nothing! So basically this movie is mostly dull with little to no entertaining moments.<br/><br/>However there were some silver linings to this movie. The acting was great with some very believable characters particularly Idris Elba's Commandant. Also to mention Abraham Attah, who played Agu, did a fine job portraying Agu though Idris Elba did steal the show from him. The sets and special effects were superb given the lower budget of the film. The sets seemed extremely accurate to African terrain. The writer/director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed season one of ""True Detective,"" did a solid job of writing and directing; although it did not reach the same heights as ""True Detective."" Basically, this movie was well made and did not have any dumb generic clichés most Hollywood movies suffer from. In a nutshell, the film is intelligent and Fukunaga handled the material respectfully.<br/><br/>So how exactly did the term vegetable movie come about? Well what it basically means is that the movie was good but not entertaining. It was an important informative movie that recycled a disturbing message on child soldiers by showing people the horrors that occur today. Yet at the same time the movie failed to entertain, which you could make an argument for that the number one job of a movie is to entertain. So just like vegetables, which are good for you but not well liked amongst teenagers, ""Beasts of No Nation"" is a good movie for someone to watch to learn from. Yet at the same time it will not entertain. If you want to be informed and entertained, some movies similar to this one that are more compelling are ""Blood Diamond,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" and even ""Captain Phillips."""

"thefilmlawyers","8","2","4","21 October 2015"," For those who disliked True Detective Season 2, Beasts of No Nation is your salvation
","Greetings everybody, Chulbul-Pandey has arrived on the scene! This week, we decided to take a look at the movie Netflix is pushing as the one that will break down the boundaries between streaming and cinema: Beasts of No Nation.<br/><br/>How many have you enjoyed the visceral nature of Apocalypse Now, and the focus on characters within war rather than the war that The Thin Red Line masterfully explored? More than anything else out there, Coppola and Malick's masterpieces are the most suitable points of comparison for the effect of Beasts of No Nation. After being battered by explosions and gunfire that are then interspersed with some horrifying plot developments, you leave the film and wear the same deep stare employed by its characters. After completion, it is easy to forget the charm of of the film's first ten minutes, where Abraham Attah's Agu (in his brilliant film debut) playfully hustles Nigerian soldiers into buying the shell of his father's television set. It is reminiscent of another classic film, City of God, where the exuberance helps in drawing you into the world of the children. That's what makes the subsequent scenes that much more impactful, as darkness replaces the lighthearted nature of the introduction and pulls the viewer in towards experiencing the multiple horrors alongside Agu.<br/><br/>The final two hours is a gut-wrenching barrage of misery and brutal dilemmas, one after another. The narrative thread seemed to be very loose which seems purposeful, with the film utilizing child soldiers who most likely would not know what they experienced on the battlefield. There were multiple times throughout the film where I wondered how the plot would proceed but the characters and events they experienced outweigh any issues with a loose narrative.<br/><br/>The overarching point that the film drives home is about the aimlessness of the mission, with it stressing that war is much bigger than the soldiers fighting. Peace is not as easy to come by once the war -or any war- reaches its conclusion. Agu and his fellow child soldiers are fighting for a future that they will not be able to find solace in, from the living and economic conditions that tend to succeed war, nor from the inner peace that will not come about due to the atrocities they have committed. Similar to Malick's aforementioned The Thin Red Line, the relationship with God in war is challenged; it is questioned whether it is at all possible for one to have any spiritual happiness after committing such massive sins. The film plays up the poor foresight in war, with brief segments such as a visit to the higher-ups serving to illustrate in very clear terms that war indeed benefits nobody on the battleground. The film does not preach these messages via endless exposition, instead relying on the fact that viewers will understand it from the way the events of the film have played out.<br/><br/>Abraham Attah absolutely marvels in his role, stealing the show in delivering a performance that will rightfully generate awards buzz in the coming months. His performance keeps viewers immersed in the film, eagerly following along with the multiple dimensions of his character, whether he is soaking in events or lashing out against them. Idris Elba played his role to a T, and helps in providing ""Hollywood"" legitimacy to a film that had no other major film or television actors outside of the Brit. He teeters undefinably on the line between being a manipulative villain and manipulative mentor, turning in the sort of performance that makes one gradually change their perception of his character. The film's most dramatic moments are quite familiar, as they are staples witnessed multiple times in numerous other war films. However, Beasts stands out for having a young boy as its lead character that experiences the atrocities of war. It is a great performance from the cast when one can say that it more than held its own in comparison to a Hollywood star the likes of Elba.<br/><br/>Cary Fukunaga, he of True Detective (Season 1) fame, displays some wonderful cinematography. While the film does not blow you away with the same tricks as True Detective (that 6 minute 1-take scene is one of the all-time great scenes on Television), it has its superb moments. Fukunaga's style favors ambient music over montages of the war scenes and while that makes it flow together it also means that its surprises fall by the periphery. It is easy to see this playing well on Netflix, with the full court push already on by the streaming network combining with the publicity generated by theater boycotts of the film generating some additional hype. Employing a graininess filter of sorts to the film added further authenticity to the film, but said filter thankfully does not deter from what was a beautifully shot film throughout. For any fans of photographer Richard Mosse, Fukunaga pays homage to his iconic Africa photograph with one scene that was outstanding both for its integration into the narrative as well as for how it served to spruce up a film focused on demolished African villages and vegetation.<br/><br/>With such a strong lineup of films still to be released in the final three months of 2015, Beasts will have an uphill climb trying to find its way onto awards ballots. With Attah's remarkable performance as well as the subject material covered, Fukunaga may not experience as much of a climb as it seems. For any fans of the aforementioned The Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now or just anybody that wishes to experience a war story outside of the usual ""war over character"" format, the film should be a no-brainer.<br/><br/>On that note, Chulbul-Pandey bids thou adieu.<br/><br/>Beasts of No Nation earns a very respectable A-"

","Never reviewed a film before, and probably never will again.<br/><br/>It's been a long day out today. Personal/family/relatives type stuff. Got home a little before midnight needing to chill out. Nothing on the regular TV, so flicked Netflix on and oooh! It's the 16th that new film is on there. Let's see what if it's any good, after all it's Idris Elba and let's face it he's pretty damned good in everything I've seen him in up till now.<br/><br/>So, the film. It's all about a young boy's experiences in an unnamed African country experiencing a civil war. The kid, Agu, starts off as a normal young lad enjoying life, trying his luck and generally being a cheeky little bu**er. The imagination TV is a stroke of genius, and yeah, I'd buy one. He's a kid growing up in a worn torn country and that war is rapidly approaching. Bang. The war has caught up, and Agu finds himself stranded in the middle of it. In steps Idris Elba (the Commandant), saves him from an early demise, and recruits him into the rebel army. From this point on it's pretty much all spoilers, other than to say you're now going to be subjected to a pretty graphic view of war from a ten/eleven/twelve year old's point of view. This kid goes through some serious s*it, and trust me, you can see that.<br/><br/>Abraham Attah the young actor who plays Agu is utterly brilliant and without doubt, the star of this particular film. Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye (Strika), Agu's cohort and the nearest thing to a friend, is again, utterly brilliant even though he hardly speaks. These two boys, and yes that's what they are, really make you feel what it's like to walk, and survive, through a war. This is harrowing stuff. Kids should be allowed to be kids. They need to play and enjoy the experiences of life before the serious stuff starts. There's one scene where they are actually managing to do just that, and play. All of a sudden you're reminded that these are children who have fingers, and, as Idris puts it early on in the film, ""have fingers and can pull a trigger"".<br/><br/>I seriously doubt that this is a film that would ever have been made through the conventional means. Netflix allowed Cary Joji Fukunaga pretty much total control over how this film was to turn out, and as far as I'm concerned they were right to do so. This guy obviously has a real talent for producing a film that is both beautiful and terrifying to watch. It's a brutal film, with little left to the imagination. It's a beautiful film, excellently shot. It's a disturbingly psychological film about young boys at war. It's a film that will make you sit up and think, while at the same time wishing it would go away. It's going to be one of those films that you need to see.<br/><br/>If I have any real criticism whatsoever, and this really is nitpicking, it's got to be the guy that drew me into watching it in the first place. Idris Elba. Now don't get me wrong, he provides yet another class performance here, although just once or twice the accent slips a little, and I am only talking a half a dozen words in the entire film. Ah, hell, he's only playing a supporting role, so we'll cut him a little slack. Yeah, that's right, the guy with the big Hollywood name isn't the star of this one. All the nitpicking aside, and it's nitpicking to the n'th degree, I would be well surprised if this one doesn't produce a couple of Oscar nominations. It really is that good.<br/><br/>Watch it, see what you think. Disagree with me if you like, but I'll still be looking forward to the next Netflix original because I reckon that the regular studios are suddenly going to find themselves with a whole new battle on their hands. It's time to throw away the formula, and let's get down to some seriously good cinema"

","This is Netflix first feature film and idris Elba is in it so I was interested and I really liked this film. This film focuses on a child who gets rescued by a military commandant who forces him to become a child soldier. Now the kid in this movie is really good and I wouldn't be surprised if we see him popping up in more things after this film. I bought him as this child soldier that was forced to do these horrible acts as his innocenece is becoming more and more lost. Obviously the biggest and best actor in this film is obviously idris Elba as the commandant and he is fantastic in this film. He was great as the commandant and even though he is an evil character you can see why these kids would believe in him because he is very charismatic. A problem with this film is that their are parts of the film where it trys to make you care about other characters and you really don't. The story is great as you see this boy and his life develop in the hands of this terrible situation. Also the end if this film really delivers in my opinion. The script has some pretty good dramatic dialogue but sometimes it was hard to understand some of the dialogue which was a negative. The style was pretty brutal and it was very good in my opinion with a great blend of story and action which really worked. Overall this film was a big surprise to me and I thought it was great."

There is not much context given on the greater picture about the war. But no one should actually care because it is about what war does to the people.<br/><br/>The outrageous performance of Abraham Attah is crucial for the films effect.

Abebrese) and baby sister (played by Vera Nyarkoah Antwi) as they fled in an already overly crowded car to escape the turmoil that their small town soon faced as the military and rebels zoned in closer to their home. Agu was faced with the evil of the ""witch woman"" (played by Grace Nortey) of his town as she swore not to know the family. The woman believed they stole her land for refugees to live on and felt revenge was best to deal with them. This sealed the fate and death of the father and brother. As Agu was able to flee the execution when his father told him to run, he was not so lucky, as he had been recruited by soldiers. The soldiers were led by the commandant (play by Idris Elba). Although the commandant saved Agu by taking him in, he also put him in harm's way by recruiting him as a child soldier and also raping him along with another boy by the name of Strika (played by Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye). Strika a mute, soon became close friends with Agu, until his untimely death. Strika's death was the turning point for Agu, he no longer feared the commandant or death, deciding to stand with Rambo (played by Zabon Gibson) to leave the commandant and surrender to the military due to not having basic necessities such as food and water. The theme of an African civil war, child soldiers, and mass killings was similar to the 2004 film Hotel Rwanda, which was based on a true story. The terrorizing of African people in the name of politics made this film frightening realistic yet outstanding. Although the film was entertaining, the thought and realization of entire families being ripped apart due to land, money, or materialistic resources is unsettling. It is a sad reality of the world we all live in, and is a constant reminder that many countries are truly going through this terrorism in their everyday lives, all in the name of politics."

","Can we fix what is happening to our people? ""Bullet is just eating everything, leaves, trees, ground, person. Eating them. Just making person to bleed everywhere."" - Agu (Beasts of No Nation) When not finishing your food and throwing the rest away, there is always that one person who says ""there are kids in Africa who are hungry"" always trying to make you feel like crap for not finishing your meal. Yes you're full, but now you want to grab the thrown away left over that was on your plate and just eat it just because of what that one person said. Society will always look at Africa being such a huge poverty driven country, and unfortunately, a lot of us know that it won't change unless a miracle happens. Mothers are being raped and killed just for being innocent in their living. Children are being turned into soldiers and put against their own will just for the sake of living, but it's honestly not life as what they are going through. But we could be forgetting the fact that not only is this happening in Africa, but other countries in the world we live in. Africa is an easy target to try and figure out their problems but what about places like China or the Middle East. This isn't nothing new. We say that Africa just goes through starvation and nothing, that's the only thing we ever look at, there is so much more. Like in the film ""Beast of No Nation"" everything changes, everyone's point of view on how life really is instead on how others put it, changes. Simple as that. Yes, hunger is big issue that could potentially be resolved and yes it is a difficult task on resolving this issue but there is so much more that citizens in Africa are going through and it's an understanding that we all need I read this quote, ""People in Africa are not poor, they are robbed"". We realize and have been realizing this since birth that society can help to uplift a country in poverty and there are people out there that can make a change and not just in Africa, but many different other country. What we don't really see is the process of them getting robbed, that maybe one day the people out there started out good, maybe not great, but there living was comfortable until there government takes it away along with family members too. Money and food and stability are such huge deals that citizens in Africa would do absolutely anything and everything to help their families out. I don't blame them, in fact a lot of people don't blame them, but a lot of us who were born in a comfortable environment here in the states, have a great tendency to take things for granted on an everyday basis which to me is a normal thing, not necessarily good, but everyone does it. Some are worse than others but we still do it. More than seventy percent of the citizens living in the continent of Africa are living in poverty and good majority of that percentage is because of the government taking away almost all of what they have had. <br/><br/>The film ""Beasts of No Nation"" touches this subject so well. A young boy (Agu), very family oriented tries to live to a happy life with family and rapping for fun with friends during the African war. His story only made me imagine of how really the kids in Africa are living during a difficult war era. A boy so harmless and skinny has no choice but to listen to an unknown commander who found him in the middle of the woods after having to see his family killed from the government. The commander brainwashes him into something that's not true. Yes, Agu survived but his survival was nothing compared to the person he later turned out to be. It's hard because children, just like Agu , are currently going this same situation if not worse and that hard to understand. He had no choice to run in hopes to live and survive. The commander turned him into something he's definitely not, as Agu was newly exposed to killings and the smell of death; he became very used to his new life. The film was based on a story in 2005 but yet the same situation is happening now if not a lot worse than this film has portrayed it. We hear and see celebrity saying or announcing how many charities they will open up for the hungry in places like Africa, but when we see homeless wanting some money for food out in our cities, we look away as if we didn't see anything. It's very understandable to help a third world country out, but I honestly like more of the help the better, and not just might building school and sending aid there way, but by trying to do something about the government of their countries and give them what they need just so they could leave the citizens at peace, but I feel like even that won't work for them."
"hansmoleman-519-633342","5","3","8","2 May 2016"," Atrocity after atrocity - but difficult to get through
","Beasts of no Nation, meant as a grim and accurate depiction of the brutality and horror of an African conflict, is visually striking but difficult to watch (not just because of the atrocities, but also due to not having much of a plot).<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a bit of Full Metal Jacket (all scenes after the training camp), in that it jumps from location to location and is image after image of brutality, but without a particularly defined plot. In Beasts of No Nation the viewer follows a band of marauders that murder, rape, pillage in the most gruesome ways possible.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone would argue against that war is all hell, and the savagery in African conflicts can reach unspeakable levels, but more than two hours of brutal violence is perhaps more than necessary."
"fil-nik09","7","2","5","1 December 2015"," Not bad
","I just finished watching the movie and ... Well, I am torn what to say exactly.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie : war - is done really realistically. And although it is not said where it is going on, you can say that all that is happening can and is happening everywhere where war is going on.<br/><br/>The movie is seen through the eyes of the young boy who is 10 or something and that gives the movie its powerful note and powerful message which is anti-war ( I guess) .<br/><br/>There is a scene where children fighters after the battle are playing hide and seek in the fields. I think that that scene portraits the most powerful message of the movie: these are children who should be playing these kinds of games every day of their childhood, yet, they are killing people and fight and do drugs and all horrible things that war brings with it.<br/><br/>Maybe I am not really a fan of war movies and there were parts / moments that I found the movie a bit boring... but, all in all, not a bad one.<br/><br/>I was hesitant between six and seven, but giving a seven rating as the acting of everyone war really really great! From the main cast to those who are just 'passing' through the movie."
"jadepietro","9","2","5","5 November 2015"," African Violence
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: Violent and brutal, the film exposes a difficult subject that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+<br/><br/>Agu is a survivor. His family torn apart due to political unrest in his war-torn African village, he is caught up in a violent civil war and later recruited into a warlord's army in Cary Fukunaga's brutal and riveting film, Beasts of No Nation.<br/><br/>￼We moviegoers are thrown into this chaos almost immediately. We see the before and after of the casualties of war: a once innocent young boy and the product of a loving family slowly weaned into a role of a violent child soldier. This chilling transformation is shown in the graphic details: his brutal initiation into the tribal army, his sadistic training sessions, his first killing, tensely staged in one of the bloodiest sequence in years. This is a unsettling film, not for the squeamish. (Be forewarned: Although the violence is never gratuitous, it is still a non- stop assault on your senses. I couldn't help but think if showing less would have had a more effective impact.) <br/><br/>￼Agu watches as the war escalates around him and he tries to comprehend its insanity. Psychologically indoctrinated into these acts of butchery by a crazed rebel leader, the Agu essentially loses his childhood innocence. It is a heart-wrenching series of events we witness and the film depicts these atrocities upfront and personal.<br/><br/>Expertly written and directed by the talented Mr. Fukunaga (who also was the chief cinematographer as well), Beasts of No Nation is well-made but literally ultra-realistic in its execution. His vision is consistently strong and the director effectively shows the ravages of war with numerous in-your-face close-ups. The film's earlier images of children playing with a discarded television set or sibling rivalry between brothers sharply contrasts with the many scenes of senseless carnage. Sometimes the film overloads on the combat and killings and overstates its case. Many of these scenes become derivative and are, at times, unwatchable due to their graphic nature. <br/><br/>￼The acting between the two leads is exceptional. Idris Elba is excellent as the remorseless mercenary commandant, although one wishes there would be more character development into the makings of this monster. His interaction with first-time actor, Abraham Attah as Agu are so intense and believable. Attah, in his film debut, is outstanding in his sympathetic portrayal of the boy soldier. It is one of the most compelling and natural examples of acting ever given by a non-professional child actor.<br/><br/>Shocking and powerful, Beasts of No Nation deserves to be seen. The subject may be disturbing, but it shows the evil that continues to fester in another part of the world. Serious moviegoers and Netflex subscribers, pay heed.<br/><br/>￼Note: Premiering in movie theaters the same day as it was streamed to subscribers, Beasts of No Nation was produced and released by Netflix as their first project. This excellent film has been ceremoniously dumped and boycotted by major theatrical chains fearing this competitive practice to be the future of filmmaking. Movie theaters sabotaged any success the film may have had and, as punishment, the film never received any distribution, being sorely ignored. A sad state of affairs.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"BGallemore","8","2","5","19 October 2015"," One of the better movies this year.
","This film is all about Agu. Initially, a very innocent boy. He loses all of his family from death and evacuation due to a civil war in his home country. He escapes and a group of rebels find him and the leader, Commandant (played by Idris Elba), recruits him. This film definitely does a great job of portraying the horrors of these on-going civil wars in Africa. The director does a great job of drawing you into a feeling of concern for this young boy because of his innocence. By the end of the movie he has killed men, leaving him very changed. I thought the ending could have been better. The route they took needed a better way to close out the story. However, the acting was great. The great acting actually carried much of the movie. I'm curious to see where the boy who played Agu goes with his new career. Overall, I recommend this film. It fills the genre nicely and won't leave you regretting watching it."
"bedir_memmedli","3","3","11","5 December 2016"," Too Brutal
","I completely understand that this movie reflects real tragedy happening now in most African countries - on one hand, we see dictators who have accumulate their countries' wealth in their hands and use their power/military to get richer and repress anyone who gets on the way and on the other hand uneducated power-hungry disconnected oppositions with each believing that it is the sole owner of these resources and therefore entitled to everything that its country has at whatever cost. But, in the meantime, I don't think it was necessary to show all these brutal scenes that I found very discouraging and inconvenient. I was even thinking about inviting my son to watch it together, but I am glad I didn't do this. Anyway, I stopped watching it after seeing how a little girl who was hiding with her mother was tortured and after that I don't know what happened. Yes, we get it and nowadays there are many resources to learn about child soldiers and all the brutalities taking place in the continent. So, was it necessary to include these inhumane vicious scenes? I don't think so! To me it was just an attempt to gain cheap reputation."
"jimmycoffin-751-212853","6","2","6","14 March 2019"," Great but nothing i Will watch again
","Definetly a movie that numbs you. It has almost the same drozy headache inducing feeling like apokalypse now. And its about children wich makes it worse. And well..harder to appriciate the movie. It's unreal that kids gets brainwached and become little killing machines and its also unreal that Africa in this modern day can't stop the terrors that often happens there. It's one of the Biggest continents but still. It's the same problems there always been. starvation, deseases, wars, rebel gerillas, poatchers, genocide, never had a proper governance in their life. This is how african movies always have been portraid. Every news Iv'e ever read etc. Destroying the rainforest, killing gorillas, all the innocents that dies. It's never a pleasant view and it doesnt need to be. I'm lucky i was born in europe. Thats like everything im thinking.
Just tired of watching this type of movies. It's like Reading bad news every day you get depressed and feel bad.
Beasts of no nation is a very well-made film.
Great acting and war effects. It's a doom ride for sure.
But is it an good movie? I just don't know..
It's like.. city of god 2?
Same stuff different cloak"
"ajsf_2","7","2","6","21 October 2015"," How is this movie? All right, Sir!
","In my opinion, the movie was better in the beginning when Agu loses part of his family (father, brothers), and sees her mother leave. Then, he becomes a war child. This reminds me of Blood Diamond movie. It's not so good, but it's still a very nice war drama. The kid acting was great, and Idris Elba was OK. I don't think it's enough to get him a nomination for best supporting actor, but I feel like the movie can join the list of Best Motion Picture nominees. Since IMDb doesn't allow me to publish this review because there are not 10 lines, I will keep writing random stuff like this for example I like to eat icecream during summer time and even at Christmas, it tastes so damn delicious."
"bangkitmandela","7","1","2","16 September 2017"," A typical war drama
","War drama used to exploits character to its core. By giving hard story imposed to its protagonist, the audience obliged to relates themselves by constant reminder that life is nothing but series of tragedy. Unfortunately, Beasts of no Nations are no different. Except that it offer darker tone than, -for example, City of God that also issued similar problem about child of war. <br/><br/>Beasts of No Nations take a close look of child soldier in Africa that separated from their family in the midst of regional conflict. These child fueled by hatred, are easy pick to be trained into sudden soldier in field. They are ready to be shaped and not well adjusted to cope with trauma. This preference are proved by the scene where Commandant ordered Agu to kill a grown educated man, because he knows that the man no longer able to be manipulated and the best use of the man is only as living prove to maintain his total power.<br/><br/>What its offer that has not yet I saw in another war drama, is the detail of soldier's inauguration, or particular rites of passage. The early shouts that made Agu stand still, yelling out his loyalty while at the same time retained his existence, are well illustrated. The rest of rites are apparent sacred, with many hint of fascism. Still, due to its based on novel from the same title, it bears portion of qualm that cannot be taken at face value. <br/><br/>His development from child to a beast is remarkably started, not after his rites completion, but the first premature kill that defined his actual changes and shifting his moral ground. Agu's inner voice while he talk to himself by using God as instrument, is our checkpoint each time he deprived from child nature. <br/><br/>We could see from the beginning that Agu's family is a typically moderate in term of religion which mark them as ideal family to begin with. They understand problem that lies around and acts accordingly, while still cares for others without doubt. They hold high regards of others, which placed them with better moral position from the rest. Such innocent family that deserve no place at this war. While this serves as prior motive for us to take more sentiment from the protagonist, this family-based narrative device are easily found everywhere else. <br/><br/>The mother issue aren't resolved. It is compelling to say that the director tried to send us back to final tragedy that Agu had lost all hope of return to his old life. Yet, the final act that Agu started to make peace with himself are pretty straightforward and well closing the movie in proper manner, like the rest of its structure. Good, but not extraordinary."
"dbradley-64894","7","1","3","28 April 2018"," Should Have Been Foreign Language
","I lived in Sierra Leone. To me, the story borrowed from the Charles Taylor catastrophe that wracked that beautiful country. <br/><br/>I feel that the director took the pidgin English too far. The longer the movie went on the more irritated I became. <br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that by the time it was finished I was of the opinion it was a racist hatchet job by a Western director. It even had me questioning why Idris Elba put his name to this.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the acting performances were good to excellent. The cinematography was often top class too. Just a shame that the movie was undermined by stupid decision to overuse pidgin English."
"rick-jatti","5","2","11","8 February 2016"," I couldn't finish it
","It started off great. Few war movies are so inspiring. Idris Elba was amazing, and I think Abraham Attah could give Haley Joel Osmont a run for his money in the ""Best Child Actor Performance of All Time"" category. The cinematography was great, the landscape in which it was shot was a beautiful jungle, the murder of Agu's dad and brother and the first couple of battle scenes were touching, and the Commandant and Agu were both inspiring and very admirable characters. But then it took a sick, twisted turn for the worse.<br/><br/>I read the synopsis. I think it's safe to say that 90% of people who watched this movie would've hoped it went a different way. Everything about the film was great, except for the plot itself. The Commandant became a rapist, and Agu became a druggie.<br/><br/>Why? Why couldn't this have been a movie about an army of African child soldiers led by an inspiring revolutionary who overcame odds and defeated the government? But no, this has to be a messed up story about a revolutionary leader who gives a whole speech to Agu about how he sees leadership in him, and then proceeds to rape him. His speeches talked about the rape prevalent in their country that was a result of the government, yet he is a perpetrator of it himself!<br/><br/>I know this was based on a book, and people would've been outraged if it was a bad adaption and left things out, so I guess I'm targeting the author here, but why couldn't it have been at least half of a happy story? Lots of movies end with the antagonists winning, but usually we are secretly rooting for them in some way, or at least something decently good happens. Nothing positive takes place in this movie. Nothing at all.<br/><br/>If there were no drug problems, no rape, and the Commandant faithfully led his battalion without any worries about pay or twisted fantasies, and then they failed, then I would've been okay with it. But this movie just doesn't please the viewer at all.<br/><br/>I know that there are many stories like this in Africa, and screwed up events like this take place, probably more often than anyone would expect, but this movie fails to present a point it is trying to make or a theme they are trying to bring out that most movies in which the opposite of what the viewers want to happen usually have. It's just disappointing."
