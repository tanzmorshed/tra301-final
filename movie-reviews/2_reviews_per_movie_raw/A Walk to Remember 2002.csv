"uds3","Null","288","316","28 June 2002"," Purity and beauty for the traditional romantic.
","I don't know - I'm way too old for a middle life crisis, maybe its the onset of dementia, but this film really got to me. Never in all these years have I come across as beautiful and pure a character as Jamie Sullivan - and to think I gave MTV the flick whenever Britney-clone Miss Moore, started up her song of the month. Call it manipulative, unrealistic, contrived, saccharine, whatever your pleasure - but I absolutely lost my heart to Mandy Moore's character here.  Perhaps the deep-rooted protective instinct in my nature, maybe a reminder of what I never found but always desired, but I would be lying if I did not admit to falling totally in love with Jamie, matter of fact that would be an understatement.<br/><br/>An impossible blend of strength, integrity, natural beauty, youth, feistiness, femininity and vulnerability - Mandy Moore delivered a performance so genuine and moving it totally stunned me. She was utterly spellbinding in every scene she was in - which was most of them. I thought her rendition of ""Its gonna be love"" during the school play was cinematic magic. She was for those moments, every man's dream and the epitome of virginal translucence.  <br/><br/>I was impressed too with Shane West's performance who at times was so reminiscent of a young Kevin Bacon somewhere around his FOOTLOOSE days. At times I agree, the film seemed to be headed down THE MAJESTIC path of over-sentiment but I'm sorry guys, I don't care. So long as Jamie was on-screen ripping my emotions apart, the rest really didn't matter!  What a stunning performance from so young a girl with barely any acting experience. The mere fact that this flick has pulled an everage user rating of 6.6 would suggest a LOT of people liked it. It blows LOVE STORY totally out of the water. On reflection, it is the film's very simplicity, lack of  pretension and strong supporting actors that serves it so very well.<br/><br/>By the way, it does so help being a hopeless romantic!"
"cvxfreak","10","387","436","26 November 2004"," Succeeds where it counts
","I'm a 17 year old male teenager who happened to stumble upon this movie two years ago at school during a free day in math class (when I was 15). I liked it then, but the math class ended before the movie could be finished. Finally, on the WB a few days ago, the movie aired and I saw the conclusion. AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie, two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. The situations that occur are very real, and very sad. Once the movie finishes, you'll be left wondering what happens to everyone (heck, even though it doesn't make sense, I want a sequel!).<br/><br/>As a maturing male, I couldn't help but cry inside, and I'm someone who felt indifferent toward movies like Titanic. I found myself wishing I were either Landon or Jamie, because they represent the real virtues of life and love. Aside from the movie's undying message, there are some slight flaws. The ending could have been expanded a bit more (you'll see when you watch it as I don't want to spoil anything) to include more emotion. Otherwise, the acting done by Mandy Moore and Shane West is superb and top notch - these two actors have quite the career ahead of them. You'll see as these two characters develop that you can't imagine any other people doing the job.<br/><br/>This isn't your typical love story, because when it comes down to it, the love is only part of the whole scheme. While I never expected this to touch me so much, AWTR enters as perhaps my favorite movie of all time. You will feel as if you're a part of the movie, you will be able to relate to them, and you will love it. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. Available on DVD now, you'll be wishing the release had deleted scenes, et. all. Highly recommended."

","This was one of the best films I've seen lately. Mandy Moore shone in her role as Jamie Sullivan, although never to the point where she became unbelievable. Her singing was fabulous, but it was clear that this was not a film about her singing - too many pop artists starring in films wind up in films about their pop careers, whether real or inferred.<br/><br/>The storyline was VERY good. I can't say too much without spoiling it for everyone else, but take my word for it. You absolutely must watch this film at some point - make sure you grab plenty of tissues though, because if you don't get emotional towards the end, you must have a heart of stone.<br/><br/>All in all, fantastic."
"MLDinTN","Null","249","297","28 January 2003"," surprisingly good
","This movie doesn't have an original plot, but it is good because of the 2 leads give wonderful performances.  Mandy Moore is especially good as the straight-laced preacher's daughter.  And I liked how they showed the transformation of Shane West's character.  It was very believable. Of course, the ending won't leave you dried-eyed.  It's sad, but we get to witness a sort-of ""miracle"" as the film puts it of how a wayward teen turns his life around.  The music was great too.<br/><br/>
FINAL VERDICT:  I definitely recommend this. It isn't just some teen movie. The film has depth and the acting is much better than you would expect."

","I can not say that A Walk to Remember was a movie that I went out of my way to see, or even that I recall it being aired in any UK cinema. I happened to watch it on TV one Sunday morning expecting something somewhat usual and predictable.<br/><br/>I must admit I was more than pleasantly surprised, enough so to actually watch it more than once, and consequently feel compelled to write these comments. I find myself struggling not to watch it whenever I see it listed, such a charming movie is this! The plot seems to be initially a rather predictable foray into the traditional territory of bad boy meets good, but sadly plain girl. At some point in the movie, girl momentarily transforms from ugly duckling into swan. At this point I found myself feeling that comfort that we all feel in the knowledge that we know exactly what is going to happen in a movie. I was entirely convinced that the entire culmination of the thing is for girl to gain some peer group acceptance. The presence of a seemingly overly protective father hints at overtones that he may be some kind of parental tyrant figure from whom she may require some sort of heroic liberation.<br/><br/>However as Jaime reveals her secret then all becomes apparent, and a far more absorbing plot unfolds than is initially to be expected.<br/><br/>Performances are competent and heartfelt, Shane West gives an admirable portrayal of an angry young man on a path of reformation. Mandy Moore is strong and almost graceful in her role as Jaime and enhances the charm of this romantic interlude with several pretty vocal solos.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah and Peter Coyote both fine actors add a lovely depth to the general proceedings and are certainly worth a mention for their respective roles as concerned parents.<br/><br/>It is impossible for me not to like this little film, because I am an insufferably romantic female and A walk to Remember has romance in a monumental dosage. There is little or no sexual content, rather emphasis is put upon the more admirable and sincere aspects of courtship little seen in the average teen movie.<br/><br/>Without going into territory that could be classed as spoiling, it is worth mentioning that some people may place A Walk to Remember into the tear- jerker category, and consign it to a dark dusty corner of their DVD collection which is only delved into in the most girly of moments.<br/><br/>For some, several scenes may be a little too saccharine- but if you don't like romance then this picture probably isn't for you anyway.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this category is a little too narrow to slide A Walk to Remember into. The true themes of this lovely story are in reality- faith, and redemption, which are universal aspects of humanity with which we can all identify in various amount.<br/><br/>The end result for me was that I felt uplifted at the end. Like eating a tub of ice cream or having a nice bubbly bath this is a movie to put on when you feel low or have had a bad day and it's sure to make you feel much better. You will fall in love for the first time all over again for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>You may well sit down to watch with preconceptions about what you are going to see. You men may sit down and watch it solely to win a few merit points from your girlfriend so she'll let you watch the football in peace later. As my title says though, this may be the one romantic movie you will hate yourself for loving.<br/><br/>You don't even have to admit to anybody that you watched it and liked it, but I encourage you to watch it all the same without prejudice.<br/><br/>A little charmer- comforting and sweet- sets out to do something very simple, and delivers well, I give 7/10"
"johanneszor","10","90","104","19 April 2008"," A personal opinion
","Let's get this straight: <br/><br/>It's not an artistically excellent movie. It is not a movie with performances that are going to constitute landmarks in the acting profession. It is not a movie with high-end special effects, storming action or astounding scenery. It is not a story that copes with the deepest causes of adolescent misbehavior / frustration / desperation in the sense of a purely sociological cinematography. It can be characterised light (although it includes sadness as a feeling) and shallow (because in its limited duration the director does not have the convenience of ""looking"" deeper into the characters and - at the same time - include an extensive plot which must be given in order to see a considerable change in Landon's personality) <br/><br/>I could go on giving cons about this film but I am sure you can find many in previously posted negative reviews - and many of these reviews, more or less, hit some quite substantial spots about the film. BUT...<br/><br/>I gave it 10 out of 10 for a single simple reason: whatever its flaws, it made me cry unashamedly and that's something that not a lot of movies can claim, in all honesty. And despite the sadness it inevitably brings (which is not necessarily bad) it also brings innocence, sweetness, optimism - yes, that too - and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change, the ability - and the obligation - to become better. It is a movie-edition of an adorable book, and as always, it cannot be better than the book. However, in its own scope it brings out the message quite clearly, quite beautifully, and quite optimistically. It is a film that I have watched repeatedly and will continue to watch with joy. And melancholy."
"Annakin","Null","131","158","24 January 2002"," A beautiful, powerful movie.
","This film was such a wonderful surprise.  While I was expecting a moderately lightweight piece of teen fare, the film came in with truly profound depth, impeccable performances, solid direction and good pacing through a difficult story.  Mandy Moore is a certifiable superstar.  And Shane West is really good, and a big surprise was Lauren German, who is not only a very good actress, but so beautiful it is pure joy to watch her. The religion elements of the story are effectively interlaced into the narrative without feeling like the viewer is being force-fed a theological viewpoint.  And bring tissues- this one is a real tearjerker which leaves you feeling uplifted and optimistic."
"icedcold21","Null","12","12","29 August 2002"," Awesome!
","I just watched this movie tonight, I dont usually cry, and I will tell you what, this movie really touched me. Mandy Moore did such a good job. And so did Shane! This was great, I give it a 10!!! And I usually am into more like horror movies, a friend suggested this too me, so I gave it a shot. And it was well worth it. I think I just might go buy the DVD tomorrow! ;)"
"elsalsero1","10","142","173","17 June 2004"," A great tear jerker, and Mandy Moore's best film.
","What can I say? it's one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. Shane West and Mandy Moore have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, self-centered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life.<br/><br/>Another reason why it's such a great movie is because you see the transition of someone who I guess you can say was ""heading on the wrong path"" given another chance to make something out of themselves, and that makes you feel good. You have to give a lot of credit to the young main actors in the film (Mandy Moore and Shane West) they did a great job for both of them just starting their movie careers only a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>Although for anyone that has actually read the book, like myself, you catch a lot of the differences between the book and the movie, and in your own way you can note what could have made the film a lot better than how good it was. This was definitely Mandy Moore's best movie, and think it left a big positive mark for her in having a acting career. I undoubtedly give this movie 4 1/2 stars out 5."
"Sambarb337","10","216","271","25 January 2002"," A moving story of faith
","After seeing this movie today, I walked out of the theater in tears. Jamie and Landon create a miracle. Landon lacks faith in himself, in the wonder of life and in God. Jamie has the faith that Landon lacks.<br/><br/>Teen peer group pressure in the form of a dare causes a young man to be hospitalized. Landon is partially responsible. His punishment is dealt out by the school principal. The principal wants to somehow reach him, to teach him humility. Landon has to do math tutoring for resistant kids, perform janitorial duties around his high school, and perform in the school play.<br/><br/>He's known Jamie all his life. However, his attitude as a cool kid, is to ignore her in public. But due to his community service responsibilities he really gets to know her. And he needs her help in rehearsing his lines for the school play. Through working on the play, Landon starts to fall in love with Jamie. He is softened. He sees her faith. She develops faith in him, and he then finds faith in himself. Mandy reaches her audience in portraying a ministers daughter whose faith helps her to resist peer pressure.<br/><br/>Why she warns Landon not to fall in love with her... that's the point of the movie. The movie will help remind people of the value of life and of simple things!<br/><br/>I give this 5 stars! But I'm a sentimental guy who likes romantic movies."
"Spoonmonitor","9","21","23","30 January 2002"," Not for the cynical.
","I saw this movie last Sunday night, and I have to say that I was deeply moved by it. I do not think that it had the cliches of teen films at all. If anything, the movie has a new perspective on teen love. Teen films today are mostly focused on ""getting laid"" or ""turning the ugly girl pretty"" (one way or another), just rent American Pie or She's All That. Not that there isn't a special place in my heart for these movies, but A Walk To Remember is in a class all by itself. The movie did have it's share of cheesy moments, due mostly to the overbearing dramatic musical score in certain scenes. Other than that, the characters were very genuine and the performances were most definitely heartfelt. Mandy Moore definitely holds her own in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, showing lots of emotional depth and making a complete transformation from teen pop goddess to modest southern girl. Shane West is a talent that should not be overlooked by Hollywood. He gets better and better in every film that he's in. He can do comedy (watch his underrated supporting comedic role in ""Get Over It""), and he tackles drama with ease in this film. Great supporting turns from Peter Coyote as Jamie's father, and from an aged Darryl Hannah as Landon's mother.<br/><br/>On to the topic of this review. This movie is not for cynical people, or people who do not believe in love. This movie's core message is that love can and will conquer all obstacles. This is a movie about teens who love each other in a very adult way. I can relate because I have had the same girlfriend for the past two years, ever since my senior year in high school. We love each other immensely, and we believe that we have a deep connection. People didn't think that we would last, because we just didn't act like all the other teen couples on campus. So when Landon would say these deeply loving things to Jamie in the movie, I cried because someone had said the same things I had said not too long ago to my girlfriend. So, if you don't believe in love, don't see this movie because you won't like it.<br/><br/>If you have a bitterness toward religion, especially Christianity, don't see this movie, because you will just be bellyaching about the manipulation of religion on the youth of America. I am a Christian, not a hardcore one, but I do believe in God. There are Christian overtones in this movie, faith is spoken of many times in this movie, and faith is the cornerstone of Landon and Jamie's love. This movie is not preachy, it does not try to hammer home topics of Christianity with words. The movie prefers to use examples in real life situations and medaphors as well.<br/><br/>I have to say thank you to the director and writer for not including a sex scene or a drunken teen party scene in this movie. It is a tasteful family film, and I'm glad it did not try to be too adult with it's content. The love that Landon and Jamie share is pure, and it is what makes their relationship unique in comparison to the other kids in their town.<br/><br/>People may hate this movie because of the amount of sap or cheesiness. Well, I think the movie is very sugary and sweet, and has plenty of sap. But it is realistic sap. The situations warrant that amount of sap. You wouldn't make a scene where a guy is confessing his love for his lady all dark and gritty, would you? This movie also does have its share of grit, especially in relation to Landon's transformation. But you'll have to see the movie for that.<br/><br/>People may also think that Mandy Moore is not believable in the role of Jamie Sullivan. This is complete hogwash. The point wasn't to make Jamie a real ""ugly duckling"", but a swan who does not care to spread her wings and show off for the rest of the world. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers can't seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. I just wish that in real life, people wouldn't look at beautiful as the equivalent of popular and ugly as the exact opposite. I knew quite a few beautiful girls in high school that sat at the back of the cafeteria and read books or did homework. That's just the sort of life they chose to lead, not because they were forced into it by being picked on, but because they simply existed on a different level. Jamie is exactly that type of person. Landon is that way too, but he just doesn't want to find that out, until he meets Jamie.<br/><br/>Bottom line, you may love this movie for many reasons, or hate it for many more. This is a movie about soul mates. This is a movie about believing in people, especially in the ones you love. This is a movie about tolerance and not judging a book by its cover. This is a movie about friendship. This is a movie about two people who know they are right for each other. But most importantly, this is a movie about how true love can lift up even the most unreachable souls in this world, and save their lives.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"wlp325","10","13","14","2 December 2011"," Absolute Hidden Treasure
","I have nothing negative to say about A Walk to Remember. Its few ""cons"" are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film, perhaps one of the best ever emanating from Hollywood and Warner Brothers – a monumental feat given its small production budget. The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it multiple times. It's a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever. It shows how deeply loving someone can transform you to gain the strength to forgive, to accept, to respect, and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider. This movie conveys what true love really is, how it can affect people in life and death, and how absolutely beautiful it can be for those lucky enough to experience its deepest level.<br/><br/>The movie is so caring and sincere, it subtly draws you into it. It shows a popular in-crowd teenage boy discovering there is much more to life than reckless, carefree, aimless behavior. When a stupid prank turns harmful, a perpetrator, Landon (one lead character played by Shane West) is ""sentenced"" to perform community service activities, and these bring him into close contact with Jamie, a non-cool, non-popular nerdy religious girl (the other lead character played by Mandy Moore), who performs the same activities -- by choice. Landon has heretofore always treated Jamie with ridicule and disdain. Though he's known her all his life, through their interaction he suddenly discovers her passion for life, with interests and a depth he never knew existed. He begins to find a new path for his own life, and the ensuing transformation is wonderfully portrayed.<br/><br/>Although the picture's main theme is about Landon and the transformation he undergoes, Jamie is clearly the ""anchor"" of this movie. She's exceptionally sweet, genuine, innocent, highly intelligent and passionate. She was so interested in astronomy, that she built her own telescope and would venture into their small town cemetery, in the middle of the night, to pursue her celestial passion. She did this, not to impress, but for its own sake. Her beliefs in herself are solid and she never changes. She wears no makeup and wears the same low-key, non-fashionable baggy clothes from the beginning, throughout and to the end of the picture. She actually likes who she is -- the way she is. Unlike Landon, her self-image is not based on what others think.<br/><br/>She has just enough attitude to not take any disingenuousness from anyone – and when being ""toyed"" with would often ""fire"" right back. When Dean (a friend of Landon's and leader of the in-crowd ""pack"") mockingly asked her why her ""Higher Power"" could not get her a new sweater (she always wore the same one), she responded, ""He's too busy looking for your brain."" When Landon humiliated her in front of his peers, she coolly walked away at the time, but when he later came to her for help she calmly slammed the door in his very surprised face. She's a strong figure that ""sees through"" the behavior and demeanor of her peers. Her role demonstrates how one individual of virtue, faith and an up-beat attitude can so positively influence those around her by simply living her life true to her own beliefs, and not succumbing to peer pressure forces, no matter how difficult.<br/><br/>Landon's role clearly demonstrates the power of forgiveness and how its redemptive qualities can bring about caring unselfish behavior. Landon's in-crowd peers, treating Jamie cruelly at every opportunity (and eventually ostracizing him when he defended her), were eventually forgiven by Landon, and when tragedy struck they were all there to offer their support for him (and ask for forgiveness, each in their own way). And in what may be the film's most touching scene (though there are many), Landon essentially forgives his estranged father for leaving his family for another woman, and thanks him for his considerable support in making it possible for Jamie to return home.<br/><br/>One leaves this movie with a number of messages. The movie teaches to always be open to new experiences and to never ""judge a book by its cover."" The strongest message, however, is that of being a better more passionate person yourself, and to cherish those around you and the time you have with them. You're left with a sense of true love being so deep and pure that just being with the one you love brings such wonderful joy to your life. You would do anything for that person, even putting your own happiness aside for the sake of theirs. Jamie was able to change an arrogant, self-absorbed teenager into a tender, loving person who was willing to do virtually anything for her – and did!<br/><br/>Don't be surprised if you end up falling in love with both Moore's and West's characters. The enduring innocence, sweetness, evolving chemistry and eventual deep love between the movie's leads is genuine, totally heartfelt and compelling – unequaled in any other movie. In the middle of this film are a series of the most incredibly romantic scenes you will ever see in an American firm. They easily flow from scene to beautiful scene, showing two intelligent, thoughtful and sincere people slowly falling for each other. From Casablanca to Love Story to Titanic, no other on-screen pair conveys such an honestly felt passion for each other.<br/><br/>Despite the considerable sadness surrounding their romance, the movie leaves the audience with optimism for life, love, faith and the ability for everyone to change, the possibility to become a better person -- at any age. I watch it repeatedly with both joy and melancholy. Perhaps Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert (renowned longtime Chicago-Sun Times film/TV critic) said it best when he concluded in his film review, ""A Walk to Remember is a small treasure."""

","I am the biggest loser...<br/><br/>I'm a 21 year old guy who's into movies like Van Wilder, Old School, American Pie, Harold and Kumar etc... Although, I was quite a Mandy Moore fan in my teens (Britney and Christina never caught on), I went to see A Walk to Remember not expecting much (quality acting, plot etc).<br/><br/>It turns out that the movie wasn't so bad and Mandy and co. didn't do such a terrible job that the critics actually said they did. I enjoyed the movie very much (I didn't cry of nothing') but was very sad after the end.<br/><br/>Now I'm not someone who reads a lot of fiction, but after reading The DaVinci Code, I decided to go out and buy A Walk to Remember book (because books always give more detail). This was only a day after watching the movie and I'll tell you what, by chapter 13, I would have already broken down and cried (or got teary and get goosebumps) at least about 9 times. Before that I couldn't really remember the last time I cried. The book was really something special and the author is very talented. I was far more satisfied with the ending in the book that with the one in the movie. In the movie we are told that Jamie passes away. In the book, however, Jamie's fate depends on the readers' interpretation and discretion (Nicholas Sparks also says this on his website). Landon concludes with ""...miracles can happen.""<br/><br/>And so, my confession...I cried like hell after reading the book and for an adult male to do such a thing is unheard of and makes me a loser. But I don't really care, how could you not cry or be saddened with every page that Jamie grows weaker or every page that Landon feels more helpless? The way that the book is crafted make it so difficult not to get your emotions involved because you learn to love the characters and the fact that the story was told from Landon's point of view.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars - Fantastic book and movie"

","This is one of the few movies that I can't get tired of watching it. It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it, and I think I've watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it, I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can't get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt (Matt Lutz) in the hospital, and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter (Shane West) in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club, Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who is a very shy, quiet, and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan (Peter Coyote); Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his ""popular"" friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie, he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other, Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind, and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list (this is when the movie gets so good). After a while Landon and Jamie get married, and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie's dad, they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school, which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet (extremely beautiful). This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven't watched the movie but from what I've heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment, the light would be very bright, warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood."

","I do not usually watch movies of the category Love-Romance, its just because i feel like adding some more boredom to a routine life full of responsibilities. So I used to kind of hate them as if they are real piece of torture until I happened to watch this movie. <br/><br/>After watching this, I realized what I have missed during my whole life till now. A Walk To Remember is a story about a guy who unexpectedly falls in Love with a girl who is going to die during her teenage bcoz of a disease. He realises this fact at the very second he proposes to her. <br/><br/>To talk about this movie, especially abt the character Jamie Salluvian..I can just tell u one liner that I FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. She is the real human being, so calm pious religious helping so tender and what not, she is a kind of girl with whom everybody wants to talk with, wants to spend time with. By the word everybody, I mean to say not just guyz, but all kinds of people. Each and every scene in which if i see Jamie, she made me cry. That was the first time i literally cried while watching a movie. <br/><br/>It has left an undelible impression on me which, i cud not able to get over for 2 or 3 months. <br/><br/>Guyz, I don't know whether u believe it or not, its not at all exaggerating to say that I am completely changed after watching this movie. I really came to know what exactly LOVE means. This movie has taught me the real meaning of LOVE - A love for a life time. <br/><br/>I am spellbound with this movie in every aspect. This has become my most favourite movie for my life time. I bet no other movie can replace it for 100% sure."
"katie-hillan","10","4","4","28 April 2013"," A Truly Spectacular Movie
","When I first heard of this film, and because of when it was released, I automatically thought: 'It's just another one of those lovey dovey movies' .. How wrong could I be.. This shows Jamie, who anyone can relate to, as the lonely girl who doesn't have any friends.. The amazing part is, she doesn't care. She wears what she wants, thinks what she wants, does what she wants, and even though everybody teases her, she carries on like nothing happened. Landon, at first, I thought was a right jerk. In all honesty I didn't have much hope for the movie in the first few scenes, as I thought she would fall for the jock/jerk and that would be the movie. Again, I was wrong. When Jamie reveals her Leukaemia to Landon, his reaction sealed the deal for me. The way he went to his dad for help, who then helped him, tried to make all her dreams come true, married her in her mother's church, built the telescope, and stayed by her side morning and night. The thing that scares me about death, is not death, but what happens after. The fact that one day, no one will remember who you are, or people will get over your death. That scares me. This movie made me feel as if there are people who are caring and kind enough to actually remember and still miss that person, four years later. I don't know if anyone will actually read this review, but I don't really care, as because of this movie, I have come to think that I will become more confident, and I believe it really has affected me as a person. I highly recommend this movie, to anyone who has ever loved, will ever love, has experience or witnessed death, is a hopeless romantic, or is even just looking for 100 minutes to kill. I guarantee you it will change your life in ways you didn't expect. All I can say now is.. I feel sorry for my future husband; He has a lot to live up to."

","I picked this movie as a usual Friday night movie and I didn't expect that I was gonna cry at all. But to be honest, I cried so hard. and let me warn you, this movie MADE YOU CRY OUT YOUR EYES.<br/><br/>If I'd describe this movie in a word, that would be ""Pure"". The love between Jamie and Landon was so sweet and pure, and all the beautiful scenery used in this film made their relationship look more pure and lovable. Their pure love reminded me of my young love in high school and made me realize how the relationships I'm getting into lately is messed up and not that pure anymore.<br/><br/>BTW, Some people might think these kind of movie is cheesy or too romantic, and I agree with those opinion, this movie could be cheesy and ""try to make audience cry too hard"" kind of movie, but still, considering those aspects of this movie, I'm telling you this film is absolutely worth to watch.<br/><br/>Great scenery, great music,great cast, and great storyline.

","A Walk to Remember is a 2002 romance film based on the novel with the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie stars pop singer Mandy Moore, who plays Jamie Sullivan- the only daughter of the minister, and Shane West - one of the popular guys in the school (Landon Carter) . The movie was directed by Adam Shankman and has many nominations and wins.<br/><br/>The story begins when Landon nearly kills a fellow student when he and his friends play a prank on him. As punishment, Landon has to participate in after-school community service activities - help the staff in school, tutor kids and take part in the school's yearly play. This faces him with Jamie - a girl who he has known all his life but ignored. He gets to know her better as she helps him with the school play. Unexpectedly, Landon finds himself falling in love and this new friendship brings him many problems with his old friends, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she's keeping from her schoolmates.<br/><br/>The script is very exciting and the movie ends very dramatically. The actors are great professionals and their acting in the film proves that. The soundtracks of the film are so influential and the main song - ""Only hope"" by Mandy Moore is a really catchy tune. The movie is full of memorable moments and thoughts like: ""Find out who you are and do it on purpose."" or ""Love is like the wind. You can't see it but you can feel it."" Story like this was played before, but this movie does it much better than most.<br/><br/>Those who love teen romances will enjoy this film but not only they - this film will please a much wider audience, including adults and also men."

","Well, this is the first time I've written a film review, which you will probably gather as you continue reading! I felt I needed to write about this film just to get some of the emotion out of me and into some words. So this review may be more for me than for you.<br/><br/>I don't know how this movie escaped me in the first place for so long, but when I saw an ad for it just a couple of days ago I wasn't too sure it was my kinda thing, especially since 'that Mandy Moore girl' was in it. But seeing there was nothing else to watch I'd give this a try.<br/><br/>Boy oh boy oh boy.... I fell in love with this movie. It brought me to a hyperventilation of tears. It was innocent, simple and so so beautiful. The acting was right on. I was shocked my Moore's amazing rendition of Jamie Sullivan, I couldn't believe this girl could act in this way. All this time I had her pegged as the run of the mill Disney 'pop star' plastics. I was WRONG. This girl (now a woman) is very talented indeed.<br/><br/>The character of Jamie Sullivan will break your emotions into a million pieces, if you have any soft bone in your body she will find it. I have never been much of a crying person but this movie, that character, really borough it home for me. Taught me a few home truths - to be true to who we really are, to be kind, thankful for what we do have and to live like it's our last day...<br/><br/>Though this film has religious (Christian) undertones, I thought it was very subtle and never forced, so regardless of what your beliefs may be this film will leave you reeling and get you thinking about life and how we should treat each other.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to fall in love with Jamie Sullivan whether you're a guy or a gal. She is angelic. The epitome of what we all strive to be, what we want to see in each other.<br/><br/>All I can say is dang you Nicholas Sparks for writing this story and dang you Mandy Moore for breaking me into a million pieces with no mercy at all!!! All in a good way of course.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. It will be a movie to remember!"

","As I write this, I've just finished watching A Walk To Remember for the first time. I feel as if so many different emotions were pushed and pulled inside of me, but by no means was it in a bad way. Everything, and I mean everything, from the actors, to the script, were perfectly arranged so that every little moment in this movie takes the viewer on a journey, a journey through the lives of two lovestruck teens. This was no ordinary, sappy, teenage love though. The love portrayed by both Mandy Moore and Shane West was more than words could ever describe. <br/><br/>All in all, I've seen countless movies throughout my twenty-one years of living, but this is BY FAR, the most heartbreaking and sentimental movie that I've ever laid eyes upon. Well done, well done."

","I have read a couple reviews of this movie by ""Professional Reviewers"" and I don't see why most of them have a problem with it. Yeah the story is a little predictable (jock meets the geek). I've seen others movies like it and they didn't leave me feeling the way that I felt after watching this. I am a guy who always puts on a tough facade and never gets very emotional. But after the movie I missed Jamie and felt like I was right there with the other characters.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore's character is portrayed as what has to be ""the perfect girl"", beautiful, passionate, and tenacious among other qualities. I was mesmerized by her ability to grow in character without really changing herself from the (un)ugly duckling she was introduced as (Well except for that scene in the play of course, HOT).<br/><br/>I had never really heard of Shane West before this movie but I think that in this movie he did a great job and was very believable. I also liked the reverend although cold and harsh at first he surrenders to his daughters wishes and accepts her choice (exactly like my experience).<br/><br/>There is part of the story that didn't make sense to me though. A form of punishment would never result in a part in a play. Aren't there other people competing for parts? Guess Not. But that is about the only thing that threw me off, easy to forgive with the rest of the story that you receive.<br/><br/>PS - Girls if your boyfriend thinks he is tough and unemotional like me, Show them this and watch them weep."

","I first saw this movie when it came out, and I remember enjoying it as a nice, romantic ""weepie"" (a kind of movie I'm not averse too on occasion, although I can't watch the Lifetime network for more than 30 seconds at a time without reaching for the airsickness bag).<br/><br/>Then by accident I caught the last hour of the movie on late-night TV about three months ago, and I noticed that, hmm, there seemed to be a bit more going on than just a nice (very nice), heart-breaking love story. In particular, and in contrast to standard Hollywood fare, redemption and forgiveness were in the air. The most obvious examples involve Jamie and Landon, the two main characters; Landon treats Jamie badly, then redeems himself through his efforts in preparing the school plan, tutoring, and confronting Jamie with his feelings for her at school (and don't forget the pink sweater!). At this point, Jamie forgives him. Likewise, Jamie apologizes for not telling Landon earlier about her illness, and he forgives her. Landon's father eventually redeems himself for leaving his family by paying for Jamie's home-care, and Landon forgives him in a scene that, even after a dozen viewings, still ""gets me"". Landon's ex-girlfriend redeems herself for the hateful flyers she made of Jamie by apologizing to Landon, who forgives her. Etc. Etc.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, I saw the whole film a few days later (thank you, TBS), and noticed other things: how Landon's parents' love for him was so evident, albeit off the screen; how Landon's friends were more than just the evil popular types; how funny Eric is; and how the teenagers in general, rather than stereotypes, round out into plausible characters that I recognize from my own adolescence.<br/><br/>I was well and truly hooked at that point, bought the DVD, and have watched it, if not obsessively, then at least more often than I can say I've watched any other movie. It is so refreshing to see a movie that deals with big issues soberly, but lightly, in the process leaving me simultaneously sad, uplifted and determined to be better than I am.<br/><br/>I know the film was panned when it was released, and this is a great shame, because this is a film whose pleasures exist at many levels, if you let yourself watch the film itself rather than watch the film stereotype. Roger Ebert, who is about the only movie critic I can take seriously anymore, did ""get it"", though, and more power to him."
"Marc_David","10","7","9","8 August 2007"," Wow!!!
","When rating this film, I rate it 15 out of 10. It is fantastic. The acting is superb, the storyline is fantastic, the direction is amazing and just about everything is brilliant. <br/><br/>Even though when you think of Mandy Moore, you think bubblegum pop/Britney-knock-off, this film makes you look at her in a whole new light and respect her for the fact that she is a fantastic actress and with all the different songs she sings through out the film she shows off her amazing singing voice. <br/><br/>Add the wonderful Shane West opposite her and Adam Shankman behind the camera, and it makes an amazing piece of film. <br/><br/>The transformation of the characters throughout the film is always convincing and never makes you think ""well hey, that just wouldn't happen."" <br/><br/>I have seen the film at least 10 times and every time it makes me cry in three specific parts. See if you agree:<br/><br/>*******************SPOILER***********************<br/><br/>1) The moment Jamie tells Landon that she is dying. 2) The Moment Landon goes to see his father after he pays for the private home care for Jamie. 3) The scene where they get married and is followed by Landon's voice over.<br/><br/>****************Possible SPOILER*******************<br/><br/>Also I know they changed the end of the film compared to the book it is based around, but I don't think it would have made the ending as good as the rest of the film if it had ended with Landon giving the wedding rings back to Jamie's father. It would have created a ""you bastard"" scenario for the viewers. Any sympathy and feeling you had for Landon would have been totally destroyed. <br/><br/>********************End Of Spoilers******************<br/><br/>So in summary, this film is a must see for any kind of romantic evening, anyone who wants to watch amazing actors and an amazing story in one place and just about anyone who doesn't mind watching a teenage love story that can relate to anyone of any age."

","This is and will always be my absolute favorite film. It is so beautiful, and i cried through the end the first times i saw it. This is totally something that everybody should see at least once.<br/><br/>short of the film: Landon Carter (Shane West)is this cool teenager who's hanging out with the popular school kids. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is a very self-confident Christian and talented girl who has no interest at all in clothes and all that normal teenagers are interested of. A total outsider.<br/><br/>When Landon gets caught doing something he wasn't aloud to do (+ causin injuries on another student)he is forced to participate in the spring play, help toodering a little challenged students on Saturdays and help with janitor work. The play and toodering brings the two very different teenagers together. After some complications they find there selves in love with each other. They have a hole future in front of them, what could possibly bring the two a part? Under there 'walk' together she changes him in a special way, making him wanting to make something of himself, showing him he can trust others and most of all himself. And Jamie isn't left unaffected herself. Together they shaped each other. Another good thing about the film is the music. <br/><br/>Watch it... and for the record, out of 1 to 10 i gave it 15"

","A WALK TO REMEMBER is one of the best comedies to hit the screen in a long time.  It seems to have everything: a virtuous ""delicate flower"" of a girl who seems dedicated to seeking out the most frumpy, spinsterish outfits (and dies, to boot), the jerk popular boy who is calculated to make middle school girls swoon, what with his James Dean wannabe look, and his one facial expression of a pouty glower that miraculously never changes throughout the film, whether his emotion is anger, sorrow, or love, a hick preacher father for the girl and a mother for the boy who looks like a female impersonator, with her squared off jaw and hilarious hairdo.  Throw in a school play in which the boy is forced to star in as punishment for his delinquent behavior (somehow, in these movies, jail, expulsion, or suspension is never used, only performance!), a requisite scene in which the plain girl glams up for the play to reveal Mandy Moore underneath, and the cheesiest looking comet imaginable, and you have a great satire of the ""doomed teen love"" genre. The only problem is that this is not a spoof, but an actual tearjerker starring Moore and Shane West in which tears are in fact generated, but from laughter and not pathos.<br/><br/>The plot is derivative and cheesy, and the dialogue is worse, but that could have been overcome by bravura performances by the leads.  Shane West, as mentioned before, has the expressive capacity of a brick wall, Moore is slightly better but still blandness personified, and the two have no actual chemistry!  I may sound like the ultimate cynic, but I am actually quite the softy, and have cried at the endings of many films.  However, as a teenage girl, I am appalled at the dreck being forced down my throat.  If it's doomed romance I want, give me GONE WITH THE WIND, CASABLANCA, or the more recent MOULIN ROUGE any day.  There is one scene, though, which makes this an absolute must rent for everybody.  About 54 minutes into the film, West asks Moore out in his car, she turns him down, and he makes the strangest face I've ever seen on an actual person!  It's technically a frown, I suppose, but actually looks exactly like an upside-down smile.  The facial contortion that he achieves is amazing to behold, and I had to rewind it several times to make sure that I saw it correctly.  Good stuff, too bad about the movie.  For actual merit, A WALK TO REMEMBER gets a 1, but for sheer camp entertainment value I give it an 8/10."
"cam29","1","48","88","8 March 2002"," horrible
","This movie is pure drivel.  It's cliche'd nonsense and it stuns me to hear people praise it as much as they seem to be.  There is no depth to any of the characters, they are all cartoon characters.  There is a father-son subplot which becomes key to the story but is very poorly presented (it's virtually ignored for the first 90% of the movie).  I can see people appreciating the moral and religious undertones of this movie but that doesn't excuse the filmmakers from putting an original thought or well-developed character in the film. Again, I am stunned that anyone liked this movie it was horrible."

","I saw this at the movies three times when it was first released!<br/><br/>I think that it is so romantic and so beautiful and i think that the movie was made very well and Nicholas Sparks novel was transformed into one of the best movies that i have ever seen! <br/><br/>It's not like all the other chick flicks; girl meets guy, they fall in love, something bad happens, they live happily ever after and they have a happy ending.<br/><br/>This movie goes much deeper and touches people. It's Landon bad boy from school, the 'pop' and everyone loves him and he knows it. After a prank gone seriously wrong, he is forced to spend more time with the right kinda people. Jamie, the school nerd, no one dislikes her but everyone laughs at her, her father is the local Reverend and she is the right kinda person.<br/><br/>They have been in all the same classes since Kindergarten but have never been friends. the first time they talk she makes him promise not to fall in love with her. he laughs, not a problem! But as they spend more time together Landon starts to realize that it is harder than he thought!<br/><br/>To his friends disgust, they start to date, but then Jamie's secret is revealed and things will never be the same for Landon again.<br/><br/>It's about true love and becoming something that you never thought that you could. it's not about teenage crushes and lighthearted teenage fun. It will make you laugh, and cry as you see Jamie and Landon fall in love against all odds, but will the odds catch up to them?<br/><br/>I loved it and i think most people out there will, it really touched me and i think its one that you can watch with anyone, your mum, your friends, even your boyfriend would like it!

","As far as teen movies go this was delightfully surprising. A tale of two North Carolina teens it was both touching and inspiring.<br/><br/>The story is beautifully crafted and Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jamie Sullivan is enchanting enough to bring the character to life for any audience. Her shyness and lack of acting experience make her ever more believable as Jamie and a sweetness and innocense naturally shines through. Likewise, Shane west is no let down either. He is perfect as the bad boy in search of better things. Completely believable and at ease with this character his charm and charisma sail him through his role.<br/><br/>Concurrent to being a love story this movie also envoques more interesting topics - so far relatively untouched in teen movies. Having Jamie as the reverend's daughter is a wonderful twist and presents new problems for Landon (West).<br/><br/>All of this contributes to the very effective bitter-sweet ending of the movie and one is left both inspired and with feelings of hope as well as affection for the main characters.<br/><br/>This is by far one of my favourite teen movies and if you miss this one, you will most certainly miss out. 10/10"

","I had never seen ""A Walk To Remember"" at the cinemas and I had never read any of its reviews in the mags or papers. All I knew about the film was it was a ""teen film with singer Mandy Moore'. Yeah that's all I knew. So when I got this film for my birthday I do admit to wondering if this would just be another film with a singer trying to do her best in a film and stumbling her way through it. So when I put this video into my machine I kind of did expect that it would just be what I thought it would be ...But I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan. And Jamie (the preachers daughter) who isn't exactly in the popular crowd in fact she's far removed from them as you can get. Mandy is such a great actress and watching this film and knowing this is her first lead role makes it even more amazing because seeing her in this film you would think she's been acting forever. She has the ability to make the audience believe in the character that she's playing and that is something that not many people can do. She also makes this role her own and I don't think anyone else could have played Jamie because Mandy does it so brilliantly<br/><br/>Shane West plays Landon Carter. Landon is the popular one and is surrounded by friends and is very much in the in-crowd. Shane's performance is brilliant in this. I admit I had never seen anything with Shane in it before but after watching this film I will definitely be checking out his other roles. In this film He plays the role of Landon brilliantly and switches from the bad guy stuff to the sensitive stuff with ease. Just like Mandy he makes the role his own.<br/><br/>The pairing of Mandy and Shane (Jamie and Landon) was a good choice to make. There is so much chemistry there, which is what makes the film so great to watch. They work well together and there is no denying it. I really hope these two will have a chance to work together again because partnerships like that don't come along often<br/><br/>The film is so great, it had me hooked all the way through and Jamie's secret (I'm not gonna say what it is in case nobody has seen the film) comes out of the blue. It is totally unexpected and you don't see it coming. This film will make you smile and laugh at the good times that happen and also cry (like I did) at the circumstances that nobody has any control of.<br/><br/>Did someone say there was meant to be a deleted scenes version of the DVD? I hope so. I got the video and it was so good and when I heard that there were extras on the DVD I went out and got that too. The only thing that wasn't on the DVD was the ""cry"" video that Mandy sings. Are Shane and she in the video too? Also the soundtracks brilliant too. Its not often that there is a soundtrack out there that you can sit and listen to it all the way through and say that is every songs great but with this you can because every songs great. It even makes me want to buy the book too which I probably will<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everyone and not just for teens. It appeals to everyone who basically wants to watch a good film. Because that's what it is.... actually its not just good its EXCELLENT lol. It isn't the same story that most films have, its very very different and that's why it is so unique. Movies like this don't come along very often so I recommend you buy it because it's not one to miss"

It made me believe the miracles can happen and to always believe, and be thankful for what you have.

"branft","9","5","6","25 July 2003"," A very touching movie.
","First of all, I want to preface this review with the following disclaimer: I am not a 14 year old girl who is crazy about Mandy Moore and waiting for a knight to carry me off to his castle.  I am a 29 year old male with a real job and life.  In fact, when I first saw this movie, I barely knew who Mandy Moore was.  I consider myself fairly well educated in the arts, having studied primarily theatre design, but film and music as well, in college.<br/><br/>Regardless of the technical merits of the directing or the script, this is the first movie to actually get to me emotionally in years.  I simply fell in love with Jamie. To portray a such a character in a manner as to make her real and believable took real talent on the part of Mandy and real guidance from director Adam Shankman.  Her ""goodness"" could have easily been taken over the top.  Also to her credit, Mandy was sixteen when she took on this role.  While this may have made it somewhat easier for her to relate to Jamie, often actors twice her age do not portray characters with this much depth.  I believe she shows tremendous potential as an actor.<br/><br/>Landon, as played by Shane West, while showing tremendous growth within the film, appeared at times lack complex motivation.  However, I feel that the character is still strong and that Shane is a fine actor.  While the remainder of the supporting characters sometimes felt oversimplified and one-dimensional, I still feel that the actors overall did a fine job.<br/><br/>The real triumph of this film is the chemistry that exists between all of the characters, especially Jamie and Landon.  This is evidence of a director who knows what he is doing and a well-written screenplay.  While the film is by no means perfect, I barely noticed its imperfections  because I was so involved in the characters and the story.<br/><br/>For any story to be considered great, it must take its audience on a journey.  We must share in the discoveries of the characters and empathize with them.  ""A Walk to Remember"" takes its audience on that journey."

","**** WARNING ****  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE A 15-YEAR OLD GIRL!!!<br/><br/>Every single movie of this type is identical, they don't so much as change one iota of the plot.  I can't believe the number of stereotypes this movie has.  The coolest guy in school (Landon Carter) is a misbehaving rich kid who has divorced parents, the virgin girl nobody likes is the preacher's daughter, the cool kid fights with his best friend when he finally decides to stand up for the girl, his ex-girlfriend is nasty to the point of playing a dirty trick on the good girl (but of course regrets her actions in the end), and the lamest of all?????  After showing the bad rebellious kid the good side of life, the angelic chick tells him she has a terminal illness!!! AS IF!!  Just like in every teen romance/tragedy ever made!  Did they crib this stuff from Harlequin romances???  After 5 minutes, I said out loud, ""Guaranteed she will have a terminal disease.""  And she does!  And that wedding scene at the end, could that be any cornier???<br/><br/>Of course there is redemption in the end for the previously heading-down-the-wrong-path hero, of course he reconciles himself with his estranged father, of course all his friends see the error of their ways and embrace the new Landon Carter.  The cool kids are mean to the dweebs, but of course it takes the ugly duckling to show them the error of their ways (and of course she is not really ugly).  This movie is so boring, so silly, so lame, only teenage girls could ever find any interest in it at all, but I guess that is who it is aimed at!<br/><br/>Even the angst the lead character supposedly experiences with his parents' situation is so contrived it is liable to make you sick.  There is a hilarious scene where he asks his cardiologist father to save his leukemia-stricken girlfriend.  When his father explains that he is a cardiologist, Landon replies ""Never mind, I knew you wouldn't help!"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!  This movie has so many bad points, maybe everyone should rent it for a laugh!  Oh well, I suppose I got my 4 bucks worth just making fun of it all the way through!  LAME! LAME! LAME!"

","A girl looking like Mandy Moore would not get treated at all poorly at all in suburban high school.  It's discouraging that the kids with real social problems see movies that are supposed to represent people like them, only to find they cast someone like Moore for the part of the outcast.  This contradicts what the messages in these movies are supposedly supposed to be: you shouldn't care what others think of you.  It's almost offensive.  You don't hire white actors to play African Americans in a movie where they deal with prejudice all the time, so why is it I never see a heavyset girl in roles like this?  If it's about the money, why even bother to make a movie like this at all, if you're going to do it wrong?  All of you arguing that it shouldn't matter, obviously don't notice the kids that have few friends. I've seen movies with male characters that aren't what society would consider attractive and are odd, or eccentric... but never even see a ""dorky"" female at the theater.  Too bad."

At this point, I knew there were only 2 ways the movie could go - either she gets accepted and made-over, or she dies all young and pure.<br/><br/>I was expecting a Vatican conference and canonization ceremony at the end, but had to settle for the lame voice-over about their short time together, etc. Yawn. <br/><br/>But you can always buy Mandy Moore CDs and know just what an angel from the Lord sounds like!"
"rum2550","8","4","5","9 April 2010"," Most touching movie I have seen in years
","Though I do not often make comments on movies I see, for this one I was compelled to do so. I guess I saw this movie DVD on a shelf of the DVD rental shop for a long time but I was not interested in renting it; may be due to fact that the leading character is played by Mandy Moore as mention in the cover. I had never disliked her but I just thought she was just a good singer and couldn't be a good actress as well. However, accidentally I saw a comment by a viewer in the Youtube under one of Mandy's videos appreciating her acting in this movie and the next time I went to shop I bought the DVD.I saw the movie last night and Wow.. Even today whole-day I felt as if I was living in the movie. This is why I am writing this. Though it feels like a typical teen movie in the first half of the movie, story evolves into some deeper territory which is not common in teen movies.I was awfully wrong about Mandy. Her acting is much superior than most renowned actresses specially since she's playing a character with qualities totally opposite of her pop singer image. Shane West is also making a superb blend. Expression of feelings by both of them makes the audience thoroughly sentimental.I guess that is wonder of this movie; for which most of the credit should go to the director and the screenwriter. I guess it's kind of magical ability making people so emotional and tearful. This is a movie that describes the true meaning of love at best. AWTR is by far the best romantic movie I have seen.You will not be disappointed seeing this one if you still haven't seen it. This is highly recommended."
"koshpatel756","10","4","5","15 February 2009"," Beautiful Film!!!!
","I cant believe this film is only ranked 7/10 on IMDb. I started watching it last night thinking it would only be a normal American teen movie but luckily i was wrong. Normally I am not one who watches much on the side of American films because only a few of them ever pull at my heart strings but this movie was one that truly did. I cried through half the film, its just that awesome of a film. The way characters are developed makes u have to fall in love with Jamie and also makes you cry for Landon and Jamie once it becomes apparent something bad is on the horizon. The film was done perfectly proving you don't need exposure or sex scenes to show love between 2 people. Even though Christianity is strongly used in the film i could link it to my spirituality and my understandings and beliefs of what love is and what it can do to a person and i believe that these beliefs are universal and recognizable by people of all cultures and religious or spiritual background. The movie conveys a lot of things that i strongly believe in about love, relationships and life and therefore it truly touched me in a way most of the material and glitz filled American films fail to do.<br/><br/><ul><li>Love transcends all, society, peer pressure, anything that may try to stand in the way does not prevent true love from taking root and flourishing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Love knows no jealousy, hatred, pride, self centeredness, and resent. Love in fact is the purest of emotions one will ever encounter in ones life and when one does, and love takes root it can really change a person for the better.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Relationships are built on trust and understanding including one of love which was very prominent in the relationship between Landon and Jamie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All in all this movie in a very short span of time reveals the beauty that one can find in the life that God has created for us no matter how early he chooses to call us to him. and how much of an impact the right life partner can have on the way one lives and views his life. As Landon says at the end of the film even though she is no longer there her love is like the wind he can feel it even if he cant see it even when one departs. shows that love for another person does not end when the persons life ends but when someone truly loves someone their souls become 1 and they live on in the souls of the other.</li></ul><br/><br/>this film was just pure brilliance one of the best movies i have ever seen. it made me cry with sadness as well as with happiness (and this coming from an 18 year old boy). If you see this movie coming on TV as you are flipping through channels or even if u have to go out to a store to get it i would strongly recommend it. I can only pray to God that I find a girl as perfect as Jamie."

","Its a movie of life time. It makes u laugh and cry. It engrosses u completely and u are unaware of what happens to yourself. Its a must watch for everybody. No age differences for the cleanest movie of Hollywood. I loved Mandy Moore like anything. The expressions of Shane West were really great. The scene in which he confronts his father a second time was heartening. The love story was superbly picturized. I loved the environment in which the movie was taken. I can't say anything about the sound track in this film, as i'm obsessed with it. The song Jamie sings is unbelievable. The ending was a little hasty but well taken. Finally its the softest and loveliest movie ever taken."
"TigerLordII","8","4","5","14 April 2007"," No clichés... no flicks. Simply what the true power of love is capable of.
","I had heard about this movie when it first came out. I had always thought it would be one of the usual flick, teen-like and full of clichés. The sort of movie you regret having paid for, that will only touch the superficials. But I was wrong.<br/><br/>This movies holds a great many resemblances with The Notebook. Most probably because they are both based on novels written by Nicholas Sparks. A man who, in his life, clearly has experienced true love to be able to write about it so beautifully. If you have ever tasted true love, you will feel it during this picture. You will see the sparks between Jamie and Landon, because just like between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the Notebook, the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is heartbreakingly real. This is without a doubt Moore's best movie and one of West's best performance.<br/><br/>This movie is all about true love, and its power. A power so strong, that it can change you inside forever, change your life forever. Shane West portrays that very well, and Mandy Moore truly delivers an enchanting performance. You see it, and you believe it. Those who reproached The Notebook to be too long will definitely find A Walk to Remember better as it is significantly shorter. The essence though, remains intact. It would be hard to believe this picture will not bring tears to your eyes. At the very least, it will touch you, for sure. Just like after I finished watching The Notebook, I couldn't stop feeling serenity and warmth. Something so beautiful is truly rare, and anyone who will ever taste this will be lucky. This is what you understand from all of this, and the message is well and clearly delivered without the need of sex or nudity, which is a pretty rare thing NOT to see nowadays.<br/><br/>Of course, it isn't perfect. Thankfully the usual they lived happily ever after cliché is non-existent here, and it wasn't the point. Some might find it too romantic, too unrealistic, cheesy even. As I said, those who have tasted this kind of love will see it this movie from a different angle. The score doesn't compare to Hans Zimmer's work (or The Notebook's for that matter), but it good, appropriate, and Mandy Moore's gentle voice can be heard a few times in the movie.<br/><br/>I am very happy I gave the movie its chance. I shed quite a few tears, and wished the movie would not yet end. Although the level of complexity of The Notebook isn't present in A Walk to Remember, it touched me more, and it definitely stands in the league with The Green Mile of the biggest tear jerkers.<br/><br/>All-in-all a great movie the romantic will purely and truly enjoy. If anything, a picture that will touch anyone who makes the effort to watch it with an open-mind, that such love exists. 8/10"

","I heard of this film by a friend a few months ago.

My point is, whats the point in wasting time on putting people down and trying to make yourself look better when in fact they could be the most fantastic person that could influence the rest of your life.

"margrette_lin","8","4","5","22 August 2004"," A wonderful film
","Although this movie is for high school students, I found something that really imspires me. I guess it really doesn't matter the age.<br/><br/>When we were young, we dreamed about a wonderful love. It happened to someone but not everyone. I don't believe that there is a person like Carter exist on this planet. Perhaps I am too skeptical. But who else can be so loyalty and faithful to their lover when one knows the other is dying.<br/><br/>Especially they are young that they are too young to know what is life. <br/><br/>The director or the author of this book is somehow drawing a picture of our future life style. Whatever the religion you believe in, it is obvious the form that we should approach. In this century, we are facing the bigger and even worse problems are our new generation. We are desperately searching the solution to solve this so-called ""hopeless"" disease that causes all the parents in digging the hole of depression. This movie is a good one to think where we can really hold the line but not to sacrifice too much our joyful and of course moral sense. The most important is freedom. <br/><br/> From my point, this can never be satisfied without certain rules applied. Imagined that if our new generations can behave like in this movie, this world can never have a chance to get worse. <br/><br/>On the other hand, we should have a simple living environment. When people don't have not much choices to make, life can be easier. That is to say, life can have less all kinds of darkness power to poison our mental condition.<br/><br/>The young actor is acting perfectly and naturally. Especially when he said ""I love you"" to the actress, his eyes showed the greates sorrow and the compassion. The most attractive moment I've ever seen. Perhaps he is young so the passion within his eyes does not pollute much. <br/><br/>When you get older and your dreams never fulfilled, it would only come to the real in the movie. That's why this film is so wonderful to bring you back to the past and your dreams without space and times limit."
"ky_2k","10","4","5","9 May 2004"," How can you say anything bad about this movie?
","A walk to remember.... Well let me start by crediting the film producers and directors for hiring the two most perfect looking actors for the main parts.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore, well what can i say Mandy, not known as one of the most great actresses or singers but she is my favourite celebrity, she pulled off the part of Jamie Sullivan like no other would be able to, many people slag off her voice and her acting skills but what is actually wrong with any of her skills?. Mandy Moore has a sweet singing voice which suits Jamie's character, would a voice like Anastasia's, Britney Spear's or Christina Aguilera's really be suitable as the role of the caring, sweet, church girl?. Mandy's acting also was very good, you actually admired this girl, and even though she dies at such a young age is this film you can't help having a slight wish that you were her.<br/><br/>
Shane West, not some of the best films i have to say, get over it, liberty heights and a 20 second part in Dracula 2000, but still this film was what really showed off what was inside of him, his acting as the typical bad boy turns good was enjoyable to watch, i genuinly believed that without Jamie's help he would of never been able to turn good, but still you could see the good inside of him.<br/><br/>The songs of the film were absolutely fantastic, including of course Mandy Moore, The New Radicals, Switchfoot, and Top Loader just to name a few. I have read endless bad reviews on this film but when i watched it i didn't see it as predictable like many people thought you have your typical teen movies Pretty In Pink, She's all that, and 10 things i hate about you, all good films but all good long winded ways of the guy getting the girl, but a walk to remember i found different, you saw their love grow but not only that you witnessed their lives together and believed that they genuinly were happy, and while i was left in floods of tears as Jamie left with her unfailing faith there was still part of me smiling.<br/><br/>I agree none of this would ever happen, but most films are the same... and if they are realistic not many people want to watch them. I have rated this film a 10, i think it is great and was not comercialised enough, if you have seen this and enjoyed it....:)... if you have seen it and disliked it then watch it again and if you haven't seen it.... yup watch it...!"
"mamontgomery","10","4","5","13 May 2003"," Best film ever, far more than just a chick-flick
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** It is interesting how the voting is so polarized on this movie.  Well over 40% of viewers rated it '10', and yet the overall rating is under 7! Obviously, a lot of people either did not understand what this movie was truly about, or if they did get it, they did not care for it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those who call this film ""a chick-flick with a harsh ending"" are clearly among those who understood none of the depth of this movie.  The centerpiece of this movie is a young women named Jamie who hold on to faith and virtue, and spends much of her life helping others, despite a tragic illness that will soon take her life, and despite disdain from her high school classmates.<br/><br/>The love story takes form as Jamie selflessly helps a young man, Brandon, who previously expressed his disdain for her, and who was ashamed to be seen with her by his ""in-crowd"".  After helping him for several weeks, he makes a sharp put-down of her in front of his friends, so she closes the door in his face when he comes back for help.  What neither Jamie nor Brandon realized, but that Brandon's friend points out, is that ""She's already changed you, and you don't even know it!""<br/><br/>Normally, Jamie dresses plainly with a simple hair style and no makeup. But during the lead in a play, she wears a beautiful gown, makeup, and hair style, and everyone, including Brandon, is amazed at the transformation. Enchanted by her superb voice, Brandon, the male lead in the play, realizes Jamie is just as beautiful on the outside as she is on the inside, and is smitten with her.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Brandon explains to Jamie that he wants to spend time with her to get to know her better, and that he really misses her.  Jamie does not believe him and tells him to ""prove it"".  He gets his chance when his ""in-crowd"" buddies pull an incredibly humiliating trick that brings Jamie's virtue into question.  Brandon defends her against his buddies, and becomes ejected from the in-crowd.<br/><br/>After comforting Jamie after the horrible trick, Brandon asks to go out with Jamie, and is told that she is not allowed to date.  Perhaps the key scene is where Brandon asks Jamie's father, the local minister, for permission to go out with her, which is flatly refused based on her father's negative assessment of Brandon's character.  Brandon appeals, admitting that he has not treated her as he should have, but wants a chance to make it up to her. He asks her father to have FAITH in him, just as her father asks them to have faith in God.  Her father agrees to give him a chance.<br/><br/>Brandon and Jamie spend a lot of time together, and good as his word, Brandon treats Jamie with respect, trying to do all he can to please her, and never trying to compromise her virtue.  Jamie admits to her father than she loves him.  Her father tells her that if she loves Brandon, then to be fair to him.  The next time they get together, Jamie tells Brandon that she has an incurable disease, and referring to a prior conversation about her faith, she shouts, ""I don't need a reason to hate God!""<br/><br/>Afterwards, Brandon drives around for a while thinking about his feelings and what to do.  While 99% of young men would distance themselves from someone that would die so soon, he concludes that he will stick with Jamie no matter what.  Based on the music playing while he is driving around, I believe Brandon came to faith that night, but there is nothing explicitly stated in the movie.<br/><br/>Brandon is truly changed.  He makes a commitment to Jamie that he will be there no matter what.  His mother finds a list of ambitions he had written. When Jamie goes to the hospital, he is there every spare minute.  When she goes home, Brandon makes a large telescope so that Jamie can see a comet that she had been hoping to see.  He then asks her to marry him.  They spend a summer together, and she dies.<br/><br/>Brandon's friends are also changed.  They reconcile with him, and ask forgiveness for playing such a mean trick on Jamie.  They help him with the telescope.  They are there for his wedding.  Perhaps for the first time in their lives, they are moved to be unselfish and caring.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Brandon has finished college and has been admitted to medical school.  He comments that he had been going nowhere, and Jamie saved his life.  And that she still inspires him.  Referencing an earlier comment Jamie had made about the Spirit of God, Brandon talks about how he still feels Jamie's love: it's like the wind; I can't see it, but I can feel it and I know it is there.<br/><br/>In summary, the love story is beautiful, but what is even more beautiful is to see how a single person with faith and virtue can impact so many of those around her.  And how such a person can truly inspire others to change."

"Victor Field","Null","21","41","31 May 2004"," Finally I can forgive Mandy Moore for ""Candy.""
","By rights, I shouldn't have cared for ""A Walk To Remember"" - not only does it scream ""painfully predictable sapfest"" but it prominently features pop starlet turned movie starlet Mandy Moore, the tall maiden responsible for the skin-crawlingly bad single ""Candy"" and one of the problems with the otherwise quite appealing ""The Princess Diaries."" And it does start off badly, with our hero (Shane West) getting arrested after a dare out by a factory goes wrong and everyone runs for it. It also doesn't help that practically everyone he goes to school with is some kind of stereotype (especially his black best friend - there are black guys who don't like hip-hop, you know). And then there's the quiet, almost saintly girl who he has to do the school play with, and who's his polar opposite, especially in matters of faith.<br/><br/>And yet... and yet... The movie is, in fact, pretty affecting. True, everyone but the two main characters is pretty flimsy; yes, Mandy's solo number in the school play does have ""gratuitous"" written all over it; indeed, it doesn't add up to all that much in the end; but the movie's too sincere in its approach to really despise, and while it does have a pro-faith agenda it doesn't take a Jehovah's Witness approach to its story, thanks to a lot of restraint in its telling and acting - no Big Dramatic Moments (even though some of the story turns would almost justify it), just plenty of heart.<br/><br/>""A Walk To Remember"" actually did better at the US box office than Britney Spears's ""Crossroads"" - while I'm a Britney man, I have to admit that this movie deserved to do so. It may be sentimental drama, but it's pretty good sentimental drama. (And yes, Mandy Moore can act.)"

"janedoe_007","10","5","7","6 August 2007"," Not just another teen movie, beautifully romantic, surprisingly good acting
","Upon looking a the case I thought ""oh dear not another pop star-actress wannabe"" however, Mandy Moore surprised me by playing Jamie, a truly believable preacher's daughter whose heart was in the right place. And i challenge anyone, male or female, not to fall for Shane West's honest, romantic Landon. It begins simplistic enough, geeky girl who is clearly beautiful and caring is fallen for by the popular jock; he undergoes a change of heart and learns from his mistakes whilst he provides her with the self confidence and power to be happy. However the twist lies in the revealing of her long term illness. Anyone who did not cry when she told Landon is heartless. A truly beautiful story which will have all romantics sobbing even after the credits have finished rolling. Happy Ending with a difference but it confronts issues for teens that many other films skim around the edges of. I also like the way we get to see more of the relationship than most films which end with the couple only just declaring their love for one another. A bitter struggle but filled to the brim with love and hope. Beautiful."

"digitalraver","10","5","7","26 August 2004"," Heartbreakingly beautiful
","First off i have to admit that i am an action movie guy and i usually hate teen movies having seen enough unfunny comedy, pitiful acting and dirty jokes. The only reason i watched this one is because i ran out of action movies. In the end i was absolutely blown away by the beautiful story. No movie has ever gotten to me like this before! I actually came close to crying at various points in the movie and that is a first, and i am no 10-yr old teenage girl. This is a movie for all people.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film was fairly close to that typical full-of-hormone teen movie and i was beginning to get upset. But as i watched on i realized that it lacked the usual corny storyline and dialog. Instead i found a wonderful love story done masterfully by Mandy Moore and Shane West. The movie is sincere and touching, the characters are realistic and believable. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, unlike in some other ones i feel like people are shooting scenes just for the sake of filling time. I have to praise the acting of the leading characters again here because they really made this great movie become even more unforgettable. I can tell that the lines come from the bottom of their hearts mixed with emotion, not just memorized from the script and read out as done in some other films (i don't want to mention names here). The changing relationship between Jamie and Landon is just heartwarming. When the sad news came it got even more touching. I also realized that the seemingly bad beginning is there to show how powerful true love can be (to completely transfer a character 360 degrees). <br/><br/>One place in the movie where i THINK some MAY think is cliché is Landon's friends (especially the guy who ate Landon's fist) all becoming supportive of him. However given the circumstances of the storyline, only people with stone hearts won't do that. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie i was left in my seat stunned, my mind can't think of anything except replaying scenes from the movie. This is truly a great different movie-seeing experience for me, and my rating for it is 10/10. Yes, 10, a rating i only gave before to mega-blockbusters like LOTR and The Matrix, because i can't find anything wrong with it except that i didn't want the movie to end. I recommend it to all people who desperately want to witness a good teen movie."

","When I first heard about this movie, and the fact that it starred Mandy Moore,a pop star, I wasn't sure what I would think. I'm a 37 year old world traveling male. I usually listen to Classical and Rock. I've never heard anything by Mandy Moore.<br/><br/>Boy was I shocked. Yeah it's a bit predictable. But, in the end this movie will grab you. There are few movies that can make me, a man, cry. This was one of them. I'm not going to ruin anything about the movie for you, but you must see this movie."

Am i glad that i did!!?! I cried from the moment Jamie told Lando she was dying until a few minutes after i'd stopped the tape - thats over half an hour!

"rich.lou","10","9","15","12 January 2005"," A nice surprise.... absolutely loved it.
","Came home from work, fed up, flicked on Sky, saw listing for AWTR and sat down thinking, oh well, another teen romance, I'll give it the first 30 mins and switch over. Being a fella in his his early thirties who had grown up on Brat Pack movies didn't help.<br/><br/>Had seen Shane West previously in 'Get Over It'(not his best work!) and knew of Mandy Moore but had never seen a review of the film, read the book, nothing.<br/><br/>First five minutes I thought, nothing new here. But then as the minutes went by and the first scenes between West and Moore came on screen,I couldn't get over the chemistry between the two leads. I thought both Moore and West were excellent throughout even more surprising when I find out since, it was Moore's first lead role! <br/><br/>The 'She's All That'clone thought did enter my mind worryingly at one point but that was refreshingly put to bed. <br/><br/>It was lovely to see a film like this for once taking a different track. I expected the usual that you typically expect in a film like this, Jamie ends up looking like a beauty queen, Landon gives into his mates and stops seeing her, Jamie falls out with her Dad as he forbids her to see Landon etc. How wrong was I? Without giving the game away it was such a change to see a relationship being allowed to develop before our eyes for once.<br/><br/>As for the twist I won't spoil it but I too have been personally effected by a situation such as Jamie's and I have to say I broke down a bit at that point. OK, it was handled in the movie 'Hollywood style' but at least it was done in my opinion sensitively, it did try and show the immense emotions you/friends/relatives find yourself in such a situation.<br/><br/>Since seeing the movie I've read lots of critical reviews and I have to say I've been really annoyed by some of their inane comments and opinions. Clearly most of the critics went in to review this film with their minds already made up. However Roger Eberts review on 'external links' I thought was an honest and accurate description of the movie. Sure, corny in parts, but hey what movie isn't.<br/><br/>It's nice to see I'm not alone in that a lot of people seem to have come across this gem of a movie by accident on cable or satellite etc and been really moved by it just like me. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br/><br/>I understand the film is a pretty good adaptation of the book, slightly updated, so I'm off to buy the DVD and the book!"
"soo-soo","1","15","29","6 April 2006"," Formulaic rubbish
","I taped this from late night TV because I thought something with Shane West might be interesting, after seeing him on ER. He did well, but was wasted in a trite, clichéd and completely unrealistic film. I at no time believed in any of the characters - the lead girl's 'acting' was just looking doe eyed and purse-lipped and as for the rest of the 25year old 'teens'...... Embarrassingly bad, even for an afternoon movie. There's nothing wrong with a redemption movie - but it insults our intelligence to have such a simplistic narrative, trying to push all the emotional buttons without any real thought or conflict. These aren't the issues real teenagers face, nor are people's reactions that predictable. That said, it doesn't work as an idealised form of reality either. Very forgettable."
"kirstyngraham","10","2","2","8 October 2018"," A Walk to Remember review-highly recommend!
","When I first started watching this movie the opening scene caught me by surprise and at the same time made me want to watch the rest of the movie. The movie starts out with Landon Carter, who was a troubled young teenager that seemed to not care what happened to himself or his friends. The beginning scene we see a glimpse of who Landon becomes throughout the movie, he stays and helps pull Clay Gephardt out of the water instead of leaving him there to drown. This scene helps the audience to see that Landon isn't all that bad of a guy, but he likes to keep up his ""tough guy"" exterior. Landon then meets Jamie Sullivan, when he is forced to do a play at his school for being involved in the incident with Clay Gephardt. Jamie, who is portrayed by Mandy Moore, is the lead in the play and Landon ends up being the male lead. Landon and his friends love to make fun of Jamie mainly because she is a very ""homely"" girl and likes to spend her free time tutoring kids at the tutoring center. Landon soon realizes that to perform well in the play he needs help running lines and asks Jamie. Now this essentially hurts his ""tough guy"" persona so he tries to keep it a secret and as lowkey as possible. One of the more iconic scenes in the movie, in my opinion, is when Jamie finds Landon in the hallway, while he's surrounded by his friends, and asks him if they are going to run lines later. To keep up his ""tough guy"" act and their lowkey friendship he says to her ""In your dreams"" this in turn makes Jamie rethink helping him and she decides to ignore him. Landon shows up at her house one night with a pink sweater, he believes this will help her be not so mad at him for trying to be ""secret friends."" When they first started running lines together Jamie told Landon not to fall in love her, he thought she was crazy and believed he could never fall in love with someone like her. The night of the big play Landon kissed Jamie at the very end, which was not scripted but made a great ending to the school play and showed Landons true feelings toward Jamie. Jamie was caught by surprise when Landon stuck up for her in their school cafeteria when his ""friends"" made a very disturbing poster of Jamie. That scene was another iconic one, in my opinion, it added a sense of softness and showed how protective Landon is over Jamie. It also showed that he was in fact beginning to fall for Jamie whether he liked it or not. He asked Jamie to go out with him that same night, she respectfully said she couldn't and that she wasn't allowed to date. Landon then went to her dad and asked him if he could take his daughter on a date, I love this scene in the movie because once again it shows how much he respects Jamie. Before their date officially starts Jamie shares a list of things she wants to do before her life ends, she keeps her number one a secret but tells Landon a few of them, being, she wants a tattoo and she wants to be in two places at once. On their date Landon makes those two things happen for Jamie, they straddle the state line meaning she's in two places at once and gives her a temporary butterfly tattoo on her shoulder. This scene like many others proves that Landon does in fact care for Jamie. At the very end of their date they walk out on a pier and Jamie says the iconic quote, ""It's like the wind, I can't see it but I can feel it."" Landon looks at Jamie and says, ""I might kiss you"" and Jamie says back ""I might be bad at it,"" Landon then turns back to her and says, ""that's not possible."" Jamie stands there a minute in awe, and says, ""I told you not to fall in love with me."" This scene in the movie is kind of the turning point where Landon does in fact realize that he is in love with Jamie. Time passes, we see Jamie and Landon walking down the street and see that Jamie seems troubled about something. Landon starts asking Jamie questions about her future and she doesn't answer, he then asks her what's wrong. Her eyes fill with tears and tells Landon that she is sick, he tries to tell her to go home and she will be better tomorrow, but she explains to him that she has leukemia. This scene shows Landon breaking down and how much he cares for Jamie. Landon goes to his father, that he doesn't have a relationship with, and asks him for help. His dad shoots him down but when Jamie is admitted to the hospital we find out that Landons dad is paying for a home care service so that she will be able to stay home. When she arrives back home Landon had built her a telescope that she planned on building before she got too sick. This is where Landon asks Jamie to marry him and spend the rest of her life with him. This scene fulfils every expectation of what everyone wanted to happen. Jamie tells Landon that the number one thing on her list was to marry in the church that her dead mother grew up in. Jamie and Landon then married in that church and got a summer together before Jamie passed. The very end scene is such a tear jerker, it is Landon on the same pier where they had their first actual kiss and he expresses that Jamie saved his life and we will forever miss her and he says, ""But our love is like the wind, I can't see it, but I can feel it."" Overall this movie fulfilled everything I wanted and more. I personally have watched this movie so many times and it just gets better every time. I was so sad when the movie ended because I wanted to see more but at the same time the ending couldn't have been any better, it showed how much Jamie helped Landon become a better person all around. This movie was so well written and told a beautiful love story. If you are looking for a beautiful love story, a heartwarming and tearful ending, A Walk to Remember is definitely for you."

Their comportment recalls that of lovers with far greater experience, dignity and grace than might be attributed to such young spirts.<br/><br/>The casting is perfection and the acting even better.

","A Walk to Remember is a love story about two teenagers, Landon (Shane West) and Jamie (Mandy Moore). The film starts out pretty typical, Landon is a bad boy who has known Jamie, a mousy, wholesome girl, his whole life, but never took the time to notice her...until he does. Landon gets into some trouble and part of his punishment is being part of the school play, where he gets to see Jamie in in a different light. When they both finally realize they love each other, Jamie tells Landon that she's dying. They have a perfect summer together and Jamie dies. As much as this film is exactly like every other tragic teen romance, it's special somehow. It might be the chemistry that West and Moore have, or the purity of their first love status, but this movie strikes a chord with viewers of all ages. 
The theme of this film is love and loss. It's a universal theme, that's why it is so easy to relate to. Anyone that has lost someone they love to cancer knows this isn't an accurate depiction of what the end looks like, but as long as you don't bring your cynicism, we all can admit this is a preferable version. Using several montages to pass time in this film was clever, to connect the audience to the characters emotions. Part of the charm of this movie was how easy it was to love the characters. Everyone watching can remember what that first, all consuming love felt like. 
There's a theme of self-discovery within this film. Landon doesn't really know who he is until he's with Jamie. He learns that he's capable of loving someone more than himself and that's an important gift. He heals relationships with his parents and friends, through the tragic ordeal he goes through with Jamie. Like ""The Notebook"" and other Nicholas Sparks novel turned films, lessons about love and life are learned through loss. Overall, I would recommend this film. Go into it knowing that you're likely going to ugly cry and then be ashamed of it, but that it's definitely worth it."
"katarinaty","10","2","2","13 January 2018"," Not enough words to describe such a beautiful masterpiece...
","I´m writing this feeling like I have not enough words to describe how amazing and beautiful this movie is. I first watched it when I was 16 or so and I loved it and it was always in the back of my mind and I kept thinking that I had to watch it again someday and I did, a couple days ago, at 21 and I felt it in such a strong and powerful way that I didn´t at 16. I cried so much it actually hurt. I can´t get over how pure of a movie it is, how beautiful and effortless. I absolutely fell in love with the natural amazing chemistry these two have and how real it all seems, so real it´s hard to remember it´s just a movie and it shouldn´t hurt as bad. It´s difficult for me because it´s possibly my favourite movie and I can´t watch it that often because it´s too sad but so beautiful I keep watching some scenes here and there.
For me it´s the best romantic movie, no matter what anyone says. I´ve watched a lot of movies and there is not a movie that´s had suck an impact in my life. It just feels different from everything else. There is not a soul with love inside of them who isn´t compelled to cry. I don´t cry that easily with movies but there is no way you won´t cry watching this. I guess the vulnerability I now have that I didn´t at 16 helps making this movie so painful to watch but I don´t care. It´s perfection on the big screen and I can´t get enough of it. The world needs movies like this. Devoid of malice, just a pure representation of the true meaning of love. I desperately want a love like that and I want to love and be loved like I´m in a movie. 
This movie has an eternal hold of mt heart and my soul."

","I have seen certain comments that put equality between this film and ""One Give"". All parameters are on the side of this movie. First, the concept of the whole story is brilliant. Secondly, the whole stream of the film deals with the monitoring of two young people, a guy who is extremely problematic and a girl who is a person for the case. This film shows that it is possible that the ""bad"" guy for love changes and shows how much for real love there are no limits. The movie is easy to watch, it fills. The film ""Give it"" gave me the grade 7. This certainly deserves 8. What is ""flawed"" is that these stories are too screened with the subject and the viewers will not see much of the new one.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A word to the wise; if you're going to make an emotionally manipulative film you should probably make the story, or at the very least the actors convincing. ""A Walk to Remember"" concerns itself with the uncompromising love of two teenagers Landon (Shane West) and Jamie (Mandy Moore). Because at that age all love was uncompromising. Landon, a preppy jock who hangs with the popular crowd gets in trouble with the law and as punishment has to join the drama club...cause that happens. There he struggles but is helped by the bland and boring Jamie who Landon and his friends used to make fun of. She confides in him and tells him she has a list of things she wants to do in life. From there blossoms a romance to the bereavement of Jamie's minister father (Peter Coyote).<br/><br/>The book written by Nicholas Sparks set the story in the 50's but the film version tries to transplant the story into the 2000s. What results is a film whose values and aw-shucks-ness is dated upon arrival. The director and writer seem to have never set foot in a high school and as a result feel the need to populate the screen with as many pretty looking 20-year-olds as they possibly can. The ensemble is complete with Mandy Moore's unconvincing frumpyness, ""popular"" kids who have nothing better to do than belittle others, and a token black guy who calls everyone ""bro."" Shane West can't act his way out of a paper bag and the eventual story resolution is just outlandish and silly. I wish everyone looked like Mandy Moore when diagnosed with leukemia. Shouldn't she be, I don't know, losing hair, losing weight, getting pale, throwing up etc.? It's one thing to embrace a socially conservative viewpoint like this film does, but its another thing entirely to gloss over or ignore certain realities. You seriously want the audience to believe pretty boy Landon rarely saw Jamie in a sexual light? Female audience members certainly saw Landon that way thus one of the few reasons this film has ever been popular.<br/><br/>Had this unconscionably bland movie been forgotten as it should have been, I may have been more forgiving in my judgment of it. But with a perplexing rating of 7.1 and an enthusiastic following, I simply had to knock it down a peg or two.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","This is not the best Nicholas Sparks novel into a movie.<br/><br/>There are some good points and some bad points. The romance is not that great like in the Notebook. The early part of the romance is terribly clichéd. But it is surprisingly quite moving after she gets sick. And then it turns into a decent tear jerker.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore fans will enjoy this. But I found her acting ability limited. She had a daft look in trying to look angelic. If there was a bit more of her sickness in the story she might have shown more acting range. Lori Singer looked a bit frightful. Peter Coyote was a bit menacing. Shane West is a bit ugly and his expressions are unattractive.<br/><br/>So in the end its an okay tear jerker but it is a bit weak."
"CitizenCaine","6","2","2","12 January 2009"," Mandy Moore In Memorable Debut Lead
","Jamie Sullivan has an ever-lasting influence on Landon Carter. A Walk To Remember is based on the Nicholas Sparks novel about two teens from opposite sides of the tracks who meet by fate in a school play. Mandy Moore has her first lead role as the spiritual teen engulfed by her minister father's (Peter Coyote) fire and brimstone attitude. Shane West plays the boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose estrangement from his father has eaten away at him over time. Darryl Hannah plays his mother in a wasted role. The film is still remarkably entertaining, mostly because it defies the typical teen stereotypes in films. Although there's a token black guy in here, the black guy doesn't get killed. Joking aside, the film has worthwhile messages for its target audience and will most definitely appeal to teenage girls the most for its Romeo & Juliet aspects. Some will find it unforgettable and others will find it a bit too sentimental. The film is really a showcase for young Mandy Moore's talents. Moore and co-star Shane West are appealing in a film that could easily have turned exploitative. **1/2 of 4 stars."

The people responsible for this ""movie"" aimed to create a semi-adult type of sob story for teens.

The plot is overused and shot up, it's not even funny to poke fun at. The dialogue is so cheesy, you might as well bring a tub of macaroni with you. It helps if you're a teenager who couldn't care less, being a Mandy Moore obsessed fan, enjoying such movies as The Mummy Returns and you really want to preserve On The Line in theaters forever. But, unlike the rest of the world, these people don't pay good money to see this movie.<br/><br/>No good points, really for this movie, except that it has people who can't see it's Mandy Moore playing the ugly girl. Bad points are countless, including the unrealistic setting. The only real accomplishment is when a teen movie really does TRY to win America's hearts.

The boy starts out to be a tough guy with a group of friends only to be changed... The acting is good, and Mandy Moore has the rare talent of being able to act and sing well.

","I bought this movie at the local supermarket, at a substantially reduced price. From the cover and the resumé, I figured this would be a decent flick to have handy in the event I got some female company for a movie night.<br/><br/>Now I find myself watching it alone.<br/><br/>Repeatedly. By CHOICE.<br/><br/>At first I tried blaming it on the presence of Mandy Moore. When that got old, I tried blaming it on the songs she sings in the movie (some of them are quite brilliant ballads). When that lie also faded, the truth stood clear; I simply love this movie.<br/><br/>As a previous comment stated, ""You'll hate yourself for loving this movie"". How utterly true this is. I DO hate myself for loving it, but I love it nevertheless. It will make you smile, frown, laugh and cry. It is like taking an emotional roller-coaster, but you find yourself not wanting to get off. That said, director Adam Shankman elegantly avoids spending three hours telling the story, even though the story itself easily could justify it.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore and Shane West both perform superbly, where I have yet to find significant flaws in their performance even after the n'th viewing. Supporting actors Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah both deliver the goods with seasoned timing.<br/><br/>I watched this movie again this evening, on TELEVISION, even though I have the DVD on the shelve next to it... I even get emotional reading the QUOTES from this movie on IMDb.com (which by the way contains a few spoilers - do not read until you've seen the movie!!!).<br/><br/>All in all; I fail to see how anyone can be totally unaffected by this diamond in the rough.

Dude, Shakespeare would of been proud!! <br/><br/>Great Christian values by the way, it so reminds me of the bible story where the goody-good guy said yes to his father, did good and saved the day, and the baddie-bad guy said no and did baddie bad stuff. Plain and simple.

","***May be spoilers ahead*** A Walk to Remember is a very annoying movie. I will explain. Mandy Moore cannot act. In the least. She is one of the worst actors to grace the existence of Hollywood. Her performance in this movie is dull. The worst part is, she's probably not going to be in another movie like this where she can shine as the lead.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is terrible. I mean, they get married! they're 18 for god's sake!! That just ticks me off. I am a fan of the Nicholas Sparks book because it's well written and i like .. well, everything about the book! But the movie, was veryy loosely based on the book. By loosely, I mean I could list 100 things (or more) about how the movie is soo much different than the book. But I'm not going to, because it would take too long to type.<br/><br/>The casting of this movie was well done. That's about the only reason why this movie gets any stars. Landon's gangster friends, all look gangster. Now, I love Shane West. I think he's gorgeous, and and OK actor. But he's nothing compared to, Leonardo DiCaprio, or Tom Hanks. But he's OK. He was and still is the only reason I watch this movie. The other reason is, Lauren German. She is the most talented woman in this production. As I said before, Mandy can't act to save her life. Or sing! As a matter of fact. While we're on the subject of the music in this movie, it deserves one out of the 3 stars.<br/><br/>The songs, are chosen very well. Although they didn't very with a lot of artists. Most of the songs in the movie are preformed by none other than.. my favourite band! Basically why I like the music so much. Switchfoot. Now what I'm about to say might be controversial, but I love the song Only Hope, but I HATE how Mandy Moore sings it! The version done by Switchfoot during the wedding sequence is sooo much better. I mean, Switchfoot wrote the damn song! Mandy singing that song, reminds me soo much of Celine Dion singing My Heart Will Go on. She didn't write it, she just preformed it! Taking all the credit for a song they didn't even write ticks me off.<br/><br/>This movie is a never ending flow of cheesy lines! I have to admit, those lines got me hooked on this movie for a month or so until I realized that life's not like that! People don't say things like that at all! For example: ""Do you love me?"" By the way, does it tick anybody else off how Jamie says Mmmmmmm a lot? And Mhmmmmm . Ahhh it ticks me off! Anyways, continuing with the quote, ""Will you do something for me then? Will you marry me?"" THEY ARE 18!! 18!! God.<br/><br/>This movie tries to be a tearjerker wayy to hard. With main characters crying all over the place, more sappy lines, and big hugs. Oh! And death!! Thats right I said it. Jamie dies!! Get over it retards. The last 15 minutes of the movie are the worst though. Just more lines, and death and tears. Cry me a river to all the idiots who fell for all the junk.<br/><br/>Well, that's about all I have to say about this piece of crap that is considered a film. Thanks for reading!"

The Jamie character is annoying (I am pretty sure that anyone who resembles her in real life are hippocrits or brainwashed), and the change in Langdon is ridiculous and unrealistic. <br/><br/>I would have appreciated that this movie was labeled with ""christian content"" or something like that when I purchased it, because I cannot understand how anyone else could enjoy it...<br/><br/>Stay away is my recommendation!"
"sdj88","Null","3","4","9 March 2005"," A movie with a heart.
","A walk to remember is a movie based on the book by Nicholas Sparks. However, I didn't know that when I first watched the movie, so I never compared the movie with the book, which might be a good thing. Not because the movie is bad or the book is bad, but because they are both very different and comparing the two would do injustice to both the film and the book.<br/><br/>The movie stars Mandy Moore as the sweet, religious daughter of the minister with a horrible sense of style (she only owns one sweater), but a heart of gold; Jamie Sullivan. Shane West plays Landon Carter, the dark, mysterious bad boy whose life revolves around his own popularity and group of followers. Two people that have absolutely nothing in common. However, fate brings them together when Landon is forced to participate in the spring play, which means working closely together with Jamie. Things change from that moment on. Landon changes from that moment on.<br/><br/>'A walk to remember' is simply a beautiful movie that shows an impossible love-story between a boy and a girl that are so different, but so alike at the same time. They manage to make their impossible love possible, only to learn that their love-story will inevitably come to an end. Like I said before: this is a movie with a heart. It's an emotional movie that will make you think about certain things you've probably never thought about before.<br/><br/>The movie isn't flawless. No movie is. However, I was willing to look beyond those flaws and what I saw was the sweetest, most beautiful movie I've ever seen. The chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is undeniable and both of them have done a really great job on this movie. They were better than I expected.<br/><br/>To me, this is my favorite movie of all times. I love every bit of it and I can watch it over and over again. The movie always brings me to tears and hopefully that will never change.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you have a heart and you enjoy love-stories with a not-so-happy ending, then you will like, probably love, this movie. It's great. Give it a chance.<br/><br/>10/10"

I cried every time I read it and LOVED IT. However, I can not say the same about the movie. If you read the book, you understand that characteristics of the characters, what they say, do, wear, the location, time period and feelings toward other characters DEFINE the book. In the movie, it's like they took the characters and the main ""part"" of the book and used it, but forgot about everything else. It was a horrible portrayal of the book. The book was wonderful, I loved it. But the movie was just lacking. I am not saying it was horrible in the acting criterion; it was horrible in terms of following the outline of the book it was based on. If you do want to see the movie, please pick up A copy of the book before you see the movie. It does makes all the difference. I do not mean to bash the director or writer, but I think that more of the components of the book should have been portrayed in the movie of the same title."

","LOVE STORY for the Tiger Beat crowd.  Okay, that's harsh, but A WALK TO REMEMBER is exactly what it is - a painfully earnest soap opera aimed directly between the eyes of fourteen year old girls, an excuse for them to get all weepy and cling to each other as the lights come up at the end.<br/><br/>
Bad boy Shane West is ordered to pull some community time tutoring and acting in a high school musical (uh, okaaay.).  `You can't make me act!' he vows to the judge, and then spends the rest of the movie proving it. Along the way he is given a chance to pull off wallflower Mandy Moore's eyeglasses to reveal how beautiful she'd really be if only she'd accessorize properly. `Don't fall in love with me' she demands.  Uh, oh.hanky alert.<br/><br/>
The perfect date movie for nice, upstanding Christian folk, anathema to anyone with a cynical bone in their body (and admittedly, my whole skeleton works that way).<br/><br/>Utterly shameless and completely predictable -- essentially, NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE without the laffs."
"show83","1","6","12","7 July 2006"," Predictable, wooden and uninspiring
","This movie reeked of a large-scale Mandy Moore advertising campaign. (With several songs by Moore.) Moore's acting has little range and her character (Jamie Sullivan) didn't seem like a real person with real emotions. Rather, her portrayal of Jamie is wooden and Moore almost seemed to be reading predictable, stilted dialogue from a cue card.<br/><br/>Shane West plays troubled youth, Landon Carter, part of the high school's popular, yet rebellious crowd. He's a typical misunderstood, tough guy with a heart of gold. Unfortunately, West's portrayal isn't believable. He comes off as more of a metrosexual, tough guy wanna-be. (The name Landon itself seems more fit for ""The OC"".) <br/><br/>The love story between the Jamie and Landon is clearly forced. Whether it is due to bad writing or bad acting, we never really care about the characters. Also, ""A Walk to Remember"" offers countless cringe-inducing lines. This is a typical case of the dialogue working better on the page than on the screen as spoken by an actor. <br/><br/>Everything in this movie is cliché. (From the slang to the overly-used ""high fives"".) The ""touching"" moments lack poignancy. And the moments that could really illicit emotion were mishandled or missing from the film. The films finale is anticlimactic and the resolution is unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it's hard to tell what audience the writer is trying to target. On its surface, the film seems to be aimed at high schoolers with its liberal use of mild profanity. However, the story plays off as more of a Nickelodean production meant for 13-year-olds.<br/><br/>One perplexing point to note: the film never makes it clear what the ""Walk to Remember"" is. There are several possibilities, but we never really see any particularly memorable ""walk"". Overall, ""A Walk to Remember"" is forgettable and uninspiring. This film rates as one of the worst I've ever seen."

Okay, sorry all, I am going to push the spoiler button now. I can't believe that we sat around to watch this entire movie. We didn't even see it all. But what we did see was horrible. The only thing that made the movie tolerable was that Shane West's character owned a first generation Camaro. Though the car was cool, the scenes in which he was ""working"" on it were as horrible as the rest of the movie. I mean- seriously, if you are going to have the ""cool guy"" work on a car in a movie, at least have him do some work that looks somewhat reasonable.<br/><br/>Anyway, stay away from this movie like the plague.

","For those of you who don't know, Nicholas Sparks wrote the book version of this movie.  I read the book with my girlfriend a couple of years ago, and we loved it.  Nicholas Sparks as an author is one of my favorite authors of today, but when he agrees to let his books be turned into movies, the movies generally suck.  Case-in-point:  Message in a Bottle (with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright-Penn).<br/><br/>Mandy Moore and Shane West are no better at acting than Britney Spears is at writing her own music (or acting for that matter).  Compared to the personalities and emotions conveyed in the book, I'd say that these two teenage meatheads never even come close to getting their characters spot-on.<br/><br/>
If you have an opportunity to see this movie, don't go see it.  I saw it by accident on a movie channel and once the movie ended, I called up my TV station and demanded a month of free cable in order to make up for the time I lost to watch this movie.<br/><br/>If you want a real drama, read the book by Nicholas Sparks.  Movies like A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle do nothing but harm the reputation of Sparks as a writer, because each movie based on his books is done horribly.<br/><br/>Score:  1 out of 10 (IMDB should allow for negative scores because this would get a -50,000)."

","Well, I saw this movie this morning as I was eating my toast with peanut butter, and orange juice. At first I thought that maybe it was a parody of a really bad teen movie, but my daughter told me that it was for real. So I watched it. It was mildly interesting. I have read some comments that Mandy Moore ( now I finally know who she is!) has made, and that girl seems to actually have some brain cells in her head, as opposed to another famous blond whose airheadedness is exploited in ""Fahrenheit 911"". So, Mandy herself sounds at least, like a cool person, who has some original thoughts. Uh, but as far as this movie....well, I'll try to be gentle. <br/><br/>First of all, it was painfully bad. I thought it was perhaps a college student's film project. All the music was generic, typical ""teen angst"" same exact melody, same guy singer, music. The acting was not bad. But the story? so predictable....I mean, a motherless girl? Where have I seen that before? Why do all these ""plain"" girls who end up with the ""cool"" guy have to be motherless? what's with that? is it a throwback to Cinderella, and snow white, and ariel? So, that right there, that she has to be motherless is annoying, and a copy of all the other teen movies. Then, you are supposed to fall in love with her at the play, and I didn't. I guess that's just cuz I'm cold-hearted. I liked how he defended her in the cafeteria, though. Anyway, the movie was funny, and I was getting a little bored with the predictability, until the ""Love Story, I'm dying"" plot twist. Okay, that was a bit surprising. But then, they stole, in the LAMEST way possible, the whole idea of a dying, beautiful leukemia patient ( see ""Love Story"", you young-ins out there, please!! )and then had the nerve to work a ten second ""dad helps out"" like in Love Story! Hello?????? When Landon and his dad were hugging, I almost expected his dad to blurt out ""love means never having to say you're sorry""!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was bad, bad, bad. And then?? the narration starts?? what's with that? Was there narration at the beginning of the movie, that I missed???<br/><br/>The movie seems to have been written by 2 different folks, one writing the first half, then the other, doing the second half. The narration at the end is what christened the movie a comedy, and did give me a chuckle. But, all in all, I'll say that the kids are young and good looking, and the acting pretty good. And, I read another review here which complained about yet another ""humble, plain jane, outcast girl"" being played by a slim beauty, and that writer does have a point. I never looked at it from that perspective, but that does make sense. I don't think the movie was trying to make any point, though, just being a good watch to accompany toast and peanut butter. And I will say this: I am glad that lots of young people like this movie. When I was a teen, I loved a silly movie entitled ""Buster and Billie"". If I saw it today for the first time, I'd probably make fun of it worse than this one. So, it's good for teens to have a tear jerker that they can love. So for that reason, and that reason alone, I ( guess ) I like this movie."

","This movie is a movie that is thrashed upon by many, and loved by the rest. I am on the fence. I love to hate this movie and I hate to love it. I own both the VHS and the DVD of this movie, but that could just be my obsession for Mandy Moore. Plus, they were both gifts to me. I have seen this movie countless times now and I can say after viewing it that many times, the movie has many flaws. To the viewers who see this for the first time it is an amazing tale that is (yes) highly predictable. Mandy Moore's performance in the movie is one that couldnt be done better by anyone else (maybe my obsession for her once again), but she did such a great job in this movie and the chemistry between her and Shane West was incredible. The scene where she comes back and says ""to death"" when Landon (West) asks her if she is scared gets me everytime. The emotion displayed by both leads (Moore and West) is not overdone nor underdone, but perfect. The plot, for a movie, is great, but realistically no. When you sit down for a movie, unless you are planning on reviewing it you never look at it with a selective eye. You like the movie or you don't, and there are no IN DEPTH real reasons why we do or we don't---we just do. So, as a NON-avid reviewer, I liked this movie and I'm a guy...I've seen it as I said countless times and I will probably watch it again. I do not recommend seeing it 7000 times, but I recommend seeing it at least once. And everyone who hated it---watch it with the perspective of you being Shane West. Wouldnt you be the luckiest guy in the world?? :) The movie rates a 9/10 in my book. Because it is predictible and nothing really new out there, I had to slash off a point.

Most of the transitions should have been a straight-cut.  As for the cinematographer, I can't believe with all the credits on his list you can see the change in quality of lighting from a long-shot vs. the close-ups.  Lastly, the book was a best-seller but this dialogues script is absolutely bad especially in this day and age.  There were so many unnecessary scenes which don't drive a point or haven't been developed much further.  I'm guessing there were a lot of deleted scenes which we will see in the DVD version.

Her song on stage to Landon was particularly agonising  it lasted for such an extraordinary amount of time and it was not a pleasant experience to have to listen to. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes were far to drawn out, others not explored in enough depth and the vile ending, where the old 'bad boy' friends came and were reconciled with their ex-friend and were happy for him to be marrying this homely Church girl was, quite frankly, absurd and an insult to the audience if the writer thought it was credible. <br/><br/>All in all it is not worth the hour and a half of your life that this film takes from your life"

","I love films.I have watched films from various genres,from thrillers to dramas to mindless action films, I've probably watched it all. I have watched and loved teen films too,I'm a fan of John Hughes and I've watched (and liked) some supposedly cheesy teen dramas too. But this film was so so badly written that it definitely trumps all. 
High-school rebel Landon( Shane West) and social outcast Jamie( Mandy Moore) meet and fall in love but there's a classic twist in the plot, she has cancer and is dying. Now, the problem is not that the idea is not new, the problem is that the writing is as uninspiring and lousy as you can imagine. There's little to no character development, in fact all the characters, specially the leads, feel like nothing but cardboard cut-outs, and consequently failed to make me feel anything at all when I was supposed to cry my eyes out; and it's not that hard to make me cry, I cry at films almost regularly. Somehow, the writer(s) has just taken the laziest stereotypes and made them even lazier,hollow and superficial. Along with the atrocious and flat writing, the acting isn't good either. Mandy Moore tried but failed,Shane West maintained a painfully constipated face throughout the film and the less is said about the other high-school characters, the better. I did feel bad about Darryl Hannah though it seems like she was just collecting a paycheck. I've never been a fan of loud background score and annoying soft rock music, and this film reassured me of that.
I believe that good or bad, a film has to make you feel something. You can be amused at a good film or disgusted by a bad film, it has to at least affect you in some way. But I didn't care about this film at all. I would've never cared if this film didn't exist just like I don't care that it does. That's,I think, the worst thing that can ever be said about any film that has ever been made.

","I'm personally not a fan of conventional romance movies and when I saw this was based on a book by Nicholas Sparks I was hesitant. I had never been fond of The Notebook, but after hearing people giving strong recommendations for this movie, I came into it with an open mind. <br/><br/>What good I can say about this movie is the actors play their parts well, Moore especially. I was blown away by her singing and she wasn't lacking in her acting ability either. The other actors were also notable, but none of them stood out like Moore did.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, my real problem with this movies is character development or lack thereof. Not only are the character's one-dimensional, but they all fit into a small archetypal box. We have the Christian good girl, the angsty bad boy that turns kind, the strict dad that doesn't approve of the relationship, the token black friend, the jealous ex-girlfriend, and generic teen number one, two, and three. Any development from these archetypes is half-assed and forgettable. The one eighty personally change the main character towards the beginning/middle of the movie and the underdeveloped main romance were the worst parts of this movie. As I was watching it all I could think was ""where did this come from?"" First, he hated her. Then he saw her looking done up and was in love. It was all too sudden for me. Most of the relationships in this movie were underdeveloped and bad (save for one, which I'll talk about soon). I feel like if the leads had better material the movie would improve drastically, but the romance is bland and predictable. Obviously a very heterosexual thing, that maybe I just don't understand? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The only developed relationship in this movie is the one of Landon and his father. The scene where they hug towards the end of the movie was the most powerful scenes in the movie. I wish it was given more attention, considering it was the only interesting part of the movie. <br/><br/>Some tiny things I found annoying: the music and the """"subtle"""" foreshadowing. The music was just bland and at one point they were playing ""I Dare You to Move"" and I wanted to burst out laughing, because, seriously? Also, I'm so glad they decide to hit us over the head with how Jamie was sick before they revealed it in the movie (which ended up being such an anti-climatic scene)<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is one boring angst fest, good for people who enjoy underdeveloped straight romances with nothing new to offer. 2/10 would not recommend"

","I mainly heard about this film from reading a lot about it, areal chick flick that I thought was worth trying, from director Adam Shankman (The Wedding Planner, Bringing Down the House, Cheaper by the Dozen 2). Basically popular student Landon Carter (Shane West) has no real plans for the future is forced to being the lead in a school play, with Reverend's daughter Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) as the female lead. Landon slowly decides to take his activity more seriously, asking Jamie to help him out, and they spend much time together. He develops strong feelings for her which he didn't expect, which displeased Jamie's father Reverend Sullivan (Patch Adams' Peter Coyote) and Landon's friends, it doesn't really bother Landon's mother Cynthia (Daryl Hannah). Their strong relationship is put to the test when Jamie's heart-breaking secret is revealed, she has terminal leukaemia which has become incurable after months of no treatment. They know that they truly love each other, and they know that their love will go on forever if they marry before she dies, Jamie's father agrees to perform the ceremony. When she does die Landon carries out many wishes that Jamie put on a list, and the Reverand confirms that Jamie did have a miracle happen to her, it was Landon. Also starring Lauren German as Belinda, Clayne Crawford as Dean, Al Thompson as Eric and Paz De La Huerta as Tracie. I'm afraid to say, while the performances are good and fine, the story is really predictable and unfortunately rather too schmaltzy, but it is a teenage romantic drama that does keep you sort of interested. Okay!"

I want one like him,but this kind of boys doesn't exist. You also learn things about life with this film(moms would love it) Mandy Moore is perfect playing Jamie's character(she's definitely not herself)and there's good supporting actors.It is a movie thought for teenagers but I think it can be for adult public too."

","This movie basically took a beautiful novel, crumpled it up, spat on it, threw it in the waste basket, and hired a cheerleader to rewrite it. I watched the movie out of curiosity, and read the book later, and was personally disgusted by how horribly they changed what could've been great scenes in this movie. For example, the beautiful Christmas play that Rev. Sullivan wrote was replaced by a New York speakeasy-ish play and song opportunity for the ever popular Mandy Moore. Leukemia victims do not look that healthy either. And of course Landon's parents are separated, they couldn't do anything original with a movie and keep the parents together, noooooooo. But I do applaud them for keeping the boy's best friend as understanding as he was in the book.<br/><br/>Like I said, read the book.

"albrec-31030","10","1","1","7 December 2017"," Tear Jerker Love Story
","A Walk to Remember is a story about Landon Carter, played by Shane West, a teenager who gets into trouble and is forced to do community service, perform in the school play, and tutor underprivileged kids. Jamie Sullivan, played by Mandy Moore, is a kind, caring, and ambitious girl that is complete opposite of Landon. Through his punishment, Landon begins to spend more time with Jamie, as Jamie willingly volunteers to tutor and perform in the school plays. Jamie and Landon end up falling in love with each other. However, Jamie has leukemia and is dying. When Landon learns of this he works very hard to help Jamie complete her life list of things she wanted to do, with one important item being getting married in the same chapel as Jamie's parents. Jamie helped Landon become a much better person. After Jamie's death Landon obtained and undergrad degree and was accepted into med school, which were two items on his life to do list. When visiting Jamie's father, Landon expresses his guilt of not accomplishing Jamie's wish of witnessing a miracle, to which her father replies that she did, Landon was her miracle. <br/><br/>The primary theme of this film is that of Landon and Jamie coming of age. Landon's coming of age was much more drastic than that of Jamie. Landon is first seen as a rebellious teen that has little care for the feelings of others. After spending more time with Jamie, Landon realizes his mindset is not appropriate and begins to become caring and compassionate. Landon shows this by sticking up for Jamie when a schoolmate photo-shopped Jamie's face on a scantily clad body, printed the picture, and passed it out to the entire school. Landon really exhibits his coming of age after he finds out that Jamie is dying. He goes above and beyond to complete as many items on Jamie's life to do list as possible. Jamie exhibits coming of age by accepting her illness and remaining a positive attitude and maintaining her trust in God. <br/><br/>The camera angles and close-ups were appropriately used to emphasize Landon's emotional changes. Lighting also played an important role in the film. For example, when Jamie was in the hospital dying the lighting was almost like a filtered sunlight, bright enough to emphasis her high spirits even though she knows her days are limited, but filtered to show that the scene has some gloom to it. <br/><br/>Writer, Nicholas Sparks, has a brilliant way of tugging at heart strings with romance stories that we all love to see and then end the story in ways that have us screaming no at what happens. Just like the ending of A Walk to Remember, the film Dear John ends with the main characters the love story is built upon not being together."
"sadija91","10","1","1","13 July 2017"," This movie mesmorzied me the first time I saw it, 13 years ago ago and to this day - nothing's changed !
","I just read a couple of the bad reviews of the people that ""hated"" this movie and I'm complety shocked and I just had to write my review. <br/><br/>The first time I watched this movie, I was maybe 12-13 years old and since then I have watched it countless times and I've still stayed memorized by this movie to this day. I am a 26 year old female and this movie is on my top 3 list of favorite movies. <br/><br/>I admit that there are a few flaws in this movie like the fact everything happens so fast. <br/><br/>First, out of the blue - Landon asks Jamie to help him with his lines even though up to that point, he ignored her and made fun of her. There's probably somebody else he can ask for help, but it just had to be Jamie - the girl that's just the complete opposite of everything he is and does.<br/><br/>Second - just after spending a little bit of time with her, he realizes that he loves and he's willing to fight with his friends and not speak to them because of her (even thought I applaud the way he stood up for her in the cafeteria when he punched his friend for sending half-naked pictures of Jamie around school). <br/><br/>And third - barely legal, Landon proposes to Jamie even though she's going to die. I mean, I understand that he loves her so much that he wants to make all her wishes come true and help her fulfil her ""list"" but marriage just out of high school?! Not that believable. I mean this isn't some third-world country where you get married at the age of 12. <br/><br/>But in-spite of the few flaws this movie has, it has so many more amazing things about it. <br/><br/>I loved that Landon asks Jamie's father if could take her out after Jamie told him that she wasn't allowed to date. I loved the way he helped her fulfil her list by taking her to the border and showing her that she can be in two places at once or giving her a sticker-tattoo..just simplifying everything and making her realize that things aren't as hard as she may have made them out to be. <br/><br/>Maybe somebody will say that this movie is corny and lame and a cliché and maybe it is but that fact that this movie shows that complete transformation of a young bad-boy who doesn't care about anything or anybody up until he his in close range with a girl he's known his entire life, but never befriended. <br/><br/>She shows him the simplicity of life. The believing in God. The goodness a person can have inside them in-spite of the bad that others throw at them. <br/><br/>This movie mesmerized me because you see a young boy transforming into a grown young man just by befriending a girl that's different from him. <br/><br/>She shows him all the simple, beautiful things in life and you realize that one person can make a difference in someone's life. <br/><br/>What would have happen to Landon if he never befriended Jamie? Would he have made up with his father? Would he have gone to college or gotten into medical school?!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"Hitchcoc","7","1","1","10 January 2017"," Hard Not to Feel It
","This is quite formulaic, but it is skillfully done and quite provocative. It is the story of a ""cool"" kid and his relationship with a classmate. Peer pressure causes him and his friends to mistreat her in the cruel way teens often do. She falls for him and then he betrays her. That's where things really start in this film because this young woman has a secret. What evolves in the relationship with the two is pretty real and quite poignant. The peripheral stuff is a little too contrived to work very well. Sometimes, script writers try to wrap all things up in a package. It's not necessary. All in all, it's a very touching film."

","Hi guys, to be honest I never knew this movie even existed till my teacher decided to play it in one of my classes which was two years ago. Im just gonna go ahead and say that I am not the type of person that watches romantic movies but this piece of art hit me like a bullet and can be labeled as one of my top 5 favorite movies. Some of you may heard this to be the original 'The Fault In Our Stars'which I highly agree. <br/><br/>Every time I watch this, no matter how many times and without fail, my mind goes blank and I start to get emotional and have tingly feelings. There's just something about this movie that no other has. Landon and Jamie just have the perfect love life and it makes you wanna wish that you were them. <br/><br/>Landon's transformation is just great and his personality as a 'popular, rebellious and cool' kid of school is actually a big reason he gets into this whole thing with Jamie in the first place.The stuff that Landon does for her is just so admirable and just gets me, I sound like a girl right now lol. Witnessing their whole love life makes you wanna find a girl like Jamie and do all that stuff just for her. <br/><br/>I think the fact that they don't show her death in the end makes you wonder about life and stuff. And the quote "" love is like the wind, you cant see it but you can feel it"" -that killed me when Landon said it at the end, I just feel so sorry for him. I do have to say that I think AWTR impacts guys more because we fall in love with Jamie so much and we really cant bear watching her ...die <br/><br/>There's just so much feels in this movie that cannot be put into words so I'll end it here saying that everyone of you should watch this movie at least once in your life."

","I agree with uds3, Mandy Moore was wonderful in this. She was understated, serene and confident in her faith.<br/><br/>I would normally tend to scoff at faith and I admit, if I had known this was written by Nicholas Sparks, I never would have watched it. He is the master of contrived, tear jerker endings.<br/><br/>But Moore and West were perfect in their roles. Landon gradually responds to Jamie's optimism. Jamie finds the goodness in him she always dreamed of.<br/><br/>Despite the unabashed contrivance of the ending, I was genuinely touched. Jamie Sullivan is the kind of character that commands respect. The play within the play was completely convincing. Both Jamie and Landon find surprising depths in their characters and in themselves."
"A_Different_Drummer","9","1","1","10 November 2013"," 187 closeups, 23 handkerchiefs, & 2 entirely different movies...
","My Notes 1. One of the greatest setups in the history of film. Boy meets girl. They appear to have nothing in common. She has only one condition to their relationship. ""Promise not to fall in love with me,"" 2. How many closeups of Mandy Moore's face are there in this film? I stopped counting after about 110. Every one was justified. Funny thing, Mandy Moore was 18 when this was filmed. In the grand scheme of things, she will never be 18 again and that particular face will never exist again. Is that not what the essence of ""time travel"" really is? Every time you watch this film, you are transported back to 2002. And you can make the trip as often as you like. 3. Were all those closeups justified? Darn straight. Even now there are social anthropologists out there still trying to catalogue all those different facial expressions, because many of them had never been seen before. 4.My beef with this film -- and it is a beef which needs someone to give it voice - is that it is actually two different movies, fused at the centre by sheer star power and will. The first film is about a boy who falls in love with the preachers daughter. I believe that such a film would have been a hit on its own, and I hope that someday someone has the will to try to make that film. The second film, which starts about 3/4 of the way through, is about a boy who falls in love with a girl who has cancer. This film succeeds in spite of the melding of the two, but this reviewer says that you did not need the second film to make the first a hit."
"ctomvelu1","7","1","1","4 January 2013"," Tear jerker supreme
","This is my personal favorite among the 917 dying people movies made by Hollywood. Based on a novel by Nicholas ""The Notebook"" Sparks, it tells the story of two very different high school seniors, a boy without purpose (West) and a plain jane minister's daughter who is full of ideas and ambition (Moore). Their star-crossed romance transforms everybody, from the boy's snotty friends to the gal's uptight dad. You've seen it all before, but it is beautifully played by the two young leads and worth a look, especially if you like dying people pictures. I cry my eyes out every time I watch it, and I am a grumpy old heterosexual man. Whatever sins Miss Moore may have committee in her life, I will always forgive her for her heartfelt and restrained performance here."
"haley_d","10","1","1","15 November 2012"," The well- known love story, A Walk to Remember, is a captivating, heartwarming movie, unlike Sparks' other movies.
","The well- known love story, A Walk to Remember, is a captivating, heartwarming movie, unlike Sparks' other movies. It is personally one of my favorite movies because of the eye-opening story of a couple that unexpectedly falls in love. It has a unique way of not only telling a beautiful love story about how love endures through anything, but also leaving an underlying message to the audience about life, hope, and one's long journey ahead other than love. <br/><br/>In A Walk to Remember, a student named Landon Carter is a below average high school student that is going down the wrong path. He is hanging out with the wrong crowd, and participating in events he shouldn't be. The director makes it clear from the beginning that Landon is ultimately displeased with the life he is living, and chooses to take his depression out on other people. After making a wrong decision, Landon is held responsible for committing a crime and is forced to do community service in return, including being a part of the school play. The ""old-school"", conservative, preacher's daughter, Jamie Sullivan, voluntarily participates in the same events Landon does. There is a turning point in the movie when Landon decides to start taking his studies and other activities seriously, so he confides in Jamie for help. Landon starts out making fun of Jamie as usual, and under her request promises her that he will not ever fall in love with her. However, as they begin to spend more time together, Jamie and Landon unexpectedly fall in love with each other. Their love is put to the test when Jamie reveals to Landon that she has cancer. Through the fear and eventual loss of Jamie, Landon is forced to find out if their love can really endure through anything. <br/><br/>While Nicholas Sparks is well known for his love stories, I think this is his greatest and most inspirational. While all his movies leave the audience longing for a love like the characters have, A Walk to Remember provides a unique story about something so devastating that has a true impact on such a young couple. For instance, in The Notebook, the characters must conquer their love even though they are separated by distance, however in A Walk to Remember, the audience is able to be more captivated by a young love separated by crippling, life changing effects of a disease called cancer. While the woman in The Notebook does have Alzheimer disease, in A Walk to Remember the audience is able to be more drawn to a love that is forced to conquer with one character left alone due to the other dying from her disease, as compared to in The Notebook where the characters die together, ending their struggle. Because it is expected that one will most likely get sick at an old age, A Walk to Remember arouses one's emotions at a deeper level due to the fact that it is less expected for her to get a disease at such a young age. The couple in The Notebook has had the opportunity to realize their hopes and dreams of a long life lived together, however in A Walk to Remember their journey together is suddenly shortened by her disease. The movie can also be given more credit to its actors actually participating in causing effects to the audience. For instance, Mandy Moore is the star of the movie (Jamie), and her own songs are sung in the movie. By actually showing scenes in which Mandy (Jamie) is singing her music, the audience gains interest. Also, the music that is played all foreshadows the events that are going to happen. For example, in the play when Jamie is singing the song ""Only Hope"", the audience can expect that Jamie and Landon are going to fall in love in that moment. During this moment the camera spins around Jamie's head, showing Landon's confusion of his unexpected feelings for Jamie as he's lost in the song. As he kisses her unexpectedly, the curtain closes, leaving only the portrait of their faces in black with the red curtain in the background. Here, the director emphasizes their sudden love in that moment, making the viewer anticipate what is to come. The director brilliantly foreshadows events that end up being significant to the story. When Jamie first interacts with Landon, she befriends someone she doesn't like, which is number forty two on her list of things to do before she dies. As the movie moves along, we find out that little does Jamie know that Landon is helping her accomplish her list. Also, when Landon first studies with Jamie, he tells her he cant just be her friend, meaning that he doesn't want anyone to know that he would talk to her. The movie then provides an enchanting turn of events when as Landon chases Jamie, he pleads with her that he doesn't just want to be her friend, but wants to be in a relationship with her. As seen, A Walk to Remember displays the common love story where through anything and everything, a love like Landon and Jamie's is able to endure. By displaying the story in a way that everyone can relate to, the director is able to reveal an underlying message through Landon's drastic change in life. The director shows that in life, anything can change in an instant, and it is the people that are willing to keep an open mind that will find their true purpose in life in the end. For Jamie, this was changing Landon's life, and for Landon it ended up being carrying out Jamie's legacy. Through Landon's story, the director shows that anyone can turn their life around in a second and it may just be one person with one gesture that can make that biggest impact on someone's life."

","A Walk to Remember is a coming-of-age teen romantic drama film based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Shane West and Mandy Moore and was directed by Adam Shankman.<br/><br/>The film was set in a coastal North Carolina port. Cocky, popular high school student Landon Carter (Shane West) is the big man on campus at Beaufort High School until a hazing incident leaves a fellow student paralyzed. Sentenced to community service and membership in his school's drama club, Landon is forced to seek help from Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), the conservative, religious, plain-Jane daughter of the town's Baptist minister. When the two students begin to fall in love, Landon struggles with the drop in popularity that his new friendship brings, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she's keeping from her schoolmates.In the final stretch of the movie, Jamie confesses to Landon that she is afflicted by terminal leukemia and has stopped responding to treatments. Landon gets upset at first, and Jamie tells him the reason she didn't tell him is that she was moving on with her life and using the time she had left but then Landon happened and she fell in love with him.<br/><br/>Jamie's cancer gets worse, her father rushes her to the hospital where he meets Landon. Landon doesn't leave Jamie's side until her father practically has to pry him away.Soon, word gets out about Jamie's illness. Eric, Landon's best friend, comes and tells him how sorry he is and that he didn't understand. Other friends come and apologize too.<br/><br/>Four years later, Landon visits Jamie's father and shows that he is still a better person because of Jamie by informing her father that he has been accepted into medical school; prior to falling in love with Jamie, he had no plans for his future after high school. Jamie's father tells him that both he and his mother are proud of him and that Jamie would be too. Landon tells him that he's sorry he never granted Jamie's wish to witness a miracle. Jamie's father tells him that she did in fact witness one: it was he. Carrying that thought, Landon goes for a walk on the docks where he narrates saying that Jamie changed him forever and that while he misses her, he believes their love is like the wind. He can't see it, but he can feel it . The movie ends with Landon, looking at the sunset, smiling.<br/><br/>Although a lot of people may find the movie suitable for teen-agers and corny at times, the love story is so sweet, sincere and positive that it sneaks past the defenses built up in this age of irony. Also,the The performances by Moore and West are so quietly convincing.Anyone will enjoy this movie if it does not expect too much out of it in terms of realism but rather in terms of an idealistic romance between two people."

"emilyofrel","9","1","1","31 December 2011"," One of my all-time favorites
","I first saw this movie when it first came out in 2002. I was about six or seven at the time and didn't think much of it. I'm now 15 and watched it again several months ago. Wow. I sobbed. Landon Carter is one of the most complex characters I've ever seen.From the very beginning,when he tries to save Clay, we can see that he is not a bad guy. Even the principal sees this, when assigning his carefully- chosen punishment.Landon is a follower, he tries to be tough, he wants to be thought of as bad...but he is in no way a bad guy. Jamie puts it best when she says early in the film, ""You like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again."" He has so many layers. The scenes between him and his dad leave me a mess. <br/><br/>The theme of faith and what it truly means to be a Christian is the one that chokes me up each and every time. A preacher's daughter, Jamie's strong belief in Christ is what carries her through everything. Landon goes to church because he is forced to, (probably so his mom can make a social statement), and even through all they go through together, his faith is never as strong as hers. Their beautiful relationship despite the differences in belief is so poignant. Also, Christ was not judgmental and would've never wanted any of His children to be...Yet even Jamie's dad, a pastor, judges and stereotypes Landon. <br/><br/>The music is fantastically chosen, and I find myself listening to the soundtrack on an almost-daily basis. <br/><br/>I've seen the movie more than a dozen times now, and I reflect on something different. Each character is unique and carefully developed. Eric, Belinda, Rev. Sullivan, and Landon's parents are sub-characters that help build the story and the depth in the main characters. <br/><br/>The romantic relationship itself is only a piece of the beautiful work. They are loving, they are sensual, but not sexual. They're wise beyond their years, yet angst-y and silly. <br/><br/>Some things do cross my mind: -I wish we knew just a little more background between Landon and Jamie.They're too comfortable with each other from the get-go (on the bus, asking for a ride)...Were they friends as kids? -Doesn't Jamie's father feel cheated of time with Jamie? -I think Landon changes a little too fast...then again, maybe not--we never get a clear picture of time. -On a similar note, the relationship progresses a bit too quickly in my opinion. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I laugh. I cry. I pray. I reflect on many, many aspects of my life as I feel I grow up with Landon, Jamie and everyone else.<br/><br/>PS- if you like the movie, DON'T read the book. I got it thinking I would like it. I'm an avid reader and writer, and almost always prefer books to movies. Not this time. The major themes and characters I love so much were lost, and it bored me to tears."

","I am a huge fan of Mandy Moore, and I have to say this is her best performance ever. None of her other films even come close. This has been my favorite film since I first saw it & I know it always will be. I read the book, and while it was good, I would rather watch this movie. Shane West did an amazing transformation with the character of Landon Carter. I could not see how some people hated this movie. Not only is it an amazing love story, but it shows how one person can truly help change someone for the better. It's just a shame that such a wonderful love story had to end so sadly This is the best story of love, faith & hope out there. I would highly recommend it to anyone. This movie is truly a treasure."

","I watched this movie by chance....i'm glad i watched. I never thought i'll watch or love any Hollywood romantic movies. My likes were confined to mostly action,sci-fi,mystery movies. But after watching AWTR i was shocked to find that i was missing a big part of movies....or rather a big part of life. This is a simple story of first love which is pure and innocent...how love can transform a person to a more better person. Landon is a high school guy who has got no aim in his life,takes fun in tormenting others,etc. By some turns in life,he gets to meet Jamie who is just the opposite of him,who help others & a strong belief in miracles. He didn't know when he fell in love with a girl like jamie. But the story not ends here...Jamie has a secret. Now comes the emotional part...which also made me cry,which even surprised me the first time... Mandy moore was fabulous in the role of jamie. I don't think that anybody could do her part better than her. I simply love her. She made me love the character Jamie. Shane west also played his part well. He is a lucky guy to get such a great part to play in the movie. I have watched the movie over and over again. I like it more and more each time i watch. After AWTR i searched for more romantic movies but couldn't find a movie like this. I will give this movie 10 out of 10. It is one of my favourite movie. I can't stop myself from writing comment on this. I recommend this movie to everyone."

The casting for this movie was brilliant, as Shane West was suited for the part of Landon, and there was great chemistry between himself and Mandy.<br/><br/>The scene where Jamie tells Landon what is wrong was so touching, it made me cry.

I finally decided to buy it for myself and I can't believe how much I've fallen for this film. I've watched it at least a hundred times, I can't get bored of it I absolutely love it. I thought it was going to be another cheesy 'She's All That' type films, I thought Mandy Moore was going to play some nerd that gets a makeover and becomes the best looking girl in school. So, to my surprise when I watched the film for myself and discovered this was totally not the plot I could not believe it. I cried all the way from half way till the end of the film, when she told Landon she was dying oh my god I couldn't even focus on the screen for all the tears. I never liked Mandy Moore before but from this film I'm her number 1 fan I thought she was great in this, she played her role brilliantly. And as for Shane West, well I think I might be in love with him, he was brilliant. I recommend anyone to buy the soundtrack it's pricey but just as good as the movie. P.S.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I remember going to the cinema to see a movie and seeing the trailer for this film. I remember thinking ""Oh Dear...another American teen movie blah blah blah"" One night I was sitting at home and my mom had been to the video shop on the way home from work and had picked it up having been told by the woman behind the counter that it was ""astonoshing"" At that point I thought ""I ain't watchin that!"" but as the night went on the video box was sitting in front of the TV as if trying to shout out ""WATCH ME!"" ... so I did naturally...I was shocked and stunned ladies and gentlemen... I have never ever EVER cried at a film before...I just don't, it's not that I see little point...films just don't move me.... but I watched a walk to remember and couldn't seem to stop.... I started to well up with tears a little when Landon tells Jamie that he loves her when they're standing on the peer... and then there were a couple of moments in the film where I quite literally started to cry pretty badly... The moments and reasons were:- - When Landon goes to thank his dad - I was crying my little heart out lol, because Landon starts to cry and then just grabs his dad and you think ""For a guy who only sends his son a cheque once a month and taught him how to walk away he's not a bad guy..."" - I cried when he asks her to marry him....I honestly didn't see that coming....when he asks if she loves him and if she could do something for him and she says anything and then he asks her to marry him....I was gobsmacked because after he'd made all her other wishes from her list come true! - The bit where Jamie is in bed and calls Landon her 'Angel' - self explanitory - The bit that made me cry the most was where Landon has just found out Jamie has cancer, and he's fixing up his car and she turns up and he cries and she tells him she's scared of not being with him and he starts saying stuff like ""Oh baby that'll never happen ok? I'll be here"" My god the tears flooded like nothing else. - The Wedding, where the ""Only Hope"" by Switchfoot starts I just cried and cried especially when all of his friends were smiling at the wedding! And then when the camera zooms away down the isle and he says ""And then she went with her unfailing faith""... after that I cried all the way to the end...when Landon tells the Reverand that he's sorry she never got her miracle and Peter Coyote says ""She did it was u"".... erm.... oh and the final bit... ""Jamie taught me everything, about life, hope and the long journey ahead, I'll always miss her, but her love is like the wind...I can't see it, but I feel it!"" -- after he says that and the music starts look at the expressions that go through his face... if this movie moved you like it did me, then you can actually more or less pin point what memeories of Jamie Landon is thinking about.... the book's also amazing....Mandy Moore's acting is great, and Shane West, well he moved me more than anyone in the film...and if it turned out that he couldn't act then it helps that he's that fine!!!!!!"

","A Walk To Remember is a grown-up teen movie, it still holds the usual traits, but the narrative is more mature and is handled in a more adult way. Mandy Moore's starring role will surprise everyone, she embodies her character perfectly, her acting is right on the mark, she definitely has more talent than your average pop star. Shane West shines too as Landon, the bad boy who looks deeper inside of himself, aided by his love for Moore's character Jamie, and changes the way he's been living.<br/><br/>It's a very moral packed movie. Jamie is a devout Christian, and Landon puts his life back on the straight and narrow. It's a journey, that is somewhat rushed I must add. The book is full of content, which has had to be fitted into a movie, and so the love between the characters develops very quickly, and the ending is even faster, and not as poignant because of this.<br/><br/>But overall, an excellent film, I cried, I laughed, and I enjoyed it."

Predictability isn't a bad thing, that wasn't what wrecked this movie. This movie was wrecked during scripting.  I haven't read the book and quite simply, I won't.  If you want to believe in a farcial type of love and romance, well give this movie a go, it'll stimulate you in the farcial way you may desire.<br/><br/>There is nothing new about this movie, and the characters are all stereotypical.  Don't see this movie if you want to be intellectually stimulated, don't see this movie if you want to see anything decent about film what-so-ever.  There are but two reasons you should see this film and they are that you are a girl who enjoys soft and lovely yet vomitingly unrealistic soppy teen films, or you are looking to completely bag a film that should've been made a comedy, but for some reason the director portrayed it seriously (also check out ""Turbulence"" if you fit into this category- my friends and i have special memories of that the worst movie we'd ever seen at the cinema)."
"relwes","1","4","9","18 April 2005"," Indefensible
","This film has gone straight to the top of my ""worst films of all time"" list. There is nothing positive to be said about it. Whoever's responsible for it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/>The plot is this: Jamie is the school saint: a hard-working charitable Christian girl, who gets bullied for her troubles, and has no friends but is nevertheless perfect. (The ""ugly-duckling"" side to her character requires a major suspension of belief, since she's played by celebrity pop-singer Mandy Moore. But I'll let that pass, since there are far more serious criticisms to make.) Landon on the other hand is a loud-mouthed, popular, and irresponsible jock. Through his friendship with Jamie however, he gradually and agonisingly becomes a reformed character. Now that's a turgid, predictable, and unsubtle morality tale if ever I heard one. In case you missed it, the moral is this: being good is good, and being bad is bad. Even worse, it's Christian propaganda of the most patronising kind: being ""good"" in this film pretty much equals being Christian.<br/><br/>Then the plot takes a tragic turn: Jamie is fatally ill. Eventually after bravely coming to terms with her illness through her faith, she dies. Shortly before she dies however, Landon proposes to her. Their tragic, saccharine wedding is one of the most despicable scenes in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The script throughout is simply appalling: it's nothing but a string of clichÃ©s of the most unoriginal and puke-makingly sentimental kind. Anyone for the line ""Daddy, I love you *so* much""? As mawkish unimaginative cr*p goes that's bad enough already, but when it's spoken by a beautiful teenage girl on her deathbed, it becomes entirely intolerable.<br/><br/>One of the many major problems of this film is the performance of Jamie by pop-starlet Mandy Moore. In a nut-shell, Mandy Moore can't act. This is not a matter of opinion, it's a straightforward observation. Her efforts at acting are embarrassing. The fact that she was cast in this role can have been nothing more than a PR move to sell DVDs by association with her name. It should be interpreted as a direct insult to the intelligence of the viewer.<br/><br/>To compound the insult, the viewer then has put up with Ms Moore singing a couple of songs. In truth her songs perfectly capture the spirit of the whole film: unforgivable, unbearable emotional syrup.<br/><br/>What makes this film so bad, what makes it such terrible, unwatchable bilge, is its humourlessness. It's is set in a high-school and was described (by someone at ""Sugar"" magazine who should be sacked) as ""The Teen Film of the Year"". You might therefore expect it to contain a smattering of laughs, or at least attempted laughs. You say ""romantic..."", I say ""...comedy"", right? But no: throughout the whole length of this film, there isn't a single joke, or funny moment. Now I wouldn't expect the team responsible for this mush to be capable of actually making me laugh, but they could at least try. They could at least lighten the atmosphere occasionally. But they don't. The whole thing is given an insufferably heavy-handed, po-faced treatment, presumably to give the illusion that some important lesson about life is being taught. Well it isn't. The only lesson I took away with me is that some people shouldn't be allowed to make films.<br/><br/>In fairness, I should admit that I knew that I would hate this film before I watched it, and that I only did so because my girlfriend insisted on it. However my expectations were surpassed by miles, and as it turned out, my girlfriend also hated it (which serves her right). If you like having boring obvious moral lessons bludgeoned into you skull, then you might enjoy this film. If you like romance to be sickly sweet and tragedy to be angst-ridden, drawn-out, unsubtle, and tortuous then you'll love it. If you like trite, kitsch, commercial nonsense posing as a serious heartfelt love-story, then go and see it. But I don't and I got thoroughly fed up with the script continually plumbing new depths in its doomed attempts to tear my heart-strings.<br/><br/>This is not just an unspeakably bad film, its also a cynical film. It was made with minimal effort and with no regard for artistic creativity to promote Christianity and to make money by conning kids who don't know any better: shameful."

For a while it seemed like that, and maybe that it is a bit, but after Jamie's 'announcement' of her problem, everything had a turnaround... and it turned to be like a fight under pressure, until the last 'tic' of the clock.<br/><br/>Definitely a 10 from me, and I recommend it to anybody."

","OK, that title I used can sum up the script if you wanna see those movies, I feel bad saying that, but honestly, it feels as if they have used the same script over and over again just with different characters. In some ways I was looking forward to seeing A Walk To Remember because it had a decent rating and actually looked like a cute movie. Unfortunately, I got fluff, fluffy fluff, in fact this movie is what I would name as the ultimate fluffinator. This was Here on Earth all over again, which I do despise that movie as well, but however, I thought I was in for a treat with some of these movie comments here on IMDb. Seriously, I don't understand what is the appeal of these movies, they only attract the googly eyed teenage girls who think that this kind of love exists, don't mean to sound bitter, just this story was incredibly predictable and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Landon Carter is the handsome popular jock at his school, one night after getting a boy injured, he has to do community service. He then meets the good girl conservative Christan, everyone teases her, but she doesn't care what other people think. They are together in theater, they have nothing in common, but Jamie feels as if she sees something in him. She does her best to get him to loosen up, but he just refuses back, until he sees that she's hot one night, then he gets interested and falls in love with her only to find out that, gasp, she's dying.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is one of the biggest ""huh's"" when it comes to IMDb ratings, this movie is just a fairy tale when you think about it. It's a cheesy love story that really doesn't have any likable characters, I know that there isn't anything to dislike about Jamie's character, but there's nothing to like in my opinion. If you wanna see this movie, I am going to warn you that if you've seen Here on Earth, Sweet November or Autumn in New York, you've seen this movie, but it's just the more innocent goodie two shoes version.<br/><br/>3/10"
"x_chrli_x","10","2","4","9 July 2008"," Absolutely Loved It.
","I came across this movie on the internet a couple of weeks ago and decided to watch it because I was bored. I didn't have any idea what it was about or anything so I wasn't expecting much but now it's one of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>OK so the movie isn't faultless. Is any movie? Yeah its cheesy in parts and the love between Jamie and Landon is just a bit too perfect. But so what? It's a movie and no one ever said that anything like this could ever happen in real life. What i liked about this film was that it was different to most films like it. <br/><br/>Personally, I thought this movie was a real tearjerker but I understand that everyone has different opinions. I mean i'm only thirteen so maybe that's one of the reasons why i enjoyed it so much. <br/><br/>The soundtracks pretty great as well. I love the song Only Hope by Mandy Moore but the version by Switchfoot is just outstanding. Finally, for anyone who likes a good love story, you will most likely enjoy this film and for people who don't , then you obviously won't. It's common sense."

","I really enjoyed watching this film. Its by no means the best movie ever made or anything but it is indeed very watchable and has a unique quality which is that it made me really like it even while knowing that it is not necessarily the greatest film ever, which is why i gave it a rating of 8. For me not a lot of films have that quality<br/><br/>Well sure there are a lot of Korney anticipated love gestures throughout but hey its a romantic drama for teens there is bound to be a few here and there. In saying that i never expected the dramatic secret which Mandy Moore's character is holding to be anywhere near as tear jerking <br/><br/>In my opinion both main actors (West and Moore) played the roles perfectly and were a great choice as Moore's beauty is such an innocent one she is really breath taking in parts and West is a really convincing lead man and really makes the audience that he is sincere<br/><br/>Great movie for girls and if your a guy with a sensitive streak like me its also a good movie"

Shane West did an awesome job acting in this movie, and Mandy Moore did excellent as well. It took me 6 years to watch this movie and now that I did I am so happy that I did. Some people want to get on the fact where the girl said ""You have to promise not to fall in love with me"", she was joking people. However the joke happened to become a reality. This movie was great on so many levels and I urge anyone to watch this movie."

But then, something happens and all changes. It may sound very usual for romances, but this change is very surprising, at least for me. Speaking of romances, you know that they aren't always shiny and happy, and this one isn't happy at all, but it's real. You never think about it, but, sometimes, in real life there isn't a happy final. Also, the couple is really sweet and they both look so good. They are really good actors and they're amazing playing their roles. To finish, I have to say: if you see the movie and like it, you'll cry like a baby watching it."
"stiva","10","2","4","1 August 2007"," So pure... So perfect... So romantic...
","This movie is an excellent blend of Landon Carter's (Shane West) love for Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and his issues with his father, Dr.Carter. It is impossible for not to fall in love with Mandy Moore. She gives an excellent performance in this movie. Slow movie, but very romantic. The background score is awesome. Merwyn Warren had wonderfully brought out the emotions through his music. The author Nicholas Sparks has given a wonderful journey to love. I fell in love instantly with the movie when Mandy Moore said this line, ""Do not fall in Love with me"".<br/><br/>It was so moving that I cried at some parts. I felt the pain of Jamie and Landon in this movie. I felt the happiness. I felt the love. I felt the miracle. <br/><br/>Watch this movie and you'll know what I mean. You'll love it. You won't regret it."
"lucky_star_1","8","2","4","16 May 2007"," Mandy and Shane should do more movies together
","I didn't watch A Walk To Remember for a long time, because I didn't expect it to be any different from just about every other soppy teen love story there is out there. But needless to say I was pleasantly surprised when I eventually did. And it was mainly due to the on-screen chemistry between the two leads, Jamie (Mandy Moore) and Landon (Shane West). Whoever wasn't impressed with their performances must be mad, because they neither overplayed nor underplayed with the complexity of emotions they had to express throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Shane was believable as the bad-turned-good guy Landon, a guy who felt like no one believed in him until Jamie came along. She turns his life around and getting to know her makes him want to change himself. All due to Shane's performance, you're right there with the character along for the journey as he falls in love with a girl who once seemed to be his total opposite - and out of his league. Moreover I'd like to commend Mandy for her role as Jamie, a kind-hearted and faith-filled studious girl with a heartbreaking secret. As a pop singer first and foremost, Mandy will no doubt be judged by critics for her supposed failure to bring anything new to the screen as an actress (understandably I guess, given Britney tried once and as far as I know hasn't since). But Mandy gives brings an undeniable screen presence, along with her beautiful singing voice and it's fair to say she has the most challenging role, what with having to go from a school tutor to a lovelorn teenager to a sick patient within an hour. Together Shane and Mandy create sparks on-screen and it's lovely to watch their journey together as their characters embark on marriage.<br/><br/>Any One Tree Hill viewers will no doubt see the similarity between Landon and Jamie's romance with Nathan and Haley Scott's. Personally I think the story has been copied way too much for the show and Landon/Jamie is much more effective in the long-term. Not to mention 'Dare You To Move' was not originally Naley's song!! Overall, a feel-good movie with lots of drama and at times, really tugs at your heartstrings. There's also a lovely song half way through the movie, 'Only Hope', sung by Mandy, which I'm sure will capture the audience's attention."

This is a romance that will never die and remain popular throughout the years. I love it!!!!!! It made me cry so much and was so incredibly sad but i loved it all the same. A chick flick for those who love love and love to cry. My all time favourite movie and hopefully yours too."
"jpschapira","9","2","4","17 August 2006"," A picture to remember...
","The first time I saw ""A Walk to Remember"" I was blown away, but this second viewing helped me analyze each element of the film separately. I'm not talking about a deep analysis, but about an analysis this movie deserves, because it appears as a romantic teen drama, but it is truly a great film; and it deserves a great film's analysis.<br/><br/>The story of ""A walk to remember"" is about a popular high school boy (Landon) who hangs out with a popular group and a self-exiled high school girl (Jamie) who hangs out with the telescope and stars, the bible (her father is a reverend played by Peter Coyote) and religion and the retarded students she tutors for fun. They are portrayed by Shane West and Mandy Moore, and the plot line says they are ""thrown together"" so make a guess. Sounds familiar? Well, it's not: it's different; just about every other thing in the movie.<br/><br/>When Landon screws up and gets to be in the high school play, he ends up asking Jamie help with the lines. ""Alright"", she says. ""But with one condition: promise me you won't fall in love with me"". ""That won't be a problem"", Landon replies. What happens after Jamie's warning is nothing else than a story of true love courtesy of Nicholas Sparks; author of the book the movie is based on and author of another true love story: ""The Notebook"".<br/><br/>It was the job of Karen Janzsen to turn that love into a screenplay, and she did her work very well, considering the little number of screenplays she had written before. It is Janzsen's screenplay (with the main help of Sparks' novel) what makes this movie so different; because the reactions of the characters in the crucial moments, which should be predictable, are not. The simple words we are expecting them to say are changed by other words as simple that become surprising.<br/><br/>This fact is supported by the labor of the castA labor of wondrousness. Shane West, a now grown up actor I admire very much and who has divided his career between the series ""Once and Again"", the bad guy in ""Get Over It"" and a better act than Sean Connery in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""; achieves here what's still the best performance of his life. His sarcastic commentaries, his anger and his happiness are flawless.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore's performance is just remarkable, and mostly inspiring considering her situation (her first and in my opinion her best lead role of her career). She transmits sweetness and tenderness in her voice that when she sings it doesn't even seem out of place. Al Thompson's and Clayne Crawford's parts as Landon's best friend are very solid and more credible than most of their ""characters"" in other films.<br/><br/>But what I hadn't appreciated was Peter Coyote's portrayal. His character seemed so typical and obvious the first time I saw the film that I didn't pay attention to him. This time, I carefully watched his manners. His lines are so carefully spoken, so well appreciated; and his looksHis looks are so honest that you care about his worries.<br/><br/>Adam Shankman, a choreographer and probably not the best option for directing the film; astounds with his measured view of the strong events the story tells and leaves behind the regular ""The Wedding Planner"". In one scene, during the high school play, his camera slowly observes each of the main characters in the audience to contrast what's happening onstageDaryl Hannah is there, and even David Lee Smith's short appearance becomes noticeable.<br/><br/>Their expressions say a lot for a romantic teen drama; but much less for a great film."

This movie has had such a powerful impact on me. I really like the settings in every part of the movie, especially the parts that show the water and the bridge where Shane and Mandy are walking. I also like the part where Shane and Mandy are in the alley and she tells him about her sickness, the acting in this part is very real and very deep.

"tedphx","8","2","4","16 April 2006"," What a pleasant surprise
","I started watching this movie late one night, expecting it to be another silly teen movie, but after the first half hour I was hooked. Unfortunately, my wife wasn't watching with me, so I was pleased to see that it was airing again the next day. I taped it, and today, we sat down to Sunday breakfast with A Walk To Remember.<br/><br/>And what a perfect movie for such an occasion - a story about love and decency in which somebody, everyone actually, decided to sweat the details. It was better than good, it was riveting. It was the way life should be - the way people should be, instead of the way they are in real life. For 101 minutes, you feel like you're in a better world.<br/><br/>Well, make that ninety minutes, anyway...<br/><br/>There's a line in the movie Arthur after a prostitute tells Dudley Moore that her mother died when she was six and her father raped her when she was twelve. A sloshed Moore exclaims, ""Don't... don't they know what they do to kids?"" <br/><br/>This movie begs the question: Doesn't God?"
"franktop","10","2","4","4 February 2006"," Pure Magic
","As previously mentioned it does help if you are a bit of a romantic going into this film, however I challenge anyone not to be moved by both the story and the characters involved. Mandy Moore I am ashamed to say I had no prior knowledge of.... that said you could not help but be drawn into falling in love with the character she portrayed. Also as previously mentioned her performance of a song within the story was spellbinding, I can not possibly put into words the innocence, feelings, and range of emotions she expressed so convincingly in the performance of that song although by this point you already have a feel for her character. As I suspected this was a singer acting and not the other way round. I can not think off the top of my head of any other singer/actor giving a performance of this calibre, Mandy Moore in this movie has an innocence, beauty and charisma of a woman we would all fall in love with. I am officially a Mandy Moore fan and will look out for any other movies she does. Finally to make comparisons it is a bit of ""Love Story"" in content and I would say (reservedly) would probably blow Love Story out of the water. Watch! you won't be disappointed"

The movie greatly inspires anyone and its main romantic line can make cry even the strongest man. The movie always surprises you and there's no way you can guess was next.

","I'm a hopeless romantic, so the storyline naturally attracted me to it. The character Jamie (Mandy Moore) resembles the sort of girl that any gentleman would seek to spend their lives with.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore plays a powerful character that affects the lives of anyone she comes in contact with. She affected Landon (Shane West) in a very strong way, despite his initial stance towards her.<br/><br/>There are some cool things Landon does in this movie that I would do for my girlfriend. He becomes a likable character, although he did not start off that way.<br/><br/>The ending, though sad, had a positive element. That's all I can say without ruining it but it was encouraging to realize how one life could affect so many others. This one comes highly recommended. 10/10"
"astronic","5","2","4","16 February 2003"," Ambitious but not convincing
","The first 2/3 of this movie reminds of ""She's All That"" (popular guy falls in love with a wallflower) and many scenes would be quite interchangeable.<br/><br/>Instead the last third deals with some really serious things (I don't want to spoil to much here) rather then giving an everybody's happy-ending like ""She's all that"" does. Anyway - depending on your attitude - you may find this part kitschy (and if you do, you're going to find it *really* kitschy). Other may see it as a demonstration of true love or even interpretate it religiously, however it was definitively to much kitsch for me to like it.<br/><br/>The characters, their development and their interaction weren't believeable to me at all (not the cast's fault, they played solid). In my opinion this film trys to be deep but goes for story development and character's action instead of focussing the characters themselves. That doesn't work out and so I saw a - without doubt ambitious - but in the end only average teen love story, most of the time lightly told and with some serious elements which just doesn't fit in.<br/><br/>If you liked ""She's All That"" then you'll probably like this one too, if you didn't, save your time and watch something else (concerning love storys ""Der Krieger und die Kaiserin"" would be a good counterpoint to this film).<br/><br/>5 out of 10."
"michaelRokeefe","4","2","4","19 January 2003"," Love blossoms almost too late.
","Sometimes a little sappy and very predictable, but a decent vehicle for teen singer Mandy Moore. The charming Miss Moore gets her first chance to carry a movie and she does so with ease. A romance slowly grows between a high school romeo(Shane West)and a quiet preacher's daughter(Moore). Peter Coyote plays the girl's bitter dad and revered man of the cloth. The couple manage to get around some of his stern rules about life. Also in the cast are Al Thompson and Daryl Hannah. A modest soundtrack allows Moore to sing four songs, the best being ""Cry"" and ""It's Gonna Be Love"". Pleasant, but no great shakes. On the other hand, Miss Moore is to fall in love with."

In some twist of fate, popular jerk ends up being forced to be tutored by the dork and surprise, surprise, he ends up falling in love with her. How unoriginal can the plot be!!! How many times have I heard that story before? The writer's must have sensed it's overwhelming predictability in the beginning so they decided they had to come up with some sort of way to give the lame story a twist. I'm not kidding, half-way through the movie, I leaned over to my friend and whispered, ""I think she's going to die..."" My friend replied, ""I was thinking the same thing."" So, low and behold, after the popular jerk had gained some depth to his character and learned the important lesson of why you should not judge a book by it's cover, Mandy takes a turn for the worse and her secret illness she was trying to hide is exposed.

","If you're a fan of comedy and not serious movies, then this movie is not for you. A walk to remember is one of the epic romantic movies of the 2000s. The movie has depth and is for people who see the realness behind the whole story. As such tragedies happen in real life, it makes the movie even sadder. I favor the acting of both main characters, Jamie Sulivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West) because they both played their parts perfectly.

","The Rom-Com to shut every other romcom out of existence A walk to remember may perhaps be cherished in the directed demography but for others this is nothing short of an exercise in boredom. Romance, tears, and not a well-developed character in sight - what more could one expect from the director of The Wedding Planner? Once again, director Adam Shankman has foisted upon the public a production so narrowly targeted that a majority of movie-goers will ignore its existence. In the case of A Walk to Remember, the only people likely to have nice things to say about what's on the screen are girls in their pre-teen and early teenage years, and the word ""discrimination"" is rarely used to describe their movie-going habits."

"destinylives52","7","0","0","29 July 2017"," Great Performance By Mandy Moore Saves This Movie
","From Nicholas Sparks' second novel, ""A Walk To Remember"" pairs Mandy Moore and Shane West as high school teens at opposite ends of everything. Moore plays a bible carrying sweetheart who is basically a saint with an amazing singing voice, while West plays a jackass who is part of the cool crowd. Neither of them has much in common, but a prank pulled by West causes an accident that forces West to do community service. One such service is to take part in a school playplaying the lead. Huh, what? West has no interest in playing lead, nor does he have any experience in acting; but the drama teacher gives him the male lead anyway becausewell, because the screenwriter and director want West and Moore to have a reason to spend lots of time together, and they couldn't be bothered with writing a more plausible reason, so we just have to accept that shenanigan.<br/><br/>So anywayMoore/West have to study their lines together and guess what? West starts to like Moore, despite her being all goody goody and wearing weird clothes and the same sweaterwell, to be fair, Moore is beautiful and is such a nice person and honest and intelligent — traits that West is hard pressed to find in his cool group. Moore's portrayal of her character is absolutely on the money, very believable and extremely likable; and it is Moore who saves this movie from being a cheese fest and catapults it to an entertaining, heartwarming rom/com/drama.<br/><br/>Enough of me gushing over Moore's performance. West/Moore's romance of course hits the obvious bumps: the cool kids hate her; the father hates West; West feels alienated by his cool friends, etc. But the biggest bump is when Moore reveals her secret to West. This revelation is my most memorable, movie moment, which I will not spoil; but fans of Sparks will probably guess the secret.<br/><br/>For the average moviegoer, ""A Walk To Remember"" will be a bit too corny and syrupy for their tastes; but for rom/com/drama fans, this is one of the better ones, and Mandy Moore's performance has almost everything to do with it.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","Nicholas Sparks' A walk to remember is one of the many book to big screen adaptations of his novels. I have not read this book so I won't be able to make comparisons between the two, bit I'll just give a summary on why I think this film deserves a 6/10. First of all, I liked the cast, Mandy Moore and Shane west do a good job at carrying the lead roles and the romantic relationship that forms with them, their chemistry also works really well, it just flows naturally between them. I also like seeing Daryl Hannah playing Landon's mother, loved her from Steel Magnolias (1989). The movie is fairly predictable except for one sad twist at the end, other than that it's pretty run of the mill. The romantic scenes between West and Moore are very cute and they do their job well, it achieves the desired goal. Some of the scenes in between the beginning, romance scenes, and the ending can drag a little, be kinda lifeless. If the acting hadn't been good, west and Moore had poor on screen chemistry, or the romance scenes hadn't been good, then I would absolutely hated it. But those three factors saved this movie from being a complete and utter disaster. I'll summarize it briefly like this: it's a cute well acted teen romantic drama that has some boring scenes that drag. 6/10."
"kellieokamura","10","0","0","2 March 2017"," A Movie to Remember
","Picture this: The Varsity Football Quarterback and the Captain of the Cheerleading Squad fall deeply in love and live happily ever after- yeah yeah yeah we have all watched that movie. Most people tend to date other people based on similarities rather than their differences. However, the movie, ""A Walk to Remember"" directed by Adam Shankman takes you on a emotional roller-coaster when a young girl diagnosed with cancer uses her innocence to overcome society ""norms"" and change the life of a immature punk to show him that there is much more to life then simply just ""being cool"". The two teenagers remind us, the watchers, what love is really about. Jamie Sullivan is a brilliant girl who minds her own business and doesn't go out after dark. She is literally ""the pastor's daughter"" . She goes to church every Sunday, which is lead by her father. On the contrary, Landon Carter is the school jock that hangs out with the kids that go out every night to drink and do illegal things. Throughout the movie, you follow both characters who live totally different lives and witness how they fight through the doubt of others and overcome their differences. AWTR is one of those movies that you just don't get tired of watching, no matter how many times you watch it, believe me, I've watched it about 30 times.<br/><br/>Jamie Sullivan, the quirky unfashionable girl who wears the ""clothes her grandmother gave her"" is automatically perceived as the innocent girl on campus from the first second she makes her appearance walking by Landon Carter and his other rebellious friends. She was wearing a flower patterned dress that went all the way down to her ankles with a knitted sweater covering her shoulders and black sandals with her white socks peeking through the straps. She carries a bible with her everywhere she goes and always talks about the Lord. Landon and Jamie have been classmates since kindergarten, but Landon never really notices her because they are part of two totally different crowds.<br/><br/>At this time, Landon was shaken up when one of his friends was hospitalized after a drunk diving incident at a factory. He, along with his popular girlfriend, joins in on making fun of Jamie Sullivan. He is forced to audition for the school play to surround himself with better people. Only then does he really notice Jamie and sees her as more than just the innocent girl. Landon isn't a very motivated student, and struggles to memorize his lines for the play. Jamie is honest with Landon and doesn't pity him like all the other girls do. He eventually convinces Jamie to help him under one condition: he is not allowed to fall in love with her. He laughs like it was a joke and dismisses it as if the idea of him ever falling for her is unimaginable. That scene shows us how screwed up our society is. We are taught and molded to being with people who fit in the same categories that we don't even take differences into consideration. We later find out that the reason for this was because she was diagnosed with Leukemia. During the long afternoons going over lines, a spark is formed between them.<br/><br/>At first, Landon denies even knowing Jamie. However, a couple days later, Landon's friends play a sick prank on Jamie, photo shopping her head onto a half naked body and handing it out to the whole school. Overwhelmed, Jamie runs off crying. This was the turning point for Landon. After making sure Jamie was alright, he punches his best friend. This act of kindness allowed Jamie to really open up to Landon. It was the first moment in the movie that Jamie realized that he really did have a heart. The fact that the school jock would give up his friendship for the minister's daughter shows how much he really cared about her. <br/><br/>On their first date, Landon helps Jamie knock some items off her bucket list; being in two places at one time, getting a tattoo--temporary of course. After a long day, he takes her to the dock. There, they share their first kiss shortly followed by Landon saying the three words he wasn't supposed to say- ""I love you"". Landon is no longer ashamed to call Jamie his girlfriend, in fact he even holds her hand in front of his popular ex girlfriend as they walk by. While talking about their future, Landon brings up college, a topic Jamie really didn't want to talk about. Frustrated, she turns to him and drops the bomb and says ""I'm sick"". Landon's true colors shine through when he goes to his father (whom he hates) and cries while begging his father to help her, knowing there isn't a cure. Landon goes out of his way to make the remaining days she has left the best days of her life. Many people say that people never change, but Landon Carter is proof that people in fact can change for the better. It just takes the right person at the right time.<br/><br/>This movie is and probably will be my favorite love story of all time. The great acting, tear- jerking scenes, and brilliant throughout story line keeps your eyes glued to the screen the whole time. ""A Walk to Remember"" not only serves as means of entertainment, but also shows a thing or two about our society. We are so used to doing what we are told is ""normal"" based on stereotyping that we feel like doing anything differently would be considered wrong. But this movie reminds us what true love is really about. I'm not going to share too much about the ending for those who have yet to watch this film. All I am going to say is that if it is not already on there, this movie should be on your must-watch list because it is definitely a -movie- to remember."

","A Walk to remember is one of the biggest surprises of a movie i have ever seen in my life, i thought this was going to be a bad movie like really bad, but i was totally wrong. The story is about a guy named Landon carter who after his friend is hurt in a dare that he was forced to do, Landon is then put into the spring play where Jamie Sullivan is also being in. along the way Landon needs help with his lines since he got the lead role and asks Jamie for help, at first she isn't so sure but ends up helping him with his lines. Along the way Jamie and Landon both start to fall for each other and end up forming a relationship.<br/><br/>I loved this movie so much its one of my favourite movies of all time, one of the things i adore in the movie is Mandy Moore's performance its fantastic and one of the best performances in a film that i have seen in a film, she just really brings something to her role. Her character Jamie is just so well written and isn't that typical girl who cares about how she looks and what people think of her, if someone says something mean to her in the film she does not care whatsoever and i love that about her character, also she has an amazing singing voice in the movie and in real life of course the song only hope that she performs at one point during the film, is incredibly well written and performed so well. Shane west who plays Landon carter our main character, is also very well written and he gives a really great performance as well in the film. His character might seem bland at first but as the movie progresses he gets better as a character. The chemistry between West and Moore is fantastic in my opinion, their relationship is very well done and believable, at least to me it is some people might not find it believable but i did. Now I've watched this movie about four times now and each time i watched i loved it more, its crazy that i have not gotten sick of the film yet and thank god for that because i do not want to at all, the story might be a little predictable in a few parts and it can get a little cheesy in a couple of scenes but those are very minor and don't effect the film in anyway. The Soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks ever the movies theme is very well done especially when its used, but the songs are just great, along with Cry, only hope, its gonna be love all performed by Mandy Moore there are so many other great songs used through out the film. Overall A Walk to Remember is a flawless movie for me i truly do love this film so much, the performances are great the soundtrack is fantastic, the story is well written and the character of Jamie Sullavin is just perfectly written in my opinion, make a walk to remember one of the best love stories out there."

","A Walk to Remember is not a typical teenager's romance movie. Unlike movies nowadays, it truly reveals an innocence and honest love between a religious girl and a bad boy without all the unnecessary drama and teenagers' problem. The movie was intriguing from the moment Jamie met Landon at church, how he denied that he actually had fallen for her kindness and positive attitude towards life. I love the part when she sang for him for the school's play, how it made him lost his breath. Their love was so pure and beautiful, it can make you cry. Although we all can tell that she's hiding her illness from the beginning of their relationship, you still would like to see how she changed him forever. The movie lacks something in general, but overall I really enjoyed watching it. The original soundtrack has become my favorite. I can't help it since it's just so pure and beautiful."
"marlokastner","8","0","0","4 October 2016"," a short preview of A Walk to Remember
","A Walk to Remember is not just another cookie cutter chick flick. What differentiates it from all of the others is its caliber of acting, direction and writing. The film is based off of the book A Walk to Remember from the New York Times best selling author Nicholas Sparks. However if it weren't for Karen Janszen, the writer of the screenplay, we wouldn't have such a good movie. Yes it is a romantic drama, but it does a good job of avoiding a run-of-the-mill plot that can be easily anticipated by viewers. Rather this movie keeps the audience engaged through every moment. <br/><br/>In the film Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is a sweet, timid, God-loving teenager who is kind to everyone. Mandy Moore does a great job of embodying Jamie Sullivan. Moore is very convincing with her demure demeanor and her hush tone when speaking with others. As the movie progresses the audience can see Moore's transformation of Jamie. She speaks more clearly and her body language is more confident and sure. Moore's acting skills defiantly added to the believably of the story.<br/><br/>Landon Carter (Shane West) a delinquent who is punished by performing in the school play and volunteering on Saturdays and at a nearby school. Shane West also did a great job using his acting skills and masculine characteristics to grasp the attention of the audience. We get a glimpse of his character in the opening scene where yes he does dare a kid to jump off a tall tower into the water but he is the only one to save the kid and he doesn't rat his friends out when he gets caught. At first, you think it's the typical ""good girl falls for bad boy"" but it is surprisingly the other way around. The interactions between the two costars, for example, the way they were able to look in each other's eyes; it was as if they were a real couple. I do think that it's a matter of opinion but this is how I interpreted the film. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, Nicholas Sparks is an award-winning writer who has created some of the all time best love stores from The Notebook , The Vow, Dear John among others. So when he decides to sign a deal to turn one of his beloved books into movies it is important that the screen play does not ruffle any feathers for those die hard Nicholas Sparks fans. This was the job of Karen Janszen a tough thing to do when there are many factors to consider. I would say that Janszen does a phenomenal job of adapting the book to the big screen. The actors chosen for the rolls were also well selected in my opinion. They helped bring the book to life. Of course there are differences but in the book many of the key points aren't drawn out as long as they are in the movie, which I personally find to be a good thing when it comes to capturing and holding the audiences attention. <br/><br/>All of the intricacies come together to create a wonderful romantic drama that will out live the lives of the actors. The story of Jamie and Landon live on because of the dedication to there craft that Mandy Moore, Shane West, Karen Janszen, and Nicholas Sparks gave to the film."

","A Walk To Remember was on my hard drive for a month now, but I never got the urge to watch it. But then the other day my friend recommended me to watch it and that took me by surprise since I never thought he, of all people, would recommend me a romantic movie. So I thought it must be a really good movie if he recommended it to me.<br/><br/>And it was. <br/><br/>By the time I watched half of the movie, I knew that this is that type of a movie which divides opinions like few others. By the time I finished the movie and saw my earlier Facebook status regarding it, the comments proved me right - as there was no ""in the middle"" view on the move, it was either very good to some or very bad to the others.<br/><br/>I fall in the category who think this is a very good movie. This movie depicts the strength of love - that it could turn even the biggest of jerks to genuinely caring people. The acting of both the lead characters was incredible; especially Shane West's evolution from a popular-bully jerk to soft-heart and caring guy. <br/><br/>The movie could have been better in some aspects though; like it was too swift at some points, thought it should have panned out a bit more slow by adding some romantic scene before the heart-breaking revelation by Mandy Moore-played Jamie. I may be cruel, but I also think adding a final scene with Jamie and Landon would have given more emotional pain to the viewers, but may be the director didn't want that and hence avoided showing a scene like that (wanted to be more elaborate, but that would include spoilers and I can't do that). <br/><br/>Overall, a good movie which I would rate 7/10."

His expand of emotions creates such a nice atmosphere that really had me stuck in for the time cost. <br/><br/>Storyline cut short.

","Landon Carter (Shane West) is a popular self-obsessed top dog. He is uncaring and when one of his pranks goes wrong, he puts a fellow student in the hospital. As punishment, he is forced to be the lead in a school play. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the reverend's daughter who has nothing in common with Landon. She is also in the play, and Landon ask her for help. Only he won't let anybody know.<br/><br/>This is a predictable teen melodrama based on a Nicholas Sparks novel that has all the stereotypes. I'm just surprised that the formula works yet again. All the characters are stock creations. It moves along the well traveled tracks. Both leads are likable and solid but uninspired. Of course, this being a Nicholas Sparks movie. There has to be a secret or twist. I do wish there was something more profound and original dialog. The stale conversations really grinds down this movie."

","This is a perfect movie to watch with your date/girlfriend/wife when alone. It basically retells the story of two opposites falling in love with each other.

Add to that the fact that this takes place in a small town and all the characters being likable.<br/><br/>There are several other romantic movies released in the previous decade that had better acting and original stories (Before Sunrise, The Notebook, Amelie).

","Mandy Moore and Shane West gave great real life performances. Mandy Moore made her character Amy Sullivan stand out and remarkable beauty. This teenage love story is sincere and sweet. It is a mature teenage love story. It brings back nostalgic memories from high school years. When you finally think the teenagers will live happily ever after; the story takes a tragic turn. The teenage love story brings you to tears in the end. As always, book author Nicholas Sparks brings out the tenderness and compassion in his characters and reminds us that goodness still exists in the world. Also, it reminds us that true love will not abandon and will always love us no matter what our faults are."

","Just your stereotypical lame teen flick -- with major religious undertones, which, by the way, was quite annoying at times. It's all been done before, and much better than this.<br/><br/>The ""bullies"" were so one-dimensional and unconvincing. They failed to show any genuine interest in Jamie (the bullies in ""Carrie"", for instance, were far more involved), so it made Jamie look almost like a paranoid drama queen.<br/><br/>Landon's ex-girlfriend's character was horribly underdeveloped, not to mention the rest of the ""cool"" clique -- they were just cardboard cut-outs with screen time of about 10 seconds. 95% of time time, the focus was on Jamie alone -- she was supposed to be likable, but so much emphasis on a single person renders you fed-up with - annoyed by - her.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore was kind of miscast anyway. She doesn't pass for an outcast.<br/><br/>The good thing is that this movie is not irritating or overly dumb (it's actually more or less watchable); the bad thing: very clichéd, too predictable, and becomes boring very quickly.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a rating this high, because Mandy Moore turned out to be surprisingly decent at acting.

","""A Walk to Remember"" a film based off of Nicholas Sparks best selling book. Staring Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan and Shane West as Landon Carter. The film opens with Landon and his gang being rebellious landing a ""new member"" in the hospital, and Landon in the police station. Jamie, a girl from high school, is the complete opposite; she is known as the preacher's daughter and plays this role very well. She does a stunning job of acting innocent and pure. Her path collides with London's when he is thrown into the school musical as a part of his punishment for his behavior. Landon does a fine job of showing that he doesn't care about this play or about life. There is a small portion of singing in this film done by Mandy Moore. She hits all of her notes. While watching you can tell that this song was previously recorded and that she is lip- syncing. This also might be because it was filmed in 2002. Landon soon falls in love with Jamie after hours of rehearsal. As their relationship develops Landon turns a corner and becomes a new person full of life. During this time Jamie breaks the news to Landon that she is leukemia and has stopped talking treatment. Landon along with Jamie's father deal with her death and he grows as a person. There are times in this film where the acting isn't up to par, but over all the cast is chosen very well, and they all do a great job in this journey together."

","It's funny because this movie has been out for almost 10 years now, and I had never taken the time to really sit down ad watch the whole thing in one sitting. From the bits I had seen, the movie was cheesy and predictable. But when I sat down yesterday, and watched every scene from start to finish, I realized that this is actually a really beautiful movie. Its a story about love and faith. At times, Mandy Moores acting skills were a little gigglerific, but as a viewer you almost look over it, because the character she plays is such a beautiful person, both inside and out (I can't tell you how many times I commented on Mandy Moore's beauty in this movie). It's really a good movie, about the power of love. I would recommend it to any romance lover."

But not that what was shown was not sufficient. I loved that. Its just that the transition of Landon from the cool, ruffian type, jock - stereotype to that of a responsible and passionate and highly compassionate person who fell in love with Jamie was done too quickly.<br/><br/>Lastly, the overall-ness of the movie is what makes me give it 8 stars. Not just the fact that tears had flown out of my eyes in the passionate scenes of affection between Jamie and Landon or when Landon and his father reconcile on his father's doorstep. Neither just the ending which was heart wrenching and quite unfair to be honest. I find it hard to come to terms with such an ending. So overall, the movie was quite pure. It had some thing about it, the chemistry between Jamie and Landon in the second half of the movie being one of the things.<br/><br/>Also, I have to say I agree with Juno Blue's review here, in which the last line (i guess) he put was ""So ultimately what matters is not the length of the life lived, but the quality"".<br/><br/>This movie I can say, is ""50/50"" (*ing Joseph Gordon Levitt) but with a different ending.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie.

","Nicholas Sparks is known for writing several stories that really tug on the heartstrings. And for this novel adaptation, it is no surprise that A Walk to Remember should please its audience at a high level. The story is about a young man who has lost his place in the world. That is, until he runs into a person he never thought to expect to change his life for the better. Not to mention, everything else around him brightens up as well.<br/><br/>Shane West stars as Landon Carter, a stuck up selfish high school senior who hangs with the wrong crowd until he soon learns there's more than meets the eye to people you only pass by in the hallway. West's acting is well done and making him the delinquent character was accurate for his look. Mandy Moore, plays Mr. Carter's soon to be love interest Jamie Sullivan, a nerdy yet very attractive co-star. Moore's performance was even more amiable. Her face, her voice and even her hair style played a significant role in making her the most simple-looking but complex character.<br/><br/>Even the rest of the cast has its charm. Carter's best friend Eric, played by Al Thompson is funny for his interest in women and his ability to be serious when he needs too. Even Dean (Clayne Crawford), who plays a loose cannon at first, becomes less self centered as time progresses. All of this and more are accounted for because of how the story works. Karen Janszen, who adapted this book, did a great job with the screenplay. Yes, this movie has its ups and downs but that's what a true romance genre film will involve. What else would you expect? Nothing is ever perfect.<br/><br/>Mervyn Warren's soundtrack to the movie also works. It's not there all the time in the film but when it is heard, it will evoke the emotion audiences will want to feel at the moment on the screen. Going back to the screenplay though, the way West and Moore work together is really convincing. The way they played off each other was fun and pure in a sense of what love should be like for anyone who loves another individual. That fact that Sullivan turns Carter into a better person is gratifying alone! If the world were like this everywhere, heck, everyone's life would be even better than where it stands now.<br/><br/>The story, music and characters are all strung together in one big blanket of sweetness. This Nicholas Sparks book adaptation is sure to please any audience."

Although I'm not a teenager for quite some time now, the movie still speaks to me and reminds me things in life that we all so easily forget in the monotonous day to day - we can actually be good to each other and do a little effort to make each other happy every day, that being cool has nothing to do with being happy and especially that love is : ""always patient and kind; it is never jealous, love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offense, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes. Love does not come to an end"" Great acting, great story, great thing to remember."

","I usually love Nicholas Sparks books turned films, but this one didn't capture my heart. I mean it was alright and a feel good movie, but I felt Shane west as Landon Carter didn't express much chemistry towards Jamie (Mandy Moore).<br/><br/>The storyline was great and I was definitely expecting a problem to occur to one of the characters, as many of Sparks books do. I felt that they should have shown more time filming Jamie and Landon working together before he tells her he loves her. It kind of went from one bit where he was rude and mean to her, from another bit telling her he loves her.<br/><br/>And the scene where Jamie is photo shopped onto a photo which is stuck all through the school. That scene could have been so much more improved and dramatic all I felt was that he saw her upset, then punched a guy and then it was it.<br/><br/>But apart from that Mandy Moore was brilliant, she did such a great job in portraying a purist girl without being to cheesy. I felt she did much more of the loving towards Landon, and he was just letting it come to him.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie, and although there are a few things that could have been improved, it still managed to make me cry and become attached to the storyline. Its a film about first loves, miracles and opening yourself up to things you never imagined."

","I can see why this movie got overall bad critics reviews. The acting is melodrama at its best/worst (choose your preferable option), the storyline is very one-dimensional. Music pops up almost every important moment to enhance the feelings and the flick is full of cliché one liners.<br/><br/>However, for all the bad features one could think a movie has, this one does all of it at the very best one could imagine. If you find yourself separated from noise, from disturbing lights. Only with a screen in front of you and the audio reaching your ears as would a one to one conversation...then this you will not finish this unaffected. I had trouble holding my tears (even though I'm a guy). All these lost moments from your child hood when everything was still sincere and you could say what was on your mind and how you felt about someone without feeling guilty or having second thoughts, it all comes back up again when watching this. It's highly moralizing too, thus providing a perfect form of escapism to those who are sick with modern society. <br/><br/>Dialogues are 'uncovered', uncalculated. Characters just say what they've got to say. To portray such a wide foray of emotive dialogues is not only daring from a director's point of view but also daring as people are not quickly content and seek many metaphors, non-direct plots and other figures of speech in modern movies.<br/><br/>This movie is not one for the videophiles per se,but then again it's one for the ones among us that want to be stirred not by the cinematic qualities but by the underlying morals and naked emotions."

","An extremely aggressive bad boy meets girl and changes every single thing in his personality when he falls in love with her. Not that I find it impossible to happen, but it is very Hollywood. I have nothing against its main plot, but ""A Walk to Remember"" is one high holy temple for girls, they are always stating how awesome this movie is and bla bla bla. I do like romances, but this story sometimes feels to be too fast. One minute they meet, one minute they fall in love and one minute she tells him she's about to die due to cancer. Some scenes are inspiring, I admit it, but nothing that will make this film any perfect. In matter of romance, I think ""Titanic"" is a thousand times more intense than this, not to mention the power of the main plot.

","Okay so I originally downloaded this movie for my wife and I was reluctant to watch it with her but hey, a man's gotta watch a chick flick from time to time.<br/><br/>It starts off poorly, in an almost TV movie manner. I was bored from the onset. Rich kids in a majestic sea side town moaning about their life doesn't exactly get me to sympathise with them. But everything changed the moment Mandy Moore came on screen. I'm not the kind of person to have any idea who she was before the movie. But as soon as she walked on screen she lifted the movie up and I cared about her character. Then gradually the relationship between Jamie and Brandon begins to develop in a kind of love hate way. Shane West does a decent job as the troubled, slightly wild boy youth, but again it's Mandy Moore who steals the show as a woman who is pretty much every man's dream. She pulls a face that makes her look so vulnerable, you just want to put your arm around her. She is beautiful as a girl without make-up and dressed in plain clothes and she is smart, sassy and fiery, with just an edge of weakness. You really feel that she's not really acting and it' the real, young and vulnerable girl there on screen.<br/><br/>There are a few tear jerking moments towards the end and one in particular always gets me (Bizzarely I've watched it three times now). Brandon finally makes up with his dad and they hug and he finally breaks down in his father's arms. I don't know why, but I can't hold back the tears at this point.<br/><br/>That said I've given the film and 8 and not a 9 because there is a TV movie feel to some of the film and I can't help but cringe during some of the singing moments. Obviously they have only been put in as Mandy is a singer and this is probably contractual. I would let this pass, as she does a decent job, particularly in the school play scene. But it's dubbed singing. She's not singing live on set with the raw voice you would get from that. She's singing in a studio afterwards and it's really obvious and overly polished and she even resorts to a few of the modern pop note dragging tactics which remind me, for a few moments that she's not Mandy Moore and not Jamie the school girl. Which breaks the spell of the movie a little.<br/><br/>The other slight issue I have is the one of religion. The film is pro-Chistianity, and despite the fact that Brandon seems to remain and Atheist throughout, it almost suggests that Jamie is only the person she is because of her faith and not because she just a smart, good person. The Christianity isn't pushed too much, but it still tarnishes the film a little.<br/><br/>Still all in all, if you watch this without being too cynical, get some tissues and enjoy!"

All in all it was a great movie to watch. The only drawback - the acting. Although the main characters are believable, the acting in some scenes of the movie did not really convince me. On several occasions during the movie I caught myself thinking ""ok, I understand what is happening here, but it's being demonstrated in a clumsy way"" (the scene in the canteen for example, or reconciliation between Landon and his friends...) That is why I gave the movie 8 out of 10. I can hope it was due to the fact that I watched it in a different language, which probably ruined the feeling.

","I love the writing of Nicholas Sparks, I find it very heartfelt and honest. When it comes to the book A Walk to Remember, it was good with a heartfelt ending and characters and the story did touch me, but some of dialogue was occasionally lazy and repetitive for my liking.<br/><br/>The movie is a decent one. It does try to stick to the spirit of the book even if one or two of the details aren't as coherent, and it mostly succeeds. The pace can be a little too mannered though, and although most of it is genuinely touching there are other times throughout the movie when the story and subject matter tries a little too hard to evoke emotion. There is the length too, I personally felt it could have been shorter.<br/><br/>However, A Walk to Remember is beautifully filmed, with beautiful locations and striking photography. The soundtrack is poignant and beguiling, the script tries hard to excise some of the more lazy and repetitive dialogue of the book and while some of it is still a little too repetitive for my taste it is also very honest and heartfelt. The story was enough to warm and break my heart, and the ending touched me hugely. The direction is eager as are the performances. Shane West is very charming and Mandy Moore is convincing, but Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah are the ones who really impress.<br/><br/>Overall, while it does try too hard sometimes A Walk to Remember is a decent movie. For other movies based on Sparks' work, I recommend The Notebook and Message in a Bottle over this both of which genuinely resonated with me, but as a film A Walk to Remember is much better than the forced and predictable The Last Song. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

I'll freely admit that the book required some updating to make it accessible to a wider audience and for the most part the updates were handled well.<br/><br/>The addition of Jamie's numbered list of goals was great. As was most of the astronomy side-story. Even the beginning initiation sequence with Landon's crew jumping from the tower fit well in characterizing Landon.<br/><br/>However the roaring 20's play was cringe-worthy at best. I can't understand why it was used. The original contained a religious play and I can see where that might not play with today's movie going audience but the student written musical that replaced it was just terrible.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was well worth watching but I'll have to fast forward through the school play scenes if I watch it again."

As he is doing community service from his school he meets a Christian girl named Jamie Sullivan(TANGLED'S MANDY MOORE) whom he knew since kindergarten according to the film. As he is practicing his lines for the school play he asks Jamie to help him but when he sees her in the play he starts to fall in love with her as she promised him previously in an earlier scene that he shouldn't fall for her because she is hiding a terrible secret from him she is dying of leukemia and has several months to live. As she spends the last months dying she wrote a list on things to do before she dies and so Landon decides to help her make all those miracles come true.<br/><br/>I liked the chemistry between Moore and West because it was kinda like a star crossed lover scenario between the two and I also like the story that goes with it you've got a bad boy who starts to become more nicer and kind and a shy girl who's father is a Christian minister.

","In this funny and charming film, there are tears and some scenes that just make you want to laugh, cry, and think about life. Jamie, aka ""Saint Mary"", just wants to live with what life she's got and make the most of it. Landon is always getting into trouble, until he meets Jamie when forced to be in the school play. He rehearses with Jamie and her one condition was, ""You can't fall in love with me."" And with a laugh Landon agreed, thinking that it would never happen, but little did he know promises dealing with love are very hard to keep.<br/><br/>Jamie has a secret reason for not wanting Landon to fall in love with her, but he does anyways. She just wants to live while she can, with as little ties as possible. She is enthralling and independent, she is very strong-willed. She doesn't let others influence her, like with the clothes she wears. She is a must see character.<br/><br/>Landon, a former bad boy, has to be in the school play and is practicing with Jamie (with her one condition). He promised not to fall in love with her (with a chuckle, I might add), but he found something compelling about her, the way she isn't bothered by what people say. He couldn't help it, he was hooked, he broke his promise, but Jamie didn't seem upset by this. He is very clever, interesting, and intriguing.<br/><br/>And last, but not least, Dean is Landon's good friend who stays with him though thick and thin, even when Landon goes good and Dean does like it, he still stays with him. He is funny and adds that certain half bad, half good guy in there.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie if you're in to a love story with change of heart and a secret twist. It will keep you on your toes thinking ""What's the secret?"" Jamie's little condition makes Landon want to know ""Why?"" If you want to know why then watch ""A Walk to Remember."""

","I am a 41 year old father - former military. I was flipping thru the channels one night while working late on some mindless work statistics for a morning presentation - and I stumbled across this movie. The channel guide on cable gave a few hints regarding the storyline, and it looked somewhat interesting - given that nothing else better was playing. I was saying to myself - I wonder how they are going to pull this one off. Fortunately - I caught it pretty much at the beginning - just as the scene of Jamie singing in the Choir at church was playing. I thought - OK - I wonder if this is the plain Jane that is going to be the love interest - certainly nothing special about her. I let it play for a few minutes - thinking I was going to change the channel at the next opportunity. A funny thing happened...I kept watching, getting to know, and even like the characters. They seemed real- the dialog seemed real...the chemistry grew between Landon and Jamie. Then - the amazing part happened - Jamie blossomed into this beautiful young lady at the school play - and what an amazing singing performance with 'Only Hope'! Before this - I knew nothing of Mandy Moore- other than vaguely remembering the song 'Candy'. The scene where their darkened silhouettes were staring at each other after the kiss at the play - very subtle, but you just knew the romance would grow. I then was hooked - and captivated at the story, the acting, and chemistry. This movie was brilliantly cast- with Mandy Moore putting on a captivating performance. What a beautiful singing voice and such a pretty young lady. Talk about the ugly duckling changing into Beautiful swan! Some reviews of this movie are harsh - if you have a heart, ever loved or wanted to be loved - then this movie has a message for you. Enjoy it for what it is - a beautiful work of art with a timeless message! Hats off to Mandy Moore and Shane West. It could not have been better cast."

","I thought this movie was amazing. I saw it when it first came out and just rewatched it now. I looked up the reviews it received, more curious about those the second time around as I admit I was part of its targeted teen audience the first time around, and was shocked by how badly received it was by critics! These guys must go around eating puppies. Sure, parts were a little sappy but I wouldn't say that they were Cheesy. And yeah, there were Christian undertones but not the kind that don't transcend the religion. The only piece of scripture I noticed that they drew reference to was the scripture about love from Corinthians. I'm not even Christian (although I'm not Against Christianity) and I have this quote framed on my wall. It's beautiful and evolved. For those who want to turn their nose up on anything Christian, you're missing out on some pretty advanced thinking in some instances in my opinion. I read a lot of criticism that the movie is unrealistic to how a male would really act by a lot of jaded, cynical women and I wonder if they know that this is based off of a novel by a Man - Nicholas Sparks - who based it off of a True story involving his own sister. If you're content finding happiness in buying things, wallowing in the shallow, bashing anything with heart and somehow acting like those things are evolved than this movie probably isn't for you. No, you don't have to be a Conservative or a Christian to enjoy this movie. Just a believer in love and the human spirit, a believer that we are more than consumers, physical pleasure obsessed animals or individuals with aloof power complexes whose purpose is nothing more than to outsnob others. Mandy Moore was truly amazing in this piece as well. I think it was altogether wonderfully inspirational. Inspiration doesn't usually come from the mediocre, it comes from the extraordinary beliefs of great people who see what could be. Who cares if this probably wouldn't happen Usually in real life. It was a piece about a ""miracle."""

","I have always believed that our characters and our lives are fashioned by those we love and associate with. Perhaps subconsciously we want to be like them, This film is based on a rather sweet story of a teenager with no particular beliefs who falls in love with a girl of gentle nature and strong Christian beliefs Her father a minister of religion restricts her social activity informing her that when a young man gives a present he expects something in return. Despite her father's disapproval, they continue to see each other and their love blossoms.<br/><br/>Quite unexpectedly the girl is struck with cancer and their happy world is turned upside down. The whole tempo and mood changes and the actors are called upon to express these new feelings. The two leads give creditable performances The rebellious young man becomes thoughtful, kind and caring; the girl calm and courageous awaiting some kind of miracle. There are some touching moments towards the end of the film. The girl rallies sufficiently and the two are wed, but shortly afterward collapses and dies. Such a heart breaking incident..<br/><br/>Then follows my favourite line. The young man is sitting with his father-in-law and quietly says ""She always prayed for a miracle"".. After a pause her father says ""You were that miracle"".<br/><br/>This is not an award-winning film The acting on the whole was well done although I did have trouble with the lack of clarity of the mumbling voices. I think sub-titles were required. I have to say I preferred ""Love Story"" which has a similar theme and a great sound track."

","I read the book before watching the movie. I have to say, the book isn't very good. The style of writing did not fit in with the mood. So, it wasn't very thriller, although some parts of the book were tolerable (like the relationship between Jamie and her father). I watched the movie right after reading it, and i hated it (it was better than the book for sure). I couldn't imagine how someone who is going through so much could have so much faith in god, in life. I certainly wouldn't. So I decided to watch it again this weekend and I have to say, I get it now. This is a story about how two people learn and sort of complete each other. Some lines are very corny and it's mixed in with some bad acting, but the story isn't half bad. You will either sob through the movie or turn it off half way. It really all depends on what sort of mood/light you watch it in.<br/><br/>I would give this movie 6.5/10, but I can't."

","A dark-haired, shabbily-dressed Mandy Moore stars as a high school gal with a deep dark secret in A WALK TO REMEMBER. Costar Shane West plays a bad boy who gets himself in trouble and is forced to do community service. This includes acting with Moore in a school play about shy lovers. Predictably, West falls in love with Moore even when she warns him not to. Then her secret comes out (it starts with a ""c""), and he loves her even more, enough to ask her to marry him. The film is a tender tale of the redemptive powers of faith and love, and forgiveness. It is frankly very moving for such a hokey plot. Peter Coyote and Darryl Hannah costar as parents. Hannah is almost unrecognizable under a dark wig and little makeup. A must-see."

"lishagurl87","7","0","0","18 February 2006"," what I think
","All in all, as a movie, it does well on its own. A bit sappy but good nonetheless. This Nicholas Sparks (I've recently come into his books) adapted film wasn't quite the tear-jerker that ""The Notebook"" was, but it pays its due to his book I suppose.<br/><br/>However, it doesn't really follow the novel at all. (I watched the movie first as I wasn't really into Nicholas Sparks; actually I'm still unsure) SPOILER ALERT! (I suppose, but more so for the book, if you haven't read it yet.) They did cover the wedding scene in the Special Features on the DVD so I won't go into that.<br/><br/>Jamie never has a list of things she wants to do (the one most outstanding is being in two places at once). Her father writes a play called ""The Chrimstas Angel"" which gives Jamie a MUCH more wholesome look than in whatever the play is in the movie. Landon doesn't kiss her then and he only realizes he's in love with her after spending time with her at an orphanage she has devoted her life and work to helping.<br/><br/>And although Landon's best friend Eric makes cracks, he accepts Landon's decision and makes the comment that he's finally ""growing up"", which shows something different than the punching scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Jamie never lets Landon in her home and the father disallows too much unsupervised contact between the two. AND they never work on the lines from the play together.<br/><br/>Jamie doesn't have that awareness of being ""special friends"" where no one can see; she's just her own person doing her own thing and helping others. And the reverend announces the fact that Jamie has leukemia to the congregation and everyone starts to feel guilty and at one point Eric breaks down because he doesn't feel someone like Jamie deserves this outcome. (Bible-toting do-gooder; AND there's a specific special reason why she carries a tattered Bible everywhere) Basically, READ the book. You'll find it's quite different from the movie.<br/><br/>Oh and Landon's ex-girlfriend barely gets any mention except for when she gets drunk and pukes all over the bathroom and herself and Jamie and Landon help her clean up and go home. There's no jealousy or resentment.<br/><br/>When Mandy Moore (Before she filmed) had ""A Walk to Remember"" as a favorite book, I assumed she'd want to stay true. The movie is completely different, but like I said, it holds its own."

","This movie is so good, that it made me live its exact story while watching it.<br/><br/>Indeed, it talks about how a bad feeling can turn into something beautiful & unforgettable by the power of love.<br/><br/>So, when I picked the DVD, I thought ""Another boring teen movie!"". But, when I put it on my player, the title song (Cry) struck me. It is all I asked for music: easy listening & moving, so I can't put it outside my head. Then, I watched the bonuses (I know: every people tells I should invert my habit). I found Mandy Moore to be a lively actress, as well as Shane West (a good Anakin he may have been). Then, I watched it. And frankly, it didn't caught me until it answered two of my questions:<br/><br/>1.Will the gift of his pink shirt be used in the continuity of the storyline? <br/><br/>2. How this storyline could evolve as it kept going stronger & happier? <br/><br/>The answers I received was so respectful & surprising, that I was won over.

The movie captures a rebel and a Christian girl coming together for love and support. And it's not just about how it's a really good tearjerker, it tells a story about love so strong it could last through anything, even death. The fact that the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks book made me want to<br/><br/>see this movie. I've read all of his books and have been hooked on them ever<br/><br/>since.

I didn't want her to die, but that's what helped Landon make his life better, he did it for her, and himself. Since I'm a hopeless romantic, this is one of my favorite movies: a classic love story.

And everyone gets together because of her and in her death there's a bright new day.<br/><br/>But dammit, it worked. The script was crisp, the cinematography and editing were superb, and the performances were first rate. And then there was Mandy Moore. I couldn't get my eyes off of Ms Moore, not because of her beauty, and that's undeniable, but her acting was star caliber. She took a part that was wide open to failure, and with skill and sincerity, triumphed. I was extremely impressed. I call this the Gilligan Phenomenom, where a hackneyed plot and mediocre scripting is eclipsed by stellar performances. This film falls into that category.

It's a love story so much like the others, but so simple and real and sad that it somehow surpasses the rest. The movie gave me the exact same feeling. It's so simple, yet filled with so much emotion that you just have to watch it over and over again. Mandy Moore gives an unbelievable breakout performance as Jamie Sullivan and is so genuine and pure that you just can't help but love her. Shane West did a brilliant, totally believable job as a rebel whose life is turned around completely by this love that he has for Jamie. This movie makes me cry every time I watch it and not only because its sad, but because of the pure love in it. These two characters have such a chemistry that jumps right off the screen and into your heart. And seeing Shane West, one of the bad boys in Hollywood, cry uncontrollably in the arms of his father will get to you every time. I honestly recommend this movie to everyone and guarantee that everyone will come out with this wonderful feeling AND...about a box worth of wadded Kleenex!!!"

","You have to be kidding me. I really started to love this movie as I watched it, it was an excellent love story/tragedy, and it made me very emotional for most of the 2nd half of the movie... and then came the ending. There was nothing wrong with performances, Moore and West are excellent, but they cannot save the last 5 minutes of the movie. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, expect something very anticlimactic. For those of you who have seen it, there was a possibility for closure that was probably filmed but left out. It's obvious that everyone in the movie can pull off what would be needed to seal the deal, so why not? I can easily compare ""A Walk To Remember"" with a video game where you are totally hooked, but after a few hours the game randomly says ""you win"" and shows the end credits. Cut the last 5 minutes off of the end of the film and leave it to my imagination... 10/10. As is, 5/10 for a cop-out finale. Very disappointing overall."

This may sound odd to most people, but she is a perfect model of the kind of girls I always thought were the sexiest and coolest in high school. Old fashioned, religious, conservative, pretty, quiet, intelligent, constructive and active in extra activities, I was in love with 'Jamie' for the entire film.<br/><br/>The drama is somewhat predictable but that's ok. Landon drives an awesome early Chevy Camaro, and it is cool to see Jamie being driven around in that beautiful car. There's a few typical scenes of the ""cool kids"" pulling a mean prank, making fun of people, the reformed kid turning sides, and more cliches you'd know this film would have. But still, it's a decent hearttugger and the song Mandy sings during the play is very good."

","I have just seen this on DVD and would like to add my comments to those already placed.<br/><br/>I rarely cry at a film; however this is one that I do not mind admitting to crying at. I felt that the film was very tender, quiet and sensitive, as surely the plot requires. I felt the acting was more than apt for the quality required: if anything the cast were let down by a, perhaps, stilted script, which could explain the `jumpy' stages of the relationship.<br/><br/>I have read a few negative comments here and would like to say that not all movies have to break the `expected', that is if the plot is a well worn one, why does it have to be different? Why can it not just be another pleasant story around a previously done outline? Why for a change can the `bad guy' not change in to a good guy: it does happen! Why is it when this happens some people do not see it for the value that it brings?

SOMETHING told me to tape this movie and watch it in it's entirety. I feel the movie seldom lags and keeps your attention if, for no other reason, you must find out what Jamie and Landon are heading for. Surely the outgoing, popular and free spirited Landon will bypass Jamie eventually. But it never happens. That's because Jamie & Landon share an unknown common ground brought on by the fact that they have known each other and been in the same class since Kindergarten. I feel Jamie has had her eye on Landon for a big part of her life and she wants to get to know him better. Landon, on the other hand, sees no need to know her and be put out of the in crowd. He is satisfied with his life as a loose footed free spirit. Jamie says things that Landon is both curious about and even enamored by. She is very down to earth and she slowly leads Landon down ""her"" path. Plain but still a beautiful person, Jamie unveils a new her when singing her song in the school play. Remember, SHE wrote it. You can see Landon falling over himself in his attentive looks and feelings as Jamie sings ""The song"". I find it to be beautifully sung and wonderfully choreographed. Jamie has tipped the scales by being herself and Landon and even some of his friends sees a glamorous and outright drop dead beauty singing her true feelings. Landon wastes little time attempting to be with Jamie again. His remark ""I can't just be your friend"" tips his hand and leads him to her with no regrets. This movie deserves universal credit for the scenes and music continually fitting the mood. I have watched the movie 25 times or more and purchased the soundtrack. ""Only Hope"" is a fitting title for her song because it explains so much about the two of them needing this relationship. The movie never tries to make Jamie look hot or sexy. She remains herself but her inner beauty comes out more in every scene. The Wedding is the culmination of alot of misunderstood relationships made stronger by the bond between Bride and Groom. It is still the most well done and beautiful wedding scene I have ever witnessed. They arrive at the altar sure of their Love no matter how long they have to share it. I'm a 56 year old male who thinks this movie will go down as one of the most underrated movies ever. I never heard of Mandy Moore and consider her acting in stride with some of the big names.

In essense, the plot is the same as everything you see on made for TV movies but the plot is not what's so special.<br/><br/> Both Mandy Moore and Shane West giving either career best or career making performances. They take the cheap story thrown at them and they develop a chemistry between their different characters that people of all ages can appreciate.<br/><br/> I read the book about year after having seen the movie and I still think they did a good job adapting the novel. The movie contains all the needed parts of the book and does not drastically change anything. The humor in the book is tossed out in favor of a more somber and serious tone but that's good because it helps to set it apart from all other teen movies.<br/><br/>***/****"

","Of all the movies I have watched, not one has ever made me cry since Titanic. This one did. A Walk to Remember is one of the best films I have ever seen in years. A simple love story that is based upon the book by Nicholas Sparks(even the book made me cry). This is certainly not a movie to miss. It will touch everyone's hearts with the true meaning of love. Shane West and Mandy Moore did a great job in the film.I've waited so long for a movie like this. It'll make you want to watch it again and again(I watched it 11 times so far). I promise that no matter how many times you watch this movie, you will never get bored of it like you do with other movies. This movie changed my life and I will always remember it as the best movie I ever saw!"

","A Walk to Remember is a beautiful romance story about how two high school teens, total opposites of each other, find love.<br/><br/>Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the minister's (Peter Coyote) daughter, a sweet, ""good"" girl who has very few friends and only wants to live life the best she can.  Landon Carter (Shane West) is a hot teen in Jamie's school who gets in trouble and is sentenced to doing community service.  When Jamie agrees to help him with his lines for the school play, they learn to find love and friendship...but Jamie has a terrible secret, and soon it threatens to tear them apart forever.<br/><br/>This story about love and faith was excellent, although it doesn't quite follow the book written by Nicholas Sparks.  If you like love stories with some drama, I highly recommend it."

"ks4","8","0","0","6 April 2004"," A warm and natural romantic movie.
","Shane West stars as the local playboy, Landon, the popular guy, who has some moral issues and is quite a bad boy, he messes up from the start and is forced to take extra special classes, sort of a community service for his wrongs, here he gets to know the geeky and unpopular Jaime (Mandy Moore), at first Landon refuses to talk to her and avoids her at all costs, but slowly Jaime gains on Landon..<br/><br/>The geeky girl inspires the popular guy for a 180 degree change, the stereotype hollywood story have its prints on this movie, but compared to all the other teen movies now a days this movie is after all different, it does not try to be funny with stupid jokes, it's natural and realistic and deals with more than just love, there are many other things to be considering in this movie, there's a lot of moral questions which are put up to question, but this movie is very warm and is told with great patience.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie is definetely that it tries to be a serious romantic movie that will make you feel and think rather than the usual dumb crap that Hollywood spits out, there is never any doubt this is a Hollywood story, but it still manages to engage it's viewer and i must admit i at several times were at the verge of dropping a tear, or even two.<br/><br/>
The cast is very well done, shane west and mandy moore have a great chemistry througout the movie, and i think it's good to see that Mandy Moore can more than just sing, but actually also act, multi talent i guess, at least she does a fine job in this movie.<br/><br/>Now one thing i really loved about this movie as well was that it does not rush into romantic sequences, i loved all the weird small moments where Landon tries to act cool towards Jaime, especially the scene in the bus where he's a cold hearted b*****d i liked, it's good to see that it had no rush reaching it's initial goal.<br/><br/>Now as i made this sound all very well, and it is a good movie, but there are some flaws which i kinda disliked, for a starter i think it all became a lil bit typically hollywood when everybody made up with their wrongs towards each other and it ended with everyone happy and smiling, and the end is also a pretty poor attempt on making the perfect ending, in my opinion it should have ended with Shane West's voice over while looking at the fall weather.<br/><br/>However, even though this movie has it's parts of typical hollywood scripts, it also has many parts where it stands out, and among them are the story itself, i think this is one one of the better romantic movies from USA lately, it's nice to see that not all romantic movies have to be dumb now a days, that there still is a market that focuses on touching ones heart, so even though many parts of this movie has been seen before, i can not deny that it touched my heart a lot, and it was a very moving and well told story, i think it should have a lot of credit for that. lately it's not many movies that really can touch my heart i think, but this did a fine job doing that, which is brilliant, i love it when a movie reaches inside.<br/><br/>8/10"

"gmyersut","Null","0","0","17 March 2004"," Sentimental and it feels good.
","I read a lot of critics' reviews of this movie and noted that most of the critics hated it.  They cited the flaws of the movie as its over-sentimentality, its predictable plot, its implausible characters, and its lack of sex.  All I can say is what an awful life to be a movie critic. If a movie can only be good without sentimentality or with sex in it, then we have truly descended into a dark hole as a society.  Only those moviegoers hardened by relentless violence and cheap thrills on-screen can possibly be said to be completely lacking in sentiment, and those viewers will not like this movie.  This movie IS sentimental, and without apology. In the end, it is how a movie makes you FEEL that counts the most, and A Walk to Remember will make you feel something - it will make you feel GOOD! It's a good story, a heartwarming story, with some pathos added.  It may very well clear your tear ducts, and hopefully that is nothing of which we need to be ashamed.<br/><br/>Some viewers may find the plot somewhat predictable, and in one way the movie is reminiscent of 1970's Love Story (which the critics back then lambasted as well, but the public loved it).  As for implausible characters - who among us cannot relate to these characters?  Every high school in America has its `in-crowd' and its social outcasts.  Too often a high school student can either be popular or studious, but not both.  This movie is the touching story of two young lives that manage to build a love across the chasm between the two social orders, and they do it with dignity, respect, charm, and a tenderness that we should all wish we had shown in our high school days.  Shane West and Mandy Moore do a very creditable job of portraying the main characters.  This movie has flaws - chief among them being the overabundance of the various forms of the word `sh#t.'  Also, in the interest of keeping the movie in the usual time frame, as well as keeping the story moving along, the transformation in Landon as he spends time with Jamie is compressed to a couple of short scenes.  This area might have been expanded without injury to the movie overall, but I think most viewers understand the necessary time compression in a movie.<br/><br/>Overall impression:  This movie is a breath of fresh air.  The actors are true to their characters, and the characters are heartwarming and real.  A very touching film. 9/10"

Adam Shankman is a great director and really brings Nicholas Spark's novel to life. The one good thing I like about this movie is even though she's a preacher's daughter It's not a religious movie, It's about a boy finding faith, faith in himself, and a girl questioning hers when she comes face to face with it. It is just an all around excellent movie. Definitely a movie to remember."

"tercar_03","Null","0","0","3 March 2004"," Emotional Outlook on Two Teenage Lovers - Spoilers
","The movie ""A Walk to Remember"" tells an interesting and emotional narrative. It is based on the 2002 novel by Nicholas Sparks and was released that same year as a film.  Both the author and the director, Adam Shankman, want their audience to understand that there are horrible events which happen in life. People need to believe and retrieve all good thoughts of bad mishaps.  A tagline of ""A Walk to Remember"" is `It all comes down to who's by your side, Look at every event in life as a miracle always wanted.'  This film had opened my eyes to different opinions. The narrative of this movie tells a romantic love affair between two young lovers.   The movie of ""A Walk to Remember"" takes place in North Carolina, where two teenagers named Landon Carter (Shane West) and Jaime Sullivan (Mandy Moore) fall in love after he gets in trouble and is made to do community service.  Landon is the type of guy who makes fun of Jaime; she is the type of girl who would do anything for him.  Landon asks for Jaime's help to perform well in the spring play. Little did he know he was going to fall head over heels for Jaime: he did not see it coming. The practices went on, and the play was being presented to the school.  Jaime had been playing a singer for Landon in the play, and he had looked as if she had weakened his whole body.<br/><br/> At the end of the play, he kissed her in front of the entire school. Landon then decided to ditch his cool but rude and heartless friends for everlasting love with Jaime.  There was a problem when Landon and Jaime started to go out because her father was the Reverend.  He did not care for Landon in the beginning.  Jaime had sadly broken bad news to Landon that she had cancer.  She did not know how much longer she had to live. He was heartbroken, but stuck by Jaime's side the whole way.  Landon had given Jaime her dreams.  They were married by her father.  She had died three months later.  Landon will never forget Jaime, the love of his life and the one who will always inspire him.<br/><br/>The movie ""A Walk to Remember"" is my favorite movie and I believe always will be.  I believe that the story of this movie tells a beautiful narrative of two young teens falling in love.  I love romantic movies, but that is not the only reason I love this movie.  I think Mandy Moore performed a wonderful role of playing Jaime Sullivan.  This story is very unique because a popular boy falls in love with a not-so-popular girl.  This idea makes this film very exciting to me.  Love will be able to happen to any two people who feel something special between them."

The movie is based around two different social standing people who begin to fall in love. Shane West and Mandy Moore play the leading roles as two teenagers who ultimately fall in love. From all the movies I've seen with Shane West in it, this is his most powerful role yet as he fits the character he plays and he just seems right for the part. Mandy Moore has made a breakthrough with this movie as I'm sure a lot of girls can relate to Mandy Moore's character. (Jaime) If other people were chosen for the leads in this movie, I don't think that their performances would have been as powerful as Shane West and Mandy Moore as they seem to have a really good relationship on and off screen and it shows in their performance. This is my favorite movie as it teaches teenagers about real life and the obstacles throughout life. It is also just a really romantic teen drama that can be watched over and over again and always be enjoyed."

There were however, a few flaws I found with this movie. Like others, I haven't read the book so I don't have the accuracy or the comparison to draw off from.

"" A Walk To Remember"" is a beautiful film, helped enormously by amazing performances from Mandy Moore and Shane West. Moore in particular is so tender and sweet in every scene she's in, it was a real change to the image of a Britney-type-teen pop star that I had (wrongly) had in my mind. The beautiful North Carolina locations added to the pleasure of watching the movie, and there were many tear-jerking scenes towards the end, most notably the final wedding scene and the moment when Landon visits the Reverend four years later.

","On the one hand, this could have resulted in yet another tiresome rehashing of that commonly favored old myth, in which a plain but sincere ""good"" girl transforms the handsome but loutish ""bad"" boy through the greater strength of her faith, kindness and patience.  Although ""christianism"" is not precisely the point, Christians will love it, because it addresses all the transformational desires that Christians and co-dependents both find appealing.  On the other hand, the ""bad"" boy is not all that bad.  He has made some poor friendship choices, and tries to live down to their expectations, but he also has some clearly redeemable qualities.<br/><br/>That is what saves this from being just another ""good girl gets bad boy"" story.  Even while he tries to ""pretend"" that he is one of the bad boys, he knows enough to do the right thing.  He has a conscience that keeps coming back to trouble his thoughts, and hence it is not so much a problem of transforming ""him,"" but bringing out what is already there.  The message of the film is not that just ""any"" sort of lout can be improved, given suitable conditions, but that if he is already ""sitting on the fence,"" so to say, then the right sort of girl might be able to give him the push he needs. She does in this film, and it results in a beautiful and poignant romance."

","This movie is absolutely wonderful...Im an 18 year old guy and I have never really seen a love story movie, my fave types of movies are usually sci-fi and action movies, Honestly When I first started seeing this movie I didnt know what it was about, I thought it was some cheap teen flick. I actually didnt want to see it, But by the end of the movie I almost started crying. This movie is about one boys quest and one girls quest to discover one of the strongest emotions in life and that emotion is love. This movie is wonderful in so many ways, the story is sooo original, the inclusion of the religous aspect of the movie makes it soo much better and the characters who are polar opposites at the beginning of the movie know by the end of the movie that LOVE negates all opposites and makes everything so much BETTER. I actually felt all the emotions that the charcters felt as when Mandy is the social outcast and West gets rejected by his friends for falling for this social outcast. I realize how cruel the world is when I see this hatred and how West's former friends make their life miserable, yet throughout all this love still survives....I just dont have word to describe this movie....It is an absolute masterpiece....Mandy sings beautifully in this movie and this movie is filled with emotion that anyone can feel...More importantly its a story about ever perservearnt love in the most unlikely of places. The ending is quite a shocker and makes the story more heart warming and sad at the same time. But the love that those two had is certainly praise-worthy to say the least and this movie overall is a masterpiece. A classic movie dealing with the wonderful discovery of true love in the most unlikely form. In a word, WOW. See It, especially with a loved one. Its a perfect movie of love. SUPRAMAXX RATING - 9.5 out of 10"

","OK, let me first say that I am not the target audience for this movie. I'm 31, male, and try very hard to keep my emotions under wraps. It takes a very special movie to get any kind of real emotion out of me. In other words, I pretty much don't cry at movies. I saw A Walk to Remember on HBO last weekend. I put it on basically as background as I was working, but it totally sucked me in.  By the end I was balling my eyes out.<br/><br/>
I had previously dismissed it as a typical teen chick flick. But it's so much more. It's a story of how one person's life can completely alter another's life. It's a story about finding faith, finding love, and holding onto that love through life's toughest challenges.<br/><br/>Not to say that it's perfect. It certainly has its flaws (many of them, actually). But taken as a whole, it is one of those stories that can truly change you. As Landon says to his mother, ""Jamie makes me want to become different, better"" This movie does the same."

","I was moved to tears when i first saw this film, i have seen this film about 5 times strangely enough, not because i totally wanted to see this film just for myself, but to show friends. I think each time I watch the film i notice little things that could be cut, and I think ultimately this movie leaves you feeling wonderful, but at the same time you get the feeling if they had took a some scissors and glue to the script and re-shaped it just one more time to make it a little bit more compact around the time Jamie(Mandy Moore) got sick the movie's pace would have felt a bit more even.<br/><br/>
I thought the movie was coherent nonetheless, although after hearing alot of other peoples opinions, it seemed like it definitely could have had one more makeover, script-wise. Fortunately, the finished product is something that is worth having in your DVD collection for anyone into a moving story. The gentle pacing of the movie might put some people to sleep Ive noticed, but, as far as movie making goes, you can watch this one a couple of times if you want to appreciate a fairly even rhythm of direction and script goes about. Like the movie's title, the film ""walks"", and sometimes runs (to the heavens). Seeing Mandy wooed by Shane West reminds me of all the great things about relationships and this film is just a great thing to be reminded of the beauty of human life. Thats quite a nice thing for a movie to do this. Also on the DVD you will get to hear Mandy, Shane, and Adam Shankman do the commentary (there is another with Sparks and Janszen that I didnt have time for). The commentary was fun to hear, of course at this point if you're listening to the commentary on this DVD it means you are one of the few big fans (my guess at least). I would love to see another production with Shankman at the helm, and I hope we see more of West and Moore in future films."

This movie has opened my eyes, and now I see things different, I'm even going to start my own list of things I want to get done while I live (he,he). I think the director made a great job, because all the acting is great, specially Mandy and Shane, they had a great chemistry in the film and is one of the things that keeps your ayes on the screen. I have hope now that boys like Landon can change, but they need to be around the right people and of course, they have to want to change or it wouldn't work.

","But it's much more than that. It's also a story about faith.<br/><br/>I usually don't like chick flicks, but this has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Jamie and Landon (two people who could not be more different) fall in love. Okay, we've seem this much before. But there is much more to it.<br/><br/>Jamie is a person of deep faith. Landon has no faith, but gains some watching Jamie face crisis. I'm sure it was no suprise to find out that it's a tear jerker. Jamie faces a death to Leukemia, but never looses her faith.<br/><br/>
There is a reason Shane West is listed first in the credits, even though Mandy's performance is clearly the one that sticks out. A Walk To Remember is LANDON's story and shows how he was effected by Jamie.<br/><br/>The writing was excelent, the performances perfect, and it was completely believable.<br/><br/>Compare this to Endless Love (a movie Brooke Shields did when she was just a little younger than Mandy) and you will see what I mean.

","Hey, maybe ""A Walk to Remember"" isn't perfect, but it sure got my emotional juices flowing.  I didn't go to see it in the theaters, even though I was interested, but I finally watched it when, by a fluke, my sister-in-law left it at our house.  I completely loved it!  I didn't expect much from Mandy Moore, but she excelled at this part and was able to fit the plain, awkward character very well.  Shane West is, of course, adorable, and his turn-around is very believable.  Not only is it a great movie for hopeless romantics like me, but it is a great movie because the girl doesn't make herself worse for the guy, but the guy makes himself better for the girl. There are so many horrible influences in this world, and the fact that this movie focuses on the GOOD influences is just awesome.  I do not normally cry at movies, but I was bawling by the time this one ended.  There are some very sweet moments, and while the ""Only Hope"" scene where she sings seems out of place, I thought it worked well.

Every emotion she is asked to portray as her character, Jamie Sullivan, she does so stunningly.  Watch Moore cry and see if you just don't want to reach through your TV screen and hug her.  She's THAT good.<br/><br/>Shane West is every bit her equal in conveying emotion on-screen.  They make a compelling couple, as West's bad boy character falls in love with the straight-laced reverend's daughter, played by Moore.<br/><br/>Teen girls will surely find this movie a real tear-jerker.

The performance of Mandy is a real surprise on me. The makeup and dress did make a beautiful Mandy to be an ordinary, plain looking girl who has a faith in God and confidence in herself. She was so believable and so real. I loved the movie not only by the two actor and actress but also the whole team. The screen writer did a good job to transform a novel -- verbal communication to be a movie which is a non verbal communication in a such of rewrite instead of substracting. Good job. Mandy's singing was great. I can not imagine if another young pop singer can do the same as Mandy did in this film. I can not say Mandy is perfect in the film neither Shane.

","Just to start I have to say that all the critics who gave this movie are way off the mark. They do make small but unrefined points. Every once in a while you get a critic that, excuse me, must have their thumb up their ass. I have read more than 316 different reports of A Walk to Remember. An overall rating that was given D+, 6.5/10, and 2.5 stars out of 5 stars. I have read articles by out-of-date critics who say stuff like Mandy Moore was only used to bring in an enormous fan-base. First off, you couldn't be more off. Using Brittany Spears for Crossroads was a, pardon me, big f***ing mistake. Brittany Spears has virtually no acting talent in comparison to Mandy Moore. Mandy Moore gave life to Jamie Sullivan. She portrayed the preachers daughter flawlessly. The chemistry between her and Shane West was amazing. They complimented each other in a way I haven't seen since Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. The way you could see they worked off eachother like their first meeting when she goes to see him, working on his car. I won't deny it, the directing coices for the movie could have been better. Adam Shankman moved the movie along to fast. Not resting on any certain spots to let the movie really sink into maybe the younger audiences. I think that whomever decided to make the movie PG was correct for the box office sake. Although the movie only did 40 million at the gates, I believe the movie would not have done as well if the younger 10-12 year olds could not see it. The biggest flaw that I saw with the movie I noticed, as well as several tens-of-thousands of people, was not in the theaters. The major problem came with the DVD. If you watch the DVD with commentary from Mandy Moore, Shane West and Adam Shankman, you will hear Adam Shankman say there will be deleted scenes on the DVD. This proved to be very incorrect. For as much as twenty dollars at some stores for the movie, what you get is...<br/><br/>A Walk to Remember-Movie(Widescreen)-----  I hate widescreen! A Walk to Remember-Commentaries(2) 1.

"CindyH","10","0","0","20 February 2003"," 9/10 stars - A great film to remember
","***USUAL DISCLAIMER - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>This film had more good than bad. First, the bad. The acting suffered somewhat. West did well but Moore could've been better. Her quiet distemper in the film perhaps hid this fact to other viewers which, in reality, is good. Hannah looked horrible, though Im no fan of hers, but my belief is that she was supposed to. If this is true, it was a full blown success. The glossing over of Dr. Carter's relationship with his son was a bad idea. More overall depth to the film could've been added, had it been explored a little further. <br/><br/>That said, now the good. It was a good moral story. The old Hollywood cliche that Christians are inherently evil was not a factor in this film lending it more truth in the real world. A message that the world should hear. The plot was held well. Many look at the film and feel that its main focus was a `delinquent' boy falls for a sweet dying girl. This is, IMHO, a misconception. It was so much more than that. Jamie's faith forced a change in Landon. A very positive life long change. It was more than the loss of his delinquency. It was the power of love, faith, forgiveness, and most important of all, peace. Peace within ourselves. The understanding that life isn't perfect. Bad things happen to good people but resentment keeps wounds fresh and in the end, the wounds will not heal. <br/><br/>Another tiresome Hollywood cliche, thankfully left out, was sex. The abstinence lent the film a freshness that few films can achieve.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a film I will not forget. I give it 9 stars out of 10. The -1 star is for the lack of direction in the acting."

","that Mandy Moore was a good actress?  She puts most singers to shame. For once a singer didn't play the spotlight role where they are the epitomy of coolness, etc.<br/><br/>Mandy plays Jamie, a high school senior and a preist's daughter who is perceived by her classmates as weird, dorky, and uncool.  She keeps to herself and doesn't bother anyone, yet they feel happy to make fun of her at their leisure.  Landon, played very well by Shane West, is the popular guy who everyone loves.  Well he gets in trouble and is forced to tutor kids and act in the school play as punishment.  There he gets to know Jamie and they differ on almost everything, or so they think.  They begin to develop a relationship (predictable, yes but acted very well) and fall in love.  I won't reveal everything that happens, but it is a touching story that brought a tear to my eye, an eye which very rarely gets teary from movies.<br/><br/>The acting is superb.  Mandy and Shane have very good chemistry and Peter Coyote (Mandy's father) plays the overprotective father very well.<br/><br/>The music of the film is also well done.  Using Mandy's primary talent in the context of the play was nice to see, as it wasn't forced in there just for her.  The song she sings in the play, ""Only Hope"", is beautiful.<br/><br/>All in all, I really liked this movie.  I didn't know anything about it; I just happened to notice it was on my TV when I turned it on and just couldn't turn it off.  This is a very good teen movie among many that are the same ol' same ol'.  Definitely worth at least one look.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I'll start off by saying that I'm 25 years old so I'm a little above the target age group for the movie.  Even so, I have found a new favorite movie. I am a sucker for the romance stuff and although there wasn't enough time to fully develope the characters, I thought Mandy Moore and Shane West made up for that in chemistry.  They were in tune with each other throughout the movie which made it easy to get totally engulfed in the emotions of the characters they were portraying.  The storyline was good also, but it was the leading lady and man that brought this film to life.  I had barely paid attention to Mandy Moore because I am not a big fan of the teen singers usually (some of them make me wince).  Needless to say I own the sound track to the movie now and she is one of my new favorites.  She had the class to do a movie like ""A Walk to Remember"" instead of portraying the typical ""cool"" teen in other movies that have no substance and guide our youth in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>I was sitting in front of a group of teenagers (13-14 years old) in the theater and overheard them talking about some pretty vulgar stuff, very disheartening to hear.  I walked out of the movie glowing from the fact that those same girls just took in a message of love, kindness, and faith in a genre that usually reinforces drugs, sex, and other very negative, yet influential aspects of characters.  Teen years are tough and teens often times believe what they see, real or not.  They saw characters they could relate to in Jamie and Landen and the life choices in this movie are the stuff life is really about.  In closing, excellent job done by all of the cast especially Mandy and Shane and I loved the movie!"

","I will start by saying I have read the book, which is a wonderful novel by Nicholas Sparks. With that when I saw the move I was blown away by Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jamie Sullivan. Casting was terrific. She was whom you saw in your head when you read the book and her voice was the one you heard while you read the dialog. Shane West was great as Landon, although they could have made him a little more tougher, but still great no less. Peter Coyote as Jamie's father was great as well. The movie is touching in so many ways. Predictable, yes and no. You knew what was going to happen but all the while hoping that it didn't, but that's the best part with movies! I cried and sobbed liked a little girl. All of the actors in this movie were phenomenal and I look forward to seeing more Mandy Moore movies. She is not only a lovely singer but and equally wonderful actress. His is a great movie and I urge all of the romantics to take a look at it, if you don't like it you get to hear Mandy's angelic voice as her singing is featured more then once in the movie."

","A Walk to Remember is a formula romantic tear jerker drama that works. Director Shankman, takes us on an emotional journey or love and friendship. Both the lead actors(Moore and West) in this teenage drama pull off their roles and make the movie entertaining and heartfelt.<br/><br/>West plays the bad boy who turns his life around as a result of his relationship with Jamie. Mandy Moore in her first starring role does a really good job. You forget she is a pop star. She is one to watch to star in movies to come. Moore and West at first don't like each other because Moore is a loner and West hangs in a clique of the popular kids. Soon he gets in trouble and has to be in the high school play as part of his punishment. West and Moore enventually get close and fall in love.<br/><br/>Moore keeps a secret that when revealed sends an emotional spike into the movie. There love is big and true. The dad doesn't approve but eventually accepts west. The movie is touching and leaves you satisfied. This is a movie worth watching for those romantic at heart."

","This review contains spoilers. I am commenting on the content of the movie: how the movie handles cancer and the commentaries on the DVD.  I am sorry, but my experience with cancer might be able to shed a little light on the contents of the movie. If this spoils your viewing pleasure I apologize in advance.<br/><br/>This is a review of A Walk to Remember. First let me express my sympathy to Mr. Sparks His sister must have been a beautiful woman to inspire such a wonderful book and movie.<br/><br/>I was only familiar with two of the actresses in the movie: Daryl Hannah and Mandy Moore. Their transformations in the movie were amazing. I am used to seeing both actresses blonde, especially Mandy Moore. I always imagined her looking like Brittney Spears, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Ms. Moore?s mannerisms helped bring Jamie to life.: looking down at her feel, stooped shoulders, quiet voice, the lisp when she spoke, all added life to Jamie. I could almost see a bit of her in people from my high school.<br/><br/>The topic of cancer was well handled by the movie.<br/><br/>Many people with cancer want to keep their illness a secret from everyone. They do not want to be defined by the cancer, they want to live as well as they can for as long as they can. They want to be known by their names not their disease. So the characters keeping their illness hidden is very commen.<br/><br/>Also, people who are dying tend to retreat from the world, and the movie got this right. For someone who is dying a chance at romance could be very scary; this represents a very strong connection to this world that many terminally ill people could not face.<br/><br/>The father's reaction to the cancer is common in one respect and uncommon in another. First his desire to protect is common among caregivers, especially if the terminally ill is a relative. But his actions, after the relapse, is unusual.  Many caregivers justify their actions by saying ?they are keeping he/she alive?; the idea that they could be overprotective does not occur to most.  It takes a lot of courage to think  ?maybe I have been overprotective?. The character shows even more courage by saying it.<br/><br/>
I have noticed something else about terminal illness; next to each sorrow there is grace that can affect many people.  In the movie the cancer is a catalyst for many positive changes, and this can also be true in real life.<br/><br/>How do I know all this? In 1999 my father died of cancer after a year of struggle. The year of 2002 saw more: in March one of my aunts died of cancer, in September by Grandfather died of old age and I was down-sized, in October Benjamin died. He went to school one day, had an afternoon nap, and never woke-up. He was six. And in late October, a friend of mine was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.<br/><br/>I have two complains about the movie. First the pace of the movie is too fast. There does not seem to be enough time to develop the characters, hence the changes in the characters seem a little rushed.<br/><br/>Secondly, the commentaries on the DVD surprised me. The one with the screen writer and the author was very interesting and informative. It was also added something to the story and was respect full of the story.  I learned a bit about what the screen writer did to make the story and I learned a bit about how the author wrote the book. Again, let me express my sympathies for your loss Mr. Sparks, I have been through something similar and it hurts.<br/><br/>The commentary by Mandy Moore, Shane West and the director took something away from the story and was not respectful of the story. It was very cynical and it hurt ...  I know that if I was on the outside of the story, if I was an attractive and popular star,  I would make cynical jokes about the girl with the funny skirt or the big car or other stuff.  Maybe the reason the commentary hurt was because cancer and the loss described in the movie is still close to me.  Maybe is was because it was nice to see a romantic lead that worried about being good not just looking good; that an outsider could be accepted, I do not know. It just did not seem to fit with the story.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie because it is well done, but if someone has lost someone to cancer, or has been treated like an outsider, be careful of the commentary by the stars and the director, it can sting."

","Nicholas Sparks, best-selling author, wrote the novel A Walk to Remember a few years ago, but was only adapted into a film this year (2002).<br/><br/>Although the movie is based on the book, there are few similarities between the two.  It seems they've just kept the names, the plot (which involves a severe illness, but I won't spoil it), and the poem, read near the end of the film, about love, and the many ways it works.<br/><br/>A Walk to Remember surrounds the characters Landon Carter (Shane West), a troubled teen who drinks, talks back, and breaks school rules; and then there's Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), a priest's daughter; she's very religious, a bit of a loner, and her ambition is to witness a miracle.<br/><br/>Of course, we all know what's going to happen--some of us will know directly from the first scene, but I'll just summarize the rest of the story as best I can without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>Landon falls for Jamie, after spending time with her to practice lines for a school play, due out in Spring.  He realizes (eventually) that he doesn't care if his friends, the 'cool crowd' if you may, tease him for being with a girl of Jamie's stature.<br/><br/>It is definitely a sweet love story, filled with tear-filled moments that make you want to cry, too.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** One night in a town called, Beauford, North Carolina a couple risk taking teenagers decided to dare another teenager into jumping in some water at a cement factory.  The boy wanted to be like the risk takers, but it got out of hand.  When the boy jumped, he got hurt.  The cops showed up, and the teenagers started to scram, and left the boy there to die. On Monday at Beauford High, the principal punished Landon Carter who got caught.  He was to tutor a young student at a poor school, and participate in the Drama Clubs Spring Play.  Jamie Sullivan was known as an out cast, because she wasn't like everyone else.    Everybody, including Landon, would make fun, of her.  But, when Landon was punished, they were brought together, and he asked her for some help.  They started to work together, and he started to see her as a real person, and even fell in love.  One day at school, his friends cut out her head from a yearbook picture.  They put it on a picture of a girl in a bathing suit.  They past it around school, and when Jamie saw it she got up set.  When Landon saw it, he grabbed her, and left school, and took her home.  He quit talking to his friends.  They went on a date to a restaurant.  Then they walked by the ocean where she told him her dream to be married where her mother and father was married.  Afterwards, he told her that he loved her.  She got upset, and told him he couldn't love her.  He was hurt and didn't understand why until later, when she told him that she had cancer.  He got upset and didn't come around for a couple days.  When the other kids found out, they were so sorry for what they said, and felt sorry for her.  He decided that he wanted to make her dream come true.  He bought rings, and then asked her to marry him, and she accepted.  They were married, and got to spend one summer together before.<br/><br/>The intention was to teach us that cancer is not something anyone can see or get from others.  The director was also trying to show a person who has cancer that they should be brave, to love or hurt someone, and live life to its fullest. When I heard about the movie, I couldn't wait to see it, because Mandy Moor was the lead actress, and I love her music.   I wasn't disappointed at all; she was an excellent actress in this movie.

The acting was less than impressive-- Mandy Moore has a wonderful voice, but she really  only shone in the two scenes in which she used it.  In many of the scenes, she was sarcastic and not as pleasant and forgiving as she was in the book; I felt that it hurt her character when she acted like that (and when the script gave her those lines).

","When I went to the cinema to see this I thought it would be the normal chick flick with the predictable ending but I was wrong. It gave fresh breath to the romance film. The twist in the story really brought it alive. I also thought the two young actors Mandy Moore and Shane West were brilliant in their roles. Especially Mandy Moore as the plain jane daughter of the minister. It is unlike any of the teen movies I have seen over the past years.  I would recommend this film to anyone it was certainly a breath of fresh air."

","Sometimes when you look at the stars they all look the same but once in a while you will see one that has something so much more beautiful than all the rest. Not just physical beauty but that certain way it glimmers in your eye as it passes, for one second, enchants you in a mysterious way and you don't know why but there is no doubting its presence. You may loose sight of this star or never see it again but every time you look up into the sky, somewhere deep down inside you will always come back to that one star. Landon is one of the popular kids, but one night after a dare goes horrible wrong he sees himself in deep trouble, forcing him to help children on weekends and join the drama club. But through his punishment he is able to see something in Jamie that he has never noticed before and it just so happens that she sees something in him as well. The label romance is synonymous for cliche so don't expect anything new here and it has that ""teen movie"" feel to it that kicks the dramatic intensity down a notch and throws in a tad of sexist humour but there is still something very satisfying with the finished product. The film features everything we love to hate: the lead actor who gets by on his looks and not talent, the often amateurish scripting, the sappy tissue box sentimentality and the far to obvious symbolism, in this case the different tastes in radio stations shows the split in personalities and they play that shows the ""hidden feelings that both Jamie and Landon have for each other. Maybe it is Many Moore who actually possesses a great degree of acting talent as the shy choir girl who only needs faith to survive. The huge problem here, along with almost every other teen movie, is that instead of having a major point of development we have many. Landon's reputation, an absent father, a strict preacher and a hurtful secret, but instead of dealing with all of these separately, filmmakers touch on them slightly then cover them up with to much sentimentality (and it's not only teen movies, can anyone say Life as a House?) which gets laid on a little thick at times, often leaving the viewer feeling a little empty at times. But there is an original concept that we are shown in that in that love is a very natural thing. How you ask, well by comparing it to nature. Love is like the sunset or even the wind ""I can't see it but I know that it is there."" We are shown that like the stars or the sunset that we don't know why or how love happens, but we know the world just wouldn't feel right without it."

","When I bought the video, I only vaguely heard about this movie being quite watch-worthy and knew nothing about the cast ( except for Mandy Moore ) and the storyline. Honestly, didn't expect much of this film except that it might be categorized as one of those forgettable teen movies. And BOY, was I wrong... Even though I have to admit that there are lots of holes in the script and editing, everything is forgivable thanx to the exploding chemistry of the two leads ( West and Moore ). Moore was awesome, but, West is the one who stole the show!!! He acts with his eyes ( especially the falling-in-love scene during the play ). He is an excellent actor and I will definitely watch him in the future... Moore and West should get together in a near future for another project, perhaps a happy-ending one this time around.

","When I first went to see this movie, I said to myself ""Ok, this is just going to be another one of those chick flicks."" I was bored one day and so with nothing to do, I decided to watch, for the simple reason for that Mandy Moore was in it. Now let me just say that she took my heart. What a performance.<br/><br/>A walk to remember is a movie everyone should watch, like it or not. It proves how even those who are viewed as and/or sterotyped as a rebel that hope still exists. I must say also that Shane West portrayed the average teenager in schools today very well. At first, he cared deeply about what others thought of him. It's only after getting to know Mandy's character that he begins to know and understand himself. My favorite part was when he questions her faith and she responded "" Without suffering, there would be no compasion."" ""Ya, but that those to the people who suffer, he said back."" All I can say<br/><br/>without spoiling the movie for those who have not yet seen this classic is that by the end, Shane's character does grow to have an understanding of compasion.

","Pop princess Mandy Moore joins the long queue of singers attempting the transition to big screen stardom in the teen tearjerker A Walk To Remember. Despite winning an MTV award for her adequate performance, A Walk To Remember promises to short-circuit Moore's cinematic ambitions in a similar fashion to Mariah Carey and the much-maligned Glitter.<br/><br/> Based on the allegedly best-selling novel by schmaltz-meister Nicholas Sparks (Message in a Bottle) and directed by Adam Shankman (The Wedding Planner), A Walk To Remember is the cinematic equivalent of a midday movie but without the entertainment value offered by the television commercials. It is the type of film that treads such overly familiar narrative ground that most audiences will have accurately predicted every clichÃ©d plot twist and turn after the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, the sickly daughter of a small town Baptist Minister (Peter Coyote in a performance that is one of the films few redeeming features). With her conservative values and unfashionable dress-sense, the bible carrying Jamie is a constant object of ridicule amongst her fellow high school students. One of her detractors is troubled teen Landon Carter (Shane West). Landon is a middle-class rebel without a cause who is mixing with a bad crowd. As to be expected, circumstances bring the two teens together and before long they share a very chaste romance, much to the disapproval of Landon's friends and Jamie's father. Inevitably, tragedy awaits the two ill-fated lovers and director Shankman launches an all out assault on the tear ducts. The final quarter of this formulaic fiasco will have audiences either reaching for their tissues or more wisely, rushing for the exits.<br/><br/>Aimed squarely at a young female audience, A Walk To Remember has enough saccharine sentimentality and two new Mandy Moore tunes to keep them happy. Those outside that demographic might find some entertainment from guffawing at the abominable dialogue delivered by a cast that should know better. Including the once glamorous Daryl Hannah as Landon's mother. Like many of her contemporaries, Hannah has followed the disturbing trend of overdosing on cosmetic surgery in the lip area and is currently looking eerily similar to Daffy Duck. <br/><br/>Overall, another film to add to the worst of 2002 list."
"timberline_thunder","Null","0","0","23 September 2002"," Highschool Movie Gets An A-Minus
","From someone who just attended his 10th High School reunion, this film reminded me that the more things change with high school--and especially movies about high school--the more they stay the same. Yet something about this movie is profoundly different and warrants attention.<br/><br/>
The leads are believable and both remind me of several friends I knew back then. The dynamics of faith, worldview, and upbringing don't hit you over the head. Shining moments show up throughout. Mandy Moore brings across Jamie as believable, not a caricature of some religious nut. In contrast, the father--think Rev. Moore in Footloose (what did I say about the more things change?)--is pretty over-the-top. Still, there is change even in him, and all good movies are about changes to people. Landon's father's attempts to reach his son are well intentioned and his love for him wins out in the end. The rest of the supporting cast is stuck to the ""predictable"" that Jamie and Landon are loath to, right down to the ditzy drama teacher.<br/><br/>
Most importantly, the movie is surprisingly clean. None of the so-common-its-required sex is present or even implied, just kissin'. Cussing was minimal and served the situation. There's a single-punch fight, but it underscores Landon's desire to protect Jamie.<br/><br/>For me, The Fugitive, Braveheart, and Lord of the Rings are staples. Yet when you need a movie to squeeze your honey with, this is a great choice. Guys, you may need to blame your allergies for your eyes watering."
"perni","Null","0","0","21 September 2002"," Ya gotta take the good with the bad with this one...
","Okay, so I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see this movie. From the looks of the previews and commercials it looked like a dumb excuse for Mandy Moore to act and sing. Plus, any flick that makes girls swoon and gush at the mere mention of the title ala Titanic pretty much goes to the bottom of my must-see list. But when a trip to the Blockbuster resulted in one of the parents renting this, I figured I would take a chance and watch it one night. First the good, because that's harder to write about in a review than the bad. Mandy Moore CAN act, as it turns out, much more so than Britney Spears and Mariah Carey. She pulled off the mousey bookworm character nicely, allowing herself to look like an actual outsider, which is more than I can say for Britney when she was cast as a 'geek' but still paraded around in Banana Republic gear. The male lead, Shane West, was also decent, though kind of limited in his range of emotions. And while the central love story was a bit cliched at times, it won me over in the end. Now for the average, since upon consideration there is nothing truly bad about A Walk To Remember. I didn't like the fact that many of the scenes and characters came right out of Not Another Teen Movie. There was ONE black character, and of course he had to stay stuff like 'bomb diggity' and act all wacky, so when he went into Dramatic Mode and actually tried to show some heart I didn't buy it. His whole character up to that point was a dumb comic stereotype, so why should I bother believing his emotional scenes? And what is it with Hollywood and high schools where the cool kids are so freaking evil? See, in the real world there are social classes in high school, and there is some sort of division, but not to the point where there are plots to totally destroy someone's soul over a lover's spat. Oh wait, never mind. And like I said, with the quality romance many of the Saved By The Bell moments (like the fliers of Mandy Moore's face on a bikini-clad supermodel) seemed bizarrely out of place. All in all, though, this is a good date movie and will definitely put any mushy girl or half-way sentimental fella in Slightly Teary, Almost Crying Mode. Let's just say that if you had to pick from Glitter, Crossroads, or this for your Teen Princess Movie Night, you would be much better off going with Walk. 2.5/4 stars"

Alot of the great movies over the past decade, have involved the same 2 main characters in a sequal.  Example:  Rush Hour and Rush Hour With Chan and Tucker, and Tommy Boy, and Black sheep with Farley and Spade.  These 2, Moore and West if they decide to stick together, which I hope they will do, could become the next big Duo.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this is a harm warming movie.

I didn't know who Mandy Moore was except that she was Lana in Princess Diaries, so I wasn't expecting anything one way or the other there. I thought she did fine as Jamie.

","This film touched me in a way that no other film has. This movie has changed me in was that I never thought possible. Your probably going ""yeah right"", but it's true. Jamie inspired me to be a better person to live life to the full and most of all not change to fit others ideal, be yourself and love who you are. This is a beautiful love story between two of the most unlikely people. Landon Carters, a rebel, cool in his own way gets into trouble and if forced to community service where he keeps running into Jamie Sullivan, daughter of the local Baptist Minster. Her and Carter have known each other from their childhood, but he never really got her. Mandy Moore makes an incredible performance, with true emotion, and displays that she is no Britney Spears and this was no Crossroads. But the best performance can from TV's Once and Again star, Shane West who shone in his role of bad boy turned romantic. The end scene with his father is really moving and shows that he has pure talent and is here to stay. This moving will make you laugh and cry and often both at the same time. Jamie's courage and everlasting faith will inspire you and Landon's devotion and capacity to love unconditionally will lift you to a higher level. This is most certainly not just another teen movie despite obvious misconceptions. The stereotypes of the cool kids and the losers and over extenuated to the point of unrealism like in most teen movies. Also the movie does not end with the prom. Not to mention the fact that they did not overdo the singing, she sung when she had to, but not at every chance she got. And my favourite thing is that Jamie does not change she has beliefs and ideals and she does not compromise them for anyone. She does not get a makeover, she doesn't need to do that, she know whom she is and she likes her. She is confident, but not cocky and she keeps a hold if whom she is even though there are a lot of rapid changes that happen. After reading the book I do not believe that one is better than the other. They are very different which can be a good thing, because the book was set in 1950's and some of the things, which happened in the book, would not have been relevant now. But it still holds on to the themes and meaning of the book. This movie should be commended for its high spirit and values and not judged."

","I especially enjoyed this movie due to the touching performance by Mandy Moore in her first major acting role. Her lowkey and natural portrayal of Jamie was so sensitive and interesting compared to other teen stars I have seen in typical recent teen movies. Her 2 songs were  very appropriate and fitted in well to the plot. Her rendition of 'Only Hope' was totally captivating. My guess is that she is extremely talented with lots of serious future potential in films. This movie is a shameless tear jerker, but very well done especially considering the low budget and short period of time during which it was filmed. I liked it even more after a second and third viewing and was totally won over by Mandy and Shane West as Jamie and Landon (and the musical soundtrack). Some critics have complained that it is too preachy, but the movie's messages about love and faith have given me a lot to think about and have stayed on my mind unlike most movies that just provide forgettable mindless entertainment."

","This movie is a prime example of ""Commercialism vs. Artistry""<br/><br/>The story has a ton of potentional, but falls into the typical trap of trying to appease a certain target audience. The sub plots are not developed in the slightest, and The characters seem to have little depth. Really folks, are teenagers these days suffering from ADD this much that we have to have films with the ""no Ridilin required"" label?<br/><br/>Mandy Moore looks the part great, but let's understand that ""looking"" the part does not mean one becomes ""the part"".. For The most part, she delivers an inconsistent performance. Sometimes she is right on,(crying scenes and romantic intimaticy) other times I got the sense she was forcing lines without characterization.<br/><br/>Her Character she plays in the movie seems contrived, even selfish at times. Jamie might try asking Landon ""what would you like to do today?"" Jeez, as if EVERYONE that is terminally ill needs more patronizing, and enjoys being catered to ""hand and foot""  Honestly, yes, it is fine and well that Landon wishes to fufill her ""wish list"" but each and every second? There is a fine line between compassion and patronization.<br/><br/>What is missing here is obvious; ""can we get to know you guys first before we see your pain?"" ""Jamie, tell us about your faith,"" not that you ""have faith.""<br/><br/>Well she can't, because it seems like the film makers did not want to ""offend"" anyone who is not a Christian. This is film making honesty? Jamie is A Christian correct? Isn't The head of Christianity someone named Jesus, then how come his name is never mentioned ONE TIME? Btw, Nice ""Head Ornament of Jesus"" in Jamie's home. I was not aware that ""Southern Christians"" had similar little ""statutes"" of The tortured thorn crown wearing Jesus as Catholics do. This is not a Christian film. Enough comments on how it is.<br/><br/>I have not read the book but I will wager the book goes into Jamie's faith just a tad more than the movie does.<br/><br/>Did we as well need a Mandy Moore Music video here? Her singing skit could not be more contrived unless she was a male midget at a ballpark urinal ""tryting to measure up""  This is out of character for Jamie, plain and simple.<br/><br/>There is perhaps something worthwhile to this movie. At least it is not the typical teenage flick in the sense that not every teenage idiot is a bad person. They are still idiots, but not ""evil idiots"".<br/><br/>Is this a tear jerker? Well, I felt sadness to a degree, but a small degree. Folks you want tear jerkers? Try The Green Mile. At least that film has characters clearly defined to love and hate. How about ET?..<br/><br/>
I just feel this film was targeted at teenagers who cry if their parents won't buy them a new car, and/or new shoes. JEEZ.<br/><br/>If The film makers just really focused only on a good movie, without caring about just who in the hell might see it, they could have had a really good flick here. They should have gone for Anne Hathaway, who shows a good deal of acting ability and actaully looks 18 instead of 14. like Ms. Moore does. Maybe for The Male lead, they could have nabbed Ralph Machio,(The Karate Kid) he still looks like a teenage idiot, and he is like 50 years old.<br/><br/>Actually, all kidding aside, Shane West does an adequate job.. Mandy Moore? Well, she is certainly a nice looking young woman. Perhaps she will take some acting lessons because she does show potentional. At least she was better than those other 2 ""singers"" who tried acting. That isn't saying much.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad film. However, could have been a great film. Peace"

","I love "" A Walk To Remember"" and everything about it, especially Shane. This movie is soooo000oooo sweet! Be prepared with kleenex because tears will be rolling down your face in no time. I have watched it approximately twelve times, and I'm not sick of it. In fact, I don't think I'll ever be! You can watch it with most anyone from your friends to your Mom. Just watch it, but beware...its addictive. I thought Mandy Moore and Shane West did an awesome job. I was kind of expecting less from Moore, since she was switching over from singing to acting, but she pulled it off well. I give it 5 stars! And for all you people dissing this film, I know we are all entitled to our opinions, but make sure you have your facts straight before you do. ~I LOVE YOU SHANE!!!!~"

","I've just read about 3 pages of comments and am wondering what movie these viewers were actually watching.<br/><br/>The acting was poor, although having seen both West and Moore in other movies I'm willing to bet that bad direction and bad writing were to blame. The plot holes were so big you drive a truck through them. The editing was sloppy and spotty.<br/><br/>Jamie's father sounded like the character was based on John Lithgow's character in Footloose.<br/><br/>""Only Hope"" fit the tone of the movie but didn't seem to fit the scene of the play within the movie. It seemed like a lame way of selling a Mandy Moore song (can we say, ""product placement""?). And the curtain came down right after that? Plot hole. Truck. Speaking of automobiles, why was Landon always fixing his car?<br/><br/>Part of the movie was sweet and I did cry at the end for the reasons I was supposed to (not just because the movie was so bad or because I was so happy it was over).<br/><br/>Usually I adore cheesy movies. Usually these teen movies are a big guilty pleasure for me and even ""bad"" movies are often entertaining (I found Crossroads enjoyable despite bad acting and writing). A Walk to Remember just left a bad taste in my mouth. I ended up seeing it twice because the video was popped in the evening after I'd seen it.<br/><br/>I'd like to read the book to see if it's much better."

"bluebabe1038","10","0","0","14 August 2002"," Mandy Moore proves herself to be one incredible performer in this movie. (SPOILER)
","SPOILER<br/><br/>Mandy Moore captivates the audience as Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of a small North Carolina town preacher, who doesn't seem to fit in at the local high school.  Jamie is a girl who doesn't care what others think and lives life to the fullest by being a good Christian girl with many ambitions. Her life changes when the popular guy, Landon Carter, due to being punished by the principal, ends up in her drama club and tutoring at the same junior high that she does.  Through many encounters on his way to being a better actor in the high school play, they fall in love, though Jamie requested he not do it.  The role of Jamie fits Mandy Moore so well and she brings to it a light of innocence and passion.  Shane West in the role of Landon Carter, is not too bad himself.  He follows Mandy through the movie, taking what she throws at him.  Her smile--unmistakably Mandy, so beautiful, so radiant, so full of pure emotion.  This movie is everything a movie should be--awesome!!"

","Student life is familiar to all of us (if you're younger than five, you're not reading this!), so why do writers create so many unreal situations that make the film just plain silly?  Why were the yearbooks distributed so early?  Why did the director of the spring play select the players for each role, and why did she choose an ""unknown"" for the male lead? Do students really write the plays -- with such adult themes?  Why did Mandy Moore's character leave the lunch room to go home?  Do students do that?  How was Shane's character able to drive here and there whenever?  Did anyone attend classes. or did they sit outside all day -- except when they were in that weird-looking lunch room?  I cringe whenever proms are featured in films: no one has a date until the week of the prom, the decorations are being decided that week, and the music/band has yet to be selected.  Isn't someone tapping the writer/director/whoever on the shoulder and saying, ""May I offer a suggestion?""  Oh, yes, thumbs down on this goofy film.

","I recently rented this movie and was expecting the typical romantic cliche storyline and definitely got that.  However, I found the movie to be overall heartfelt and the cliched morals to be so true and not forced.  I agree that the movie was far different from the book (which I read before seeing the movie) and I did feel disappointed that a lot of what happened in the book, like the dance, didn't happen in the movie.  Yet I was pleased that there are still a number of things that the movie did incorporate from the book. I did find myself surprised at the acting.  Although, both Mandy Moore and Shane West's acting is not superior, I thought that overall they did a really good job.  They were believable and emotional in their roles.  This movie to me was good because it draws you into the storyline and leaves you as emotional as the characters and lets you feel exactly what the characters at feeling at the given moments.  When I first saw the whole movie throughout, I started crying when Jamie is ridiculed by Landon's friends and the anger and sadness she was feeling got to me.  And from that point on I was bawling throughout the rest of the movie all the way to the end.  When Jamie tells Landon she has Leukemia to...Landon's reaction to it to....Landon with Jamie in the hospital to....Jamie's dad breaking down to....Landon finds out his dad is paying for home care and goes to thank him to....Landon saying that although he cannot see their love, he can feel it. A true tearjerker with a heartfelt storyline that is a cliche but definitely well-acted by newcomers Mandy Moore (whom I definitely had doubts of but was proved wrong) and Shane West (whom I have adored since his first season on Once & Again and surprised at his strong acting skills). Another good thing is the songs could not have fit the scenes they were in any better.  I have fallen in love with the soundtrack from watching this movie.<br/><br/>The DVD features are not all that great but I did learn that the character Jamie is based on Nicholas Spark's real-life sister...and Mandy Moore, Shane West and Adam Shenkman's catches on bloopers.  I just wanted to add one that they failed to mention or maybe even didn't catch.  But when Landon goes to visit Clay at the rehab center he's in a beige shirt but walks in with a blue & white striped shirt.  But anyways the movie is pretty good and I give it an 8 out of 10 stars.

It wasn't your typical 'teen' movie, it contained a substantial story, and better character development, and the actors, even Mandy Moore, were decent. However... Taken in terms of a book adaptation it was absolutely awful. When I watched the film I noticed it ""adapted"" very little from the book, which I was almost willing to forgive... However when I saw the ending I was completely and utterly appalled. The book ends in the exact opposite way that the film ends. I could not believe that they would change 100% of the ending. The last two lines are the best two lines in the entire book, and they not only discluded those from the film, but they changed the meaning in its entirety. Though this film was not terribly made, and in terms of a ""teen"" film, it was even good, if you've read the book, be prepared for a major let-down."

","I should never have put on my eye make-up before watching this movie.  I kept tearing up and wiping my eyes.<br/><br/>A Walk to Remember is a love story.  Jamie Sullivan, played by Mandy Moore is the Christian girl and Shane West plays Landon Carter, the rabble rousing, anti-authority ""cool""teenager she loves. <br/><br/>Landon is embittered by his parents' divorce.  His father is a successful doctor who has left Landon's mother for reason's unspecified.  Landon is drifting, getting into trouble, one of the leaders of the ""in"" crowd when he runs afoul of the law.  Part of his probation is tutoring after school, doing janitorial work, and acting in the school play.  He meets Jamie, who also tutors and is in the play during this probation.  Jamie is a committed Christian--innocent but sweet and strong in her beliefs.  The sparks between Jamie and Landon start to fly the opening night of the play.  Jamie is too shy to say how she feels, but when she sings, her heart shines through and speaks to Landon.  He can't help but respond.<br/><br/>Landon's transformation from surly, cynical ""cool"" guy to loving, goal-driven, caring person is a joy to watch. At first, he finds it difficult to be without his former comrades, but after a while, they become boring to him.  Jamie believes in him.  He starts to want something more. The relationship never rings false.<br/><br/>The only quibble I could have with this fine film is the way that Jamie dresses.  It is entirely possible for a woman of faith to dress fashionably. They have Jamie wearing an old grey sweater most of the movie as if to say that if she wore pretty clothes, she couldn't be a Christian-NOT!!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film.  I've seen it three times."

"stacey-33","Null","0","0","23 July 2002"," Just had to say something...
","I read the book by Nicholas Sparks right before the movie came out on video. When it did, I had to go to the video store three times before I got to rent it, cuz it was always sold out. But, I finally got it and at first I was so stunned at how diffrent the movie and the book was that I did'nt give it much of a chance. But it had an effect on me.<br/><br/>So I watched it again. And there was a lot I missed. So I watched it again, and still more I had missed. I found the movie to be beautiful and touching and while I still prefer the book (of course) the movie has sooo many attributes.<br/><br/>Yes, I think it is possible for people to fall in love the way the two do in the story. I don't think it was any more filled with cliche's than the cliche's that most teenagers are living with everyday. When your young, some worry more about the way they are appear than who they actually are. And it often takes a lot of time and a few more years of life experiance to realize what being a mature, rational, loving human being, really means. I thought the way the teenage boy morphs into a young man was well written and wonderfully acted. I could gush all day about the job Mandy Moore and Shane West did in this movie.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie was that the screenplay so obviously skimmed over the religous aspect of the book. Those who've complained that the movie was too preachy, would be shocked at how the book was actually written in comparison.<br/><br/>I understand that in todays society of political correctness, the screenwriter, most likely, thought it would alienate too much of the audiance to leave in all the spiritual and religious aspects, but that was the biggest part of the book, and at first I felt cheated by the re-write. I think the movie would have been better, in fact, if it had stood by the original story. But, the powers that be have more control over these things than I, so be it.<br/><br/>But, had I never read the book, I would have no complaints. It is a very beautiful movie. I wish I had seen it when I was 17 instead of 27."
"denise_culver","9","0","0","23 July 2002"," Excellent movie that presents The Gospel without being preachy
","Unlike films such as Left Behind, A Walk To Remember presents moviegoers with the reality of what Jesus can do for a life without confusion and end-time prophesy. The movie wasn't billed as having Christian undertones, so it was a pleasant surprise to find the message so prevalent throughout the film. Parents need to be aware of the fact that there is a considerable amount of cursing throughout the film, as well as some suggestive behavior by the teens. However, for kids older than 13, the movie will be a realistic representation of what they see and hear in the mall on a regular basis. Furthermore, it teaches kids (and adults) the importance of maintaining a strong testimony for the Lord, despite peer pressure and condemnation from the world. Overall, it is an excellent film."

","Well, I just saw AWTR again, and I have to say that I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>You will either buy into the love story or not. Mandy Moore is good, but Shane West really gives the better performance. In all fairness, the movie does have some flaws. There were a lot of editing mistakes that should have been corrected. Jamie and Landon fall in love too quickly. I would have liked more scenes between them before Landon declared his love for Jamie. And finally,the movie really deviates from the book. They should have used more scenes from the book, which is superior to the movie. THE DVD IS REALLY AWFUL!!!  There are no deleted scenes.

","A Walk to Remember is a kind of movie that you could bring your parents to, but don't want to.  While watching the movie, you'll be wondering why your boyfriend can't be like that.  'A Walk' is a movie about a rebellious teenager who gets in trouble with the law and is charged with, what seems severe to him, is minor punishments.  Landon, Played by hottie Shane West, is the eighteen year old on the wrong path of life who in the end, finds out what true love really is.  Pop sweetheart Mandy Moore takes a break from her singing days and tries acting.  In conclusion, she was great(better than both Mariah Carey and Britney Spears).  Ms. Moore plays Jamie, the sweet and ugly-beautiful daughter of the town's southern baptist church. She helps Landon with his lines for the school's spring play which is one of his punishments.  When the play is over, the most unexpected thing happens, Landon falls in love with Jamie.  When his friends find out, they play a lame joke on Jamie but end up losing Landon as their friend.  This is only part of the movie and the rest is the parts of the story that give the movie away. To sum it up, A Walk to Remember is a sincere film about two teenagers who find love that some people don't find in a lifetime.  I recommend that you see this movie and love it as much as I do. It is a true 10 out of a 10."

","Surely this film has the best of intentions -- the Drab Girl proves to be wonderful, the Bad Boy with the heart of gold reforms, the Cool Kids regret their cruelty when they begin to reform, faithfulness is promoted as a virtue (how common is that these days?), and astronomy is billed as a great way to pick up girls!  There is some objectionable dialogue (family-oriented readers be fore-warned!), but only one overly coarse scene.  The reasons I didn't particularly enjoy this movie were simply the amazing triteness of the plot, the low-caliber acting skills of the main cast, and the ineffective dialogue.  I'm glad that it is so popular -- there are many, much more harmful films out there -- but I can't help wishing it were generally of better quality.

First of all, they did a very good job of de-glamorizing Moore, and second of all, Jamie was supposed to be plain, not ugly. The way I saw it, Jamie was not the ""loser"" who gets stuffed in trash cans and has food thrown at her at lunch, she was just the plain-Jane, invisible loner.They needed to pick a pretty girl to play her because in some scenes, Jamie is supposed to be pretty.<br/><br/>Don't let harsh critics or the somewhat corny title stop you from seeing this movie!

","""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks was an amazing novel that warms the heart and soul. The movie ""A Walk to Remember"" with Mandy Moore and Shane West was the movie it was made into. I wish I could say the same about how great it was and how it left me with the same feelings the book did but I cannot. This movie left me extremely disappointed and feeling sorry for Nicholas Sparks for ruining his precious novel. I know that when directors make a movie out of a novel the words ""based on the novel"" always are shown but I still cannot see how they could have even said those words. This movie doesn't even take place in the same time period. I knew from the beginning scene something was terribly wrong with this movie. I was so disappointed at who they chose to play the part of Jamie Sullivan. Mandy Moore does not have any acting talent and should stick to being a pop singer. I'm so sorry, Mr. Sparks that they ruined your wonderful novel."

","A Walk to Remember is the best movie I've ever watched. For those of you who have seen it and don't like it, you'd rather watch The Fast and the Furious. Because you don't like these kinds of movies. A Walk to Remember made me cry from the moment the SAD part happened. I also have the Soundtrack and you know that song from Switchfoot ""You"" well whenever I hear that song, I always seem to cry. When I saw that movie that same night I talked to my friends and I told them about the movie, and I was crying. You know how the same actors and actresses star in another movie together? Well I hope that Shane West and Mandy Moore will do another movie together. They just did an outstanding job in A Walk to Remember. A Walk to Remember thought me a lot of things that I never knew before. And I think this movie should win another award for it, because it really deserves more then 1 or 2 awards. I know that Mandy Moore won an MTV award for it. GREAT! Even though the movie did have swears for about the first half or so, at least the swears weren't THAT bad. I know I've seen movie like Save the Last Dance and they swear A LOT. I learned that the movie did have a SAD ending to it...but it also had a happy one too once you think about it closely. And I'm not talking about the SAD part. I don't wanna spoil it for others because some of you may not have watched it (although someone did spoil it) But here is some advice ""Go and see it if you haven't because it's worth it"" When I first saw the preview of A Walk to Remember on Television, I was thinking of something different. Because when I saw it in February, it was MUCH different then I thought it would be. But it's good to imagine. Whenever I look at sites and they keep saying ""This is a dumb movie"" or whatever, they're totally WRONG!!! Some people just don't seem to understand. I rate this movie a BIG 10/10"

","Mandy Moore is a beautiful young girl and seems to be a natural actress. Here she plays the daughter of a strict preacher (Peter Coyote), and she herself is a spiritual person who does her own thing in high school, pursuing her list of things to do, while not worrying what the shallow students think of her. Takes her hand-built reflector telescope into the cemetary at night to view the heavens. Tutors other students. Sings in the church choir. <br/><br/>SPOILERS -- She and her dad have a secret. She is dying of lukemia, and her ""list"" is really the things she wants to do before she dies, which isn't very far away. Number one on her list is to get married in the same small church in Virginia where her parents were married. Circumstances get her and the popular but dangerous guy into common settings, tutoring, the school play, and ultimately she ""makes him want to be a better person"", shades of ""As Good As It Gets"". He has to spurn the old friends to move on.<br/><br/>
As she gets more sick, and it is obvious her time is very short, he proposes and they do get married in the small church, she dies, he goes on to college, he gets accepted to medical school, the things he put on his list after meeting her.<br/><br/>There are absolutely no new ideas in this film. Its charm comes in the way the characters develop, and the truly wonderful acting by Mandy Moore. It is a good story, of what true love and devotion is, rather than two kids just trying to get in bed as soon as they can. The film doesn't preach, but it does touch the subjects of belief in God and the value of real relationships. In my book that kind of film deserves a high rating. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not a perfect movie, some scenes didn't ring true, but overall I really enjoyed it."

Hopefully they will read this.  First of all, I think many people knew about why Landon was doing the things for Jamie (because they were on her list).  Secondly, I am a mother of 3 and was so happy to watch a movie that didn't have cussing and sex in it, but looked at the issues realistically. Not ALL high school students cuss and have sex.  It is an encouragement to all to see Mandy's character showing how people can be good.  Sure kids are tempted and have desires, but not ALL give in.  I think we need more movies like this one to set an example of how kids should behave and treat others.  This movie dealt with many deeper issues than the love story, but I loved that part too.  I cry every time I see it, and it truly is an encouragement to my children and me.  By the way, I am a Christian and was not offended by any of the scenes.  They were realistic and they showed how to deal with behaviors that some view as inappropriate. It is an encouragement for all to be better people and make a difference in their lives."

If anything, buy the soundtrack.  I seem to remember all the criticism against a little movie called A REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  Now what, three decades later, that movie is considered a classic with standout performances by James Dean and Natalie Woods.  No way am I comparing A WALK TO REMEMBER to REBEL but there were some similarities that I enjoyed.  Shane West had a break out performance and Mandy Moore complemented him very well.  Personally, I think West carried Moore on the acting part of the movie but Moore carried West in the ""Do we care?"" part of the movie.  I wasn't a big fan of Mandy Moore before but now, I have nothing but support for her.  I can't wait for her next movie and might even consider renting Princess Diaries.

","""A Walk to Remember"" is based on a novel written by Nicholas Sparks.  I have read the novel and have seen the movie, and while each is different in its own way, both are fantastic. <br/><br/>This movie is very emotional - exploring the relationship between two teens in North Carolina.  A relationship not based on sex or lust, but on love and salvation.  Moore and West embodied the characters of Jamie and Landon perfectly.  Their performances draw the viewer into their lives - seeing the looks in their eyes, the emotion in their voices, the heart wrenching feelings that are evident as the story progresses.  The viewer sees Jamie opening up her world to let Landon in = and sees Landon change as the love Jamie has for him grows deeper and stronger with each passing day.  <br/><br/>The performances of the entire cast are wonderful - Peter Coyote as the Reverend / Jamie's father is the epitome of what a Southern Baptist minister looks and acts like; Daryl Hannah as Landon's mom is enjoyable - although I am not sure what to make of her dark hair!!!<br/><br/>This movie pulls at the heart strings and leaves an impression on the viewer that will remain for a long time to come -- an impression of what true love really is all about, how wonderful it is to find it, and how much it is to be cherished - whatever comes.<br/><br/>For all the hopeless romantics, this is one to add to your collection...."

I was expecting another mushy romance story with characters that always make the wrong choices. But this is an intelligent romance with a moral.<br/><br/>
The story was a little original with believable acting from most of the actors. While I didn't really cry or anything, I did get a little moved at certain parts of the film. When we find out the bad news, I really wasn't expecting it. It came sort of like a shock to me. But, all in all, everything turns out good. The ending wasn't really a happy one, but atleast it wasn't a sad, depressing one. A WALK TO REMEMBER gets 5/5."

","I've read some negative comments about this flick coming from European (especially British) male reviewers. Pretty much, what they have to say is that the movie sucks because it is either totally unbelievable or a `remake' of `Here on Earth.' <br/><br/>   Now, I'm a male, I'm European, and I grew up in Europe. I think I have an idea or two on why European males consider this movie totally unrealistic. Let's get to the core of the issue here. <br/><br/>   The plain truth is that Christianity is a mystery in Europe, especially for the new generations. Girls like Jamie Sullivan in Europe are like white flies (even among the evangelical Christians that I know over there!); therefore, when your typical European guy sees this movie, he'll be thinking, `This thing does not make sense' <br/><br/>   See, the truth is that Europeans can relate more to the girl of `Here on Earth,' who does not have any problem betraying her boyfriend with the main character of the flick, or with the girl of `Autumn in New York,' who does not have any problem flirting with the male lead after five seconds she's known him (and going to bed with him after fifteen minutes), even though the guy could be her father and actually had something going on with the girl's mother a few years before. <br/><br/>   See, those kinds of creepy things are perfectly acceptable in a movie for your average European guy. But, when you see the pure and innocent love story of `A WALK,' they say: `Already done.' Already done? Really? A love story where two teenagers do not go to bed and yet show the greatest intimacy you can see in a movie, where the guy blesses his girlfriend with total love without expecting anything back, just for the sake of making her whole. You've seen this in many movies? Really? Ok, I'll tell you what. Name one other recent movie where you see the kind of unconditional love, purity, innocence, redemption, forgiveness, and spiritual growth (the average European guy will want to look up the words `spiritual' and `growth' in the dictionary, since he's probably not accustomed with them) that you see in `A WALK' Since, this story has been done so many times, you won't have any problems naming at least one other movie, right? Oh, and please, do not come up with a movie like `Life as a House.' I saw that one, and it falls under the same category as `Autumn in New York' and `Here on Earth;' movies that want to win my heart by showing one aspect of love while showing lack of respect for all or most of its other characteristics. <br/><br/>   One final word of advice for your average European guy out there: look up the word `love' in your dictionary. Too many years of European cultural influence might have led you to confuse it with the words `Lust,' `Selfishness,' and `Sex.'<br/><br/>fscinico@yahoo.com"

","It's clear from the commentaries on the dvd that everyone working<br/><br/>on this film really tried hard and meant well; but, oh dear, the result<br/><br/>is sentimental and lightweight, so completely cut off from the<br/><br/>realities inherent in its story that it's just hopeless.<br/><br/>It's a measure of just how far it is from narrative credibility that this<br/><br/>movie makes 'Here on Earth' (Chris Klein, Josh Hartnett, Leelee<br/><br/>Sobieski), which has a nearly identical storyline, look like it's a<br/><br/>well-acted and well-written drama. If you haven't seen 'Here on<br/><br/>Earth', you'll have to take my word for it that I'm being rude about 'A<br/><br/>Walk to Remember'. <br/><br/>I've no idea whether Mandy Moore fulfils her potential here, but<br/><br/>Shane West has done much better in 'Once and Again', even in<br/><br/>'Whatever It Takes'. He promised a while ago that he wasn't going<br/><br/>to do any more teen movies, and on this evidence, the sooner he<br/><br/>takes on a role that really stretches him instead of just relying on<br/><br/>looking cute or mournful, the better. He has shown signs that he's<br/><br/>going to develop into a really good actor - but you have to look hard<br/><br/>to see it here.<br/><br/>This film does have one merit: it can be an object lesson in film<br/><br/>schools, to show why sweetening a story too much and lightening<br/><br/>the story's elements to avoid upsetting anyone at all, in the<br/><br/>process losing all contact with the value and emotional core of the<br/><br/>original story, leave you with a film that's worth a lot less than the<br/><br/>effort that's gone into making it."

","I have to start off by saying that i am not a fan of the Pop princess scene, but what a pleasant surprise A walk to remember turned out to be!  I watched this movie by default and all i can say...again...is wow!  Manday Moore, the last in the line of Pop teens to hit the scene is absolutely wonderful in the role of Jaime Sullivan.  She deserves to be given credit for a job well done.  As a previous user mentioned, they always seem to cast the beautiful in the role of the dowdy-but-soon-to-be-hot role.  No one can say that Mandy moore is beautiful, but never in the movie is she so polished and greased up.  She looks natural and it's all so believable!  Her acting was really good, and she handled the emotional scenes well - could've been better, but it was ok.<br/><br/>Aaah, then we come to Landon, played by Once and Again's Eli Samler. Excellent.  I loved him in this role, the emotional scenes was really moving and i found myself teared up ALL THROUGH this movie!<br/><br/>I would recommed this to anyone.  I've gone to see it twice already, and i'm planning on buying a copy as well.  <br/><br/>By the way, th soundtrack is great too.

","To be honest, by now, i have seen this movie for the 4th time. you may think this is way over or im just plain stupid. i didn't watch this because of Mandy Moore nor Shane West. this is a movie with a religious ingredient but not exaggerating and conservative. it proves its romance without a sex scene (which is in most romance movie these days).<br/><br/>People who think this movie is no way near good, unfortunately they failed to see its meaningful, life mirroring message. let's not deny the fact that its highly predictable and typical. but if you try to watch it a different approach, get into the characters (this is when i began to cry, i actually dwell on Jamie's character-not sure how did that happen), then you would know what i mean. the scence when Jamie confessed she was ""sick"", there were tears in my eyes. my tears hang in there, and then when she came to see Landen and began to apologise, i wiped my eyes. i thought that was the highlight of it. then when Jamie said ""i'm afraid not to be with you"" i just cried. i maybe a cry baby, but this movie has brought tears to many. in fact most people stayed crying (girls) till the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to the ratings it received from Australian critics. i mean yes, maybe not the best movie of the year, but i strongly suggest for them to watch the movie again. the soundtrack was awesome! i just couldn't let go of it, everyday i listen to it. and everytime i hear mandy moore's songs, scenes from the movie pops in my head. i have brought soundtracks from several movies i have also seen more than once but none of them reminds me of the exact scence in the movie when it was played. i must admit the songs blends perfectly to the moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Mandy moore deserves that MTV Movie award for such surprising and amazing role and acting! i almost forgot its mandy moore i was watching.i can't wait to have my own copy!"

","There's no doubt that Mandy Moore (blondie turned brunette) really put heart and soul on her performance in this movie.

Now I know why she won her MTV Movie Award as Best Breakthrough Performance.  She has started her acting career with the right foot.<br/><br/>Shane West seemed to have helped her a lot.  There was plenty of compatibility between them.  His performance was also good (probably because of his previous appearance on the melodramatic TV show ""Once and Again"").<br/><br/>And finally, the story itself was very good.  Sad and touching, though.<br/><br/>The songs performed by Mandy Moore herself, help people to catch the mood of the movie.  One thing I can assure you:  every time you hear a song from her, this movie will pop into your mind from now on.<br/><br/>One last advice, if you have a weepy heart:  have at hand of box of tissues, or a napkin (the same thing if your significant other is right next to you)."

"Joey_Mac","10","0","0","15 June 2002"," Unbelievably Emotional Roller Coaster Ride!
","First off, let me start this by saying that the critics reviews of this film absolutely appalled me.  Their reasons for these ratings appalled me even further!  Critic called this film ""so saccharine covered it will make you want to lose your lunch"" and so ""sweet and innocent it will make your blood boil.""  I guess a film with a lack of sex, drugs, and violence (although there is violence to a small extent) might really throw people for a loop. ..Apparently, emotionally-charged, wholesome films aren't enough for the medias insatiable appetite for obligatory breast-shots and sensless blood-shed.  I mean, don't get me wrong, films such as ""Boogie Nights"", ""54"", and ""Scream"", all of which contain violence and/or nudity/sexual content, have all made their way onto my top 20 favorite movies of all time. I enjoy them just as much as the next person, but this film was a huge change of pace from what I'm used to seeing on the big screen these days.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with high expectations for it to be a sappy teen romance, one that might even make me tear up a bit (I'm a sap for romance, i.e. ""Bounce"", and ""Pearl Harbor"").  What I got was so much more.  SO much more.  The film opens with a sequence that may mislead you a bit.  I sat in my chair for the first 10 minutes thinking, ""Oh great, could this be any more of a stereotypical teen flick?""  Although I love movies like ""Whatever It Takes"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""Boys and Girls"", somewhat less-than-innovative teen flicks, I wanted more out of this one.  It quickly begins to better itself with the introduction of Mandy Moore's character, Jamie Sullivan.  In a very ""Carrie""-esque fashion, she's the pretty ""ugly"" girl (another thing critics couldn't over look) whom everyone makes fun of and you feel sorry for.  There is something special about her right from the very start.  There are so many layers to her character and you want to get to know them all.  By the end of the film, you do.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film, some of the most romantic movie moments in history (in my personal opinion) take place.  See, Jamie has a to-do list, and as her and Landon (the incredibly cute Shane West) begin to fall for eachother, he tries to complete her list one thing at a time.  One thing she mentions is how she's love to be in two places at once.  So, he takes her to the middle of the road one night and tells her to stand in a specific spot.  When she asks what's going on, he tells her she's straddling the state line--she's in two places at once. . .Now, call me a hopeless romantic, but I think that is the sweetest thing in the entire world (and my favorite part of the whole movie).  He also proposes to her so they can get married in the same church her mom did (another wish on her list).  By the end of the film, your heart is tied in knots and you don't know whether to be happy or cry.  Jamie eventually unveils a life-altering secret to Landon that changes the pace of the entire film.  If you get emotional easily like me (I cried in the first 20 minutes of ""Scooby Doo"" when the gang breaks up.. .), you will be as heartbroken as Landon.  The film ends with a very vague feeling, and when I walke out of the theatre, I knew I couldn't wait to see it again. . .and again. . .and again. . .<br/><br/>Mandy Moore's acting is exceptional, if not better.  I think she's an incredibly talented singer and now, I respect her totally as an actress (""Princess Diaries"" just made me want to slap her).  Shane West as always was great.  We really get to see his range in this film.  And the supporting cast does a fine job.  I don't think this movie could have been any better! Since the movie, I bought the soundtrack, read the book, and already have my copy on DVD preordered at Amazon (July 9!!!)  Please, ignore critics thoughtless reviews and check this amazing little film out for yourself. ..I highly reccommend it!"

","Yeah, yeah...the storyline's been done before.  Even some of the dialogue sound familiar.  And yes, the score at the end dripped with too much melodrama to be effective.<br/><br/>But you know what, despite all that, the movie still works.  It had me, and a good number of the audience, teary eyed at the appropriate moments.  It had me smiling like a dork in the joyous moments of the film.<br/><br/>For me, what made this movie so effective was the performance and chemistry of the leads, Shane West and Mandy Moore.  They made celluloid romance look real and sincere.  Their emotions and feelings were palpable. The film and the actors gave one of the best depictions of real love.  There is maturity and innocence in their actions.  And that's what makes this movie different from other run-of-the-mill romance movies.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore really surprised me at how effective she was in conveying Jamie's innocence and  strength of character.  Her sweet face and graceful manner make her almost otherworldy, but she still manages to reach out to the viewers and tug at their emotions as if she was someone they knew all their life.  I believe we'll be seeing more of Mandy in Hollywood which I think is a good thing.<br/><br/>Shane West is another revelation.  He had the difficult task of showing Landon's growth from aimless youth to self-assured adult capable of self-less love. And he pulled it off.  His subtle performance made Landon's transformation believable and does not suffer a single awkward moment. Like Mandy, I hope we see more of Mr.West in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Others have complained that the story is too squeaky clean and it's totally impossible that two teeners could be so controlled when it came to sex. Well, guess what...there are responsible teen-agers out there.  They just don't get enough attention since most of Hollywood think that only sex will sell to a young audience.  The box-office performance of ""A Walk To Remember"" certainly disproves that.  Young people, adults and grannies alike enjoyed this movie. It's about time that Hollywood showed another kind of teenager. The kind that you can admire.<br/><br/>As for the comments that this one was just another ""Prety-ugly-girl"" movie where the heroine is just waiting for a make-over...well, I don't know what movie you were watching but ""Walk"" was definitely not it.  Jamie was never ugly to begin with.  She just didn't dress right and did things that were ""unusual"" for other kids.  All that branded her as an outcast.  And where is it written that being pretty ensured popularity in High School?  That's  a fallacy.  Lots of pretty girls in high school but they weren't popular since they didn't have the right friends, the right clothes, the flashy attitude or other things that made one popular.  The Jamie character was that kind of pretty girl.  She had the pretty face but had a strong sense of self to not be concerned with superficial things.  Again, that's what made her different.    And she never had a make-over in the movie!  She stayed true to herself til the end.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Shane, Mandy and the filmmakers of A Walk To Remember! It was a risky move to go against the mainstream of sex and violence in films.  But judging from the user comments in this site, you guys did the right thing.  This is simply one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>P.S.  The soundtrack is excellent as well. Listening to it brings back images from the movie and one can't help but be emotional when hearing the tracks."

","The book A Walk to Remember was, no doubt, one of my favorite books. It's a moving tale of hope, faith, and love. When I found out that they were turning it into a movie i was down right agitated. In my mind: ""Hollywood will butcher this..."" After watching the movie (For the third time now, if i may add =] ), my faith in films (those based from books) have been officially restored.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: A jaded, rebellious young man (Landon Carter) unexpectedly falls with a sweet, religious girl (Jamie Sullivan).<br/><br/>But the experiences each character undergoes makes the movie simply beautiful. The simple things they do for each other will truly leave you smiling and probably even complaining why you yet to find that kindof love. Hehe...<br/><br/>Shane West's performance as the soul-searching Landon Carter was fantastic. I don't know how he does it but the simple tug of his mouth, forming a smile, or the slight squinting of his eyes makes you ""feel"" what he feels. The scene where he clung to his father in desperation left me bawling my tears out. Mandy Moore played her role beautifully. After Mariah's Glitter and Britney's Crossroads, it was refreshing to finally see a singer who can actually act!<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is worth every penny you pay for it.

","I saw A Walk to Remember last night at the Melbourne premiere and was impressed. The movie was extremely emotional and managed to avoid for the most part resorting to old cliches which would have detracted from the overall feeling. Rarely does a film successfully make the audience care about the characters to the extent that this film does and that would be in large part due to the actors, specifically Shane West and Mandy Moore who were perfect in their roles and were deserving of the recognition they recieved at the 2002 YOUTH HOLLYWOOD awards. Shane West is consistantly a great actor and Mandy Moore does not deserve any 'pop star turned actor' criticism as she is obviously talented in both areas. As for Mandy Moore being too attractive to play a wall flower, its not how one appears that decides how they are percieved, its how one acts and as Jamie, Mandy Moore exudes the perfect balance of emotions to pull the role off. Overall an amazing film."

","I really loved this movie.  I had read the book before watching it, so I had some sense of what was going to happen, but I was not expecting the acting to be as good as it was.  I was also worried that the book wouldn't be followed accurately enough.  But all my worries were pushed aside as I began watching.  Mandy Moore does an amazing job portraying Jamie, the preacher's kid, and Shane West was great as Landon, the rebel as well.  This movie deals with realistic teen problems without having to cram in a ton of sex and vulgarity.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to see it, and don't forget to take some kleenex, you'll need it."

","Hats off to Mandy Moore who looked great and put on a great performance...I dont know why she chose this movie when she is given such an interesting character but THE WORST lines in the world.  I liked this movie more the first time when it was called HERE ON EARTH!  which btw handled the storyline a million times better.  Shane West was not bad, but buddy, hit the weights!  I think critics and anyone who can see past what little appeal this movie had would agree, this movie could have been improved and made 100x better.  Worth seeing if you have nothing better to see or if the only other option is Mothman Prophecies, which both rank up there as BRUTAL."

","When I first saw the commercials for the movie, I thought it was going to SUCK - especially because of Mandy  Moore. But then I decided that if you can't judge a book by its cover, how can you judge a Movie?<br/><br/>SO I went to Amazon and read all about the book, and stupidly read to many of the reviews therefore finding out what happened [because you know you have 2 kinds of reviewers a) those who hated the book and/or want to spoil it for everyone else and b) those who are to stupid to know that the word review is not a synonym for SUMMARY] then I ordered it. I'll be getting it tomorrow, I think.<br/><br/>So anyway, Unbeknownst to me I decided to go see the movie a couple of days ago, only I never got there -- then I thought, why not just wait till I read the book. But I ended up thinking about it and really wanting to see it each and every-time I saw an add or commercial.<br/><br/>So I went and I really liked it. I'm not going to even start to compare it to something like titanic -- because of course there is no comparison, but for its type and genre, it was pretty damn good. I've definitely seen a lot worse.<br/><br/>It had me in tears in after like scene 1 [incessant tears lol AKA constantly crying] but then again I'm a Sap. The kind of girl that cries at Cartoons, Disney Movies, Books, TV Shows, everything lol. I was probably born with tissues in-hand.<br/><br/>Yes, there may have been some cheesy writing and even cliches, but is there really ever not cliches in many movies? How can there not be cliches, everything is only original ONCE - after that if its ever done again its considered a cliche: If Joe Schmoe wrote a script and had someone kill someone by pushing them off a boat and that was an original idea -  then 12 years later Jane doe had the same idea, only altered a little -  that would be cliche, right? but should she get criticized for that? I don't really agree, maybe she feels that that is the best way for her script/story to go. I'm an actress and a writer, so I do understand how that can be.<br/><br/>
Shane West gave an awesome performance as the Not-so-Arrogant Landon Carter. Peer Pressure and Logic conflicted this slightly ""troubled teen"" as he bounced between them like a child on the giant inflated trampoline-like carnival ride. But eventually Logic took over, as well as Emotion. The girl that was shunned not only by him, but by his ""friends"" was soon the girl he found himself falling for. This same girl he knew for 12 years, never even spoke to and felt she could be summed up in mere sentences.<br/><br/>
Mandy Moore's performance was not as awful as I first assumed, infact it was pretty good. Portraying Jamie Sullivan, The Ministers Daughter [a very small town with only 1 Minister] in other-words, a very straight edged ""goodie goodie."" She sings in the choir, partakes in such after-school clubs as Stars and Planets, Drama, etc. She never Dates, Has hardly any friends, etc. She's your quintessential ""perfect"" daughter. [As for Mandy:] I mean, she's definitely No actress - but she didn't bring the Movie down like I thought she probably would.<br/><br/>
Overall, this was a sweeet Movie, ""cliches"" and all. If you're a sappy crier like me, bring tissues or make sure you get napkins at the concession stand lol.<br/><br/>I look forward to reading the book, and seeing the movie again. And while I may be in the minority, I say that if you have even the slightest notion to go see this movie, then you definitely should. :)<br/><br/>Any Questions, Comments, Whatever. Email ME :)"

","I read this book back in the summer, and I remember looking on IMDb to found out if any other Nicholas Sparks' books had been made into movies.  I was thrilled to see that in a few months I would be able to sit and enjoy another's interpretation of this entertaining book.  While the movie does deviate from the story a bit, it was well done and still stuck to the basic premise behind the book.  Another factor that helped me like the movie is that even though Mandy Moore is an attractive young woman, she was not displayed that way for most of the movie.  The makeup/costume people did a fine job of making her look plain, while her sweet voice made her appear to be the shy, reserved girl we all knew in high school.  Although I prefer the book to the movie (flashback over 50 years, more concentration on Jamie's religious strength, etc.), this movie is definitely worth a watch for you Sparks' fans.  A fine performance given from West and Moore.  Their on-screen chemistry was wonderful."
"jennbratt","Null","0","0","29 January 2002"," Mandy Moore is good, HOWEVER
","I thought Mandy Moore did a wonderful job in her first leading role, but this movie was just a mess.  First of all the editing was so poorly done. I counted at least 5 scenes that should have been left on  the editing room floor..they seemed to be there is just a filler and it really frustrated me. I would have enjoyed seeing more interaction between the two lead character.  There were too many scenes with the characters that we care or know nothing about. And not to be shallow but I would have liked to have seen a little bedroom action.  They showed the dorky friend simulate a raunchy sex act...why couldn't we have seen a little more intiment moments. This movie could have been  better if it were not thrown together ...maybe to beat Britney Spears movie to the box office??"
"chengwinghei","Null","0","0","28 January 2002"," A well-meaning but untimately unsuccessful movie for me...
","***warning, spoilers!!!***<br/><br/>After reading the book, I may have set my sights a bit too high. I understand that it's harder to make a good movie than a book, but this movie is a major disappointment, even though they should have credit for at least trying.<br/><br/>Knowing that it's set in the nineties instead of the fifties, I sensed that something was seriously wrong. (with so many ""90s"" based movies in the market, making another movie is like walking thru a minefield of cliches!!!) The opening scene was unbearable, with the rapid-fire acting you'd expect from apprentice actors. (it's okay to have smart one liners, but it just goes on too long!!! Even kids in real like don't talk so much trash at such a speed. Maybe they were struggling to get those lines over with. *hint* The black guy does something really stupid; yet another cliche.) The reason for the kids doing what they did in the first scene is never explained.<br/><br/>It doesn't get any better. The lead of the story, Landon Carter, who was framed for the previously mentioned stunt, GETS A LEADING ROLE IN A COMMUNITY PLAY!!! What kind of punishment is that!? There is also many many instances, when swear words never should have been used.<br/><br/>Of course, Carter and Jamie Sullivan get closer and closer every scene. Again, the circumstances they meet is as fake as I could imagine, involving a church choir scene where Jamie seems to be the only one that sings decently. Carter's friends, especially the black guy, crack some great lines, but most of the time they are schizophrenic (inconsistent in their personality), and in their efforts to ruin Carter's and Sullivan's ""relationship"", they pull off a high school prank that is lame, even by high school standards. Again, WHY THE HECK THEY SCRAP ALL THE DETAILS IN THE BOOK? This is a complete mess, although there's a moment of relief in the community play scene, when Moore, playing Sullivan, goes back to doing what she does best.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the guy playing Jamie's dad is as stereotypical as hell. However he gives a surprisingly good performance when explaining to Jamie about what boys are like (he takes his time, using only one line.); that scene starting off awfully enough.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie are a series of scenes which seems to be borrowed from every teen movie made since the stone age. And the result is awful. Not only did I not know what was going on, (then realised nothing was going on, since those series of scenes didn't make any sense) but the line ""I love you"" was used like twelve times, each times decreasing in sincerity, that the very last time it was used, I heard the guy next to me just groan and cuss. The emotional equivalent for running for touchdown, even though you never had the ball in the 1st place.<br/><br/>To top it all off, Many Moore's performance is just outright DISGRACEFUL. She just doesn't cut it as a preacher's daughter. Maybe it was her lines. Or her lack of emotion. Maybe both. Whatever. My take is that if you're going to make a movie based on a good book, FOLLOW THE GOOD BOOK. That is a good first step. And Mandy Moore should take more ACTING CLASSES!!!<br/><br/>BTW for those people that say this movie is for ""stupid 12-year olds"", your snobiness is showing. What 12-year-olds? We know your grown-up tastes are ""superior"". *hint* *hint* Cut it out."

","I kind of got roped into going to see this with my sister, and thought why not, at least Mandy Moore is in it.  I must admit that at first I thought it was corny, with the illness and the wedding, etc., but I wanted to get the whole story and read the book (a very good and quick read).  After reading the book you really get a better idea about the movie and realize that it is not a typical teen movie.  The story isn't about a puppy-love crush or the big dance.  Admittedly it shares many themes with other terrible teen movies, but that does not link these movies into some cheap ""genre"".  Many of the adaptations for the screen hurt the story, and in that sense help to justify many of the negative reviews.  The best adaptation, and one that I feel really makes this a good movie, is the time frame for the two main characters to fall in love.  The book offers a very real sense of urgency, which is expected because Jamie is going to die very soon.  What happens in only a matter of months in the book translates very well into the time frame of less than two hour movie.  It didn't feel forced or choppy to me, but something that could be completely natural.<br/><br/>A word about the acting.  I think that Mandy Moore could have a very promising career as an actor.  After reading the book I think she played the role of Jamie perfectly.  She portrayed that sense of endless exuberance and faith very well.  I also think that Shane West did a fairly good job.  In watching him perform, he seemed portray well the way a guy would act in certain situations, e.g. with his buddies, with Mandy and her father, etc. He acted in a way a real person would act in the same situations, which to me is most important.<br/><br/>Bottom line, with this movie and with any movie, if you can take something good out of it, then it was worth it.  A good movie is one that can personally get you involved in it.  Too many people go into a movie with the task of only trying to recognize and point out its faults without actually just watching it.  There are too many cynics out there who can't wait to dump a movie into the teeny-bopper genre just because its actors happen to be teenagers.  Save your reviews for Britney's movie ""Crossroads."""

The teen singer, along with fellow actor Shane West, put out strong, memorable performances which make you hope to see them in more films in the near future.

The whole circumstances as to how they come to be together and fall in love was changed so drastically that it is unbelievable.

They certainly don't know what it's like to live what the main character went through. But for the people who have been through the kind of harrassement that Jamie Sullivan did, know exactly what it feels like. No matter how many times writers make up stories like this one, each is unique in its own way and each represents a real aspect of everyday life among teenagers. It represents a tough period in their lives, for those who know exactly what this movie shows, some people just can't understand it because they have never been through such a thing. This movie deserves major credits and I for one give it a 10/10! Mandy Moore shows her ability as an amazing actress!(Oh and just a little side note, for those who say that she has no business in acting I got a question for you....YOU THINK YOU COULD'VE DONE BETTER???

","I thought this movie was very sweet, it does have some of the cliches of a teen movie, but at the same time it had a much deeper and more powerful story than most teen movies. Some of you are saying that it's a typical ""pretty ugly girl"" movie, where the popular guy takes on the mousey girl with glasses, big clothes and a bad haircut and underneath she a babe. And yeah, it's clear that Mandy Moore is no ""ugly girl"", but it's not like she changed her clothes and cut her hair, she was still the same person at the end as she was at the beginning. Can you name any other ""pretty-ugly"" girls who didn't change their entire being by the end of the movie?<br/><br/>And I would also like to inform everyone that being pretty doesn't make you automaticly popular in highschool. I knew plenty of girls that were a pretty as any of the ""popular"" girls and their Friday's night were always free. And many of the ""popular"" girls are popular because they play a lot of sports, wear trendy clothes, have nice houses to party at, and it didn't hurt to be a little bold with boys. They weren't necessarily popular because they were nice or pretty.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm done preaching. I liked this movie pretty well. I think Mandy Moore's a decent actress and may have a promising career when she done teen bopping (I think she one of the better teen queens and she's not a ho, unlike a certain singer whose upcoming movie was previewed at this one, and after the 30 seconds I feel like I saw the whole thing)Shane West was also really good, and real cute too.

","This movie received a poor review in a popular New York tabloid. I'm glad I didn't let that sway me from going to see it and, if you've read the same review, I hope it won't keep you away, either. The two hours flew by and, miraculously, even my seven year old sat through it with nary a trip to the candy stand. Two high school seniors, Jamie Sullivan (a very brunette Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West) begin this movie with absolutely nothing in common. Jamie is the Reverend Sullivan's daughter. She's sweet, studious,  religious, innocent, keeps to herself, and not only is NOT in the ""in group"" but seems to have no friends whatsoever in the small town where she and Landon have both lived their whole lives. Landon is street smart, a poor student by design, has doubts about God, dates a fast girl, has a lot of friends. Landon also has a chip on his shoulder because his father, a cardiologist, walked out on Landon and his mother some time before.<br/><br/>
The movie begins with Landon and his friends pulling a dirty trick on another classmate involving a jump off a tower. The classmate gets injured. Landon gets caught and is ""sentenced"" to, amongst other things, joining the cast of a play in which Jamie is also involved. After initially resisting his involvement in the play, he enlists the help of Jamie to learn his part but keeps their relationship, however tenuous, a secret from the rest of his friends. However, his limited exposure to such a sincere, truly good and spiritual person (Jamie's yearbook ambition is to ""witness a miracle"") does impress him and, indeed, even haunts him. He slowly loses his cynicism about life and people and tries to better himself... all because of her influence, of which she in unaware. In the meantime, he has broken off with his popular girlfriend and she, sensing the growing feelings Landon has for Jamie, sets Jamie up as the butt of a horrendously cruel and very public ""joke"". Landon comes to her rescue and the romantic relationship between Jamie and Landon begins. And it is truly a beautiful, albeit innocent, one. But Jamie has a secret which clears up, to the viewer, many of the questions they may have about the level of maturity she exhibits which is well beyond her years.<br/><br/>
I loved this movie because I would like to believe that it could happen. The depth of love between these two young adults is as perfect a love as could be experienced on this earth. Only a very deep cynic, one who has lost all faith in the possibilities of unconditional love,  could write this movie off as ""sweet"" or ""predictable"".  Don't let that be you."

","I am a fan of movies with plot twists.  This is exactly why I hated ""A Walk to Remember"".  For the first half hour to 45 minutes of this movie, it was somewhat enjoyable and entertaining.  Then, there was a turning point in the movie.  It became nauseatingly predictable.<br/><br/>At first, I was only able to predict the ending vaguely, but as the time went on, I was able to pinpoint every detail of what was to happen next. A few times, I was even able to tell, word for word, what a character would say next.  Since I am not a psychic, and I am usually horrible at predicting the endings of even the most mediocre movies, I would say that the fact that I was able to forsee the ending to this movie is enough reason not to go see it.<br/><br/>If predictability is not enough of a reason for a person to skip this movie, I can list a few other, more minor, cons: both of the main characters have crooked teeth (that just bugged me the whole time), the plot was totally unrealistic, something about Mandy Moore's speaking voice makes a person want to rip their ears off, and you could much better spend your $5.00-$8.00 by renting ""American Beauty"", ""Miss Congeniality"", ""There's Something About Mary"", and/or ""A Goofy Movie"", which happen to be true classics.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie to insomniacs.  This movie's lack of plot twists should put you right to sleep."
"BUbeauty2005","8","0","0","27 January 2002"," Hollywood's attempt to recreate a fantastic book
","The film ""A Walk to Remember"" was a decent attempt to recreate author Nicholas Sparks's book of the same name.  However, this Hollywood adaptation changed several small aspects of the film, creating large discrepancies between the two that those who read the book first will most definitely notice.<br/><br/>The actors tried their best and did extremely well, considering the lackluster script they were handed.  The director, Adam Shankman, took a leap of faith in moving to a project so serious, compared to some of his earlier work, like the comedy ""The Wedding Planner.""<br/><br/>Mandy Moore played the innocent to perfection.  Shane West was a good 'bad boy' but a little stiff during the emotional parts of his character. Peter Coyote was an excellent Reverend Sullivan, although the shots of him were a bit strange at times.  Darryl Hannah remained in the background as West's mother, but her appearance was quite strange, due to an obvious wig and collagen lip injections.<br/><br/>All in all, Shankman and his crew did their best to adapt a book set in the 1950's for a 2002 audience.  I only wish they could have stayed truer to the actual novel..."

","Yeah, that's basically all I can say: Ugh. I truly did not like it. It was pretty stupid. I was surprised it was only rated PG, but that's not the point. I give Mandy Moore the credit she deserves: Her acting may not be Oscar-caliber, but it is fair. Why didn't I like it? It was boring and it had a lot of drama for really no reason. To sum it up, don't waste your time seeing it. See a better movie, like Lord of the Rings, Black Hawk Down (if you can handle a good deal of violence), or A Beautiful Mind. Once again, I stress A Walk To Remember is a waste of acting, time, and money!"

","A Walk to Remember was, in comparison to the book, somewhat disappointing. Although the essence of the story was established by the movie, it lacked the book's serenity and changed Jamie Sullivan's role.<br/><br/>There were some casting and acting problems.  Shane West did an amazing job portraying Landon, but his mother was obviously miscast. Mandy Moore exceeded my expectations in acting, but she still was not quite the Jamie that we all know and love.  Jamie's dad did not portray the reverend very well at all. Jamie's character is supposed to be a perfect person.  She is ridiculously nice, and she is never mean to people, even when they are mean to her.  In the movie, Jamie slipped a few times, making rude comments on at least two different occasions.  This rudeness was a little surprising.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is reasonably entertaining, but cannot do the book justice.  For all of you who liked the movie, but have not read the book, you are missing out on the wonderful story that A Walk to Remember is. Read the book."

"Cynzmyname","10","0","0","27 January 2002"," Finally, a movie about teens that's not a ""teen movie""
","""A Walk to Remember"" reminds us that characters under the age of 20 can be mature and complex, or grow to be that way by the end of the story.  This is one of those stories that makes you want to be a better person.  Although there is an abundance of predictable moments, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't include every crappy part of reality.  Movies are a form of escape and this one shows us what we CAN be, not what is expected of us.  Mandy Moore really pulled off the role.  Although she has natural beauty, she was never ""made over.""  It is obvious that she is never overloaded with make-up and Landon falls in love with who she is, not how she looks.  I was pleasantly surprised by her acting ability, I saw Jamie on the screen, not Mandy.  Also, I've been a fan of Shane West since ""Once and Again"" began and have been waiting for someone to give him a great role for him to show off his amazing talent and versatility.  From beginning to end he completely transforms as a character and I can't wait to see what role he'll take on next!  This is sure to be a springboard for leading roles in major movies for Shane.  ""A Walk to Remember"" takes us back to a time when movies were what you WANTED life to be, not what it WAS.  Congrats to the amazing cast and crew (and author Nicholas Sparks)for bringing this wonderful story to life and restoring hope in Hollywood movies."

","I read the book A Walk to Remember and could not wait to see it when it came out in theaters.  I was shocked when it only got one star and the critics practically trashed it.  I went to see it anyway.  I loved it!!!  It was put together so nice,everything from the cast to the music.  I gave it 5 stars (or more), but i think critics should have given it at least 3 stars.  It was the best movie i have seen in a long time.  Shane West and Mandy Moore were awesome together! Everybody in the movie theater was crying, including me. In case you don't know what it is about, it is about a girl named Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who does not fit in and gets made fun of.  Because of a prank that causes someone to get hurt, a cool boy named Landon Cartor (Shane West), has to be in a play with Jamie.  He eventually falls for her and sees that she has a great personality.  I dont want to give away the ending, go see it, its great!  If you have read the book, it is pretty much the same but it is set in 1996 instead of the 1950's so it is a little bit different.  This movie was so great!

"crickymarie","10","0","0","26 January 2002"," Of all chick flicks, this one is one of the best ones I've seen
","Personally, I loved this film, but I wanted explain both why it's good and why it's bad, for those who want a reason to see it and those who want not to waste their money on something they don't want to see.  If you want a chick-flick, tearjerker, or date movie, this one is a good choice; also, if you're of the target audience (teenage girls, Christians, or Nicholas Sparks fans), you might like it too. Why it's good: 1) Shane West and Mandy Moore can act, and they have great chemistry together.  I think this is basically why it's better than, say ""Here on Earth"" (which is what this film is being compared to in other mean, nasty reviews in newspapers I've read so far). 2) It's a HUGE tearjerker!!! 3) It gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, like it gives you hope when you see a character like Jaime Sullivan who's actually a good person. 4) For teen girls, there's always Shane West 5) For Mandy Moore fans, there's Mandy Moore 6) Christians will like the fact that the Christian Jaime is portrayed in a good light- she's also a strong character and has a sense of humour in her comebacks to school bullys. 7) I can't really vouch for how similar the movie was to the book, since I haven't read it, but I've heard, although there are changes that happens with every book-turning-into-a-movie, it stays true to the themes and feelings from the original novel. Now, bad things: 1) It's quite mushy/corny 2) You COULD argue it was done before in ""Here on Earth."" 3) If you're a male, you could be in a potentially embarassing situation because the audience was about 95% female when I went to the theater. Well, that's my ""bad reasons"" list.  Yeah, a bit biased, wasn't I?  I have to say, there were moments when everyone was sighing, or sobbing, or saying ""awwwwww!""  I guess you can tell I really liked it.  It was good!"

The story was far from a cliche, and since it's a quality book and not just some movie written for a teen idol, it deserves much more respect. Jamie Sullivan is never an ugly girl, and never becomes pretty, she just happens to look especially nice one night because she dressed up for her performance in the school play.  People should stop commenting on it like she got a makeover and then was the most popular girl in school.<br/><br/>
It was a story of a girl with a good heart and good morals, who was able to accomplish a lot and make a guy who used to think he was something special, realize what special really means.  Mandy Moore did a very good job and proved that if she wants to act, she most certainly has the talent to.<br/><br/>Those who say that people who like this movie could only be Mandy Moore fans or anything else with a negative connotation...are wrong.  It was a heartfelt story that was portrayed very well.  Whether the actors have staying power is totally irrelevant to the quality of the film.

This movie was more than just ""boy meets girl, young love"".  There were many dynamics to the story. It's a story involving forgiveness, humility, and faith.  The movie's song ""only hope"" sung beautifully by Mandy Moore, written by Jonathan Foreman (of Switchfoot, formerly The New Radicals), is easily interpreted (if not firstly written) as a christian worship song. (Switchfoot is a christian band). The relationship between Landon and his father is parallell to a persons relationship with God, and the way you approach him.  This movie was incredible, and a life lesson.  About how many people you'll miss out on if you limit yourself with first impressions and stereotypes. About having faith in yourself and other people.  Understanding the depth and possibility of love at any age.  A lesson in forgiving others and learning how to humble yourself and ask for help.

You actually believe that she is a sick patient with lukemia and is about to die soon. She doesn't get all cocky just because she finally bridged the gap between the music and movie buisness. She did bridge the gap but the did it humbily and performed magnificently. Shane West also did a great job. He makes you feel what he is suppose to feel in the movie. And he does such a great acting job to make the transition between cocky popular dude to a caring thoughtful boyfriend really smooth.

","A couple more words on A Walk to Remember and I'm off my soapbox.<br/><br/>1). It's nice to see a movie that isn't afraid of faith, doesn't mock it, doesn't trivialize it, and doesn't criminalize it.  Like The Apostle, it dares to be spiritual without being overtly religious.<br/><br/>2). It's also nice to see a movie that dares to portray teenagers as thoughtful, intelligent human beings who think about things other than sex and weed and saying ""dude"" all the time.  In fact, it is a stunningly honest portrayal of adolescence as West's character screams to the world ""I'm a rebel, screw you all"" but turns right around and says through Moore's character, ""that act may work with your friends, but when you're all alone, you know that being aloof isn't really all that fulfilling.""  Like many teens, Landon knows that but doesn't dare say it out loud... not right away...<br/><br/>3). Is it possible to show the transformation of his character without using ""Flood"" by Jars of Clay?  Jars is an awesome band, but that song was big 5 years ago, and I am the only human on the planet who still listens to that album (though it WAS their best).  The kids are listening to Creed and Lifehouse and Sixpence and dc Talk and Plus One now, to say nothing of the harder stuff pouring out of my local station.  Christian pop music may have started with Michael W. Smith and Amy Grant, and flourished through Jars and dc Talk and the Newsboys, but the industry has grown up in recent years. The record companies recognized good music when they heard it; it's time Hollywood stopped treating Christians like we spend all our time at Gaither reunions.  There's plenty of good modern rock out there, and easily found.<br/><br/>That last bit was a long rant for a 20-second section of the movie, but as a musician it didn't escape my attention.  Don't let one nitpick stop you from taking in what is an excellent story, and fairly well told through the actors."

","I originally walked into this movie as punishment for taking my girlfriend to see Kung Pow with my friends.  I turned the tables on her, however, my enjoying this movie, and with good reason.<br/><br/>I have never read the book, and in either case I have no idea what correlation exists between the title and the story, but I do know this about the movie, it is a good story that is competently acted by the principals. Shane West is good at pouting at authority and even better at showing steely resolve when someone dares to believe in him.  Mandy Moore easily sells her role as the quiet but confident church mouse, but I think she cheats by having those big brown eyes.  The dialog is not perfect but manages to make its point and move the story forward.  Personally I think if dialog is ""good enough"" you need to go back and make it great, but the story itself, while a bit cliched and contrived, glosses over the holes in the dialog.<br/><br/>The movie starts off rather hard-edged and typical of Varsity Blues-type teen movies, but the opening scene is an antithesis to the rest of the story.  It is so disjointed that it almost seems out of place, probably because it was not in the book (I'm told), but it can be dismissed as necessary to get us acquainted with the fact that these teens are going headlong down the path to trouble.  Once that's out of the way, we can actually start examining the characters.<br/><br/>West seems angry at everybody, probably because his dad left him and his mom is Daryl Hannah in a bad wig.  Add his desire to be cool with his friends, mostly by pretending not to care what people think (a dichotomy that only makes sense if you're cool), and you have a kid only to happy to glare at everybody.<br/><br/>Moore is a preacher's daughter who inexplicably sees West and finds in him an inner strength that no one else sees.  The film suggests that it's because nobody else is looking for it, a subtle undertone about the times. It goes without saying that they fall in love, and there is a major tragic plot twist in the final third of the movie that has the whole theater blubbering by end credits.<br/><br/>The dirty little secret of this movie is that the story is not about the couple, but about West and his character's redemption.  The undertones of faith and charity scream for a religious message, but for better or worse, there is no actual conversion process in the film.  I was personally disappointed by this, as it seems to suggest redemption by proxy, which is both unbiblical and impractical, but in an age where religion is immediately and unfairly linked with prosletyzing, it's a compromise I will have to live with.<br/><br/>Having said this, the final portion of the movie seemed a bit drawn out and misdirected.  Time spent languishing over the principals, their tragedy and their resolve (a bit mature and dry-eyed for 18-year-olds), could have been invested in West's interaction with supporting characters.  In fact, the supporting cast has been sentenced to the periphery in this film, appearing only now and again to remind us that West and Moore are not the only two people on earth.  Perhaps truncating the later scenes and replacing them with longer scenes involving the supporting characters would have fleshed them out more, and as a result, made the principals more three-dimensional as well.  A good supporting role does not supplant the main story or give the audience something to do between car chases, it enhances the main story. A bit more of this would have made a really good movie into an outstanding portrait of humanity.<br/><br/>I highly recommend anyone who dares to believe, in God, in themselves, in each other, go and see this film.  You will not be disappointed. Self-appointed cinema gurus, watch at your own risk.  This is ALMOST a great movie.  8 out of 10."

","When I first heard the Mandy Moore was starring in an upcoming movie, my first thought was: typical. But it really wasn't that bad! I would even go as far as to say it was good. Pretty good. There were a few parts where Mandy got a little annoying, but other than that, she was a fine actress, considering this is her first major role in a movie. I have earned a new respect for Mandy Moore. I was also delighted to see that she did not have a huge singing part in A Walk to Remember, just singing in the church choir and a school play. However, Britney Spears' movie Crossroads, looks horrible! Her singing career influenced the movie way too much. But we'll cross that road when we come to it. Ha. Get it?"

","This was a great movie in my opinion.  I had read the novel before I saw the movie so I was expecting to be able to bash it when I left.  I am also not usually a fan of movies such as these but there was something about this movie that sucked me in at the beginning and would not let me out until the end.  This is a happy/sad type of movie that has a lot of emotional scenes at the end.  I am not a person to get tear jerked during a movie but this one sure did jerk some tears.  I wasn't full out crying but I was close. Only one other movie has done that to me....Braveheart (best movie ever). Anyway, the story is great, the acting is above par, and the development of the main characters is perfect.  The only problem I have with this movie is that it drops some of the characters and subplots in mid plot and very weakly reincorporates them in the end.  I would have liked to see more development of these characters and sub-plots but I guess there was not enough time.  Anyway, I recommend this movie to all but younger kids who will not find it too entertaining."

","I must confess, first of all, that I originally went to this movie more out of an attempt to humor my girlfriend than for my own personal enjoyment. Although I tend to enjoy a good ""chick flick"" from time to time, personally I was initially more interested in seeing ""Lord of the Rings"" for a second time than this movie.  However I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was done and actually ended up enjoying it immensely.  I haven't read the book upon which this movie is based, so I can't say anything about how faithful it is or isn't to the book, although I do plan on eventually reading it.  However, as far as the movie goes, I can't really think of anything that should have been changed about the movie.  The movie was pleasantly devoid of profanity, violence, and sex, it promoted several important messages about life, love, and growing as a person without lecturing or being preachy, the characters evolved realistically (in the time alloted, of course), The acting was expressive without being overly dramatic and without resorting the characters resorting to cliche'-ridden lines, and although the ending was sad, it also offered a sense of hope and happiness.  The soundtrack was also very well done from start to finish, including Mandy Moore's song from the play (""Only Hope"").  I also have to give the movie extra credit for the fact that I was close to tears by the end of the film, something that hasn't happened at least since ""Transformers the Movie"" when Optimus Prime died when I in 3rd grade.  Any movie that can make me emotional and bring me close to tears like that is clearly doing something right.  My girlfriend bought the soundtrack to the movie right after we left the movie theater and I have found that just listening to the songs, particularly the aforementioned one, is enough to start making me feel sad again.  Anybody who has not seen this movie yet and is wondering if they should owes it at least a rental.  Very well-done movie!"

It had sappy moments but all love stories do. My only real criticism with the movie is that I wish that it hadn't rushed through Landon's growing feelings for Jamie. The emphasis in the book is how Landon evolves as a person and falls in love with Jamie. The book beautifully illustrates this and by the time he tells her that he loves her [in the book] you really believe it.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews were mean spirited and unfair.

","OH-MY-GOD! This movie is absolutely good! Don't listen to anybody who tells you otherwise. Well, it is a little on the generic side (that much i admit) but that still does not change the fact that it's a pretty good story. Shane West was absolutely adorable in this flick. I mean, I hated his guts in Get Over It, and his performance in Whatever It Takes did not even faze me one bit, but he definitely hit pay dirt on this one! He's got that rebel-turned-good-boy thing going for him. I definitely developed a major crush on him after watching this movie! Anyway, Mandy Moore (the female lead) was not as bad as I expected. I thought she was gonne be awful, but it was passable at most. She has a pretty mediocre talent when it comes to acting. (Take The Princess Diaries, for example...).If it's any consolation to Mandy, I love the movie's theme song, though! c"",)The movie would have been better if they casted the female lead with a great dramatic actress, because the role of Jamie was a pivotal one. More depth was required. They should have casted someone along the lines of Julia Stiles, Sarah Michelle Gellar or Katie Holmes (just 3 of the best drama princesses of this generation.)At least, Shane West was there to salvage the dramatic content! Overall, it's a must-see flick for those who likes romance and teen movies. It's a little predictable, but I guarantee you'll be sighing and crying till the credits roll!

","Finally! A teen film that portrays virtue with neither ridicule nor lectures.<br/><br/>""A Walk to Remember"" opens with in-your-face teen rebellion. The ""in-crowd"" at Beaufort High sets up a wannabe for a prank that goes too far. The principal punishes the protagonist by forcing him to interact with ""people different from himself."" And so Landon Carter (Shane West) crosses paths with Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), a plain Jane Bible-carrying astronomy geek whom Landon has known and ignored since kindergarten.<br/><br/>What follows is a love story with predictable milestones, innocent teenage romance, and devices to close the loose ends. What makes this film special, though, is the way it develops the characters.  Landon is portrayed as an angry son who doesn't want to forgive his father for leaving his mother. Jamie has a seductive inner peace that Landon can't resist. The trailer use Landon's question, ""Don't you care what people think about you?"" and Jamie's answer: ""No,"" to set her up as a rebel against rebellion. But she also sees something good in him despite her first instincts (and her father), which tell her he's nothing but trouble.<br/><br/>Reverend Sullivan (Peter Coyote) could have been less aloof, but the screenplay doesn't give him much to work with. He has to raise his daughter alone after his wife dies.  He does the best he knows how, trying to balance the transfer of his values with the acceptance that he has to let his daughter grow up to become her own person.<br/><br/>It's typical for Hollywood films to ridicule anyone who doesn't break the rules, and films praised by the Christian community often suffer from proselytizing that turns off secular audiences. This film doesn't pander to either side.  Jamie, by being an old-fashioned symbol for virtue, is the hero of the film, and yet the Christian overtones are muted.<br/><br/>The tone of the mainstream critics of this film is merciless, which is another indication that this film is rebellious in exactly the way it sets out to be. It's a sweet story with a bittersweet ending, and grace is plentiful. That's too much for cynical nihilists to tolerate.  But read the negative reviews for yourself.  The criticisms sound empty and shallow, just like Landon's in-crowd friends who fail to ridicule him into abandoning his relationship with Jamie."

","A Walk to Remember is a refreshing and welcome alternative to the typical ""teen movie"" that Hollywood makes these days (e.g. American Pie, Bring it On, pick any Freddie Prinz Jr. movie!). It is smarter than the movies named above for several reasons: (1) the characters are well developed and seem like real people with real issues; (2) there are no jokes involving bodily fluids or functions (thank God!); and (3) it is about romance, rather than sex. Shane West plays Landon Carter, who is a rebellious but popular kid in his high school. And pop star Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, a cute but unpopular girl in (the same) high school, due to her quasi-mousy style of dress and her strong Christian beliefs (her dad is the minister of a local church). When Landon gets in trouble and is forced to participate in the upcoming school play as his punishment, he is helped in his preparation by Jamie, who is also in the play and who volunteers to meet with him to practice their lines. During their meetings, an attraction builds between Landon and Jamie but he is afraid to show his feelings for her in public, around his ""popular"" friends, until something happens, and he feels that he must make a stand. I won't reveal any more of the plot here, since much of the joy of watching A Walk to Remember lies in seeing how it develops the growing romance between the two teens. There's genuine sweetness in this story and between the two lovers--which manages to stay a hair's breadth away from manipulative sentimentality--and then something happens. For the record, I predicted it far in advance, but that didn't lessen the impact of what happens. For the film takes its time developing its two main characters so that we genuinely care about their fate when the ""unexpected"" moment finally comes. For those who have not been overcome by cynicism and irony, and who are open to seeing a sweet teenage love story, I heartily recommend A Walk to Remember. It is a sleeper that will gradually win your heart over. (If you're a teenager, I recommend that you go see this film and prove to Hollywood that there's a market (among teens) for sweet, intelligent films like this.)"

Not likely to sweep the Academy Awards, but, all in all, WELL worth seeing.<br/><br/>=ALL= YOU SHOULD KNOW before going to see this movie is that: it's about teens, it involves a girl who has faith in God, there's romance as well, and quite a few people really like the movie. <br/><br/>To be fair, it seems there are others who just can't stand it. A lot of those are probably (if I had to guess) people who are a bit of Grinches when it comes to values and faith. If you are favorable towards those things, whether you're a teen yourself, or a 40-year-old dad like me, you'll probably like A Walk to Remember.<br/><br/>Not that you have to be particularly religious to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>
There were a couple of moments where I felt the production suffered; chiefly, in a couple of musical numbers that were just -too- musical. The soundtrack seemed to wander off into recording-studio land, divorced from the surroundings of the film. They would have done better to bring in some of the sounds from the real-life (er, movie-life) setting, and not to have the vocals quite so ""professional."" The girl is supposed to be a rather ordinary high-school girl; it is a bit distracting for her to sound like a professional singer (even though I understand she is).<br/><br/>
But other parts of the movie overcome those flaws. You pretty well forget (at least I did) that you're in a movie. That's one of the tests of a good film.<br/><br/>This one will probably make it into our home video library."

I went to see it with my wife and my 14-year-old daughter and I found myself, a 44-year-old man watching the film with tears streaming down my face.  Simply a superb film.<br/><br/>I found the characters to be different and interesting, not following the similar `pop star in a movie' profile.  The Jamie Sullivan character played by Mandy Moore was an expansive, complex character that typically can't be played by such a young person, but she nailed the character perfectly, playing her with such depth and feeling that I don't think it could have been done any better by anyone else.<br/><br/>Shane West also did a wonderful job playing Landon Carter. I though he played this character perfectly.  His emotions, his inner struggle with his desire to be with Jamie or to continue to be `cool', his anger, and non-caring attitude.  He used all of these emotions to paint this character flawlessly.<br/><br/>Peter Coyote also played the part of Reverend Sullivan, Jamie's father to a T.  He perfectly portrayed the Christian father with the inner struggle of seeing his daughter grow up and having to let go, also because of her illness, wanting to protect her.<br/><br/>This movie is a `must see', but bring a box of Tissues."

","I read the reviews for this movie before I saw it, and, honestly, I wasn't expecting it to be good. The reviews said that Mandy Moore was too pretty to play this role. So I expected this to be another ""Crossroads."" But was I sure wrong!<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I completely forgot that Mandy Moore was even a singer. She did such a great job in this. And, for the record, she did not look like a pop star in this. I don't know where that reviewer could get that idea.<br/><br/>Now, if you have read the book, there are some differences. But really the changes didn't really bring the movie down, but make it even better. Yes, I would have liked some of the things to stay the same, but still the movie seemed to work anyways.<br/><br/>Shane West played Landon very well. He's obviously a growing actor and I hope to see him in other roles.<br/><br/>I'm impressed in Mandy Moore for picking a role like this instead of picking a lame chick flick movie like Britney Spears did. Some of the scenes in A Walk to Remember had some dramatic intensities, and I think Mandy pulled them off well.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie and I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a great movie. 9-10"

","A few weeks ago I went and saw this movie with my father. I really wanted to see the movie because I read the book a thousand times. I heard that the movie is much diffrent from the book, and that left me dismayed for awhile. But, I still wanted to see it. Let, me first say that Mandy Moore can act! I don't think anyone else could play the part of Jamie Sullivan with more heart than Mandy Moore did. And, Shane West is such a great actor, and he needs to be more recognized. Now, I have read tons of reviews, and lots of IMDb user comments, and people keep saying the same thing over and over again...""this movie was cliched."" Yes, some aspects of the movie was in fact cliched. But, I think people are missing the one factor that seperates this movie from other teen oriented movies...it uses religion!  Never before did I see a movie that portrayed religion as a good thing. I mean we have so many people in the Hollywood business belonging to this Scientology stuff that I think that everyone has forgotten God. Movies from the past have made fun of God by bashing catholism, and stereotyping other religions to a point where it makes America want to throw up! But here comes along a teen movie that holds it's moral values and reminds us that  people somewhere out there still believe that God exists. The point of the movie was the Jamie was outcasted because her father was the strict pastor at a Southern Baptist Church. She held her faith strong and people made fun of her for that. She did'nt transform into this beautiful girl, she stayed true to herself. So thats why i dont get this pretty-ugly girl crap. Nobody in the movie said she was ugly..they just thought that being different is strange. I go to a Catholic school, and I guess everyone of us is strange. Especially to public school people. The point is I think you should see this movie because it is DIFFERENT in the sense that it reminds us of Christianity, instead of bashing it. Mandy Moore is a wonderful actress and she beats Britney in my book at acting. (I saw Crossroads and I almost threw up) By the way, even my southern Baptist dad cried!"

","Aristotle believed in perfect circles and perfect triangles that only exist in our minds. The actual representations of these perfect shapes are flawed if for no other reason than that they are man made. So although these representations are slightly flawed, they remind us of the perfect shapes or things in our minds. Even though we've never seen a perfect triangle, we know what one looks like because our mind can eliminate the flaws. The characters in this film are by no means perfect, the situations are occasionally ludicrously created to stir up emotion or so that Shane West runs into Mandy Moore in the most unlikely place. But, the attempt made was to try to put the perfect people together and watch as the magic happens. And these representations of the perfect boy/girlfriend are enough to stir up feelings and cause you to sharpen your own perfect boy/girlfriend image. A Walk to Remember is only a good movie if you open yourselves up and have faith that maybe for just 100 minutes Aristotle was wrong, and that perfection can occur."

","Although the movie was well scripted and fairly acted, it was very mushy and predictable.  Those of you who didn't read the bestseller when it first arrived on bookshelves had no idea what you were getting yourself into, but for us we were quite surprised that the great book was adapted into a movie. This was an excellent choice for Mandy Moore to pick as her first starring lead role in a motion picture, and she is a fine actress with great learning talent.  Shane West was excellent as the heartthrob/ bad-boy, but not a far departure from his current character on ""Once and Again"".  All and all the movie was moderately good, but needed more substance and less reliability on the romantic element."

Landon does an incredible job coming across as the typical guy jerk, but he realizes there's so much more out there as he learns to love completely and give of himself.  As a result of Jamie's love and faith, he grows into a man, instead of just a bigger version of a little boy, which is the direction he was headed.  Jamie also is an amazing role.  She stands by her faith and beliefs, despite the pain and sometimes ridicule it causes her from her peers.  She portrays a Christian teenage girl, without coming across ""preach-y"" or ""holier-than-thou"" or totally out of touch with the world.  Which is the way it really is.  Also, who says she is the ugly duckling turned beautiful.  In my opinion she was beautiful right from the start.  Glamour isn't synonymous with beauty."

","I remember seeing the previews for ""A Walk To Remember"" and thinking three things.  The first was ""Oh, a Mandy Moore movie, how much you wanna' bet that will be the most brainless teen flick of the year?""  The second was ""Can we say predictable? ""  And my third thought was ""Shane West is HOT!"" As it turns out, the only one of those three observances was right, and lucky for me (and the rest of the female population) it was that Shane West is, indeed, VERY ATTRACTIVE.  ""A Walk To Remember"" is more than just the flighty teen flick it looked like in the previews.  This movie isn't just a plug for Mandy Moore songs and an excuse to stare at Shane West for a few hours, it is both moving and meaningful.  I'm often very hard on movies if I feel like they don't have enough substance or character development.  ""A Walk To Remember"" has you leaving the theater after some good ole' catharsis, as well as feeling like you just made some new close friends. I definitely recommend this movie, and warn that it IS a tear-jerker.  But then again, it sometimes feels better to cry then to hold it all in, and if you get to watch this movie while doing it, it's not too bad of a deal."
"Dallas67","7","0","0","21 February 2002"," A bit saccharine but better than some sugar.
","I think I can fairly say that as an agnostic man rapidly approaching his mid-thirties, I'm not exactly the target audience for `A Walk to Remember'. That alone is its own disclaimer: I need not even add that I'm cynical, jaded, and universally unmoved by the machinations that filmmakers (and novelists) use to tug at our emotions. Most films in this genre send my eyes straight to the back of my skull immediately to rest there for the next two hours. It's not even the type of film I would normally find myself attending were it not a bout of  whimsical nostalgia. I think my even being in the theater may take a bit of mercifully short explanation:<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer, I was struck how much young Miss Moore reminded me of a girl I loved the summer before my senior year. That was lure and when I sat in the theater and saw this story mirrored my own - good, moral girl takes a chance on the wild guy - it made me think about things I'd not considered for years. Unlike Landon, I was not wise enough to appreciate the gift I was given and she gave up on me, to my immediate regret. Two thousand miles and seventeen years later in a Los Angeles theater I was surprised to find that I still regretted it. On the drive home I even found myself taking stock of my life and the way I live it. The movie made me think and it made me feel. No one could have been more surprised than me.<br/><br/>Still, I can see the faults with `A Walk to Remember'. Though Shane West manages to convey some solid emotion as Landon and Mandy Moore's Jamie radiates despite both inexperience and a frumpy wardrobe, these characters are one-dimensional and seem slaves to the sheer unoriginality of the story. Typical is a scene where Landon's ex-girlfriend cruelly passes out flyers with sweet Jamie's head pasted on a Club magazine covergirl's body. Sadly, it is overdone with all the attendant movie clichés: Close-ups of school kids laughing like hyenas, close-ups of Jamie's sweaty mortification, a heartbeat soundtrack, all of the above moving at half-speed. A better (and ultimately more difficult) scene would have shown us a Jamie capable of standing up for herself in the moment, perhaps breaking down only when it had passed and she was alone with Landon, enabling him to return and still throw the punch that estranges himself from his friends. A viewer that lacks a personal connection and therefore the ability to fill these missteps with the emotional shorthand needed, could certainly point to this scene and others as a reason to dismiss the entire film. However, with the possible exception of professional movie critics and some members of the reptile family, I think most of us enjoy a level of intercourse with our poor battered hearts. Hopefully enough to allow ourselves the occasional emotional manipulation even when it is as nakedly applied as in this film.<br/><br/>As teen love stories go, `A Walk to Remember' may deserve some points for trying to transcend the genre even if it doesn't quite make the climb. Certainly, it might be more beneficial to our culture if we were given more young female characters like Jamie. If girls like her were given some equal time among the teeny-bopper bimbettes that permeate entertainment, it might just open some young men to the reality of what they should be finding attractive and start looking not only with their eyes, but with their hearts and minds. At the very least, it may spare some of them a surprising and unnerving feeling of deep regret, years later, when they least expect it.<br/><br/>
If you have a serious sweet tooth, the film is a 10. For those who have loved and lost at a young enough age where you can still manage a pang when you think about it, it's a solid 7. If you can't give it at least a four, get on a transplant list - your heart is about to go."

","Although not very faithful to the novel by Nicholas Sparks, this isn't too bad for a teen movie. As long as you know that you'll get all of the teen cliches so prominently displayed in the ""Not Another Teen Movie"" parody, then the rest will be OK for you. Most of the characters are more like caricatures of what someone thinks a typical teen from that peer group are like. The story is pretty good, but the presentation is a little stale.<br/><br/> Mandy Moore plays the ""ugly duckling"" part pretty well. It's at least notable that she did not go the Britney/Mariah route into films trying to be just as glamorous or as good looking as they think they are in real life. Her range of emotions seems pretty honest. The character is pretty well developed and easy to sympathize with. The only fault in her performance is the overly dramatic singing sequences in a few parts of the movie.<br/><br/> Shane West (""Whatever It Takes"") does pretty well as an insecure popular kid falling for the unpopular girl. With the turn the movie takes (I won't spoil it here), his character becomes more tolerable and less typical as the film goes on. With help from good supporting actors Peter Coyote (""E.T."") and Darryl Hannah, the cast rounds out pretty nicely. Obviously this movie was not geared for critics, though, and will probably get panned. It's made for teen girls and that's about it. So, in that respect, it's served its purpose and isn't bad for what it is. It's got its target audience covered and will probably do well in malls and multiplexes across the country.  If you're in that demographic, go check it out. If not, you'll be fine waiting for video if you're even curious at all."

","I saw this movie almost two weeks ago, and it struck me so much that I have seen it two more times with the excuse of accompanying some friends of mine who wanted to go see it. I wanted to take my time before writing this review, in order to make it slowly sink in. In the meantime, I have read reviews by critics and moviegoers, have read the novel by Nicholas Sparks on which this movie is (loosely) based, and have realized that the first time I saw it in the theater was actually the first time I ever cried at a movie. I do not exactly know why most of the the other people in the theater were crying, but I did cry because of the sweet, chaste, and unselfish love that Landon and Jamie showed towards each other in many a scene. It was really touching. Most movie critics have put down this movie on the moral basis that `Hollywood does not have the right to preach to us.' Personally, I liked the fact that Christianity was treated with fairness and respect.<br/><br/>It has been rightly written that this movie brings nothing new to the big screen. It is a mixture of `Love Story,' `Pretty in Pink,' and `She's All That,' with a sprinkle of `Seventh Heaven.' Yet, my personal opinion is that `A Walk to Remember' is in a category by itself, way above even celebrated movies such as`Titanic,' `Sleepless in Seattle,' or `Say Anything.' In all these movies, there is no spiritual and psychological growth in the characters, neither are there higher moral lessons to be learned by the viewer. They surely have a couple of aspects similar to `A Walk' but, in the end, they totally lack the sense of nobility irradiated by this movie. `A Walk' makes you think and, as I read in some of the reviews, even reevaluate your moral principles. This is not something that the above-mentioned love stories do.<br/><br/>Take `Say Anything,' for example. It was recently voted on `Entertainment Weekly' as the best modern romance movie. They say there it shows a lot of attention to small details, like the scene in which Lloyd checks his hair in the mirror before dialing the last digit of Diane's phone number. Now, notice that these details do not show love and altruism, but rather superficiality and selfishness. He wants to look good: normal in a teenager, but hardly noble. Check instead all the things Landon does for Jamie. It's totally unselfish and considerate towards her feelings and principles. Check out for example how, in one scene, he stops kissing her as a sign of respect for her religious beliefs: how manly and how mature. Also, sex is never an issue, and even their kisses reveal a sense of purity, chastity, and sweetness unseen in most other movies. You want details? Forget the `Say Anything' Lloyd checking his hair in the mirror, and check out the scene with Landon and Jamie on the deck. She is sleeping with her head on his shoulder. He notices that her sweater leaves her shoulder uncovered and pulls it up to keep her warm. Want more romantic details? Check out the seriousness with which both of them say the phrase, `I love you,' and their reaction to this phrase. Unlike in many other movies, in which these words (if they are even pronounced) drown in an ocean of sex-related activities, here they play a pivotal role that conveys truly felt reactions in the two characters. <br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good. Honestly, the first time I saw the movie, I did not even know that Mandy Moore was a pop singer (I am not exactly into teen pop music). Had the acting been bad, most of the above-mentioned details would have not worked out the way they did. Both West and Moore did an excellent job, and so did the supporting cast.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I do not recall seeing any other movie in which there are so many positive aspects at the same time. Here we have true (proved, and not just `felt') love, chastity, respect, kindness, maturity, self-confidence not based on peer pressure but on higher moral standards, forgiveness, devotion, patience, hope, and faith. All these aspects contribute to making this movie much more that a mere teen love story, but instead a true walk to remember, even for the viewers.<br/><br/>By the way, check out the book. It is even better."

","I bought a ticket for this movie on the strength of Roger Ebert's review, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself agreeing with his three-star review. It is a fairly corny teen flick, yes, but it's ABOUT something. I left the theatre thinking how some 18-year-olds focus on today, believing that they have all the time in the world to worry about the future, and others are faced with situations that make them grow up fast. People in the second group tend to realize that 18 is not to young to do something valuable, to change another person's life.<br/><br/>This definitely wasn't Shakespeare, but I was gently entertained, and it made me think.

I have not read the novel, so i can't compare and contrast, but the acting was good and at some points very (gush-worthingly) cute. I admire that Mandy dyed her hair brown, b/c it helped to separate Jamie from Mandy Moore, pop princess. I also liked how they didn't overdo a singing-Jamie.

"dave-658","8","0","0","18 February 2002"," Great movie, better than the book!
","The movie really was better than the book, the producers made signficant changes in the beginning to setup the relationship between jamie and landon. The opening dare scene really showed the kind of guy landon was, what kind of direction he was headed, and truly made a dramatic difference between jamie and landon... When he was forced to go into drama by the principal, to me, it seemed a much more logical and natural way to setup the relationship...the movie made it seem that jamie was much more the saviour, and the landon was the one in need this way...   The movie is just straight out more powerful than the book.. I think this doesn't make the book bad, its just more of a credit to the producers.<br/><br/>
Aside from that, if you haven't read the book, go see the movie first!!! If you've seen the movie and loved it, it is probably worth your while to read it too.<br/><br/>And, yes, the world should have more Jamie Sullivans."

","As a fan of Christian themed and clean movies I was looking forward to this movie then found out more about Mandy Moore.  I was thinking it would have a ""fair"" story but doubted the depth of the story, the depth of the characters faith in the movie, and if Mandy Moore had been selected for her acting skills or for her teen female popularity. I hate spoilers so I won't even hint at the story line but suffice it to say the story takes twists and turns that leave you with no memory of the first 10 minutes.  The characters develop into people you can relate to, cheer for, cry with, and believe they are real. From a 30 something male, this is a movie to see."

She did such a wonderful job in this movie that I'm still affected by the movie, and it's been a week!  Shane West and Mandy work really well together, and it's hard to believe that they're not really together in real life!!!! So the movie is predictable.  And so the movie is a chick flick.  And so the movie isn't original.  But you know what?  When you can take something, a plot that has already been worked, and STILL make it work, that's really something!  Some parts of the movie were unrealistic, like the part West tells Mandy that he loves her.  It was too quick.  But overall, the movie was really well put together.  Mandy and Shane are the perfect people for the roles.  I was deeply touched by their love.  It makes you believe that true love, faith, and all the good stuff in life does exist even if it may not exist here and now!  I think everyone left the theatre crying.  Even the guys.  That should tell you something.  I totally admire Mandy Moore now. She is likeable without having to show off, without having too be too ""Hollywood.""  If anyone says that this movie sucks, or says that those who like the movie are pathetic,then those are the type of people who ALWAYS have to find something bad in everything because this movie was really awesome, to my surprise.

","When I went to see this movie, I thought I'd be seeing a decent ""chick flick"" love story. What I found was a boring, too long, cheesy, bad production. The most disturbing thing was the costumes. It was supposed the take place in the mid-90's, but everything looked post-millenium. Low-rider jeans and three-quarter sleeved shirts filled every scene. Even the music was off target. I'm sorry, but ""Get Your Freak On"" by Missy Elliot came out last year. I was told that this originally (in the book) took place in the 1950's. It would have made MUCH more sense if they had left it there, rather than trying to modernize it's stereotypical and predictable story line. The only positive note to be made is that Mandy Moore is actually believable, although the character isn't. Thumbs up on your acting, Mandy, thumbs down to the script."

Although when I first saw the length of the movie was close to two hours I thought that it was going to be long and drawn out but I was soon to be proven wrong.  I believe that this was a well directed movie as the scenes just seemed to flow easily and quickly to another and it did not even seem like it had taken the two hours.

This movie was made with heart and feeling.

Shane West was the perfect choice to play Landon Carter, and while I had my doubts about Mandy Moore, she came through with a great performance for the most part.  At times, I felt the story was a little jumpy and that it could've developed more. But the meaningful, heartfelt moments more than compensated.  Might I also add that the music in the movie is amazing, great soundtrack.  A Walk To Remember is a teen movie, without the usual staples.  It definitely sways the audience with maturity, instead of with gross out humor or sight gags.  A Walk to Remember does for the romantic movie what Nicholas Sparks did for the romance novel."

(My friend told me)<br/><br/>Anyways- this was a pretty good movie, not the best but if there is nothing better to see, its worth it.

"Wes Alexander","Null","0","0","9 February 2002"," A sloppy sap-fest...
","A WALK TO REMEMBER / (2002) D-<br/><br/>By Wes Alexander<br/><br/>Teen romances have become very painful for me. It started in 2000 with HERE ON EARTH, continued on with CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL in 2001 and now A WALK TO REMEMBER. I don't know when the creators of these movies stopped caring, but they better start caring soon. The month of January scares me because it is usually the worst month for movies. Studios save all of their good movies for December and in January send out whatever's left on the shelf.<br/><br/>
A WALK TO REMEMBER is exactly the same as every other movie of this genre, but here goes: Shane West plays Landon Carter, a reckless teenager who decides it's time to change after a friend of his has an accident He has to- ya know what? Screw it. It's not worth the time to write the summary. You know what happens. He meets Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and she starts to change his life forever, as said in the trailer. The two fall in love and so on and whatnot.<br/><br/>It seems with each of these movies I get even more irritated. This film is filled with so many clichÃ©s it's not even funny. This is a line in the movie: `Everything was going fine, then you happened.' I'm serious. That's the kind of dialogue these characters say. The screenplay by Karen Janszen is filled with the most unbelievable and insane dialogue. Does she realize real people don't talk like that? I've never read the book, but I have a high suspicion it's better than the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that Moore and West have chemistry. It's rare in these movies, but it does happen in this one. I don't personally like Mandy Moore, but she makes the most of this material. I don't really like Shane West either, but the two make a good pair. It's a pity that they couldn't have had something decent to work with.<br/><br/>
It is no doubt that teenage girls will eat up this kind of tripe. It's not their fault, they don't know any better. But, the lack of emotion is a real drag. A half and hour episode of MTV's Undressed has more emotion than all two hours of WALK. This film will be easily forgotten."

The character of Jamie played by Mandy Moore was what impressed me the most. Mandy Moore is a true actress! The character of Jamie was not just another sweet girl done wrong. Jamie was so alive in Mandy emotionally, that in certain parts of the movie I noticed emotions under the surface of Jamie that were almost subliminal, I never thought that someone could show indifference at the surface and hurt underneath the way Jamie does in some scenes.

She changes Landon's look towards her by being who she is.  He sees her beauty, outside and in, falls in love.  She wishes not for him to fall in love because something is wrong with her.

The 12- and 11-year-old girls I took to ""A Walk to Remember"" were visibly bothered by the salty language.  Good for them!<br/><br/>That said, the film was pretty well acted but as predictable as pimples on a teen.  Anyone with more than 10 years of moviegoing experience will see every plot twist telegraphed well in advance.  That did not deter about a third of the audience from weeping at well manipulated points.<br/><br/>I'd love to know the ""back story"" of this movie because it was obvious (from the date of safety inspection stickers on many cars) that it was filmed six years ago and then shelved.  Usually, that spells major trouble and a total lack of confidence on the part of the studio.  ""A Walk to Remember"" didn't seem to be that big of a mess to me.<br/><br/>I can see why many teens would revere this movie as inspirational.  As an adult, it is refreshing to see a teen film that is not glorifying negative stereotypes but celebrates positive values.  Go see this with your over-12 kid (if he or she will let you!) and then talk about its messages.  If you do, your ticket will be one excellent investment."

"someirishdude","10","0","0","2 February 2002"," Worth Remembering
","Don't believe the critics. Trust me. I almost did and I'm glad I didn't. A Walk to Remember is a wonderful movie. It's a movie with faults. It's a movie that probably could have been directed better. But while a flawless movie with no faults might win an Oscar, it might not entertain and touch you like ""A Walk to Remember"". Let me preface this by saying that although I have known tendencies to get into bubble gum pop, such as Britney Spears etc...I was not a fan of Mandy Moore. Nor did I think she was all that looks-wise either (at least prior to this film).  I decided to give this movie a try because the online feedback was truly compelling. I went to several different movie databases and the customer reviews were really persuasive.  I almost didn't go because just about every critic bashed the movie except Roger Ebert who gave it high marks. So, I decided to give it a try. The movie is set in a small town (Beaufort, NC). It begins predictably enough with the bad boy and pals bullying the commoners in the usual H.S. way. But the movie becomes very different from the She's All That, American Pie, type genre.  Mandy Moore is cast as the preacher's daughter, but instead of the usual portrayal of the ""preacher's kid"" we find a person very comfortable in her own skin, very devoted to God, and ernestly making progress towards her life goals (which include 'befriending someone I don't like"" and ""being in two places at once""). Landon Carter (Shane West) is being punished for some misdeeds and is forced to do community service, where he finds Jamie Sullivan (Moore) already there and obviously, she does this regularly. I won't go any further into this because I hate reviews that give away the whole movie. What I will say is that it's been a long long time since I saw a truly enjoyable movie that had such a positive message about life and love. I was amazed at how they showed how one person can make so much difference in the life of another.  If you are with your significant other, I guarantee that you will hold him/her a little bit tighter walking out of the theater In summation...it's a wonderful, feel good flick. It's got all of the sappy romance of the ""Wedding Singer"" with the emotion of a movie like ""Untamed Heart"". But in the end, it will make you reflect on who you are, what goals you have set ,  and how you will move towards living every day instead of passing time."

","So many movies about teens show the immature side of kids. But A Walk to Remember is about real people, with real problems and joys and sorrows, and love - the characters just happen to been teens. Mandy Moore was most impressive in taking over a roll and not coming off like a popstar making a movie. Though new at acting, Mandy was just incredible in the role of Jamie - convincing on every level. There are many more experienced actors and actresses that could take a lesson from Mandy on how to get into the persona of a character, as opposed to just playing themselves over and over in every movie. And the music - the AWTR CD is the best movie soundtrack I've ever heard. All the songs on it blend together so well, and the song ""Only Hope"" is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard. I expect we'll be seeing more of Mandy Moore the actress.

West: potential actor trapped with a lousy script that requires him to do stupid things and swear all the time... Person playing preacher: even with extremely stereotypical role, manages to squeeze a convincinfg performance confronting his daughter (This scene starts off embarassingly stupid). Rest of the cast: ""rapid-fire"" acting, as if they're trying to get. Even typical teenagers can crack so many one-liners in such a short period of time. And they're portrayed as if they spend 99% of the time goofing off or giving Lance and Jamie a hard time. Cardboard people. The second half of the movie is unbearable, since half of the lines blurted are ""I love you"", ""I love you too"", etc. That line was already beaten to death when it was most needed. The opening scene is already an embarrassment, I can't imagine anybody getting into such a stupid bet! The main character's ""punishment"" seems more like a punishment for people that would DIE for the job he got for a ""punishment"". The scene where Lance Carter ""discovers"" Jamie Sullivan, in a choir where only Mandy Moore seems to be singing. I guess you COULD see the movie for the songs, which saturates the screen as if the whole thing was a giant music video. I have to admit there is one great song that Moore sings just before kissing West...

Show me someone who didn't cry and I'll point out the lack of a heart. Granted it had it's flaws, but name a movie that doesn't. The movie followed the book over all, a treat for those of us who read the book. I laughed when times were good and I cried when they were bad, what more could I ask for. I've had some favorites in my time but this movie beats them all hands down. Such innocence in a young woman is rarely done right on the big screen. Makes you want to rush in and be there where all the activity is. Shane does an excellent job of portaying a young man who is uncertain with the world and shows that even the young are capable of such moments of clarity that it changes your world forever. If the critics don't like it so be it, not like I ever listen to them anyways. They're just people with hot air to blow on anything they can. Roger Ebert was right on the money with his review and I salute him for his good taste. If you haven't seen the movie yet I recommend you do it soon and often. I've seen it twice so far and have made plans to go back for more. I recently bought the book so that I could see the story in more detail from another angle. That was 2 days ago and it's already looking like I've had the copy for several years...can't put it down. I recommend this movie for all to see."

Mandy Moore holds her self in this movie with the style and grace of Audrey Hepburn. I also applaud the fact that she picked this type of movie to debut in, an intelligent role movie that requires acting skills instead of a no brainer like Cross Roads staring Ms. Spears. Mandy plays Jamie Sullivan a hermet like girl living in a small town that everyone wants to get out of, she keeps mainly to her self and her believes but is not shy when it comes to conversations or defending her self. She goes about her daily life until she mets up with Landon Carter (Shayne West) Forced to be around each other by circumstances beyond Landons control. After time spent together Landon begins to become influenced by Jamie and starts to realize what is important in life and what is not. Jamie also benefits from his influence and has a good time sharing there time together. This movie is so good and there are twists and turns here, that is why I don't want to ruin it.

Jamie is a Role Model for ALL ages for today and all times; someone we ALL can learn lessons about life from.  Shane West is wonderful as the troubled young man who thru the interaction, encouragement, inspiration, friendship and love of Jamie, learns to give unselfishly as Jamie does and learns what being a real friend means.  I can't say enough good about this GREAT movie.

This wonderful moving and touching movie has so many needed lessons for us ALL.  It even has Christian values in it, that are subtle and don't insult you, but are kind, caring, and gentle.  It has lessons for Teens and Adults about Peer Pressure and NOT going along with the crowd. IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS YEAR, make it ""A Walk To Remember"".

During the movie, you watch Landen transform into the good person he always was deep inside, but was too ""cool"" to show it. This movie can be corny, but not as often as you'd think, and plus, corny is good at times.

Moore just kept pulling me into her complex character. 'Jamie Sullivan' isn't the easiest character to play, especially for a first time actress (in a staring role), simply because Jamie reaches both high and low in one hour and forty minutes. A character of that range is a challenge for anyone.<br/><br/>Shane West also proved to make a great transformation from ""Once & Again"" to ""Remember"". West's Landon Carter experiences the same character changes as Jamie, yet in different ways. He manages to loose one personality and develop another completely.<br/><br/>All in all, ""A Walk To Remember"" was a great movie. I was pleased to see Moore take on such a complex character, especially for her first staring role. Moore's big screen potential shines through, West provides a decent love interest, and Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah make great supporting characters."

","""A Walk to Remember"" is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. This is such a change from the majority of teen movies out there because this one actually has meaning. I read the book about a month ago and loved it, so my friends and I went to see it Saturday night. It differs from the book in various ways, but I still loved the movie. By the end of the movie, there wasn't a girl with dry eyes in the entire theater! I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who loves love stories."
"DaveS-DicksonTN","10","0","0","29 January 2002"," GREAT Movie !
","One of the BEST movies I've ever seen ! Hollywood needs more inspirational movies like this one with innocent love, values, a good clean movie. Mandy Moore portrays the character of Jamie Sullivan to perfection and believability with a goodness and purity that moves you to tears time and time again.  She is a courageous, unselfish, giving, totally non-prejudicial, forgiving, loving wonderful person. Jamie thru devoting her time to unselfishly helping another person, suddenly finds herself in love, when she DOES have a Delightful effect on the young man and changes his life for the BETTER forever.  A wonderful love story with many lessons that we can ALL learn.  A great Date movie, or for the family, or just 2 friends, a church group, or even alone.  But, bring some tissue/kleenex, you will need it, more than once.  I didn't know who Mandy Moore was when I went to see this movie the FIRST time, but now I definitely do, and as Shane West's character Landon say, ""He can never forget her, or the image of her walking towards him (in the wedding)""  Jamie is SO SWEET and giving, you will never forget her.  Jamie's character is also religiously inspiring, a real ROLE MODEL for us ALL !  She is the kind of Role Model we need, NOT sports figures (all they do is make lots of money) This girl has VALUES and Character ! I will definitely have to buy this one on DVD and Video and add it to my collection! Don't miss this movie ! !"

The ""christian"" messages and themes are things everyone can apply to their lives, reguardless of their beliefs. Mandy Moore gives a great performance and has a future in acting.

","I walked out of the theater in tears. Mandy Moore (Jamie) and Shane West (Landon) were believable and authentic. Although Mandy isn't plain, she was convincing as a person of faith.<br/><br/>Teen pressure causes a young man to attempt a risk where he is injured. Landon is part of the group that pressures the teen who gets hurt. The principal thinks Landon is reachable, so doesn't throw him out of school, but gives him several public service tasks in order to try to reach him and to allow him to experience humility. It is while performing these tasks that he meets Jamie. Landon doesn't understand faith. Jamie has deep faith.<br/><br/>The teens have know each other since kindergarden. As their relationship develops, Jamie's faith in god and her belief that Landon has something special reaches Landon. His scepticism about life starts to melt away.<br/><br/>This is a special teen movie.<br/><br/>Other teen movies I've really enjoyed... 'Get Over It' and 'Bring It On'."

","This movie was absolutely WONDERFUL - but I would definitely recommend having some Kleenex with you! Me and my friends not only cried, but gave off waterworks! Shane West is perfect for the role of Landon Carter - just as I pictured him in the book - and Mandy Moore did a surprisingly good job, though she wasn't what I pictured for the role. The only things that bugged me were: a.) The movie is set in modern times and the book is in the 1950's. b.) Jamie was a bit more outspoken in the movie (I'm referring to closing the door in Landon's face as well as talking back to him). Other than those flaws (only two is really good), the movie was great. *Note to the men=Unless you're on a date (great date movie, plenty of room for cuddling), I wouldn't recommend it at all - they just complain it's a ""sappy romance"" but the previews make it kind of obvious that it's a romance. *Note to the women=GO SEE IT!

Overall, this movie was decent and had good music like New Radicals and such and such. Daryl Hannah was also good as the mother but looked nothing like Shane.

"dwbball50","2","2","5","22 February 2002"," If only it followed the book...
","I read the book A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks before I want to see the movie.  I am unfortunately disappointed with the movie because of its lack of direction in accordance with the book.  The movie left out a couple of key points that were in the book.  I thought Hollywood changed A Walk to Remember in order to fit the ""Hollywood"" status that movies have become today.  Is Hollywood to afraid to put the Bible in a movie that should have it in it?  Was Jaime's faith not important enough to really leave it out as they did.  They missed the mark on the movie dealing with the real meaning behind faith and salvation.  I also think they misinterpreted the character of Jaime for most of the movie.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book yet and go see the movie, you will probably really like it.  It is very entertaining and worth the viewing.  If you really want the whole story behind the characters, read the book because it is much more emotional, romantic, and developing than the movie.  I would just have to conclude with what I have emphasized earlier:  This is a great story that Hollywood missed the mark on and really ruined it all."
"joebondo","10","1","2","5 May 2016"," A movie to remember
","Growing up in the 80's, I realized that many romance movies (especially the tearjerkers) spawned from the 1970 movie that started it all, ""Love story."" Whenever I watched a 'love story' on the big screen, I always compared it to the original Love story movie. Looking back at Ryan O'Neal & Ali Mcgraws 'love story', I always thought their story was the pinnacle for all movies to follow. Last summer I viewed ""Me, Earl & the dying girl"" (not that great) another take on the original Love story but this one about friends. I have yet to see ""The fault in our stars"" but from what I read, just another take. I have seen many romance films throughout my years. A few months ago for the very first time I watched ""A walk to remember"" and it is a true masterpiece of the 'Love story' genre for ages to come. This film leaves an imprint on its viewers, almost mesmerizing! Unlike Ali Mcgraw's character, who is an atheist, in the original ""Love story"" film, Mandy Moore's character,Jamie Sullivan, is the polar opposite, a young woman who was brought up by her father with virtues, ethics, morals, a sense of responsibility and most importantly, a deep love and belief in GOD. Even though Jamie is deeply religious and strong in her beliefs, she isn't portrayed as a ""Jesus freak."" The positive effect (putting it lightly) that she has on Shane West's character of Landon Carter, is truly remarkable and something to behold, to cherish and remember. It goes to show just how important the people we associate with can have a profound effect on our lives. Landon wasn't necessarily hanging with a 'bad' crowd but rather some typical teens who try and look and act cool, maybe make fun of others who don't 'fit in' but they're definitely not bad people. No drugs, no gangs, etc. So when Landon gets a good dose of Jamie Sullivan, it rubs off on him, opens his eyes and makes him want to be the best person he can possibly be for not only himself but especially for Jaime. For the record, all the performances in the film were terrific, but I truly don't think anybody else could have nailed Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jaime Sullivan's character. As far as I'm concerned, Mandy Moore is the academy award winner for best actress in 2002!<br/><br/>The song Jaime sings during the school play, entitled ""Only hope"", was not only inspiring but indelible. Ironically there's a line in the song, ""I know now you're my only hope"", turns out to be exactly what Jaime was for Landon and Landon for Jaime. Being a father myself, I found the expression on Peter Coyote's (Jaime's father) face at the end of the porch swing scene (where Jaime receives a gift from Landon), absolutely priceless!<br/><br/>What a great film to display how the good of one person can affect the life of another forever. That's what this film is all about, and of course let's not forget the great love these 2 share. What made me love this film even more is the simple purity of the film. I haven't read the book, A walk to remember,(I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a copy) by Nicholas Sparks but from what I've read about the book, the movie is more contemporary to appeal to this generation but at the same time, the movie does something very unique for this day and age. It pretty much keeps the 2 main characters at arms lengths most of the film, a throwback to the books' time. And when we do see the 2 main characters engaged in a kiss, holding hands or hugging, or in one another's arms, it's all the more special. No sex, no drugs, no profanity, no Landon seeing someone on the side or vice versa. Such a warm, gentle and once again, most of all pure film, and it's truly amazing. I remember seeing the movie ""The Notebook"" and thinking to myself what a great love story. But after seeing A walk to remember, I will be hard pressed for the rest of my days to find a love story that truly captures pure magic the way it did between Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter."
"eden_obomeghie","9","1","2","2 November 2013"," For the Romantic in all of us.
","A Walk to Remember. A Walk to Remember is a teen movie for the ages based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. It goes beyond time and space, and it leaves the viewer in awe. This movie is more than words can define or expound. It captures the viewer where it counts, the heart. It yanks and it tugs until the viewer is left on the floor with a tub of ice-cream crying unashamedly. This movie is a masterpiece in its own right, not because of the acting, but because it is believable. It takes the plot of every new movie to a whole new level. It is a story of two North Carolina teenagers from different walks of life who are thrown together by the perils of life, and they fall in love. The love that they share is unending and undying. The love that they share is one that everyone wishes they could experience. It stars Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan, the preacher's daughter who is very reserved, and Shane West as Landon Carter, the popular boy with no specific plans for the future. The performance of Moore and West makes the movie much better and believable. It was developed on an $11 million budget and shot in thirty nine days, but it grossed over $12 million on its opening weekend. It was met with negative reviews by professional reviewers, Rotten Tomatoes called it ""a walk to forget"", but it received positive reviews by general viewers. The production time was short because it was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, at the same time that Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and the TV show Dawson's Creek were being filmed there. This movie spends all 101 minutes of airtime making the viewer believe in its characters. It helps the viewers sympathize with them, and it sheds a light on the struggles and the plight of every teenager. The tension between the young couple and society is one that most people have experienced. The entire movie makes the viewer believe that they are the characters. They viewers feel the pain and the hurt that Jamie feels as an outsider, and the viewer surely feel the weight of the love that Landon has for her. This movie prevails because it does not participate in the lackluster sex scene that most teen movies present to the audience, rather it portrays a wholesome teenager managing the commotion that is her life, and the man who loves. Many critics failed to understand that the point of the movie was not to make Jamie a real ""ugly duckling"", but a swan that does not care to spread her wings. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers cannot seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. This movie inspired many movies that came after it, movies like; The Notebook, The Vow, and Dear John. The climax of this movie occurs when Jamie dies; this is because it leaves the viewer in complete shock. But end of this movie is the highlight because it leaves the viewer wanting more. It leaves the viewer begging for a sequel or imagining an end. I personally love this movie because it makes me want a love that the two main character share. My favorite part is when Landon takes Jamie in-between state lines, and helps her fulfill her dream of being in two places at once. That scene struck a chord with me because it showed just how much he loved her. It sends a message that true love is possible at any age and it knows no bounds."

","I absolutely loved the movie! Yes i admit that i was about to stop watching when i first saw the beginning, but i was so lucky that i didn't. My heart was aching to know what was going to happen next. I couldn't stop watching. My sister thought i was weird because i didn't want to play with her. I was completely intrigued. The singing, the conflict, the scenery. I could go on, but the best part was how it ended. The ending didn't make me want to ask for a sequel. It made me feel like the movie was complete. Most films would just leave it abruptly and leave us wondering why? Why did it have to end there. They leave us on a cliff hanger every time. But not this one. It's special. It hit home. This is one of the best movie i have ever seen and trust me have have seen quite a few. This movie is beautiful and entices you. I don't how they did it but it did.

"miyliman-591-293722","8","1","2","6 April 2013"," A beautiful and innocent love story
","A walk to remember is a sweet innocent love story that is hard to come by in this era of cynicism and brainless teen movies such as American Pie and its numerous sequels. This movie is a small treasure and works not only on teenage audiences. I'm 34 and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I finished watching this.<br/><br/>What really sets this movie apart from many other teen movies, is its boldness in telling a traditional love story a la Romeo&Juliet. It shows how two young people from the opposite side of tracks fall for each other. And yes, this plot element is somewhat of cliché, but this movie gives it a different spin and actually manages to tell the story convincingly. The most important plot twist (I won't reveal it here)is also something we have seen before, but who cares when it's done believably and West and Moore give great performances.<br/><br/>The movie has some of the most romantic scenes I have seen in ages. I understand that some viewers will find them maudlin or even cheesy but I certainly didn't. Some moments in the movie seem almost magical, like the scene where Moore sings in the school play or where the lovers study the night sky together.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has been needlessly mauled by almost every critic (the late Roger Ebert being an exception, that man knew a good movie when he saw one) but appreciated by the audience. The audience has it right. Don't believe the overtly cynical reviews by critics and give the movie a chance. You will probably like it just as much as I did."

","I am a romantic by heart, and this movie I would have to say is THE best movie in the genre of romance I have ever seen. The story is clichéd but the execution is fantaaastic. It portrays a Utopian view of love. There is one great quote about love in the movie (watch it to hear it), and every word of it has divinity attached to it. If you are an emotional person, it will be an enjoyable roller coaster ride for you. I just fell in love with Jamie Sullivan(Mandy Moores) character and I believe anyone who watches the film would do likewise. Jamie is like a divine figure in the movie, like a haloed angel lighting up every scene (which is most part of the movie). The film also stands out because it stayed away from any physicality. Most of the romantic movies have passion and lust attached to some of the scenes which I must say are quite contrary what love is. In today's age where pure, eternal love is elusive and promiscuity in the name of love is being practice blurring its meaning, this movie shows us glimpses of what love is about. Although Shane West's character knows that Jamie is going to die, he marries her, living a lifetime of happily married life in a summer where people spend years living together devoid of love. I would recommend this movie to everyone, go watch-out with your family, with your girlfriend or wife. I am damn sure you won't rue having watched it."

"jordan_p09","10","1","2","8 October 2009"," brief summary of the movie, and my personal opinion
","Love Your Enemies<br/><br/>A Walk to Remember, filmed in 2002, is a heart warming story between two teenagers, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West), who find each other and battle the road of love as they struggle with acceptance, strength, courage, and hope for one another. Jamie, a young quite girl with a strong heart for God, fights for her life as she struggles with leukemia. Determined to fulfill her biggest dreams before she dies, she works hard everyday to take care of her father, Revered Sullivan (Peter Coyote), do well in school, and complete a list of things she has planned for her life. On the other hand, Landon is the complete opposite. Part of the popular crowd, Landon tries his best to fit in and be cool with his friends as he shuts his family out of his life. After encountering some trouble at school, Landon's parents and principal believe that he needs to fill his free time with some better activities which leads him to a punishment of being part of their high school annual school play, therefore creating a common bond between Jamie and Landon. While Jamie plays the main character and shows strong understanding to her script, Landon tends to struggle to remember his lines. In an act of desperation, he ask Jamie for her help in which eventually bring the two together in ways that we wouldn't think possible. As they put their differences aside, the two see the positive influences of one another and fall head over heels in love.<br/><br/>I believe that the director Adam Shankman, brings the idea of acceptance into this film. He is reaching out to show that even though two people may have completely different lives, views, or values on things, there may always be that one common bond which brings a pair together. As we watch Jamie struggle with her leukemia, we also see Landon as he learns what's important to him though the eyes of Jamie fighting for her life. <br/><br/>To me the most important part of the movie is at the end when Landon goes by Reverend Sullivan's house to return Jamie's poem book. This is a symbol in the movie of how Landon had changed and the impact that Jamie had left on his heart. As he moved forward in his life, he showed the drastic changes he made to become a better person than the bully he was in high school. The love he had formed for Jamie had done more then make him smile -- it created a whole new person who succeeded in his future as he completed his own list of life expectations in which he planned for himself."

I think the music has added a lot to the movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone. It can also be watched by a family or younger kids. This movie shows you that you don't have to have sex and violence in a movie for it to be good.<br/><br/>Watch this movie - it is worth your time."

Shane West,born to be wild kinda boy before, learns the conscience of a well spiritual being after he met Mandy.He faced all the extraordinary obstacles and attain his pure nirvana (their marriage). Their chemistry meets so well that will just makes you cry your heart out with satisfaction and thats the best part of the movie.

","This film deserves more credit than its given. The performances by Shane West and Mandy Moore are fantastic. Their acting really makes you believe in what's going on.<br/><br/>The story is so moving that in many places it brings tears to your face. Its based of a novel by Nicolas Sparks, who also wrote the book in which the film The Notebook is based on. A Walk To Remember is a story about a love which survives many challenges, but is brought to a tragic end. <br/><br/>The songs in this film are exceptional. Mandy Moore puts her amazing voice to a good use and makes the film come to life."

","The first time I ever saw this movie totally surprised me. I wanted to see it on the big screen but wasn't able to so when it came out on DVD, I went to rent it. What a surprise. I've watched Mandy Moore being a spoiled brat in The Princess Diaries before this movie so I didn't expect to see her as a different character. As the movie progressed to where Jamie performs in the play and transforms her image, I was thinking that she would change her looks and dress like her character in the play, boy was I wrong. You would also think that at some point of the rest of the film, she would dress up but the character of Jamie stayed true to herself. Also Shane West's character Landon was a pleasure to watch as his character transforms and he falls in love with Jamie. Their chemistry is so amazing. I've watched this movie numerous times and I still love it. The morals of the movie is so uplifting and refreshing to see compared to other teen movies. A good friend of mine doesn't like the acting in this movie but I totally disagree. I cannot see any other actors playing the roles of Jamie and Landon but Mandy and Shane. It's always nice to hear people seeing this movie by chance and being totally surprised and loving the movie. This is my absolute favorite movie of all time."
"Ms-M-Johnson","10","1","2","16 June 2007"," Great Movie - A timeless story
","One of my favorite love stories. It is possible to find true love in the strangest places as experienced by the characters in this film. I saw this movie when it first came up and didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. Movies like this often go under the radar and don't get enough credit. Though similar stories have been told in the past, I'm sure, this one seems fresh and up to date for this generation.<br/><br/>A definite must see especially for those of you who have almost given up hope. Good for anyone - students, bible study groups, couples, friends, those looking for love, etc. Rent or buy it (I own it) soon.<br/><br/>Great soundtrack as well. Mandy Moore sings many of the titles as well as Switchfoot and a few others. I'd also recommend ""Where the Heart Is"" featuring Natalie Portman. Another uplifting story that complements A Walk to Remember."

","I can't remember how I felt the first time I saw it on DVD in 2002. I was totally surprised and blew away after the second time I watched it. I couldn't believe such a simple love story could touch my heart so deep down inside! The movie was not released in China and I've never thought it would, so I went to HK Records to buy the movie and soundtrack in early 2003. I just want to keep it for years to come. In the years afterwords, I watch it every chance I can and never get bored. I always watch it alone and try to find something new from the movie, and I did. I frequently go to IMDb message board to see comments from people all over the world and figure out how people see it from different angles. Despite some negative comments, I don't mind I am the only person in the world who love this movie, I am glad that so many people like it and I'm not alone. My love to the movie remains as fresh as 5 years ago. Shane West is my favorite actor even if he just did this one movie!"

","Well Im 23, male and have never seen, or even wanted to see a movie staring a pop star. Always found myself changing the radio whenever Mandy Moore, Britney etc began to sing. It was late one night, 2 am and I was just finishing up my studying and about to go to bed when this movie came on super station, so I decided it would be a good choice to fall asleep too, why not? It started off with all the ingredients for another hackneyed teenie movie but as the plot progressed it became so much more than that. Lo and behold I found myself staying up until the wee hours of the morning just to see what happened next.<br/><br/>The entire time I found myself becoming more and more intrigued with Jamie. This is the kind of girl you want to marry. Anyways Im not gonna go over the plot as there's hundreds of posts that have already done that, but do not mistake this for a regular teen movie. There's no comedy, sex, and plot which revolves around and culminates in the prom dance. I usually don't like love stories either, movies I watch include Scarface, Boondock Saints, 7 Samurai, Good bad + Ugly, Yojimbo... well you get the point.<br/><br/>Anyways Im going out today to buy the movie so I can watch it again and see the scenes that super station always cuts out. I feel almost embarrassed doing it and actually posting about this but this is the kind of movie that leaves you with a lot to think about afterwords."

","Well what can i say, this movie was good, but disappointing. I didn't actually think they were in love and i didn't really see he cared for her. I read the book before i watch the movie, and fell in love with the book the minute i read it. After watching the movie shortly after, i was disappointed. I have the DVD and watch it multiply times to see if i can figure a way to think it's good, but to me it's disappointing. Nothing they do shows that they really care for each other. Unlike the Notebook which i read and didn't like i thought the movie was great understanding and had some scenes from the book. This did not. For example, the writing was badly written(for the play). didn't they know this movie takes place in 1958 not 2002? and didn't they know that Landon and Jamie had more moments, and more sad moments. Didn't they know that Jamie asked him about the grave yard and she didn't go. and she didn't have a list. I was disappointed that's all. I wanted the movie to be similar to the book. The movie didn't make me cry but the book, sure did."
"lexi_rae9392","10","1","2","8 April 2007"," A Walk to Remember--Your Guilty Pleasure
","I just watched this movie the other day and all i could think while watching it was ""this is so cliché"". There is the usual nerdy girl- Jamie Sullivan (played by Moore) and the hot, egotistical popular bad ass- Landon Carter (played by West). At first he looks down upon her and then, magically falls in love with her defending their relationship against his friends.Yeah, like that will ever happen.<br/><br/>And yet, I still fell in love with the movie despite its predictability. The plot is interesting, although i felt like i was watching a daytime soap opera and any minute she was going to overlook her views of abstinence (this is before i knew that they were going to get married!) and get pregnant before she died of leukemia.<br/><br/>Jamie teaches Landon about faith and love, and you practically fall in love with Landon as he goes the extra mile to impress her by fulfilling some of her goals on a list of things to do before she dies. However, Landon doesn't realize how soon that will come. As they delve deeper into their relationship with some heartwarming, sappy scenes of flirt and dating, Landon finds out that Jamie doesn't have long to live since she has leukemia (i knew this was too good to be true). Then, he tries to make the time he has left with her priceless, and, you guessed it, he romantically proposes to her and they marry. And of course she just had to die, the movie just wouldn't work if she didn't. <br/><br/>After watching it I looked up the songs and bought them on iTunes. They are very relevant to the story, and whoever picked the actors did a great job. They were perfect for their roles and i wouldn't be surprised if they ended up dating after the movie. I would definitely watch this movie again...and i do admit that i cried at the end when the older Landon says ""Our love is like the wind. I can't see it, but i can feel it."" This movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure with its corny sappy lines that make you wish you were in the movie, and of course you cant get over Shane West and Mandy Moore! If this sounds like your type of movie than i suggest you see it. I know i cant wait to see it again and read the book!"
"film-critic","5","1","2","24 March 2007"," A Walk through the Spiritual Woods sans Bill Bryson
","Is love an instantaneous combustion? Can two nobodies, living at opposite ends of the social Earth, suddenly fall in love, change their lives, and live a happy co-existence together (well, not forever in this movie  but you get my drift)? This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery  this time it was called ""A Walk to Remember"". An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, cliché bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore). As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together. Sparks fly? Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally  through Hollywood magic fall in love. What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments. As I mentioned in my review for ""The Notebook"", one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.<br/><br/>I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale. I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before. With ""A Walk to Remember"", I was not impressed or surprised. Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films. There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom. Gasp! Did he say that? Yep, I was bored with this film. The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen. Alas, nothing  I repeat  nothing of the sort occurred. From the cliché play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, ""A Walk to Remember"" proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab. Why is this? Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)? Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry? Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks. It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.<br/><br/>As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention. Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this ""gig"" mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role. I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting. The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film. I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss  as only you could find in Sparks' story. He fit the mold of what this film represented. He was a father  one that nearly anyone could relate to. There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish ""popular"" behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe. How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier? While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad. I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet. Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut  language and nudity  to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film. Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a ""religious"" film, but instead, a film about faith. I didn't see that. Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought. Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind. I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.<br/><br/>Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- ""A Walk to Remember"" could be the result.<br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"
"Lark_Pash","8","1","2","23 March 2007"," Sweetest Book and Movie
","When I first saw this movie several years ago I didn't enjoy it. I had just finished reading the book several days before and some of the storyline was changed. For one, the book is set back in the 60's? (If I am recalling correctly) When I watched this movie again it became an instant favorite. I thought the quality of the filming was not as good as it could have been and it seemed like it was made on a cheap budget. Besides those factors, this movie is a tear dripper and one that makes you want to jump into the screen and hug the characters when they are having hard times. It's unlike other teenage movies and if you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, you know all of his books are unlike any other. This film makes you want to do everything on your ""to do"" list and to tell everyone you care for that you love them. It proves that you can be the same person as you have always been before, maybe even stronger, when you are faced with a terminal illness."
"sasquatch_77","8","1","2","1 March 2007"," Great movie of faith and perseverance!
","This movie was directed by Adam Shankman, and takes place in a typical high school setting. However unlike the setting there is one character that stands out from the others; her name is Jamie Sullivan played by Mandy Moore. To name a few reasons, she is the only daughter of the reverend Sullivan who loves his daughter and wants the best for her. Jamie is a plain dressed eighteen year old in her senior year at high school diagnosed with Lukemia. Quietly making the decision to move on, she involves herself in plays and extra curricular activities at school. She also volunteers at another school tutoring lids, spending time with them working patiently and adamantly. Confident in her abilities and content at her position in her life she then meets Landon Carter played by Shane West. Landon Carter is a complete opposite of Jamie. He is one of the ""In Crowd""- the crowd which every student wants to be associated with. Just to be able to walk with the crowd makes the student cool in there eyes through acceptance in others by association. Unlike Jamie, Landon drives a nice car and doesn't care about others. Landon is apathetic about the future and cares not for anyone below his level of society. When Landon is forced to do community service at school, he runs into Jamie. They each have two very different lives and yet the same misunderstandings about each other. All throughout the movie they are confronted with each ones' personalities and differences. On of the punishments of Landon's for trespassing and underage drinking is to be a part of the school play, and before he knows it he is cast as the lead character in the play along with Jamie. In the play Jamie is Landon's mysterious stranger, who before his very eyes becomes his joyful angel and his passion. With a scripted kiss, Landon realizes that Jamie is no longer an insignificant nobody, but someone worth getting to know. With new clarity Landon sees others as Jamie has always seen them, as other people living the same life as he does: the same likes and dislikes, the same struggles and goals, plus the poisoning of the ""In Crowd"" and its affect on others.<br/><br/>The turn of Landon's life around the corner of ignorance was Jamie Sullivan in all her quiet Christ-like persistence and faith. What he could call his friends in the past could not compare to his new found friendship with Jamie. Unlike before, Landon can be himself. Around Jamie, Landon is set free.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is the changing for the better Landon's life and the obstacles of high school. Ironically the title is about Jamie's faith and walk through life setting an example for others. Jamie quoted ""Without suffering there would be no compassion"", explaining to Landon her faith and reasoning. Throughout the movie, shots of Landon started off being above in and out shots, noting him as one of the big dogs at school. As the movie progressed the shots became more and more lowered showing himself lowered in his own eyes. The in and out shots focused on Jamie were usually close up and intimate outlining her facial expressions and reactions to each scene. Natural light was used to warm the scenes and give them a realistic effect, and spotlights along with stage lighting were used for the play scene and shots setting aside the play and marking it apart from the movie for effect. I like this movie for it's character and it's story of faith and change in one's life. This movie speaks to me of heart and hope... hope that there is more out there and that through other we can be strengthened and lifted up when we ourselves can't see past our own faults."
"Bizarretemper","10","1","2","23 February 2007"," A Walk To Remember
","Adam Shankman is the director of the movie, A Walk to Remember. It is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. There are two major actors and actresses. Jamie Sullivan, who is played by Mandy Moore, is an outsider, who has Leukemia. Landon Carter, played by Shane West, isn't too friendly towards her. He is one of the most popular kids in High School and is also constantly in trouble. Landon's careless attitude leads him towards the path of Jamie. Faith brings these two people together to save each others lives. This movie is so touching; it will make an impact in your life along with changing your view of life. <br/><br/>Is there a movie you want to see that is unique and touching? Go and rent the movie, A Walk to Remember. This is an excellent movie to recommend to anyone. In this movie a viewer will notice the outstanding performances of the actors and actress, the cinematography and the music. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is magnificent. Everyone in this film finds a way to touch the viewer's heart. Shane West starts out as a schmuck then transforms to a gentleman, and does it perfectly. Furthermore, he pulls off the double life between his friends and Jamie and him. When Landon's two worlds clashes, he stays with Jamie leaving his friends to back stab him. Mandy Moore does not lead on that her character has cancer. Jamie is an outsider but she doesn't fit into the same crowd as Landon and prefers to spend her time enhancing the lives of others instead of partying. Also, she lived everyday to the fullest. Being alone does not bother her.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is phenomenal. Before faith brings Jamie and Landon together, Jamie is always wearing pale colors. Half way through the movie, Jamie wears a bluish grayish sweater until Landon buys her a pink sweater. There is a warm and lovely look to the small town of Beauport, North Carolina. The images are never lacking in sharpness. In this movie there are exterior and interior scenes. The exterior scenes look thoroughly gorgeous and really give the viewer the sense that they are right in the middle of the action. The interior scenes seem softer. It appears that Jamie looks paler then rest of the cast. When each scene ends, it will fade through the back to start the new shot, making it look like a black screen.<br/><br/>The sound track was excellent. At the beginning of the movie, the music is very suspenseful. Immediately, the viewer knows something is going on. Each dramatic scene starts with up-beat music. For instance, Monday morning at school exciting music and it is catchy. Some of the music matches marvelously with the scenes. In the shot of Jamie talking to Landon on the bus, the music comes to make sense later on. Once that song gets louder the viewer hears ""all the things you try to do, throwing your life away"" is hinting towards how Landon is living his life. The most touching and unforgettable music came at the end. It just added to the sorrow of the scene. In addition, the music does not overpower the movie. Adam Shankman used the right amount of music.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is worth watching. Shane West's and Mandy Moore's performances were exquisite. Meanwhile at the same time, the cinematography was beyond compare. Alongside with that the music added to it. None of these were lacking in any means. This movie will be an instant favorite for romantically hopeless people."
"desperado5598","10","1","2","24 January 2007"," Why u should see this movie...
","I'm a sucker for sad movies and this is one of the best. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, its not for you. Jamie is the school's laughing stock. On the weekends she tutors kids, works on science fair projects, and hangs around at home with her dad. She doesn't care what people think about her though, and is really into reading the Bible (her dad's a pastor). Landon is one of the most popular people in school-also one of the most common people to pick on Jamie, but when he's reported drinking on school property, he's subjected to community service and the school's upcoming play, which Jamie is pretty involved with also. Landon stinks at acting and Jamie is the drama club's pride and joy, so Landon decides that she can secretly help him. She agrees as long as he promises not to fall in love with her. Of course, this gets a laugh out of him. Well as you may imagine they fall in love anyway... Then tragedy strikes. Landon discovers a secret that Jamie's been hiding from everyone for years.<br/><br/>If you see the movie and absolutely LOVE it, then you HAVE TO READ THE BOOK. No matter how good this movie is, the over-used stereotype that the book is always better than the movie, is true for this too! Except this time the book is FIVE times better. BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE TOO!!!!"

What perfects this movie is the actors great performances, the great settings, the script, the music - everything about this movie was great. I can't describe it, but the movie triggered sort of a sorry/weird feeling inside of me that I have never experienced before - a very new perspective on life, a beautiful perspective on life. One can say safely say that I fell in love with Mandy Moore's character and it's sad, but I don't believe that you can find girls like that in the real world. I haven't actually read the novel - but if it's anything like the movie, it must be a best seller. A definite recommendation from me to anyone who hasn't seen this movie!

"robert_nickel","10","1","2","29 December 2006"," One of my favorite movies of all time
","It's so refreshing to see Christian characters who aren't the bad guys. Besides Ned Flanders, Jamie Sullivan is about it. Recently, I grabbed this movie on Tivo for my wife, who'd never seen it. She was so ready to hate it because it got panned by the critics, and during the opening scene made several comments like, ""I don't think I'm going to like this."" The movie gradually won her over. By the time Jamie sang ""Only Hope"" (her song during the school play), she was hooked. So often, good movies have nothing to say, and movies with something to say aren't very good... This movie is that rarest of exceptions, managing both. For anyone who believes that there is such a thing as redemption, that even unlovable people have value, and that faith has power, this movie is a must see."

"clairebear081","10","1","2","17 November 2006"," NOT the same old story.
","Here's the thing I don't understand. You know, opinions are opinions, to each his own. But at very least, I'd like to know how you people can group this movie in with ""teen flicks"" or ""chick flicks"". Trust me, I hate sappy teen flicks pretty much with passion, and this is my favorite movie of all time. Maybe your idea of these kinds of movies is different than mine, but to me, chick/teen flicks usually consist of things like sex, a desperation to be popular, changing oneself to fit a mold, crazy drunken parties, the skanky popular girls, the jocky football players, the nerds who'd do anything to be/date them, oh and a little more sex if there's time. All set up with a backdrop of a cute little California high school where everyone knows their place on the social ladder and in the end, it's all about how the unpopular finally defeated the popular. You know, stuff like that. Maybe you'll laugh a little, but you end up walking away with nothing more than some funny(ish) quotes and the same old story. I have several movies in mind now that I've said all this, don't you? OK. now...moving on to AWTR. Let me just say...NOT the same old story. Whoever tells you that it is wasn't quite paying attention, either that or their mind just doesn't work with the ideas that come across in this movie. (In less nice terms, they're shallow and don't think about things much.) Read the book first, really liked it, so of course my next step was to see the movie. Since I knew the story already, I wasn't expecting (I really couldn't) the whole overused cheesy ""sappy teen flick"" thing. I'll admit then when the beginning music started up and I started seeing people getting out of their cars I was confused. Wasn't this like 1958? But it the movie version it's not, and it didn't take away from the story at all. If anything it made it more relatable, seeing modern day teenagers in situations that are honest, realistic (if you disagree, go watch Mean Girls or She's All That and compare them to this) and very moving. Very.<br/><br/>Don't, PLEASE don't make the mistake of ignoring this movie because of Mandy Moore. Jamie Sullivan is easily my favorite movie character of all time, just because of who she is. And guess what? It never changes. Never once does she come close to even wanting to change who she is for anybody else. Instead it's pretty much the opposite. She changes them, without even trying. Even as the ""plain Jane"" she is so beautiful. This character just grabs your heart and holds on. Watching her is just incredible...I wish I could describe how amazing she makes this movie experience the way some of the reviewers on here have. Trust us- she is just amazing.<br/><br/>Landon's transition is also amazing to watch. I mean..ahh, I can't even describe it in a way that does it justice. Just watching the people, the emotions in their eyes, the tears, the joy, being overwhelmed, everything like that...you feel it, and you believe it. You just do. It's nothing I can really describe perfectly, or make you grasp unless you watch it for yourself.<br/><br/>Yes, there's Christianity in this movie. But whether you believe or not (and I know some nonbelievers who absolutely love this movie), the idea that it's possible for someone's entire life to change by being exposed to faith when they least expected it, can and definitely does affect anyone, as I have personally seen.<br/><br/>As for me...you know what? Never in my life has a movie affected me like this, it just hasn't. It doesn't matter if some people don't believe me when I say it...it's made me want to change. It's that believable. I won't give anything away obviously (duh), but it brings about things that you will not expect. Maybe this movie is in a way, like Jamie Sullivan herself...you think you know what it's all about, but once you really understand it, it will change everything for you, and it's quite possible you'll fall in love."

","I've watched this movie a billion times and every single time, I learn something new. This movie will touch your soul. Im absolutely in love with this movie and the characters.I have to say, I did not like Mandy Moore, but this movie proved me wrong. She is a very talented actress along with Shane West. She portrays the faith within Jamie and the faith that came out of Landon. <br/><br/>MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think this movie is SO wonderful because the music ties in with all the scenes. Especially sad when Landon goes to see his dad.<br/><br/>BTW-this is not a typical teen movie. Watching this makes you wanna just fall in love and have faith. I own the book, soundtrack and movie. It's crazy but I watch it everyday and it never fails to disappoint me. Also, I love switchfoot! Amazing music, amazing talent, amazing people, amazing quotes, amazing movie period. I totally recommend it for those who want to see a brighter side of life, love, and faith."
"lolly_helena","9","1","2","18 August 2006"," Good...but it lacks a pinch of surprise
","To my mind this is a wonderful story about two teenagers that find love in the most unexpected way,and in the meantime they learn important facts about life...and death...and the true power of their feelings. It is one of my favorite movies, but i must say that it lacks something...many can actually tell what is going to happen next. If you are in the mood for a romantic movie, this is the one you should see. It is an unusual movie concerning the fact that we live in a modern world that does not believe any longer in God, love or the necessity of helping others. Jamie is the perfect girl, although she is ill and i think that we all have something to learn from her. Maby we can actually find a little part of her in ourselves."

","I watched this movie about a week ago. I had read the book a week earlier, and I thought the movie portrayed the novel accurately. This movie was very emotional. I admit I rarely cry while watching a movie, but for this movie I cried. The movie did follow the plot line of the book, yet there were variations. Because I read the novel before watching the movie, I found myself referring back to the book when a particular scene seemed to deter from the book.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether it followed the novel exactly or not, I enjoyed the movie immensely. I would suggest this movie for anyone who wants to experience a night filled with emotions, this movie will do the job."
"supergloo","9","1","2","25 July 2006"," So sweet, and so very, very sad. I love it!
","This movie really pushes your emotions. You'll hate what a jerk Landon (West) is at first. You'll empathize with Jamie (Moore) and how she doesn't fit in, especially when she's slandered. You'll be joyful when they're finally together and realize they love each other. You'll cry when you find out about Jamie's illness. It really is a great, romantic chick flick, but I know guys could appreciate it, too. Well, some of them, anyway. The only problems I have with it are the departures from the book. I mean, the book takes place in the '40s, but the teens are in '90s gear. And Jamie is really supposed to be plain until the play. I guess you don't sell movies without beautiful people. I guess you can't make Mandy Moore plain. My biggest complaint has got to be the fact that the title of the movie isn't explained in the movie like it is in the book. The walk is when Jamie is walking down the aisle at her wedding and she can barely walk she's so weak. The wedding was really just brushed over in the movie. But all-in-all, I just love this movie. If you haven't seen it, go see it."
"gmajlat","10","1","2","24 July 2006"," Heart warming story- must see
","This story is about teens but the way it is presented, it doesn't target any particular audience. I am 37 and male and I enjoyed the movie. The characters were very nicely written and interacted with each other seamlessly. This is a must see but be careful its a real tear jerker. Mandy Moore proves that she is more than a pop singer. Her looks were very much downplayed in the movie which caught my attention in letting you concentrate on the character as opposed to teen sex. Which I may add there is none of. Also there are no curse words no inappropriate scenes, nothing like that at all. A true family movie that isn't a cartoon."

","To me I thought the movie was great! It really touched my heart. It also broke my heart because the things I saw in that movie are still true today. Kids can be very cruel, and do things that can scar a person for life. This movie has brought back memories for me when I was in high school and middle school. I was a joke, and the popular kids made it worse for me everyday. And they took the liberty of letting me know that I was an outsider and that I was not good enough. If only they could see how life is so beautiful and precious that they shouldn't waste it on being so mean to others. Still till this day people are the same... the movie was beautiful and I hope it showed and touched people like it has touched me. Just because someone is not up to date and showing there body off or because they like to learn how the world goes round doesn't mean that they should be pushed aside. The movie gave me hope that one day I can end my sadness and there is a beautiful person out there that can accept me for who I am."
"inicola2","10","1","2","17 February 2006"," The bravest plot in a long long long time
","I remember seeing this movie in the theaters several times. As I get older the exact number I am not sure of. At least 3, maybe more. I love the chemistry between the primary actor Shane West and actress Mandy Amanda Moore. You can feel the angst and yearning of two young people growing up. While Jaime Sullivan knows the leukemia will not permit a normal life, that is not an excuse for her to be someone less than who she is. Her pleasant maturity and grace is so refreshing and sincere that I can never forget it. That the plot was based on a great short novel that was based on a real life character simply blows me away, Danielle Sparks just wanted to be able to grow up and get married. In the atmosphere of American culture today you would find that nearly ludicrous for anyone to admit, yet Jaime has no problems admitting this to Landon because ""she sees something good"". There is the power of developing/valuing another soul in the movie, of faith in God that is genuine and vibrant. I see myself growing up and finding a young man who actually loved me for who I was. And I bought the DVD and watched every single permutation of the film until it made my family ill. I pray for Mandy Every single day. Because anyone who can act and sing like that needs to be in the arts, I sincerely hope that she stays in films and acts on Broadway. I think this film renewed my faith in humanity.<br/><br/>Irma"
"sari_tb","9","1","2","4 February 2006"," Very good!
","This movie was surprisingly good. I thought it would be a teenage movie (I'm 26...) but it really is great for everybody. I don't know anything about Mandy Moore except she sings, but now I know she can act, too. Anyway, this movie was very good. Jamie (Mandy) is a daughter of a ""priest"" who falls in love with Landon (Shane), ""the bad boy"", after they start learning an act together. This movie was beautiful and heartfelt, deep. Towards the end you find out that she has a leukemia which she dies from in the end after she gets married to Landon. The reason I gave 9 stars out of 10 is because of the sad ending (otherwise 10 stars). And the last 30 minutes of the movie really keeps your eyes wet, at least mine, and I don't cry that easy. Well, you just have to see this movie if you like to reach out for tissues."
"great_humour","8","1","2","30 December 2005"," Not what you would expect coming from a teen film
","When I first watched 'A Walk to Remember' I never thought it would be so wonderfully created. Adam Shankman directed such a fine group of cast members that made this film terrific. Shane West and Mandy Moore had enormous chemistry in their characters and produced qualities to each other that most teenage couples would not experience let alone fall in love in such a way that the love can only be shown as of adult perspectives. I found that Landon and Jamie have a unique bond that goes beyond all circumstances, without the cliché of teenage boyfriend/girlfriend lovey dovey. My perspective on this film really gave me a sense of hope and long lasting appreciation that couples like these two characters can come together with different backgrounds and who both are in different worlds can fight for their love to be together, really shows the true meaning of everlasting bond. The film has impacted me in so many levels that I would not describe the emotions I was feeling when I was watching it. It's one of my favourite films to watch that I would really watch over and over again. 'A Walk to Remember' is what any viewer should experience watching because it will give you love, laughter, sadness and most of all the intense build-up of these characters that are shown from beginning to end."

","A walk to remember is an excellent movie, it is about a girl who has faith in its purest form, about a girl who believes, who knows what her priorities are and she makes you feel like world surely does have good people left in it. A sad ending movie, but still every time i see it, it makes me feel better. It is one of those movies which empower you, if you try to learn something out of 'a walk to remember' you will certainly learn a lot. Having seen the movie dozens of time and after reading the novel too, my opinion is that it is a very sweet, inspiring and romantic movie, it surely makes me happy every time I see it.The character of Landon Carter comes off very well. Surely his acting skills are excellent but it is Jamie which actually wins your heart. The change in Landon and the trust he then shows in Jamie is commendable. The songs are good too. One of the songs that is 'Only hope'is very beautifully done, in fact the whole play sequence is nice. One can say that the characters are very well framed.Though the book and the movie are quite different still the emotions are as strong as they were in the book! Surely a remarkable movie and no doubt my best!"

"richardcoppage","7","1","2","2 December 2005"," Love hurts...in so many ways
","A Walk to Remember....I remember this one. I saw it about 3 years ago, when it came on HBO. I was surprised at how good it was. It's about a teenage girl named Jamie(Mandy Moore) who is the nerdy kid at high school. Landon (Shane West)gets into trouble, and has to do community service to make up for the mess he got in to. Also, he is chosen as the lead role in the school play, Jamie in the play also. So..this is where the movie ""jumps"" off. The two get to know each other, and guess what! THEY FALL IN LOVE! Who knew?! After all the name calling, teasing, and ""you've had the same sweater since middle school"" picking, Landon starts to see Jamie in a new light. Worse comes to worse, when Jamie's father sees her with Landon. Jamie's father is a minster and doesn't approve of the ""new"" boyfriend. This movie is a must see in my case. It isn't the best love story of all time, but it is a good movie. It's a sad one too...get ready to cry ladies."
"CC1966","6","1","2","1 December 2005"," a sweet little film with a few big flaws
","Okay, everyone's got a right to their opinions, and when it comes to this movie people either seem to love it or hate it. I suppose I'd be in the middle to lower end of the ""love it"" category, as this wasn't really aiming to entertain a woman in her late 30's.<br/><br/>I suppose one of my bigger beefs with this movie is that I'm not sure who gave the young African American man(Eric) the go-ahead to play his character as an oversexed, hip hop homeboy. He's like one of a handful of minorities in a small predominantly white town...not saying he needs to act like Carlton Banks from the ""Fresh Prince"" show, but as an African American woman who grew up in a similarly small town, it was kind of embarrassing to see him acting out that way.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to make this a big racial statement; actually, it's more to the contrary. Not all of us who grew up in those circumstances turned out to be one extreme or the other-we just found somewhere that was comfortable in the middle. I mean, come on...the kid's name was ERIC for crying out loud! Was he over compensating for not having a more ethnically oriented name? The only time that I witnessed Eric as more as an honestly portrayed teen and less as an ethnic caricature was toward the end when he and Landon were having heart to heart chat by that lake in back of Landon's house.<br/><br/>Granted, guys his age are little more than totally raging hormones walking upright in society, but he seemed to be embarrassingly over the top compared to the other guys. It made me cringe.<br/><br/>And as for the play-within-the-movie...shouldn't the dialogue even remotely have made sense? There were times that it did, but then you were just like, ""What is Landon talking about?"" And what was up with the cloak on the ""mysterious female singer"" Jamie was portraying...was that cloak supposed to add that element of mystery? It just felt like the movie was trying too hard to accomplish something and ended up basically killing time to set up for the beautiful song that Jamie sings.<br/><br/>Again, remember these are comments made by a woman who is nearly old enough to be the mother of the target of this movie's audience, so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt. But truthfully, as I turn up my Switchfoot CD and reminisce, ""A Walk to Remember"" makes it in under the wire as one of my favorite celluloid romances."

","A Walk to Remember is one of the most very good romantic movies I've seen. Its story is like Final Fantasy VIII's when Squall's cold heart had been softened by the angelic young woman, Rinoa Heartilly and then they end up falling for each other.<br/><br/>A Walk to Remembr's plot is really amazing. Landon(Shane West) got in trouble and then he has to do a certain amount of good deeds to make up for it. Which includes participating in the school play where he's working with Jamie(Mandy Moore). With his frantic troubles, Landon started to lose faith, and that faith is what Jamie has. She's the daughter of a minister after all. Soon, the two started to fall for each other. But the plot comes to a twist when Jamie tells Landon not to fall in love with her, and when she tells him she was sick. She has Lukemia.<br/><br/>I swear, when Jamie said she has Lukemia, I think I cried. I think that was the most dramatic moment of the movie. Anyways, I recommend you guys to see this movie.

","A Walk to Remember is without a doubt one of the best romantic dramas of all time. I will admit, that although sometimes the lines can be perceived as a little 'dry', it adds to the character of the film. Mandy Moore and the gorgeous Shane West really highlight that teen romances do happen, and despite differences, do flourish, which enables the film to provide an inspiration and hope for all. Although initially the film appears to be aimed at a 'teen audience', the film provides something for everybody and can be enjoyed by all. I would definitely recommend this film. Some might say that films such as 'crossroads' (Britney Spears), is a far better film. However, although 'crossroads' is a pretty good film in itself, for me, AWTR, leaves it standing, as it is one of the only films that can make you smile and cry at the same time."

","Hmmmm..... finally i was able to watch this film by Adam Shankman, at first i thought it was like one of those teen movies i've watched before i even hesitated borrowing the DVD from my cousin not once but many times. and so as the film was starting i've read who the director was and found out it was none other than the director of message in a bottle starred by Kevin Costner, this caught up my interest. i wasn't familiar with Shane West until i saw his movie ""whatever it takes"" with Spiderman star James Franco. i find Shane as a younger version of Chris O'Donell; smooth, matinée looking cool guy who's character shifts from one to another. he has carried the character of Landon Carter very well, a teenage boy who's life is actually being mislead by the group of people he calls his friends and so after being punished by the school's principal (he was to make tutor during Saturdays, joining the school play & other community service)he met Jamie Sullivan (played by none other than pop star Mandy Moore), which actually and eventually changed his life forever. So from being a bully, Landon was transformed into this goal-oriented person, i feel the passion and the power of love, a love so unselfish that even i, yes me! cried for this movie. its so amazing to see and experience the power of love. As what others usually say love is what makes this world go round and it is true. Inspite the trials and conflicts between the two, they manage to pull it through and have the best summer together as husband and wife. i find this movie very useful and very entertaining. somehow, i found a refreshing meaning or definition of what love is. it is not bounded by obstacles around us because by faith in God nothing is impossible. it's a miracle, this movie changed me."

","This movie is the most brilliant movie I've ever seen. I know you probably heard that its sad. But I'm gonna say it myself its a tear-breaker and no matter how may times you watch it you're still gonna cry. It's the best movie and I rate it 10/10. The actors/actresses were great. This movie was unpredictable and I didn't expect the ending at all. That makes it so good! Shane West and Mandy Moore's best movie yet! Watch it. Bring some tissues with you! I advice everyone to watch it young and old. Its also inspiring! Some will probably say its kind of cheesy but its not. I love it. I love it. Mwwaahhh...."

","Landon Carter has always been with the crowd that constantly gets in trouble and makes fun of others. After Landon saves the life of one of his friends and gets busted by the cops, He is forced to do community service, including the school play. His co-star, Jamie Sullivan, is the pastor's daughter. At first he is afraid of being around her because of his reputation. Then after flyers are made about her in the wrong way, he defends her, leaving his popularity and friends. They start to go out with each other and admit that they both are in love. Then Landon learns the truth; Jamie has leukemia. He tries everything to help her. He finally made Jamie's number one ambition; they both got married in a church. After the summer was over, Jamie dies but remains in Landon's heart. I cry every time I watch it because it's so sad and happy. This, in my opinion, is Mandy Moore's best film ever. She and Shane West do the best job portraying Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter."

","Oh my gosh... This movie was totally great... Just great. I cant even think of any words. Hot actors,Greeeeeatttt Soundtrack,Greeeeaaaattt plot.... This is a great flick. I don't know why some critics hated this movie! Probably cause they're into weird alien movies and eat 2 minute noodles in their little apartments in the dark all alone. How sad. I know it doesn't really make sense but I wish there was a sequel. WATCH THIS MOVIE! Trust me. I know a good movie when I see one. I just saw this in the weekend and I was super surprised that I didn't watch it in 2002. This movie makes you laugh,cry,gasp for breath,and best of all it's not far-fetched. It inspired me. A lot of people @ school think I'm a bit of a-grade mean girl and I admit after watching this movie It hit me hard and clear that you don't have to be a mean girl(even though I never fully became one THANK GOD) to get noticed in a good way."
"puppylover0021","8","1","2","2 September 2005"," Heart-wrenching, but I wish it was more like the book
","This is a pretty good movie, although I have to say that I was a bit disappointed it strayed so much from the book. The issue of spirituality was toned down SO MUCH in the movie. In the book, Jamie and Landon get through the hard times because of their faith but in the movie they get through it because of each other. I really didn't like that unnecessary change. There were a few additions to the story that I though just made the movie unforgettable. Jamie's list of things to accomplish really touches the heart, especially as they are completed one by one. This really is a sweet story and it was well done. If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, do not expect it to be word for word, because it isn't. I think the movie and the book were both really good, but not by any stretch the same. You just have to view the book and the movie as separate stories altogether to really enjoy it. Yes, they probably could have and should have followed the book more, but it was still a heart-touching movie that makes me cry and cry for hours after."

","this movie was the greatest! i especially love that it has some Christian background to it... i love Mandy Moore and Shane West both in this movie. They each did a wonderful job. Only Hope by Mandy Moore is my favorite song of all time. And, what a coincidence, it's in my favorite movie, this one. But anyway. Mandy Moore's voice is beautiful. Shane West did an extremely wonderful job at this movie... and hey... he still looked hott! ha ha! We need more movies like this in our lives. the ones that have a Christian background but don't portray Christians as ""bible huggers"" as i like to say. Also we need movies that if we were in front of God that we would be able to say ""yes, i watch this movie"" to him our God and not feel ashamed of saying it to him. But, once again, this movie was wonderful. All the actors and actresses did an awesome job and made this movie wonderful!"
"sbsyd207","10","1","2","9 August 2005"," It's my Only Hope
","This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. As a hopeless romantic, sappy does me in. But there was something more about this movie. It wasn't sappy. It was all mushy gooshy that-would-never-happen kind of thing. It was real. It felt real. It was moving and powerful. It makes you want to appreciate life a little more. The casting was perfect. Mandy Moore shined as Jamie, the quiet, intelligent, hard-working but unsocial minister's daughter who doesn't care what anyone else thinks about her. Shane West was a perfect Landon, making the smooth transition from Bad-boy of the school, to the sweet and sensitive love of Jamie's life. It seemed like the perfect story for Jamie to turn Landon into a man strong in faith and values. She is his inspiration and guide. She teaches him how to live life to the fullest and see things in the proper light. If only. Just as Landon begins to see that Jamie is his ""Only Hope"" he learns a gut-wrenching secret. The strong, loving, caring, sweet, intelligent love of his life is dying. In a race against time, Landon is determined to find his place in the world and his place with Jamie. He shows her the world. Tries to make all of her dreams come true. And if the thought of being with her the rest of his life strengthened his faith, then the thought of being without her made it even stronger. Although this movie is very different from the Novel written by Nicholas Sparks, it does have some advantages. The setting in the Nick Sparks book is 1956. The more modern setting of A Walk to Remember made the story more understandable for the younger generations as well as the young high-school love. The list that Jamie makes of all her hopes and dreams isn't in the Novel either, but it's a good way to show the gestures Landon made to help Jamie with her dreams. The play was written into the novel, but the play was a Christmas Play and she was an angel. In the film, the Play becomes a musical when Jamie sings ""Only Hope."" Although Jamie is not musical in the novel, it gives a nice touch of a sweet girl who has talents just like anyone else, but chooses to use them in different ways. Overall, this movie is incredible. There is not one thing I would change about it. It's completely powerful and moving. Touching anyone who will watch it, and changing them forever."
"K_special_nr1","10","1","2","25 July 2005"," A rare love story that fill you with warmth.
","I think this movie is such a beautiful story about two people's love for each other. You get to see a very rare kind of love. A love which not many people get to have. I can admit that I am kind of weak, when it comes to love-stories, but there is something special about this one. Many movies has the same story only with some differences, but not this one. This movie has it's own story. There is so much love and joy that it doesn't take you long before you feel this warmth inside of you. This movie proves that there is so much more to a person than her/his looks. This story makes you see that you can not be shallow, that you have to look inside of someone, to find true love. This is such a great love-story and such a great movie. I advice everybody to see it."

"rabbit_caviare","8","1","2","15 July 2005"," Great movie
","A Walk To Remember is a very nice movie.<br/><br/>I will start by saying that yes, this is a chick flick. But it's not one of those ditsy blonde films about teenage crushes and all of that, it has a lot more substance than one of those crap-tastic Hilary Duff screen play that's in theaters every single day. Mandy Moore played the role excellently, and so did Shane West - those two were very convincing as a couple.<br/><br/>In addition to being cute and thoughtful, it was also pretty sad. Drama, angst, romance, and character development definitely reared their heads in this film, no doubt about it. My only complaint on the movie was this: it was a bit slow paced. Not excruciatingly slow like Inventing The Abbots or anything, but definitely not an action packed gore fest of sex and violence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you haven't seen it -- see it."

"sez_bef69","10","1","2","19 June 2005"," amazing
","This is a masterpiece, in a word. This is a breathtaking and inspiring film it shows that if your love is strong enough, you can get through anything. The film inspires and encourages people to have faith and to never turn their back on somebody they truly love as the outcome is so rewarding if you stand by them. Although 'Landon Carter' has to incorporate into his life that he has lost the love of his life, his soul mate, his everything, he knew that Jamie would always love him for 'being her miracle' and for not leaving her side when she truly needed him, and this helped him go on and continue to smile. Overall this film is truly amazing and breathtaking, it is inspiring to those people who believe they should change (i.e because they are a criminal) as from this film they can see that life will be much more rewarding in the future if they do."

OK maybe I'm just easily influenced by films, but is that a crime? why should we have to sit through a 3 hour long cult indie movie just because its supposed to broaden our minds? surly we'd all prefer to watch a chucklsome movie, (with perhaps a little eye candy!) and walk away with a smile on our faces and an ambition to become whatever the lead character in this movie was!

In all honesty I think everyone male or female should see this movie b/c I think it gives people a different outlook on life. I've also read the book and although the do differ they are both excellent in their own ways. I recommend the book & the movie. Rarely does the movie capture the book but the movie did it. Excellent actors, excellent director, excellent EVERYTHING!"
"johnsthevoice","10","1","2","3 June 2005"," Themes, sex and staying true to morals...
","A Walk to Remember is a beautiful film which stays true to Nicholas Sparks' best selling novel of the same title. I found that the themes of the movie were brilliantly exhibited. Everything does ultimately come down to who is by your side. Mandy Moore's character, Jamie Sullivan, is inspiring as she never once, through all obstacles, turns from her faith. She stays true to it and preaches the powerful word of God to all who are willing to listen. She humbles herself to those in need and wishes for nothing more than to do good. Her soft but strong character helps Landon Carter (Shane West) grow from a rebellious teen to a ambitious young man at the end of the film.<br/><br/>In the scene where Jamie and Landon meet at her telescope and they make a quick reference to sex, my ratings on the film boosted. I thought it was amazing that Jamie did not give in to temptation and stayed true to what she believed in. I thought the best part about this was the fact that i saw a beautiful romance movie which did not involve any sex scenes, something very rare in the world today as you can not even turn the television on without seeing sex advertised.<br/><br/>I believe that A Walk to Remember was a brilliant movie sure to move the hearts of anyone who truly believes in the power of love."
"jhardman-2","10","1","2","6 May 2005"," The scenes that made me well up were Landon and his father hugging when he tells him thank you and also when Jamie tells Landon she has leukemia.
","I'm not a trained critique but having spent 27 years in 9th grade, I feel I am partially qualified on the subject of teenagers, peer pressure, etc. A Walk To remember has become one of my top five movies of all time--and that's quite a few. The message in the story is great(which is #1 with me). Shane West and Mandy Moore are absolutely fabulous and carry the story in simple, well-acted scenes. The support cast could not have been better. Wish I had them to pass out International Star Registry Certificates at the end of the month. Kudos to all the young people writing in. If you enjoyed the movie and shed a little tear you are on the right path in life!! In summary, I can say that this movie has touched me deeply and will never go out of style with its message!"

I think the movie adapted the story really well and put something in the movie that's stronger than the book.<br/><br/>Personally I think this movie would be much better than ""Passion of the Christ"" for the whole church to watch together.<br/><br/>A great work."

This is what guys would call a ""Chick Flick"", a drama movie, like a classic love story. I love all different types of movies and this HAS to be my favorite drama of all time.<br/><br/>Summary: Landon, the main character is a so called ""popular"" kid at school. Like other popular people he always thinks about ""cool"" things. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), changes that by opening his eyes more. This is great movie. It will touch you in a way you've never been touched before. Better than any classic love story. After you see this movie once, you'll want to see it again. And again.<br/><br/>Overall: This is overall one of my favorite movies. I normally don't like dramas that much, but this one made me change my mind. It really has emotion and a great love story.

"happyrobles","6","1","2","7 March 2005"," Read the Book
","Although this movie was okay, the book, as always is much better. The idea of the movie was the same as the book, but the details i.e. town setting, reason they start seeing each other, the preacher's involvement, etc.- all of that was much better. IN the book they walk everywhere, ergo the title of the book. In the movie they drive cars. It takes away from the relationship because Landon should be walking her home all the time. Again, the title has a meaning. I must say I loved Peter Coyote. A great actor. And Many Moore was unexpectedly good. The part fit her, or she fit the part. I thought the movie's soundtrack could have been much more mellow considering the plot. Too much ""hardness"" and vulgarity when the book had none. I loved the book so much I wanted to see the movie to experience the feelings again. It was a bit of a let down, but I am glad I saw it."
"holla_hollabk","10","1","2","23 February 2005"," Not like any other teen/love story ! ! !
","The first time I ever saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I would love it. I have always wanted to watch this movie but never been able to find it. I recently finally watched it and I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>The storyline is great and they couldn't have chosen better actors to play the roles. I have to say that Shane West and Mandy Moore played the characters so magnificently, the characters were so alive it gets the audience really involved. Jamie (Mandy Moore) is really inspirational as she plays an outcast but she never lets anything bother her, she is happy with who she is and the life she lives. Shane West's character Landon I loved the most for many reasons. I love the way his character changes throughout the film based of the influence of Jamie and how he always goes out of his way to help Jamie cross off the things on her 'life to do list'. This is really lovable! West and Moore have so much chemistry together and this really shows in the movie. <br/><br/>Once you see a scene that makes you cry, you will be crying throughout the whole film. The whole film is an emotional roller-coaster that will tag you along the whole way. I became emotionally involved in this film, I couldn't stop crying throughout the film, after the film and every time I think about it I burst into tears! I always get emotional during romance/drama films but this film stayed with me, I have never felt this way about a film, until i came across A Walk to Remember. This film will always be one of the best films I have ever seen. <br/><br/>It isn't just a typical teen/love story, it has so much strength and intensity. There are so many key moments in the film (that I don't want to mention because it will spoil it) that make the audience so attached, and this is why it succeeds so much! The acting, music, story are all fantastic! I highly recommend people go and see this movie!!! Just have a box of tissues next to you!"
"aw083","10","1","2","9 September 2004"," A fair review?
","'A Walk to Remember' is perhaps a cheesy film with a typical teen-movie storyline, but the story is truly romantic and of course, based on the true story of (author of the novel) Nicholas Sparks' sister. For those of you who have seen the film, you either loved it or felt indifferent towards it. I am yet to meet someone who didn't like it, and most shed a few tears, even those who do not consider themselves 'teen-movie' fans. The basic story is very similar to another film, called 'Here on Earth', and I would recommend it although only as a second rate 'A Walk to Remember'.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore sizzles as Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the minister in Beaufort, North Carolina. She is deeply religious and a grade-A student, about to feature in the town's new production, a play written by a local student. Landon Carter, played by the slightly less good Shane West, is roped into appearing in the play after getting into trouble with the law, and things develop from there. The emotion and romance scenes are well played by West and Moore, and actually believable.<br/><br/>Moore and West are backed up by experienced actors Darryl Hannah and Peter Coyote, along with some younger actors who range in ability from good to poor, although I won't go into details...<br/><br/>Cheesy, yes. Predictable...no. Be surprised, go on!"
"hawaiiangurl45","10","1","2","19 May 2004"," Touching Movie
","I was browsing through Hollywood Video, debating what movie I should rent. There were many movies that were good, but ""A Walk to Remember"" caught my eye, since I read the book when the movie first appeared in theaters. My brother said it would be weak and was trying his best not to get it, but I opposed and told him he gets his movie and I get mine. I am glad I didn't listen to him. <br/><br/>This movie was a real tear jerker. People say Shane West sucked at his acting, but I never seen any of his other acting and he did really good to me. I don't think he was trying to act like this big stud or anything. Mandy Moore did very well being the sweet good girl, but in some ways, I think it comes naturally to her too. <br/><br/>Anyways, this movie was good because of how Jamie Sullivan helped Landon become a better person. He wasn't too bright of a guy before coming close to her. He was rude and wasn't really going anywhere. Jamie helped him realize the important aspects of life, and he grew to love her. One of my favorite parts was the first time Landon told Jamie he loved her, and Jamie replied ""I told you not to fall in love with me."" I thought that was just beautiful! lol. <br/><br/>When Jamie told Landon she had cancer, it really mad me sad. I wanted them to be together, but I had to keep reassuring myself that this was only a movie. The part that finally made me cry was when Landon hugged his dad in thanks of helping Jamie. That really showed Landon's love for Jamie, and his forgiveness to his father. <br/><br/>Another thing I liked about the movie is how Jamie's father realized that Landon really did love Jamie. Jamie's fathers' opinion about Landon was wrong, of course all loving fathers are erie of letting their little girl go away. I was happy to see that Landon and Jamie's father became good friends, and that her father even was proud of Landon for getting into medical school. <br/><br/>This is one of my new favorite movies. I could watch it again, probably am before I bring it back in. I will even buy it. 10/10<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, make sure you do."

","I went to see this film with a friend to make fun of it. And found myself totally enthralled by this small but emotionally engrossing film with a breakout performance from singer Mandy Moore. She stars as a religious young woman who ends up changing the bad boy in school and making him fall for her.  it's beautifully done with great performances, good music and a suprisingly emotional and honest edge."
"vyau","8","1","2","1 April 2003"," A surprisingly good teen movie, but not without its flaws.
","Like most guys I probably wouldn't have been caught dead watching A Walk to Remember at theaters or renting it without a date (perhaps even with one). But thanks to nine channels of HBO and one long, boring night I stumbled on what turned out to be a surprisingly solid and inspiring presentation about a popular rebel teen (Shane West) who is changed by his experiences (read PG movie) with the Reverend's ""less than socially desirable"" daughter (Mandy Moore).<br/><br/>Moore's acting is amazingly convincing, near flawless, which came as a huge shock to me because I was prepared to laugh at it from the very beginning. West's performance is also excellent, although his acting in the later half of the movie outshines the earlier, possibly due to the fact that his involvement with the supporting cast of his clique lessens as the movie progresses. It is hard to distinguish whether his group of friends seems unconvincing at times because of sub-par acting or poor ""in-crowd"" scripting.<br/><br/>The book is set in 1957 but the movie takes place in some indistinguishable decade in the later 20th century. And whoever was responsible for this theme, which involved vintage cars, clothing, wall decor and other props (black and white television programming), almost pulled it off perfectly. But then there is a small scene where students use Adobe Photoshop on a computer that removed this sense of timeless past generation blending that, until then, had been achieved and greatly narrows down the time frame that this movie could have taken place during.<br/><br/>Overall, despite any shortcomings (and there are still a few I have not touched on), this movie delivers an convincing emotional performance and a return to innocence that can be unexpectedly refreshing. (8/10)"

","<ul><li>Please note that there are big spoilers in this review before you decide to read on! -</li></ul><br/><br/>
This one really touched me by the heart. ""A Walk to Remember"" is a wonderful masterpiece that got way to less attention here in Austria during its theatrical run. (One reason for that might be that hardly anyone knows Mandy Moore here which may have helped to get people watch it in the US.) I discovered it more by coincidence and ... well ... it made me cry out of joy and out of sadness at the same time. People who dislike this movie simply didn't understand it or have a heart of stone. I can't imagine any other possible reason not to love ""A Walk to Remember"".<br/><br/>It's a story about true love that everyone of us wants to discover in his/her life, but with a very tragic and sad ending. Nevertheless the movie definitely wouldn't have been this good without it. It's also a movie about faith and how positively it can affect people. And that aspect was done so beautifully, too, that even a non-believer such as me couldn't help but love it.<br/><br/>This is not the average romantic teen movie. It's much, much more. So don't be distracted by the fact the two main characters are in high school. This is a movie for all ages, for everybody who believes in love or wants to start to believe in it.<br/><br/>If you want to compare this movie and find something remotely similar, you should think about ""Love Story"". I think that in many ways that one is what comes closest to ""A Walk to Remember"".<br/><br/>I love this one. Since I saw it at the theater last summer I can't forget it and now I finally decided to buy the RC1-DVD because I simply can't wait for the RC2 version anymore."

I didn't expect it to have too much of a storyline.<br/><br/>Well i was wrong.<br/><br/>The acting is good, excellent in fact. I was thoroughly moved by Mandys performance. She portrayed the innocent choir girl so well.<br/><br/>Its just a shame people will be writing it off cos of the persona of teen comedy, which lets face it isn't everyones cup of tea.<br/><br/>I suggest to everyone watch this film, forget about the song ""Candy"" and enjoy yourself for a little while, letting go of reality, and enter this well told world of 2 peoples lives who were so different yet they over came that obstacle to find love."

","I went to see this film somewhat sceptical about how good it would be,(the not another pop-star tries to be an actress syndrome).  I admit that I was suitably impressed.  This may not be in the same league as Crazy/Beautiful but it does the job better than most.  <br/><br/>Although this contains the standard teen fare, wild child in search of redemption and uncool geek, the central performances from Moore and West plus supporting cast from Coyote and Hannah make this an enjoyable fare. Yes Moore does sing but it is all in context.  This is what Spears needed to do in Crossroads.<br/><br/>The sound track is one to add to the collection.<br/><br/>Ian"

","This movie is outstanding. The characters chosen in this film (Mandy Moore and Shane West) were wonderful and they captured the identities of Jamie and Landon from the Novel by Nicholas Sparks perfectly. Watching this movie and having read the book it allowed me to place an actual face to the characters in the book. This movie is one of the best love stories I have seen or read. Its a movie that will have you thinking about the one you love in a different way. A walk to remember, a story I am fortunate to have had the pleaseure of seeing and reading as well."
"cariart","Null","1","2","29 August 2002"," Squeaky Clean Does NOT Equal Good!
","I've been told that 'A Walk to Remember' should be forgiven for its multitude of faults because a)It has a positive Christian message for teens, and b)It's a 'Chick Flick', and, for some reason, that makes leaps of logic somehow acceptable. Personally, both arguments, to me, demean the groups referred to. A good film stands on its own merits; a bad film, and this one is a stinker, should not be rationalized away by saying it's target audience expects less!<br/><br/>'A Walk to Remember' opens with the world's most clean-cut 'gang' of overprivledged kids busting into an abandoned warehouse complex at night (shades of 'Footloose'), then daring a kid as a rite of initiation to dive from a tower into a sinkhole of water (shades of 'Breaking Away'). Conned by the charismatic leader (Shane West), the kid jumps, and is badly injured. Naturally, the police immediately arrive, and West is busted, for staying with the kid. As punishment, he is given probation, community service time...and he has to JOIN the DRAMA CLUB!!! (This is PUNISHMENT for nearing KILLING a kid???) In the Drama Club is school geek and Born-Again Christian Mandy Moore, who you can tell is 'The Good Girl' because she carries a Bible, doesn't wear makeup, and is wardrobe-challenged! From her soulful glances at him, and his arrogant smile in reply, you know that True Love is only a few plot-twists away. It takes Opening Night to provide the catalyst, though...apparently, this club doesn't believe in dress rehearsals, because when she walks onstage, in makeup, and a slinky dress with no underwear (one wonders how her minister father approved of THAT!), and sings to West, as the male lead (yes, despite having no acting ability, or experience, he gets the lead in the play), he sees how hot she is for the first time, and falls for her.<br/><br/>She warns him NOT to fall in love with her (ah, could there be a secret she's not sharing? DUH!), but he follows her around, anyway, even to the cemetery where she stargazes with her telescope at night. (This sets up one of the most brain-dead scenes of the film; he asks to see Pluto, to which she replies that it doesn't rise until two hours before sunrise. ""I'll wait"", he says...In reality, Pluto is impossible to see in a small telescope...it wasn't even discovered until 1930, in an amazing piece of detective work...and this supposedly brilliant astronomy hobbyist doesn't know this??? As a Born-Again Christian, you KNOW she wasn't lying to get a night alone with West!)<br/><br/>Eventually, Moore collapses, and it is revealed she is dying of cancer (shades of 'Here on Earth'), and, on her deathbed in the hospital, West proposes to her. His estranged doctor father pays to get her Home Care, for her last days...and the next scene, the couple are walking through the woods together, with Moore looking better than ever! (I believe in Love's healing powers, but this is a stretch, even for me!) The couple marry, and share a Summer of Love, before she finally dies (shades of 'Love Story'), and he, redeemed, goes on to ace Medical School (shades of 'Magnificent Obsession').<br/><br/>The acting is uneven, at best; Shane West does a credible job, certainly better than Chris Klein did in the 'Walk' clone, 'Here on Earth'. Peter Coyote, as Moore's minister father, does what he can in a role that seems to have been 'lifted' from John Lithgow's in 'Footloose'. Daryl Hannah, nearly unrecognizable with dark hair, is quite good as West's mother. But the rave reviews Mandy Moore has received as the dying girl seem unjustified; no makeup and stilted line readings do NOT equal a great performance! In order for a film like this to work, you must believe the heroine, and the bittersweet nature of her love. I never got beyond the 'golly, look, Mandy Moore is acting' stage, and her delivery often had me wincing!<br/><br/>
There ARE some great tearjerkers out there, both classic and contemporary...'A Walk to Remember' is just NOT one of them!"
"Sorie","Null","1","2","20 July 2002"," Nothing Worth Remembering!
","First off, I would like to say, that I don't no what possessed me to even pay my precious 9 bucks to see a load of crap, but I went anyways with my friends, hoping to at least have a good time. By the middle/end of the film I had ripped half my hair out! First off, its so fake because just cuz Mandy Moore wears a ponytail and overalls, she's considered to be a Jesus freak, and all of a sudden, in one scene she transforms into a magical princess because she's wearing a dress? Please! And the way the main guy all of a sudden goes from thinking she's a loser to being in love with her? This is every sucky teen movie mixed together with some hashish!

","I've just had the misfortune of seeing this film and feel honour bound to warn others before they suffer the same fate (if you are a thirteen year old girl of a romantic disposition, please stop reading here).<br/><br/>Quite simply I'm staggered that anyone is thinking of giving this a cinema release in the UK. I could see how this kind of cod, two dimensional, moralising pap might go well in The States - especially the Midwest - but over here the religious over tones really jar (not to mention the ropey acting and simplified to the point of the ridiculous charcters).<br/><br/>OK I'm not the target audience (being an embittered, European, urban 29 year old man) but I'm sure there are better movies out there for this demographic (I love Dirty Dancing for example, Footloose anyone?)<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favour and avoid."

","Altogether an average movie.

Another thing to be noted: this is a wholesome movie, especially for some Christians. Pity isn't it that a wholesome movie has to be this bad."
"bopdog","10","1","2","30 January 2002"," WAY above most teen movies-- Authentic, sweet, and very real!
","Great for what it is, and what it sets out to portray. ""A Walk to Remember"" is a well made, thoughtful movie. It is dramatic in a manner one might think is aimed at adolescents. But what makes it appealing to adults as well as kids is the ""truth"" of the drama. That is, unlike many teen movies that seem to capitalize on the angst-y, overblown melodrama and theatrical nature of teenaged fantasy, ""A Walk"" touches on very real and important (albeit sometimes very quiet) issues that everyone deals with throughout their life.<br/><br/>""A Walk"" is also very sweet, but avoids sentimentality. Overall, it is a very authentic and meaningful depiction of some of the big issues facing us all: Our choices, self and social identities, and having a vision of who we want to become, and how we go about becoming that. Perhaps this is a bigger issue to one who is 16 or 18 or 19 years old, but it certainly reappears over and over to some degree or other throughout our life span.<br/><br/>The performances were especially great. Peter Coyote is a strong, skilled, and delightful presence. Daryl Hannah (Sp?) is unrecognizable as a brunette, so we get to experience a wonderful aspect of her character-- which is totally on-target and deep here-- without being distracted by her glamor and stardom. I was enjoying her as the mom for the first 2/3 of the movie, wondering to myself, ""Where have I seen this amazing actress before?"" before it dawned on me that it was she. Good job to both of them!<br/><br/>Mandy Moore was grand, avoiding all cliche of the ""ugly duckling"" female character we have seen so many times before. The male adolescent lead, Whats-his-name, at first struck me as a bit young Charlie Sheen-ish, and therefore a tiny bit of a rip off. But upon reflection I saw his portrayal as 100% appropriate. After all, isn't this what 17 or 18 year-old boys are like in real life? Especially the confident and popular ones? You know, a bit of posturing, a bit of performance, a bit of bravado, and a bit of uncertainty and fear. And yet in the end, the better ones are capable of change, capable of personal breakthroughs and transformations for the better.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent movie! I gave it a 10 out of 10."
"lundca","3","1","2","27 January 2002"," Nicholas Sparks would not recognize it
","The movie did not follow the book is some of what I considered the most essential parts of the story.  In fact, is at least one instance, he was attributed to a role she played and it lost much of the sensitive storyline. Oftentimes a book is better than the movie and this is one.  Landon was better played than Jamie but the display of her progressive decline was not illustrated well.  Not impressed."

"missnavymoo2","5","1","3","21 July 2008"," Not Like the Book
","Although I enjoy this movie and watch it whenever it's on, I find a few things irritating about it. The first thing is that it doesn't compare to the book. The book took place at an earlier time. Although the character is 17 in the movie and in the book, he lives in a different times. In the book, he was born in 1942 and meets Jamie in 1959. But in the movie, the time is now and I find that so irritating. Why did the makes of the film feel the need to ""contemporize"" it? It was condescending to teenagers and insulting to older viewers. The teens in the film dress like slobs -- couldn't Landon wear something other than an old, ratty flannel shirt just once in the movie? Did Jamie, who was so pretty, have to look so drab and plain? Another thing that irritated me was Daryl Hannah. She was woefully miscast and just a throw-in as far as I'm concerned. Finally, there is the portrayal of Landon's father. In the book, he is a Congressman who is away in Washington. In the movie, Landon's father is a doctor and is divorced from his mother. It makes the father look bad and I don't think that was necessary. Still, I like the movie, especially the end. Despite its flaws, I'll recommend this movie, especially to teens who may better understand and appreciate flannel shirts, drab jumpers and god-awful music."
"ar-thur","5","1","3","25 March 2008"," Composition movie
","If there was a school composition with the theme ""romance"", maybe ""A Walk to Remember"" is perfect for being written down. Because this film is like a composition: introduction, development and conclusion, in 30 lines or less, with no vacancy for those roller-coaster events that keep your eyes on the screen. It's too closed to its romantic context, never going up and down to tell us something special. Simple plot that ends in a boring and predictable hour-and-half picture. That may explain why teenagers loved it: they identify themselves and their lives. And it's really possible to identify someone, but, being one of those people who go to the movies expecting something else to run away from my routine (and we are only few), I disliked it. Of course, there are cool events, just like the ""being in two places at the same time"" scene, and Shane West and Mandy Moore are a nice couple, but it gets into nothing when you compare to the obvious metaphors used and to the moments that are lost with songs that tells you nothing. I think it's a great movie to be watched by non-demanding couples that will pay more attention to each other than to the movie. Unremarkably picture, good for teens and couples because it's easy to swallow. A 5/10 for me."
"mbworm","7","1","3","19 March 2008"," Mandy Moore is Sweet
","Basically the only reason people saw this was to see Mandy Moore in her debut performance. The popular teen pop star was put to the test to provide a decent performance in a romance movie loosely based on the bestseller by Nicholas Sparks (it's a great book, highly recommended). And to everyone's surprise, she's actually quite good. A lot better than most modern teen actresses in fact. The movie is a bit overly saccharine with it's teeny bopper appeal, but the romance that blossoms between her character Jamie and the bad boy at school Landon (a touching performance by Shane West) is believable and heartbreaking. Of course there's a catch. Even though everything seems to be great because a barrier between popular and unpopular is broken with their love, it turns out that Jamie only has a short amount of time to live- she's dying of Leukemia. The movie becomes unbearably sad but Moore and West carry it perfectly, with heartfelt performances in a truly convincing manner. I guarantee you'll cry by the end of this, and if you don't you'll at least appreciate the sweetness and purpose of the film."
"orphanactress818","9","1","3","3 July 2007"," Absolutely Inspiring
","I first read ""A Walk to Remember"" when I was 12 years old. Then, a few days after I had finished it (and spent 2 hours crying my eyes out) I heard there was a movie. I absolutely refused to see it. I have had plenty of experience with books made into movies. They always turn out completely horrible- and they never follow the book.<br/><br/>Well, I stubbornly held out for about a year. Then I finally watched it. I cried. It is an absolutely amazing movie. Yes, I realize that it is not like the book at all, but still. But, just so I can get my argument out there, I made a list of the ways it could be better and another one of things that I liked about the movie.<br/><br/>THINGS THAT COULD BE CHANGED -Jamie's hair should be blond. -They should have actually included the orphanage scene. -Jamie should be an angel in the play. (Well, I know it says she is, but she doesn't LOOK like an angel. At least not in the way the book said she would.) -They should have included the part where Jamie's raising money for the orphanage. -Landon and Jamie should actually go for a WALK. -Jamie's family is supposed to be poor. As in, she should not have a big grand house. -Jamie's sweater is supposed to be brown.<br/><br/>THINGS THAT I LIKED -They way that they included the fact that Jamie really inspired Landon. -The wedding scene. -The dinner scene. -The hospital scene. (Even though that when I started bawling, it was really moving and completely inspirational.)<br/><br/>And I know I liked a whole lot more about the movie, but if I listed it all here, then, well, I would Definitely run out of room."

Also, I do appreciate Jamie's attitude toward death. The day before yesterday while I was sharing this movie with my students in my audio-visual classroom, I could not help finding tears in my eyes again and again.

The portrayal of Jamie (Mandy Moore) and Landon (Shane West) is absolutely spell binding and flawless.The emotions shown by them towards each other is never excessive but it pulls your heartstrings unlike any of the contemporary movies. Another feather in the movie's cap is the heart warming and soulful music which accentuates its splendour and takes it onto a whole new plane.'Only hope' is a breathtaking number with a scintillating setting. There were too many heart wrenching scenes in the movie that i can't truly pick just one out,surely you wont either.Further i don't wanna give any spoilers-just one advice DO NOT READ THE PLOT OR STORY B4 U SEE THE MOVIE,it will drastically diminish the grandeur of the movie. All in all this is one movie which i have been fortunate enough to see and you will understand what i mean when you see it.A truly MOVING piece of art... that reminds you what human emotions-love,hope,faith,joy,sorrow are all about."

","I watched this film last night and really enjoyed this. It is a lovely love story but at the same time I found it really sad. The film was definitely better than I thought it was going to be. The only thing I would say is that the ending could have resulted in Jamie recovering from her illness. I am glad that Landon was able to take up his dreams of a place at Medical School. The wedding scene was the most saddest and I cried a lot until my face was all red and blotchy and I was still crying when I went to bed that night. Jamie made a lovely bride and Landon looked very nice looking in his wedding suit. <br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone that needs a good cry. There was some good acting involved and the film reminded me of 'Grease' at a younger age but without the dancing and the illness side of it."
"mts_andy","4","1","3","17 September 2005"," Great!!!!!
","This movie really touched the depths of my soul.<br/><br/>It's a romantic story, but not dull or boring like the soap-operas. The whole movie is sensible and sensitive. Jamie is sweet, yet very mysterious. She has principles which she respects, she has dreams, she knows to love, she knows to appreciate the values of life.<br/><br/>Landon is, at the beginning, what we would call ""a real jerk"", but when he gets to know Jamie, everything changes. He is willing to change. He becomes conscious of his powers and dreams through her and his personality softens, his qualities become to prevail.<br/><br/>Mandy More's voice is breathtaking in that episode with the play.. She appears there completely changed from the rest of the movie, she is charming and pretty...<br/><br/>This story can be considered a second variant of Love Story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you'll love this movie!!!"
"schlewitzaj","2","1","3","24 December 2004"," Sugar-coated dreck
","About the only thing I came away with that I could stand was Ms. Moore's song ""Only Hope,"" a pretty song that tapped my sentimental streak. Nothing else tapped it, though the movie tried mightily with a series of tearjerker clichés. Guess I'm tired of seeing beautiful young women dying of some wasting disease that doesn't go much deeper than hollowed eyes. Landon Carter (such a cool name) turns from bad boy to furrowed- brow earnest--and the message is that not getting any from the pure but dying Janey Sullivan is what causes this transformation. And because we all know where the movie is heading, the story requires an improbable twist that temporarily divides Landon from Janie--just so we'll stay in our seats and see how they work it out in the end. Not whether, mind you, because whether is too painful apparently for viewers. Even the protestant Christian layer of the story aims not to hurt--faith is equated with solace. I suppose it is, or can be, for some, but doubts and arguments about god often accompany faith, though you'd never know from their ""walk to remember."""

All of herself. <br/><br/>She was also able to show him the beauty of life.<br/><br/>She made him a better person by being herself and sticking to her faith.

"mathias1979","2","1","3","19 July 2002"," Sappy, Predictable, Unoriginal
","I have nothing against watching a romantic movie from time to time, but this movie made me want to vomit. First of all, how much more unoriginal and cliche filled can a movie get? This made the movie completely predictable and incredibly laughable.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore herself wasn't all that bad, except the scene of the school musical where she transforms to herself and comes completely out of character...but I suppose that's more of a script problem there.  The rest of the actors in this movie were atrocious.  It's almost if they were putting little effort into their roles and that lack of sincerity smacks you in the face over and over again.<br/><br/>
Mandy Moore and Shane West had absolutely no sparks between them.  There's was nothing that really made you care if the their relationship worked out or not because it just seemed to be void of all emotion.  And what attracts the two characters together in the first place is beyond me as they had nothing in common and all they ever shared were a few terribly sappy moments.  It leads me to believe that it was only a physical attraction and that they weren't really in love and it was just infatuation.  As a result, I couldn't care less about their relationship.<br/><br/>Even my girlfriend who loves chick flicks just as much as the next girl puts this movie up with some of the worst  she's ever seen.  I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 only because it featured a few decent songs throughout the  movie and it was good for some cheap laughs."

","The good: it's passable.

Impress her with your sensitivity. Try not to laugh when she starts crying, and try, by all means, not to remind her there are love stories men like, too (for example, the magnificent ""Before Sunrise"", with Julie Delphy and Ethan Hawke) because they are GOOD, not poorly acted, with no underdeveloped characters, and with no clichés whatsoever.<br/><br/>After all, we men have a heart, too."

"thetweedybird","2","1","4","18 April 2008"," Not loyal to the book at all
","I don't understand why movie makers feel they have to add to a well functioning story. In the book Jamie has a big, forgiving, unprejudiced heart of gold. She sees the best in everyone. That is what makes her see the best in Landon when he doesn't even see it himself. Jamie in the movie is nothing like the Jamie in the book. Her Reverend father keeps her close in the book because he was an older man when she was born and he lost his wife. He is nothing like that in the film. I really miss some good strong characters. Jamie of the book would never have said ""Prove it"" to Landon about their friendship. She brought out the best in him by being true to herself; a warm and giving person. Not every viewer is a person with Zap mentality. A slow build up often gives the best results. I thought this movie shallow and superficial."
"curlylicious824","4","1","4","3 February 2006"," Nice plot, but to much religion involved
","I saw this movie tonight on TV, and it was all very touching and a good teen chick flick overall, but i was bothered by the continuous religious undertones, and the movie's involvement with god and faith. As a non-practicing Jew, i am made very uncomfortable by faith-based movies and messages, and I felt like, rather than focusing on the love story, and even Jamie's reliance on faith to pull her through, it sent the message that Jamie converts Landon, and the only thing lacking in his life was religion.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the basic plot line is very beautiful and riveting, however, some of the topics that the movie covers have the potential to make viewers uncomfortable, and draw away from the main story."
"cranium42","3","1","4","30 January 2002"," You should Run from A Walk to Remember
","A couple days ago I went to see ""A Walk to Remember"" starring Mandy Moore and Shane West.  And I must say it had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (In my humble opinion).  Mandy Moore was good in ""The Princess Dairies"" because she looked like the cheerleading type.  Here, everyone knows she's a very beautiful woman, so the idea of her playing an ugly duckling is hard to get over.  I don't see the point of wasting $8 on a movie when you can just rent ""She's All That"" and basically get the same movie.  From what I stated earlier, ""She's All That"" was a good movie because very few people heard of Rachael Leigh Cook before the movie came out, so few people knew what she looked like.  Also, movies should throw ""curveballs"": plot twists that keep the viewer guessing.  I've always tried to guess what would happen in other movies and have been wrong.  In this movie I predicted what would happen SIX different times (and no I didn't read the book and didn't find out what happened from someone else).  Mandy Moore is a great singer, and while she was good in ""Princess Dairies"" she lacked something in ""Walk"".  Shane West did have some bright spots in the movie, and I think he has a career ahead of him in acting.  Otherwise, I believe this movie lacked heart and was too predictable to be enjoyed by a general audience."
"Quinoa1984","6","1","4","27 January 2002"," Fair as a date movie and chick flick, but uh...
","A Walk to Remember is puzzling as well as corny even if at moments it seems like it could be a decent movie.  It brings puzzlement to me how Mandy Moore who plays the lead girl in the movie is the ""plain Jane"" type in her community.  I'm not saying she did a bad job in her role, but in any real community (yes even in Virginia where this story takes place) does anybody really think that somebody who looks like Mandy Moore would be the outcast from all the preppies?  Maybe if the film had flashbacks of her as a kid being the outcast it might be not as undoubtful to see her as an outsider, but come on.<br/><br/>Truth be told, there were times in this movie when I thought it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be from the trailer and commercials.  In this Nicholas Sparks based story, West plays a popular kid who gets in trouble and is sent to do some community service type things, and Moore is there volunteering and soon it unfolds with them getting sort of romantically involved, then more so, then she changes him forever, and, and... <br/><br/>
In total, I can see a group of teenie-bopper girls feeling and not feeling the way I did after seeing this movie and it depends more on the person whether or not they like this.  As for me, I won't watch it again unless I'M the one on the date and know I'm getting action afterwards.  Grade: Between C+ and C"

"Travis_Bickle01","3","1","5","7 August 2005"," Weak and disappointing
","I knew the story, I saw the trailer and I thought I would like it although it looked a bit cliché... Apparently not, I didn't liked it as much as I hoped. This is the second novel by Nicolas Sparks that is turned into a movie, the first was ""Message in a Bottle"" with Kevin Costner and Paul Newman. ""A Walk To Remember"" didn't work for me because the cliché-elements where a little over top. It was just to much of it.<br/><br/>She is nerd, the daughter of the minister. He's the popular guy of the school. He does something wrong and gets punished for it. One of the punishments is the fact that he has to participate in the school play. There they get to know each other and fall in love. Then she tells him she's sick and after a while she dies. From the moment he started to know her, he becomes a good guy and when she dies he never gets over her and she was the love of his life. Voila, I think we had all the clichés.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad but what disturbed me was the fact that it was so unbelievable and extremely cliché. I've seen ""Love Story"" as well, you know, the romantic classic with Ryan O'Neal. Although this movie contained a lot of clichés as well, I loved that movie! So I don't know exactly why it didn't work for me with ""A Walk To Remember"", but I can only repeat I was disappointed and I think the movie doesn't deserve his 6,8 rating.<br/><br/>Not the best romantic movie I saw. I'd rather see ""10 Things I Hate About You"" a fifth time...<br/><br/>3/10"
"jacknchicken","2","1","5","18 July 2002"," This movie gives a bad name to the term ""Chick Flick""
","This movie has themes that almost completely differ from my own beliefs.  Do you remember as a little kid the color wheel that they taught you, as if everyone in life was to become a natural painter?  Well, if I was red, this movie would be a teal sort of green.  A Walk to Remember features a) a high dosage of Christian faith, b) a celebration of teenage marriage, and c) Mandy Moore.  I'm not sure why no one shot me before the movie started, because they should have.  The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 out of 10 is because of the inclusion of two New Radicals songs on the soundtrack.  To say that Mandy Moore's acting was stiff would imply some sort of action (a derivative of emotion).  Mandy Moore's acting was ... nothing.  It was nothing!  There is no adjective to describe how bland she was.  There are also several characters who are completely unnecessary, like the ex girlfriend and Shane West's father.  I don't know, maybe they're in the book or something."

THIS is the kind of relationship girls should aspire to, not the back and forth crap of 'the notebook'. I can't say how good this film is without giving things away but it is more than your typical 'bad boy turns good'. first of all, because as we learn in the movie and it's even a line essentially said, that Landon's not even that bad, he's just pretending. West's transformation from this wanna be bad boy to this sweet, sensitive but most importantly VULNERABLE teenager is a sight to see. it's a heartbreaking twist that feels almost like karma to his character. the beauty of this film and its acting is in its subtleties so play close attention. It's message of love, hope AND FORGIVENESS is one that is sorely needed, especially in the cynical world of 2015. must see!"

And I would credit that to the brilliant performances by the striking Shane West and Moore. What was not cliché, was Moore's character up to a point. I like the fact that she isn't a doormat, and takes a stand for her dignity.<br/><br/>The moment Moore revealed that she has leukemia, my heart sank. Not out of sympathy, but because of the amazing dip the storyline took for me. And as I expected, it went into a very predictable, unwatchable routine after that.

From the entire beginning sequence showcasing the utter callousness of a few people to the lengthy singing scene, the buildup was poorly executed. The entire relationship with Landon's father was unbelievable as well and now he suddenly has unfounded ambitions for medical school.

","A Walk to Remember (2002)<br/><br/>Director : Adam Shankman <br/><br/>Cast : Shane West as Landon Carter, Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan <br/><br/>Based on the novel ""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks, the movie is a romantic drama with profound depth. It expounds on the virtues of love and faith - how these can miraculously transform the life of spoiled, misguided teenager. Convicted of a life-threatening prank, Landon Carter is asked to partake in social services and the school play as punishment. It is here that he truly gets to know Jamie Sullivan, the reverend's daughter. Touched by her simplicity and kindness, he falls in love with her and it seems like just another teenage romantic movie until there is a dramatic revelation by Jamie. As the drama unfolds, there are some touching moments too as both try to come to terms with the reality.<br/><br/>Shane West and Mandy Moore have done great justice to their respective roles, eliciting heartfelt emotions from the audience. The beautiful settings (Jamie is a star-seeker!) are a bonus. A love story based on optimism, values and respect, the movie is truly one of its kind and I would give rate it 8 on 10."

However, I must admit that the movie could have done better in terms of how Landon first develops feelings for Jamie. Although Landon asks Jamie to help him run lines for the spring play, the movie does not show any actual scenes of the two of them TOGETHER at Jamie's house running lines for the play.<br/><br/>The only scenes with Landon running lines for the play are of him ALONE, in his bedroom, studying the script, underlining dialog, writing notes, etc.<br/><br/>So, it falls flat for me when Landon tells Jamie that he misses ""spending time"" with her because the movie doesn't show him actually running lines with her; it only shows him and Jamie in dress rehearsals for the play with the director and other members of the cast.<br/><br/>I think the movie should have included several scenes with Landon and Jamie running lines together at her house because this would have provided better build-up to Landon telling her that he missed ""spending time"" with her."

Luckily, I watched it on my laptop while Jeremy Lin was dropping 38 on the Lakers on the big-screen TV.<br/><br/>Actually, the plot and story were pretty good...but they were ruined by cheesy dialogue, over-acting, and a few musical numbers that only a teenage girl could love. While I didn't enjoy the songs, I have to admit that Moore is very talented. If anything, this movie served to showcase how good of an actress she is, as she managed to deliver weakly-written lines with a natural, confident demeanor that captured my attention and made me forget a few times that this movie sucked...but then one of the other cast members would ham it up and I'd remember again very quickly. Coyote also did a decent job with the lines he was given. Hannah's part was bland, and she didn't stand out much at all. And, oh yeah, I guess they were still doing the token Black guy thing in 2002--Al Thompson had on his best tap shoes.<br/><br/>One more thing: I forgot how ridiculous portable CD players looked, until I saw West's character wearing one around his shoulder like a purse.

","This movie made me cry. It was the romance and love so evidently portrayed that made such a compelling story. Stories of love are hard to believe and bring to the movie screen; it usually works better as a novel. The two leads did an excellent job with their respective characters. It starts out as your typical high school movie which was amusing but done well in that it introduces Landon, who is played by a smoking hot Shane West. Mandy Moore was a perfect Jaime. Her pixie like looks and the self-confidence exuding from her character was appropriate. The love unfolding between the two was convincing and great to watch. The music weaved through out was unobtrusive and used wisely. I appreciated that. I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a love story."

"bigbackyard-1","10","0","1","26 November 2006"," Really good Movie
","Really the only reason that I started doing any research into this movie was because of the name of the town. They mentioned Beaufort (pronounced bo-furt) a few times, then when I just watched it again on TV a few minutes ago, they showed a sign saying 'welcome to Beaufort'. I paid attention to location and scenery, because back in the early 80's I lived down in North Carolina. After I had been there for a year and a half or so, I got a job working for the Town of Beaufort. I worked for the town up to the time that I moved back up to Indiana. In total I lived in North Carolina for almost 5 years. I told my wife while watching the movie ( before I found out that it was indeed filmed in North Carolina), I told my wife that there things I saw on there that did look like Beaufort. Especially along the water front, and one view where it showed the downtown area on the waterfront. I have spent much time there along the boardwalk and the downtown area there. I thought it was really cool to find out that it was the same place that I used to live and work in. Here's an FYI fact for anyone that might happen to read this. When the first shuttle exploded on take off back in the 80's, the pilot, Mike smith, was from Beaufort. They erected a monument to him down on the boardwalk that is shown in one scene of the movie."

","I thought this movie could use a lot better acting. West was only partially convincing into the true love story, and the same goes for Moore. However, the plot of the movie itself, I felt to be spectacular. The idea of true love is an idea that is grossly abused by Hollywood, and only this movie has been able to accurately capture true love within such a context. The director could have done a better job coaxing the actors to bring a more cohesive work together, which would have resulted in a 10 rating rather than an 8. Of the mediocre cast, Mandy Moore did the best job in her portrayal of the noble female. In summary, great story, but needs better acting and directing."

"Jim_Hall","10","0","2","25 August 2006"," ""It All Comes Down To Who's By Your Side""
","A Walk to Remember <br/><br/>Rating: PG | for thematic elements, language and some sensual material Theatrical Release: 2002 Runtime: 102 min.<br/><br/>Critique: The foundation for ""A Walk to Remember"" is built upon hope, faith and love. The age old story of good and evil is portrayed here, yet not in a traditional style. The rebellion of Landon and his friends is introduced first. Jamie is portrayed as the preacher's daughter who sets the good example. The contrast of their characteristics is clearly defined in the movie, showing good and evil. Even though resentment is taken against their newfound relationship, they prove their love and stay together. Do you hate sappy love movies? Well this movie is anything but sappy. The care for realistic emotions between Landon and Jamie is carefully created while cheesy love is left in the can. Even though this is a romance, a small amount of comedy is added to keep the movie flowing smoothly. Jamie and Landon soon find themselves facing a serious roadblock. This problem is quite unusual for teen movies because I feel it's something that would be presented to an older audience. I can't reveal the situation since it will give away the movie, but I encourage everyone young and old to view the film. I'm glad this plot was chosen because it's something anyone could face at anytime and it should be considered more in film-making. Although ""A Walk to Remember"" isn't a true story, novelist Nicholas Sparks adds some similar situations in his life to the movie. The crew denies that the movie is a Christian film. However the use of faith, hope, and love develops their relationship. Without these values there wouldn't be a film because it's based on those principals. A specific religion isn't really discussed since it focuses upon a generic stance in the belief in God and the values I just mentioned. What a clever approach to make it basic don't you think? It tries not to offend by taking one side of a religion. The conclusion of the movie is wrapped up very beautifully, being based on faith and love; the values that Jamie cherishes oh so much. You're in for a great experience of faith and hope, proving that love never fails. <br/><br/>*Audio 8/10: There's music ranging from Cold to Switchfoot, however the film score steals the show easily. ""Only Hope"" is performed in it's entirety by Mandy Moore for the school play scene. It's not one of the highlights because it seems to last for an eternity. Shane West(Landon Carter) delivers a voice-over during the start of Mandy Moore's ""Cry"", making it a great way to end the film with a punch. There are some minor errors that could be fixed for the audio, but nothing major. Subtitles are presented in English, French and Spanish. Languages are available in English and French (Dubbed in Quebec) in Dolby Surround 5.1.<br/><br/>*Video: 8/10: A crisp and clear picture is presented throughout the entire film. There is some grain but you have to look close to see it. Beautiful arrays of colors are presented from the filming locations in and around Wilmington, NC. The video is offered in a letterbox widescreen format. Scene access and interactive menus are also available. <br/><br/>*Extras 7/10: The extras are quite nice for the film. Two commentaries are provided, the first by film director Adam Shankman, Shane West and Mandy Moore. The second is by novelist Nicholas Sparks and screenwriter Karen Janszen. A theatrical trailer, cast film highlights, and a music video are also provided. The first commentary is rather outlandish since they seem to goof off rather than giving us good details of the story as in the second commentary. Deleted scenes and a 'making of' should have been added for an in-depth analysis, but they fail to give us that. The best extra is the music video entitled ""Cry"" by Mandy Moore, which is based exclusively on the film.<br/><br/>*Since studios release a variety of DVD editions with extras: the audio, video, and extra reviews may be directed at one specific version."

The handsome rebel, and the angelic good girl. Egad, is this 'Grease'? Where are the musical numbers!? But then, something unexpected happened. The leads broke from most formula conventions and actually started to develop into fleshed out, three dimensional characters. These kids grew into vulnerable, identifiable people driven by real motives. They drew my empathy. I cared about them. I especially liked the way they handled Moore's Christian character. These days, it's rare to see religious people portrayed as sincere and reasonable instead of self-righteous, Bible thumping caricatures.<br/><br/>Yes, it got a little sappy towards the end, but by that time, they had earned my affection, so I didn't really mind. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lowdown's no wuss, but I hafta say, I got a little choked up near the end.<br/><br/>This movie proves my theory that even tired movies formulas can be made new by putting a spin on the way the characters are presented.<br/><br/>If you leave your tired cynicism on hold, you'll enjoy this one."

Both the main characters change subtly, bit by bit, after being influenced by each other. Cinematography was good, and the cameraman's skill is already fully shown at the first scene, where the camera moves in different directions and at different speed to focus on various things that are going on in the youngsters gathering.<br/><br/>I particularly respect the fact that Mandy Moore is portrayed wholesomely, without having to resort to using skin to attract other boys (or the movie goers). There was even not a sex scene, which I have no complaints about. This down-to-earth girl-next-door is attractive without being sexy or glamorous. Sex does not equal love.

","When I first watched this movie it was late one night, around one, on the TV. I wasn't sure what it was about but I thought from the title that it would be another soppy love chick flick, I was dead wrong. This movie shocked me to the core. I expected my happy ending and unfortunately didn't get one but it was satisfying all the same. The story starts off as a typical chick flick always does, the cool guy of the school and the nerdy and geeky girl have to hang out for some reason such as she has to teach him, in this case they have to run lines together for a drama class. As they spend more and more time together they fall in love, deeply in love. The girl is deeply religious and we don't find out why until later. A few days or weeks, it isn't specified, into the relationship the girl tells the boy that she's dying. Hints are given during the film by the girls father but it isn't really recognised until now. The girl slowly starts to die from leukaemia and it's heart breaking but the boy stays by her side all the same. They get married and then she passes away. The last few lines of the movie are beautiful, they are :""Jamie saved my life. She taught me everything. About life, hope and the long journey ahead. I'll always miss her. But our love is like the wind. I can't see it, but I can feel it."" The End."

","I saw the movie a WALK TO REMEMBER a few weeks ago and I must say it is one of my new favorite movies. I doubt Mandy Moore or Shane West will ever see this, but I want them to know they did an awesome, realistic job. I liked especially how Landon shows his love and affection to Jamie and respects her boundaries. I hope to have a love like that someday. I also read the book---Awesome and even sadder. Could not put down. Can't stop thinking about it. There is significant changes from the book to movie. But in general, ""the spirit and Feel"" of the movie is the same as the book. If you want to read or see a true love story, read or watch a Walk to Remember. In conclusion it is a sweet, innocent, compelling, riveting, tear jerking story."

","I first went to an advanced screening of this movie with a large group of women and children. I had no idea what to expect but I can promise you I was not expecting much, as a 38 year old male the prospect of seeing a Mandy Moore film did not thrill me. Wow was I surprised! This is as good a portrayal of what selfless Love between 2 people is supposed to be as anything you will ever see.Mandy Moore was fantastic. Shane West was perhaps even better in as good a performance as I have seen. Perhaps this movie did not get the respect it deserved because of the youthful cast. this whole cast should be able to look back in years to come at this movie and know they were part of something very special"

","I only came across this film very recently (within the last year) and was completely hooked by the storyline from my very first viewing.<br/><br/>Since then I have lost count of the times I have watched it, yet on every single viewing the film impresses me more and is definitely one of my favourite films. The script and monologue within the film is powerful and emotive which is greatly aided by the amazing chemistry between Shane West and Mandy Moore's characters. I cannot truly express in words how this film makes you feel, you are taken in by the story and the characters and become a part of the trials and tribulations they face in a relationship that occurs against the odds. <br/><br/>A refreshing film that really encompasses the true meaning of romance and the traditional values of courtship. Its impossible not to completely fall in love with the characters and the storyline. <br/><br/>A Walk to Remember is a simple yet powerful and extremely emotive story of love and the traditional values of romance. A truly inspiring and amazing film that you will not forget, a 'must see' film."

","The story is simple: a rebel boy with a broken childhood (Shane West) gets placed with a good Christian girl (Mandy Moore) and she begins to change him into a better person. Yes, the plot is really that simple.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie a bit more than a handful of times and would go so far as to say the film is my third favorite movie of all time (behind ""Mallrats"" and ""Waterworld""). So if my opinion is a little biased, my sincerest apologies.<br/><br/>The star of this film is Shane West, who went on to be a big star on the television show ""ER"" and the mismanaged film ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". I was convinced that he was a rebel, a lover and a confused little boy. He seemed very good at expressing a wide range of feelings and it was easy to identify with him. Excellent casting, especially considering at the time he was an unknown.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore also stars, but she is clearly following Shane's lead. With the exception of her solo scene (where she will amaze you with her vocal beauty and stunning good looks), she doesn't really do very much. She walks with her head down and talks in a monotone voice. There are times where I wasn't sure if this was bad acting or a poorly written character. But maybe you won't notice. I didn't notice until my third or fourth viewing (and I think it helps if you're watching with someone you care about). Even in her solo scene, the director seems to be unsure of what angle he wants to work with, which seems to distract from the whole. My friend Shannon also found the song a bit long, although I disagree. <br/><br/>Multiple viewings are required to pick up on all the subtle hints left throughout the film about the twist. You might catch some, but others you will completely miss. I guarantee. <br/><br/>I think the budget went almost entirely to the soundtrack. Daryl Hannah (""Kill Bill"", ""Blade Runner"") and Peter Coyote (""Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis"") must have worked for free, because there are something like thirty songs in this movie (including at least three by Mandy Moore, but a variety of other things like Jars of Clay and ""Big Pimpin"" appear). If you pay attention to just the music, you'll notice very few scenes aren't loaded with some song -- so again, is the movie selling the soundtrack or is the soundtrack selling the movie? <br/><br/>But anyway, yeah, watch this with someone you love. You might cry your eyes out. I did on my first viewing in the theater with my girlfriend at the time. Of course, if you're a girl, you might cry anyway. And that's cool. Guys like chicks who cry. We totally dig that. Why do you think we let you watch Lifetime? This film, like Lifetime, is a guilty pleasure -- maybe nothing Oscar-worthy, but a fun and emotional movie. Also, it makes a great precursor for the much bigger and much sadder Nicholas Sparks masterpiece, ""The Notebook""."

","This movie is one of the precious memories that I cherish having shared together with my late wife. I still vividly remember tears streaming down my face as we watched a simple seemingly predictable plot unfold into a profound statement about life and living. <br/><br/>Mandy Moore donned this part so very naturally, almost as if perhaps written for her from the start. It is not a musical, but she does sing a couple of times and though I probably watched this movie 3 or 4 years ago, her songs had such an impact on me, that I can still comment on them now.<br/><br/>Treat someone you love to an unforgettable evening by watching this together."
"grapey_science_project","10","0","1","25 April 2006"," one of the best movies ever
","This is by far my favorite movie that i have ever seen, even the book is excellent. it is the tale about two young teenagers, Jaime Sullivan (Moore) and Landon Carter (West) and how they are put together after Landon gets into some serious trouble with the law. They come from two totally different lifestyles, Jaimes dad is a Reverend, and Landons dad is a doctor who walked out on his family.<br/><br/>It is a very touching love story, as many young people can relate to this plot. Jaime had Landon promise that she wouldn't fall in love with him, but he did. He took care of her and loved her right to the end.<br/><br/>Nicholas Sparks wrote a great book, even though it didn't follow along with the movie. Everything was very twisted, as things that happen at the end of the movie, happen at the beginning and vice versa. He is the only male author that i have ever read anything by that had a more touching theme than any female author i have read anything by. He also writes my favorite book, The Notebook. These are two amazing books and movies. (and Ryan Gosling is even Canadian)!"

"mrchips71","8","0","1","23 April 2006"," Flawed but touching film
","""A Walk to Remember"" will upset older viewers and some young ones, too. The film itself is excellent. It brought tears to my eyes, and justly so. My only caveat is that the original beginning of the story, set forty years ago, as it appears in Spark's book, which I read, was so different from the vulgarity of the film's modern day opening that it upset me.Also, changing the Christmas play to a spring play about gangsters also jarred me.These changes had an effect on the tone of the film and its prevailing mood which Sparks worked so hard to create in the book. Despite some other changes, the story and the acting of the two main characters was so compelling that it overcame my initial negative reaction. I would highly recommend this film, but don't read the book first. I'll never understand why film makers insist on dumbing down teenage stories with scenes that are not really typical of most of them, who are more sensitive than many Hollywood types realize."
"CarsonTrent","7","0","2","20 April 2006"," Liked it
","There are certain movie genres that traditionally don't attract me at all. Love movies usually aim to make the women identify with the female lead, and let's face it, are meant to squeeze a few tears. The story is always a little too dramatic, and you'll come to expect the stereotypes of betrayal, impossible love or tragic death. 'Love Story' is perhaps the perfect example for this, and I believed a 'cheesy' romance will never make me turn from my usual routine. I was wrong. This movie, which owes much to 'Love Story', and features teen pop-singer Mandy Moore(whose music I never listen to), virtually without any acting experience, of course guided by the script, gives life to this pure, smart, integer and delicately feminine high-school girl who mesmerized me with her stoic attitude towards destiny, and made me watch the entire movie. I couldn't hold myself from feeling a little like Shane West's character discovering her. Somewhat moved."
"lyxxzen","9","0","1","17 April 2006"," A Truly Painful Film
","I won't dispel any specific plot points or comment on them, as I feel that the strength of this movie is not in it's plot (not to say it's plot isn't good, it is) but in it's power, it's emotion. The performances, soundtrack and direction are done to elicit the greatest possible emotion from the viewer, and it does that without breaking a sweat. It makes you feel like crying and never stopping, and yet you still feel like coming back for more (and coming from someone who doesn't let that part of myself out, that's saying something). Not to say you'll want to watch it repeatedly, but probably every couple of years (or even yearly if you have a poor memory) you'll feel compelled to revisit he movie, just make sure you have some Kleenex handy"

"winterstorm1990","10","0","1","14 April 2006"," A bit corny, and not without flaws, but...
","I loved it! As a 16 year old male, I have never really been into movies like this before, but last week, whilst flicking through the channels late at night I came across A Walk to Remember. (if you must know, it was the only thing on at the time, so I didn't plan in advance to watch.) Despite missing the first 20 minutes, I quickly picked up the plot and began to really enjoy it. I honestly couldn't see Jamie's illness coming (although like I said it was late at night) and from that moment on I was captivated. So much in fact, that the next day I went out and bought the DVD and the book, and proceeded to enjoy and finish both by the end of the day.<br/><br/>I had not heard of either Mandy Moore or Shane West before watching so you can imagine my surprise when I found out that this was Mandy's first leading role. I thought she portrayed Jamie Sullivan, the minister's daughter and all round good girl, brilliantly. She brought a certain innocence to the performance which is impossible to learn, probably on reflection due to lack of experience, which really added to my enjoyment. Shane West did an admirable job as Landon Carter, the town's bad boy whose life gets turned around when he spends a bit of time with Jamie.<br/><br/>The film was so good in fact that I would put on a level with the book. Usually the film never lives up to the novel it is based upon and so is often disappointing in my eyes, but that is not the case here. The soundtrack (which I now also own) adds something to the film that the book cannot have, and in particular the songs ""Only hope"" and ""Cry"" (sung by Moore) were excellent and appropriate to the scene they were in. I also think that the film portrays the character of Jamie Sullivan better as well, as in the book she is made out to be a saint who does absolutely nothing wrong and is somewhat one dimensional (almost robotic), which I thought was slightly unrealistic. She is made out to be more human with feelings in the film. (the emotional scenes were played very well by Mandy Moore, I really felt for her) However, she is made out to be slightly sarcastic in the movie, for example in the ""Read my mind"" scene and where she puts down Dean. (""he (God) is probably looking for your brain"") I don't think that she would have had a pop at her God, if she was a really devoted Christian. The list of ambitions that Jamie has is also a nice addition.<br/><br/>The corny bits? Well one immediately springs to mind. What sort of person says to another person on a serious level ""You have to promise not to fall in love with me""? Maybe if it was a joke, then perhaps, but you can see that she really means it. Obviously later we find out why she says it, but even Jamie, who does not have many if any friends, could not be that naive.<br/><br/>So why give it 10 out of 10 if it has flaws? No movie is perfect, and the impact that this movie has had on me is greater than any other. It is a truly touching story of love, the impacts that love has on people, and the obstacles that people are willing to over come in the name of love.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic and very moving story that I would recommend to anyone."

But yesterday, by the time the movie was half way through, I found myself crying in my bed like a child.(I was watching in my room) It was so sad, I never really cry with a movie, sometimes on the inside but never like yesterday. During commercials, I had to took a box of handkerchiefs, and even when the movie was done, I have been crying for half an hour.

","I watched the movie lot of times (at theater, at home, at my friends' house even at my aunt's house) and I always end up crying every time. Shane West (Landon Carter) and Mandy Moore (Jamie Sullivan) both gave outstanding performances to their film characters and the chemistry is perfect (awesome!). Though the film is like four years ago, way back when I was seventeen. I still believe that this film offers more than just a teen movie. More than just an ugly-duckling-Cinderella plot. More than just a teenage-courtship love story. There's more to that... Lessons not only teenagers should learn. It is for everyone who yearns for their own walks to be remembered. Humility, simplicity, forgiveness, trust, faith, miracle and true-love that might somehow change or make you think twice regarding your perception of people, of love, of faith and most especially the purpose of your life."

She makes a list of what she want to do in life , that list comes true .

I thoroughly enjoyed the book (it is one of the only books that made me cry) and was psyched that there was already a movie.<br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed how they changed the time period and the reasons why Landon's father was out of the picture, and how Landon got to see Jamie in the play... heck, that the play was changed from a Christmas play to just a high school drama club effort...the production team took A lot of liberties with this story! Over-all, I still loved this movie. I loved watching the character grow, seeing how everyone changed in the film, everyone changed for Jamie. The wedding was just beautiful! I highly recommend this film!!"

","OK, so first let me tell, that I've read the book before I saw the film. And actually I read the book for five or more times. So I Loved it, and when I realized that blondie Mandie Moore was about to star in it, I decided, not to watch it. Than I was at home, watching TV on HBO, and they started a movie, and that was it... And I watched, and enjoyed it (except from the first five or six minutes, that was I think very badly done), and I cried on it, like a baby, although I have never cried while reading the book(only for the first time). So actually I really think, Mandy Moore was great in this movie, she was actually perfect in it. She made me laugh, made me cry and made me fall in love with her (altough I am a girl). She was magical. Shane West for Landon, I think that is also a great choice. He has this incredible talent, playing the-not-so-lovely-guys, and he made this incredible soul-metamorphosis Landon goes through not just believable, but understandable. Peter Coyote and Darryl Hannah was also good, big thumbs up for them... I really think this movie is good, and wish all the Nicholas Spark-adaptations were this good, which are they not, sadly..."

","***May contain spoilers*** <br/><br/>I'm very curious about those viewers giving this film a 10....and I'm also curious about viewers who genuinely cried during this film.<br/><br/>A cynical review would call it a mediocre version of the overdone pretty-girl-dies-a-long-and-sad-death genre like Love Story or Terms of Endearment. The film on one level is absolutely dripping with sentimentality and unrealistically poetic exchanges between the main characters. The cynic in me could not help but roll my eyes at the sheer transparent let's-make-the-audience-cry attempt by the director and screenwriter.<br/><br/>However...I won't trash it completely. Shane West and Mandy Moore are wonderful young actors and they shine in their roles. The DVD features a fun commentary by the director, Moore and West as they giggle and reminisce about shooting the film. And the music soundtrack is great.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad. If you're a 12-year old in the mood for a good cry or if you're an unfashionable Christian who has felt what it's like to be ""uncool"" (ie: like Mandy Moore's character), this film will delight you."

You are not able to get sentimental? - don't watch it! I like many genres, drama, historical, science fiction..., You name it. Only once before I was so touched, that I had to cry even on the day after and that was STAND BY ME. In my view everything was perfect. Really great actors fitting into their roles, the right words at the right time, not always predictable turnings. But most of all it was as good as real, I ""believed"" the story, I felt the love and the pain, enjoyed the humor and the even greater love afterwards. The brutal part for me is the extremely sad ending with a little touch of happiness. I once wrote a song, lining ""...we had something others never ever have, a glimpse of heaven..."", but after seeing this movie I don't know if I ever had that glimpse.

HBO, Cinemax, etc. are fine. But I just watched its network premiere on the WB, and I must admit I was very disappointed.

It was edited poorly as well, and those who only see it in this manner will not get the full effect of this amazing movie.

"SFTVLGUY2","Null","0","2","7 November 2004"," ADULT NOVEL IS TRANSFORMED INTO TEEN FLICK
","Although ""A Walk to Remember"" revolves around the developing relationship between two teens in their Senior year of high school in a small North Carolina town, it's doubtful that when Nicholas Sparks wrote his novel he anticipated it would be adapted to the screen as a movie marketed to the same age group as his protagonists. It's as unlikely that the crowd drawn to this film by the presence of Mandy Moore ever read the book on which it's based as it is that those adults who made it a bestseller will enjoy it very much. For one of those reasons only Hollywood screenwriters seem to understand, the plot has been altered to make Landon a delinquent forced to participate in the spring play as part of the community service required of him; in the book, he was guilt-free and his motivation to perform in the traditional Christmas pageant was of a far more personal nature. Furthermore, as portrayed by the attractive and confident Moore, Jamie is far from the ""Plain Jane"" described by Sparks, and her miscasting impacts a major plot point involving Landon's bewilderment as he finds himself slowly falling in love with a nondescript and inexperienced girl. The tragedy they face will bring teen girls to tears and no doubt cause their dates to squirm. Recommended for ages fourteen through eighteen; adult fans of the novel should avoid disappointment and stay away."

"jazzilm","Null","0","1","4 July 2003"," They hit and COMPLETELY missed it.
","WARNING: Spoilers for those who decide to see the movie and have not as of yet (although I would recommend otherwise).<br/><br/>This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The basic plot (quirky girl who knows how to live life to the fullest meets shallow boy who doesn't know how to live, they fall in love, she dies) is all right, but it had too many flaws to make it into a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>It had its good parts.  The acting was good in the movie; Shane West did a fine job and Mandy Moore was all right (although she should stick to singing, in my personal opinion).  The messages and ideas that paralleled the plot were sweet, although could have been presented better.  However, its many flaws shadow its good parts to no extent.<br/><br/>Firstly, and most importantly, the characters weren't loveable.  In order to connect with a movie and enjoy it to the fullest, you must first love the characters and empathize with them.  I had no empathy whatsoever when I watched this movie.  I like the idea of a quirky but wise girl teaching a boy who doesn't know how to live (although ""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli really sold the idea), but Moore's character was a little too quirky and unlovable; the same goes for West's character.  Not only were they unlovable, but West's character remained inconsistent throughout the entire movie- he goes from badass punk teenager to wise, educated, and kind man with no flaws whatsoever.  The only flaws I would have preferred to see in this movie were simple personality flaws in West's character, Brandon, that remained consistent through the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot had serious flaws that were not acceptable.  Brandon is banished to do the school play, auditions and is terrible at it, and yet lands the lead?  Too unbelievable.  He turns to Moore's character, Jamie, a girl he absolutely despises for assistance in rehearsing for the play. Given time that would have allowed Jamie and Brandon to get to know and respect each other, this would have been acceptable.  However, this happens so quickly it's simply not believable at all.  Which brings me to my third point.<br/><br/>Things move too quickly in the movie to make sense.  I like the concept of falling in love so fast and so suddenly, you don't know what to do with yourself (Love in the Time of Cholera, anyone?).  The way it's presented, however, is in a manner that leaves the audience stranded and confused, even yet more unable to love the characters.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but let me just sum it up:  it had a nice concept and the potential to be an amazing film, but it completely missed the target. It makes an attempt at having depth and insight, but does the two concepts no justice.  If you're into sappy teenage stories that happen to be CRAP, then watch it.  But I'd recommend using the film's message about living life to fullest and use the two hours you WOULD spend watching this god-awful movie doing something a little more productive."

However, the movie made no reference that Mandy Moore was going to be sick....until that scene ""I'm sorry, I can't see you anymore."" My first reaction, well it must be because of her father. But then I decided to listen to the reason - ""I have leukemia"". Someone in the theatre yelled out ""WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSH**!!!"" I mean, honestly. There are like 250 movies that end this way.

Most people would imagine the movie would be something of an abomination since it stars a teen-idol pop singer, as did I. To my surprise, the movie turned out very well, and remains one of my favorite movies. <br/><br/>The third time I saw the movie, I really became engaged in the plot development and dialogues, picking up alot of information. This is what I've discovered: The movie is basically an exploration into the power of love as a motivating and life-changing force. Not only will you see a change in Landon, but you will see him change relationships with the people around him as Jamie changes his own life. He becomes more supportive of his mother, he creates a bond with his father(who is divorced) that wasn't previously made, he creates a new identity with his friends after the fight at the cafeteria, which actually puts him closer to his friends after they discover what Landon has gone through, and he eventually becomes a shining star in Jamie's father's eyes. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is also very good with Mandy Moore's ""Only Hope"" and ""It's gonna be Love"", ""Someday We'll Know"", ""Cry"", and New Radical's ""Mother We Just Can't Get Enough"". The song placements are near perfect in creating the right mood, especially with ""Mother We Just Can't Get Enough"". This will be one of the most special movies you will ever see, it ranks up there with Chasing Amy and Love Story. Go watch it now!"

Shane West (BATON ROUGE!) was rather good in my opinion and really led the cast.  Mandy Moore... well, Mandy did better than I expected - but I wasn't expecting much.  She needed more life more joy in the beginning.  I realize she is sick but they make her so serious and boring.  She doesn't giggle and grin and do stuff a normal person would do. I realize also that she is very conservative but conservative people can have a good laugh too!  Still, about halfway through she starts to improve. Everyone else is ok but I liked Lauren German who played the exgirlfriend especially.  She did a nice job of giving that character just the right amount of significance.

I heard that Nicholas Sparks didn't give consent on the script, but the writer(s) still strayed far from the original story. The movies is *very loosely* based on the book -- I believe only the characters' names are the same in both. Don't be fooled: the movie isn't set in the 50s as the book is, but rather the 90s. The plot is not as smooth-flowing as it is in the novel. I would recommend a visit to the local library than to the local theater.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I think that Shane West did quite well as Landon, although Mandy Moore was not as convincing to me as Jamie. Peter Coyote did as best as he could as Reverand Sullivan, but the character was to be much older and more indifferent; not as mean to his daughter or to her new love. And I have to say that the ending was bad as well. They should have stuck with the original ending ... I won't give it away.

There's the high school play, the first kiss, the lunchroom hierarchy; all that's missing is the soda shop. (Don't these kids have cell phones? Don't they spend endless hours instant-messaging one another?) Then it goes all Hallmark and soft-focus, heavy-handedly folds in religion, and springs its unsurprising surprise about its heroine (and Mandy Moore, especially in the early scenes, is quirky and interesting and probably too good for this material). Finally it staggers to a gooey conclusion, by which time virtually every character has forgiven every other character for everything. You don't have to be too much of a cynic to question that. Maybe some very impressionable teenage girls will respond to this Nutrasweet dish; I'm not so sure about the rest of us. It's like Ned Flanders' kids' idea of a date movie."

","It's kind of hard to write a review on this movie because there's only so much that I can say without ruining the entire plot for everyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll try my best not to do so. Anyway, I had read the novel 'A Walk to Remember' in which this movie was based on a few years ago and I was kind of disappointed to see that the film didn't stay very true to the book. There were ALOT of differences, almost too many, so if you're one of those people who like it when movies stay true to their adoptive novels then you might not like this one. I however did enjoy the film very much; it was cheesy at times but it had a very touching and memorable storyline along with some pretty fine acting if I do say so myself. Mandy Moore is a beautiful girl and it was VERY hard to make her role as the school outcast seem believable (it kinda worked), and Shane West did pretty good as his role of the bad guy turned good. The last half-hour of this movie is quite depressing; I don't think there was a dry eye in the theatre as the final scenes were very touching and sad. Overall I'd say it was a pretty good movie and I do recommend it to those who enjoy mushy romantic stuff. If you're not a fan of romance then you probably shouldn't waste your time seeing this one. Kudos to the entire cast and crew of ""A Walk to Remember"" for doing a superb job!"

","This is one of those movies that you'll remember for a lifetime. I just saw the movie like 5 min. ago, it was great. The classic story of love is mastered in this movie based on the book by Nicholas Sparks. When Shane West cried I had to cry.... Guys crying are my weak point. I couldn't help myself. Shane West and Mandy Moore make this story so believable you feel for all the characters. Especially that the movie states it true... that love is a leap of faith. My friends and I could have made an ocean with all our tears!! This is the greatest movie!!!! And one of my  favorites!!!"
