"mrcaw1","8","78","85","30 August 2006"," Quality film making from Disney
","Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal."
"blanbrn","8","69","78","25 August 2006"," Support the underdog, after the movie you will smile!
","After just seeing ""Invincible"" I must say thumbs up! Way to go that finally after 30 years this true story is brought to the big screen. Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan, but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and part-time school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him, to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him, but thru his will and determination to make it, because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a blue-collar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie, especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable, but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons, well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil, overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more real-life NFL movies are made about players, because ""Invincible"" sets the standard."
"ruby_fff","8","27","29","30 August 2006"," Wahlberg and Kinnear seem so easy wearing their roles naturally in this NFL sanctioned film about Philadelphia Eagles' Vince Papale and Coach Dick Vermeil
","Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.<br/><br/>Papale and Vermeil - they needed each other (or fate brought them together). In a way, both are in the same boat: struggling to gain confidence by the rest of the team. Against all odds, they did it and won over the rest of the South Philly Eagles team and the PA fans. Yes, it is inspirational. Yes, it's been told before. Why so different? This film being NFL sanctioned is the more earnest in getting it right in every respect for authenticity. The shots of the different plays and athletic moves get up close and real with a trained acting team and augmented sound design.<br/><br/>Double duty as director of photography and director of his debut feature film, Ericson Core, faithfully puts us in the year 1976 recreated. The Jim Croce song that started the film ""I Got A Name"" is reminiscently catchy and hints at the personal struggles of Papale. With Sara Knowles (""Gattaca"") production design, Susan Lyall (""Mississippi Masala"") costume design, vital Football Coordinator Mark Ellis (""Miracle"") who studied/choreographed the plays and moves for specific film shoot, and having Vince Papale and Dick Vermeil as consultants at hand, Brad Gann's script and a strong supportive team of producers, all made ""INVINCIBLE"" unarguably a worthwhile film to see.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema with no expectations - feeling fortunate to see Wahlberg and Kinnear both in one movie. I find the film heartwarming (a tearjerker for me, too). It encourages roots: remember the buddy friends, neighborhood community and parents who'd stand by us. The tenacity to not give up - keep trying, focus on task at hand - doing your best is no failure no matter what others may think. The integrity of one's character and believing in oneself is not easy to sustain in hard times. Support system close to you is important: Papale has Janet's encouragement and Vermail has his wife's timely reminders. We need such spirits genuinely emanated in films like ""Invincible."" <br/><br/>Greg Kinnear came a long way from the remake of ""Sabrina"" opposite Harrison Ford. His diverse roles in ""As Good As It Gets"" opposite Jack Nicholson, ""Auto Focus"" opposite Willem Dafoe, ""The Matador"" opposite Pierce Brosnan, and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" along with an ensemble of talents, demonstrated how vastly skillful he's become. Mark Wahlberg can be underrated - it's almost all him in ""Boogie Nights"", funny fantastic in ""The Big Hit"", quietly solid in ""The Yard"" (opposite James Caan), 'funkily' good in ""Rock Star"", smooth action in ""The Italian Job"" remake, gritty action in ""Four Brothers"" - he holds his own in a wide variety of complex and challenging roles, be it ""Three Kings"" or ""I Heart Huckabees""."
"foolishewe","8","48","55","23 August 2006"," Good Story telling, brings back memories
","I just came from and advanced screening tonight and it was an entertaining feel-good movie. The movie is based on a true ""local guy makes good"" story, and quite entertaining (although after searching online for Papale, it appears that they may have taken a bit of dramatic license with some of the details). The story telling and acting were good. I think Kinnear's presentation of Dick Vermeil (I remember seeing Vermeil on the local T.V. a lot back then) was outstanding. Mark Wahlberg gave a credible performance as a determined underdog here, he seems to be maturing as an actor, and from what I could tell was in good physical condition to play this role. Kirk Acevado and Mark Raspoli put in good supporting performances as (sometime) supportive friends and relatives. The movie is an O.K. family movie if you don't mind a bit of swearing and sports/football violence (tackles, blocks and those sorts of things).<br/><br/>I grew up in eastern Pennsylvania, and can remember the atmosphere in my home town and, to a lesser extent, Philadelphia at that time. The decline of manufacturing, labor disputes and unemployment/hardship on workers and their families was well presented. My recollections of the Eagles were that the team was pretty weak and the fans being very vocal in their disappointment (this is a Philadelphia tradition for all their sports, it isn't just reserved for football). Among my favorite scenes is some neighborhood football that brought back some memories (although our games were a bit less brutal). There are a number of funny scenes in the movie and quick one-liners (which I won't spoil here)."
"redmama34","7","48","57","27 August 2006"," From A Philly Boy - A Feel Good Story That Does A Good Job Recreating 70's Philly Life
","First off - I'm biased. Let me get that out of the way first. I grew up in Center City Philly during the 70's and am a life-long Eagles fan. So, I was pretty excited to see the movie to get juiced for the upcoming 2006 Eagles season while also hoping to relive Philly life from 1976.<br/><br/>The movie starts by giving us some background on the plight of the 1975 Eagles (a pretty bad team) and Vince Papale (a man pretty down on his luck). Little did both the team and Vince know their fortunes were about to change with the arrival of Dick Vermeil, the new head coach of the Eagles.<br/><br/>The basic need of any biographical movie is that it MUST establish a relationship with the audience in order for us to be emotionally connected to the movie. I would say that Invincible only does a ""so-so"" job with this. For example, I recently saw ""Walk The Line"", if that movie does one thing well is it makes us really care about Johnny Cash and June Carter. On the other hand, Mark Wahlberg's version of Vince Papale keeps us at a distance while offering only limited insight into what really makes Vince tick. It doesn't help that the script keeps Mark's lines to a minimum. This doesn't seem to jive with the real Vince Papale, a very high energy man who always has something to say. On the other hand, Greg Kinnear does a GREAT rendition of Dick Vermeil. He really nailed Dick in personality and mannerisms.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie are the visuals. The movie does a great job recreating Philadelphia life in 1976, what it was like to be an Eagle fan in the 70's and 1970's NFL life before the mega-millions contracts and cushy locker rooms with every amenity imaginable. These aspects of the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>However, there were a couple noticeable misses in this recreation. There was no mention at all of the 1976 Bicentennial in the movie. This was a pretty big miss since the entire city was wrapped up in the celebration. Another thing that puzzled me was the ""woes us"" attitude from the Phiilly fans in the movie. This really wasn't the case in Philadelophia at the time. Yes, the Eagles were bad, but the Phillies made the playoffs that year, the Sixers went to the NBA finals behind Dr. J, and the Flyers had just won two Stanley Cups. While I'm on the portrayal of the Philly fans, some of it was a little over the top. When the Eagles are losing by several touchdowns late in the game, everyone doesn't stay to boo, and we certainly don't threaten other fans to stay. I laughed at most of it because I knew it was more caricature than real life. But I know there are people out there who think thats how Philly fans really are. From me to you, it's more myth than fact.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving the movie 7 out of 10. But, if Vince Papale were a Giant, I'd only give it 6 out of 10."
"editor-299","7","14","15","22 August 2006"," Good film with a terrific soundtrack
","Never underestimate the power of a good story, decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's ""Invincible,"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear, brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries, including ""Remember The Titans,"" and last's year's golf film, ""The Greatest game Ever Played,"" so they know their stuff.<br/><br/>""Invincible"" is the biographical tale of down-on-his-luck Vince Papale (Wahlberg), who is a pretty fair street football player in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s. He is also a substitute teacher, but when he loses that gig, is forced to tend bar part-time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his team, the NFL Eagles  mired in several seasons of last-place finishes (making the franchise the joke of the NFC East)  hires a new head coach, Dick Vermeil (Kinnear), who decides to hold an open tryout for players. It's looked upon as a joke, and hundreds of untalented and out-of-shape clowns show up at Veteran's Stadium for the event, even Vince (who never played college ball and is sure he is not good enough to get a second look). On a fluke, however, he is the only walk-on allowed to go to training camp.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he becomes sort of a neighborhood celebrity, and develops a sweet love affair with his boss' cousin, Janet (Elizabeth Banks, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" the TV series, Scrubs""), a die-hard New York Giants fan.<br/><br/>He impresses Vermeil enough to make it down to the final cut, but what happens after that, you'll have to find out yourself.<br/><br/>Wahlberg might be a tad bit small for an NFL player (he's much smaller than the real Papale), but he is appropriately well-built; and his low-key performance gives real pathos to his character.<br/><br/>It's Kinnear, however, who steals the picture. I must admit, when he first appears on screen, there are a few giggles; but he eases into the role of the harried skipper (whom many did not expect to last the year) and does a tremendous job.<br/><br/>Lastly, since the story takes place in 1975 (the year my old favorite team, the St. Louis Cardinals, won the NFC East), you would expect the soundtrack to blast some high quality tunes. In this respect, the film does not disappoint. Tunes from The Who, Jim Croce, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Canned Heat, Edgar Winter Group, Grand Funk Railroad, Rod Stewart, Elvin Bishop, Rare Earth and others, highlights this movie-going experience.<br/><br/>A bit sappy, at times, but overall, a nice little biopic that is one of the more inspiring movies of 2006."
"pookey56","8","10","11","26 August 2006"," male bonding
","Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person, i am a fan of his films and his work, and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home, since i remember Vince Papale, how bad the Eagles were, Dick Vermeil and of course, the infamous Tom Landry, so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too, and, thankfully, i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film, and for the most part, it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting, which for me was the essence of this film, and that was, camaraderie, support, atmosphere, and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too, the seeming A**h** who turned out to be a courageous, self-sacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead (remake).I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects, with the exception of The Fast and the Furious, and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated, such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number, 83, taped on his back; and he saw his friends playing football in the mud, a long-held tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment, strikes, and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes, this film was very formulaic. But the film was ""inspired"" by a real person; a son of Philadelphia; the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end, for a less abrupt denouement; but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage, determination, the American dream, family and friends. Those aspects came through very well, even in spite of Papale's life-long struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans."
"jenld1029","10","34","46","25 August 2006"," Great Underdog Story!
","Not just for Philadelphia Eagles fans, but for all sports fans who love a great underdog story. Watching this film, I was transported back to the gritty streets of South Philly in 1976, watching the impossible dream unfold for a guy down on his luck, but determined to change his life with his love for football -- and for his favorite team, the Eagles. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job playing the improbable hero Vince Papale. The supporting cast is also very good, with a great turn by Elizabeth Banks, who believes in Vince's dream of making it in the NFL. It shows that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. A film for the whole family to enjoy!"
"pjh0704","10","24","34","4 October 2006"," Such a great film
","I gave this film a 10 rating which is highly unusual for me. But, upon reflection, I could find NOTHING wrong with it. The actors are perfectly cast. The musical score is great at transporting you back to the day. The scripting is wonderfully low-key and seemingly true to life. There is no overwhelming sentimentality, yet there is also no unnecessary violence or foul language. In short, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Wahlberg can consider this one of his shining moments. As can the rest of the cast. I'm not even a football fan. But, after reading strong reviews, especially about Wahlberg's performance, I took a chance and went. On my ""Mom's night out."" I was thinking ""If this stinks, then I've wasted a night that won't come around for another week or two."" I came home and told my husband ""Honey, we've got to see this football film together."" He looked at me as though I'd lost my mind. If they made more sports films like this one, then I'd go. I'll be buying the DVD. For the whole family."
"ReelCheese","6","17","24","27 August 2007"," Standard Underdog Pic
","Somewhat loosely based on a true story, INVINCIBLE is your standard root-for-the-underdog sports movie, nothing more, nothing less. Mark Wahlberg is Vince Papale, a beefy touch football player/bartender who struts his stuff at an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. Overcoming tremendous odds, Papale cracks the roster after earning the faith of rookie coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear).<br/><br/>INVINCIBLE probably would have been better as a less family-friendly film. Everything happens so cleanly in this Disney pic that it loses some of its realism and credibility. The audience may also feel cheated given the extreme liberties the writers took with the Papale story, including a complete disregard for his pro pigskin experience, fabricating an open-to-the-public tryout and the invention of a ""you won't amount to anything"" note from Papale's former partner. No bio pic is 100 per cent truthful, but this is going a bit too far.<br/><br/>While there is a certain charm and inspirational underpinning to INVINCIBLE, it can't hold a handle to many of the other entries of the same genre. It's one of those movies that can be summed up with four words: good but never great. The performances are good but never great. The direction is good but never great. The list goes on. Junior high-aged kids will probably appreciate this one the most."
"bedwar2","10","24","37","24 August 2006"," One of the best stories of the year
","I was very pleasantly surprised as to how good this movie was. I haven't seen a movie this good all year. It is a great story not only about Vince Papale but also Dick Vermeil's first season as coach in Philly. Growing up in South Jersey and seeing many Eagles games as a kid, Disney did an excellent job making you feel like you were in Veteran's Stadium in the mid-70's. The stadium announcer even sounded identical to the one at the old Vet. This is a story line every bit as good as Rudy and in my opinion, better. The shots of the city of Philadelphia are good. You will not be disappointed by this one! I went into the movie thinking that I wouldn't hate it but I wouldn't love it either, but I was wrong, it was much better than I would have thought. And it is extra special for an Eagles fan, but great for all football fans."
"tavm","8","6","7","25 August 2006"," Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are inspirational in Invincible
","I have a friend here in Baton Rouge, La. who was very anxious to see this movie, so for his 38th birthday (which was actually on August 22) I decided to take him to this and pay all admission and concession. From the beginning with Jim Croce's ""I Got a Name"" to the exciting end with Vince Papale's triumphant touchdown in his first regular home game, this was one inspirational movie! Mark Wahlberg does a fine job portraying the sad-sack Philadelphian. Greg Kinnear is equally good as a former college football coach taking a chance on an only ""open tryout"" player who only did high school games. The best scenes are the ones taking place during the first regular season game at the Dallas Cowboy stadium and then the first regular home game opposite the New York Giants (which Vince's girlfriend Janet supports!). By the way, my birthday friend really enjoyed this movie so on his and my recommendation, by all means seek this one out!"
"eva-whitley","2","11","16","6 October 2007"," Annoying they took so many liberties with the truth
","Vince Papale was a SUBSTITUTE teacher at my high school (and his), which is not, and has never been, in South Philadelphia. South Philly has had many famous people come from it; my town has one: Vince Papale. Was it so hard to give us that? They gloss over his pre-Eagles life, but I guess it couldn't be an inspirational feel-good movie if they had stuck to the truth, i.e. he came from the suburbs, he had a career as a professional football player before he played for the Eagles, etc.<br/><br/>But part of the appeal is that it's supposed to be ""true to life."" With this many liberties with the truth, I can't suspend my disbelief enough to get into this movie.<br/><br/>They managed to snip everything that was interesting to me and turn it into another clichéd ""underdog struggles against odds to become accomplished person."" Nice, but not particularly novel and using the truth might have made for a more complex and nuanced story.<br/><br/>Well, they did the same thing with REMEMBER THE TITANS, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But we're seen the movie before, so if you liked RUDY or movies like that, this is pretty much the same thing. OK if you want the same old, same old."
"elgrampo77","7","2","2","8 May 2019"," A feel-good sports movie

","I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! I met Dick Vermeil in '75 when he was recruiting my h.s. boyfriend to play for UCLA just prior to his leaving for Philly - nice guy (but the boyfriend went w/ Mike White at Cal - GO BEARS!). Dick is a class act; that he gave the time of day to me, a high school wide receiver's girlfriend says something about the man.<br/><br/>** SPOILER ALERT ** Thank you, too, Mark Wahlberg! Excellent performance. I felt the despair of Vince after his (short-sighted) wife left him so clearly. And the uncertainty of laying it all on the line to try out for your beloved Eagles; that was amazing. You all were faithful to that mid-70's vibe as well. It was huge for me that you included Jackson Browne's These Days as part of the soundtrack. That was one of my top two favorite songs in high school. The whole local boy makes good thing is always a joy to behold. This film has heart and soul and it bothers me that on comcast it rates only 2 stars (who are these critics, anyway?!?) - I'd give it a solid three and a half. If you love football and like a great underdog story, then this is the film for you! I so enjoyed it and send my thanks to all involved!"
"mcsheehey","4","9","16","26 May 2007"," Uninspired and Uninspiring
","From the time I saw the first preview for ""Invincible,"" I was very excited to see it. I loved ""Remember the Titans,"" and this seemed to be that kind of movie: a sports film with a good cast that alters the mold and tries something new and interesting. Perhaps this is the reason that ""Invincible"" proved to be such a disappointment for me.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg stars in the film as Vince Papale, an underdog who rises from the streets of Philadelphia and becomes an Eagle. His performance is completely flat. Not only does he not try to give his character life, but he is not even likable. Sorry, Mark, but no Oscar nod for this one! As for his football story, it proves to be enormously dull. The sequences follow the usual Disney sports movie mold, never breaking free in a single area. Greg Kinnear, who is typically fantastic, struggles to give Coach Dick Vermielle some actual personality and character. He wants us to sympathize with him, but he comes off as simply pathetic. The lifeless football story never even comes off the ground. The final game scene is anti-climactic, involving Vince making an unimportant play that means nothing.<br/><br/>The romantic aspect of the film is even worse. Elizabeth Banks plays Vince's love interest, who he marries after the end of the film. She tries doing a New York accent for about five minutes, before abruptly switching to her normal voice. Her performance itself is bland and vapid, like the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Still, I understand that some people really like this film. I can honestly say that I didn't. If you're a huge sports fan and care little about bad acting and boring slow-motion shots, you'll probably like it. If you're looking for a good-quality film with an exciting plot, you'll hate it. Period."
"gradyharp","5","6","10","27 December 2006"," Yet Another Sports Film About Personal Triumph
","INVINCIBLE, though the title of this very Walt Disney/Hallmark Card docudrama, is a term that could be applied to the plethora of movies built on the stories of down and outers who pull themselves up by the boot strings due to their success in sports. Brad Gann is responsible for the script of the life of Vince Papale, a 30ish out of work substitute teacher, deserted husband, depressed South Philly member of a gang of friends who pass the time while jobless playing football in the muddy vacant lots of their part of the world.<br/><br/>Vince Papale is played well by Mark Wahlberg, giving a quiet performance of a deeply injured man who manages to finally succeed at something - being chosen by the failing Philadelphia Eagles football team when a new coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) tries a desperate attempt to enliven the team by holding open tryouts. Vince's friends convince him to make the effort, the bar owners relative Janet (Elizabeth Banks) adds her encouragement as does Vince's father (Kevin Conway). Of course the obvious happens or the film wouldn't have been made! Vince becomes an Eagle and soars, not only for himself but also for his father, his friends and his new girl.<br/><br/>It is difficult to fault this film: it is also difficult to sift out anything different from all the rest of the films that follow the same formula. Wahlberg does well, being careful not to allow his physique image to show for fear that the public will continue to think of him as an underwear model instead of an actor. And the supporting cast is well selected. There is an audience for these 'sports as king' films and this one has nothing that even kids can't watch. It unfortunately is just repetitive. Grady Harp"

","This story is very uplifting. It's about a 30 year old bartender/layed off teacher, whose wife just left him. He tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and against all odds, makes the team. Coach Vermeil sticks with Vince because he's got heart, even though his assistant coaches think he should be cut. Vince goes on to play several years in the NFL.<br/><br/>The football scenes were shot pretty good. But, I hate how they always have to stick some love interests in the story that doesn't have much to do with the story. Here, they insert another bartender, who eventually dates Vince. It's just a chance for Mark Wahlburg to get a few kissing scenes in.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was anything that is a must see. If you like movies about sports, then you may want to check it out."

The football scenes were so intense, I cringed at how painful they looked. I loved the fact where they just show the hum-drum of everyday life without trying to make everything appear beautiful. They background of South Philly portrayed was wonderful. Mark Walburg did a marvelous job as Vince Papale. To Kevin Conway who portrayed Frank Papale, WOW!!!! You sure can make a girl cry. The remaining cast were perfect in all their roles. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This movie would be great for boys and girls who love football and those who don't. It is just a great story."

This is the same actor that was in 4 brothers he is a pretty talented actor. The Football aspect of this movie will really appeal to sports fans alike. The team-work aspects that are displayed in the football scenes are awesome. The Soundtrack sounds pretty leveled out and catchy. I think they use a Nickelback song in it. Side of a bullet if I am not mistaken. This will for sure storyline wise beat out Snakes on a plane, and is good to even show the family. The Film is owned by Disney so you can't go wrong with that. So I recommend this film to any sports fanatic, football fan or a family man."

","*********SPOILER WARNING********** <br/><br/>Rarely have I ever been so disappointed by a movie, especially one I had such low expectations for to begin with. I went into the theater expecting a nice, comfortable, predictable Rudy rehashed, themed especially for my favorite city in the world, Philadelphia. I was not expecting nor did I particularly desire great cinema or stunning originality; I would have happily settled for a well-done version of a marvelously entertaining cliché. What I got was a movie that, more than anything else, seemed hopelessly unambitious; it didn't seem particularly interested in old, stand-by truisms or anything particularly resembling a story. Sure, there were a couple of scenes ripped straight out of Rudy (including one where two guys get into the ""pit"" and have to hit each other), but mostly it was a a meandering, moping, and unengaging retelling of one man's life in football, totally lacking in any dramatic fire. And I'm a big Eagles fan!<br/><br/>None of the players on the 1976 Eagles are particularly featured, replaced instead with a ""general grumbling"" about Papale being on the team. So, clichéd though it would be, there is not even an attempt at a ""first I hate you then I respect you and finally I stick up for you and help you become an established member of the team"" story line between one of the established players and Papale. There is a passing gesture at this sort of plot device, nothing more. <br/><br/>Instead, the story, such as it is, focuses on the relationship with Papale and Dick Vermeil. Even that lacks much dramatic tension; each week Papale is still on the team, until Vermeil calls him into his office and tells him to bring his playbook --- usually what he does right before he cuts a player --- in order to tell him he's made the team. Surprise! There is hardly any dramatic tension here, and this is the crux of the story. <br/><br/>The other subplots are equally lacking in any real rising action, or, in at least one case, sense. Papale's first wife left him and called him a loser, but it's OK because he nearly immediately meets a hotter girl who is a Giants fan but still a good person. Yawn. <br/><br/>In another subplot, Papale's dad supports him, but suggests he should resign himself to the idea that he is just a regular guy and will never be anything more. Boy, does the younger Papale show him! Not only does Vince make the Eagles, but on the day of the Eagles' home opener, his first day in Philadelphia in uniform, he ""forgets"" to get his Dad a ticket, as we discover when we see his father at a bar, watching the game on TV (but still cheering his son on with a bunch of other barflies --- how nice). <br/><br/>Finally, in the one that makes the least sense of all, one of Papale's best friends continually reminds him what a loser he is, no matter what he does. He gets through the open tryout --- he's a loser. He makes it past the first cuts --- loser. Next round of cuts --- loser. After he makes the team --- loser. After he doesn't play well in his first game against Dallas --- loser. Presumably, this would have gone ad infinitum, but mercifully the movie ended. Why does his friend despise him so much? Even the movie doesn't seem too sure --- it just seemed like it would add something to the plot, I guess, to have this ""sour grapes"" character there at every turn, to remind Papale that whatever he's achieved is only dust in the wind, and that soon he'll be nothing again. <br/><br/>One positive note: the attention to uniform detail is heroic. In 1976, the Dallas Cowboys, who normally have a stripe running over the crown of their helmets that is blue-white-blue, changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the bicentennial. The movie has the 'Boys in the correct uniform. And the Eagles are wearing that 1976 Philadelphia patch that uses the number 76 to make the crack-and-clapper in the Liberty Bell. <br/><br/>I only wish attention to this type of detail made it worth while. The Vet mostly looks like Franklin Field, with benches where the seats should be. Moreover, the movie's story is decidedly uninspiring --- I can't see how this movie would hold any interest to anyone outside the Philadelphia area."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Disney throws us another inspirational true story ... this time about South Philly's Vince Papale, a local bartender who was a walk-on cult hero for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1970's. Think ""Rudy"" in South Philly or ""Rocky"" in football pads.<br/><br/>Marky Mark does a passable job as local hero and good guy Vince, who is just one of the guys in this struggling town. First time film director Ericson Core does a passable Disney job of providing a bit of the feel of these hard nosed, blue collar people who struggle with life but always find a way to support their Eagles.<br/><br/>The story picks up when Eagles owner Leonard Tose (played by Miohael Nouri, who is seen in the current ""Boynton Beach Club"") hires UCLA hot shot coach Dick Vermeil (played well by underrated actor Greg Kinnear), following the Eagles miserable 1975 season. We get a few hints at the legendary brutal Philly sports fans and a small glimpse of home life for Vermeil, but most of the film centers on Papale and his personal struggles and his group of mostly supportive friends.<br/><br/>Papale's love interest and future wife is played by the remarkable Elizabeth Banks (so wonderful in ""The Baxter"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"") who, even though a Giants fan, seems to fit right in with this group of tough guys and, of course, immediately spots and falls for Vince's soft heart.<br/><br/>Don't miss Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly as a disgruntled Eagles fan and just see this one to enjoy the uplifting story and inspirational message it delivers. A soft PG-13 makes it OK for most kids who would have any interest in seeing it."

","I was really looking forward to an inspirational sports movie. I like macho male bonding and on the field violence. I was very disappointed. The plot is a joke and the acting is worse. I know its based on a true story but it was just so predictable. What was up with the love story? Invincible is a cookie cutter film and best saved for a very slow Sunday afternoon at home during football's off season. My girlfriend fell asleep and I was barely hanging on to the end. I don't know how you can make a movie about an underdog, football, and beer boring but they did it. The scenes where the ""boys"" are playing football in some old empty lot is a joke. Is this supposed to resonate with the common man? Like we all play football in empty lots in the pouring rain kicking the crap out of each other like we are 15? Come on. Please."
"tabuno","9","2","3","16 January 2019"," A Revealing Look At Football
","15 July 2013. This biographical portrayal of Vince Papale, a 30-year-old bartender (played by Mark Wahlberg) from South Philadelphia who tried out for NFL's Philadelphia Eagles in 1976 is perhaps remarkable not for the ironically ""good"" under-spirited acting, but for the scriptwriting, directing and editing. While Wahlberg performed decently, what made this movie special wasn't the dramatic performances so much as the more difficult underplaying of the usual stereotypical and hyped up action and melodrama in typical sports movies or for that matter most dramatic features. This movie never went over the top, Wahlberg's sports actions didn't excessively eclipse that of the rest of the Eagle's plays. And even the script brought out the more elusive underlying sociological underpinnings of the game of football often missed in most team sports movies. The potential romantic subplot was restrained and more authentic and supportive, not intrusive, the father-son relationship was made into an antagonistic sideshow, nor the coach-player relationship wasn't made into some warm and fuzzy mentor character sideline. Instead, Invincible focused on the personal and intimate struggle of overcoming a socially derived fatalistic and damning self-image as well as the social connections in a tightly knitted community.<br/><br/>Robert Redford's The Natural (1984) was as much about his romantic relationship and the political gamesmanship as it was about baseball, Micky Rourke's The Wrestler (2008) was more about the singular individual focus on redemption and coming back, Brad Pitt's Money Ball (2011) with its rich and more raw look at the big picture of baseball perhaps Invincible is more connected to Meg Ryan's Against the Ropes (2004) was more about overcoming the sexual discrimination of couching in a male dominated sport while Papale faced age discrimination and elitist snobbery of NFL draft requirements, or Shia LaBeouf's The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) with an individualistic look at an amateur playing in the elite big league of golf at the turn of the century."

","""Invincible"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Ericson Core <br/><br/>Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Banks, Greg Kinnear, Kevin Conway, & Michael Rispoli <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG"" (for sports action and some mild language) <br/><br/>Wait just one minute! Haven't I seen this movie before? Inspirational movie? Check! Based on a particular sport? Check! Based on a true story? Check! Has a happy ending? Check? Predictable? Double-check! Made by Disney? Triple-Check! Okay, okay, I haven't seen this movie beforebut I've seen COUNTLESS movies just like it, three of the most noticeable ones (""Remember the Titans"", ""Glory Road"", and ""The Rookie"") being made by the very same company as this--yes, Disney. Everything, even the 70's soundtrack, has been used beforeby Disney films no less. You can figure out every minute of this movie, from the hopeful beginning to the happy ending, and everything (and I stress the word ""everything"") will happen exactly as you believe it will. ""Invincible"" has no surprises, no originality, and really no point. Sure, the movie works on a very basic level (especially for people who have never seen another movie in their lives), but that can only be expected. After all, it copied at least three movies that worked far better.<br/><br/>Vince Papale (Wahlberg) loves football, but really only has experience playing around with his friends. When the Philadelphia Eagles hold an open try-out, Vince's friends convince him to give it a shot. Of course, Vince does and is whisked off to football camp where he is to train for one of the spots on the team. But, with everyone doubting him and expecting him to be cut at any time, can Vince gain the courage and the determination to keep going? Strangely enough, this movie completely ignores the fact that Vince played football for the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League as a wide receiver until 1975. This is what earned him a meeting with Coach Dick Vermeil (played by Kinnear). The movie desires so desperately to pull off the whole ""unknown bartender becomes professional football player"" that it completely trivializes Papale's actual life. Why was the fact that Papale has since gone on to help students in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania? ""Invincible"" makes Papale's story out to be one of luck and being in the right place at the right time, rather than a story of perseverance, determination, and passion. But, this isn't the first time that Disney has completely skewed a true life story so I hardly expected any accuracy on their part.<br/><br/>The performances vary, both as a whole and individually. In other words, some of the actors were good, some were bad, some were good in some parts, and some were bad in some parts. Mark Wahlberg gave a consistent performance, as did Elizabeth Banks. They both did a good job. Wahlberg's engaging made me feel for his characterunfortunately the script gave him no help with that. Greg Kinnear was on and off. Sometimes, he seemed to be on the ball with his performance and I was definitely enjoying watching him work. Other timeswell, it just didn't click. I enjoyed Michael Rispoli's performance, which surprised me because I'm not usually a fan. I guess this shows that you shouldn't judge someone for their work in a movie called ""Death to Smoochy"". Shame on me! The rest of the performances were passable--not bad, not good, just adequate for the roles. That is all that mattered, I guess.<br/><br/>At a generous 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, I see that most critics did enjoy ""Invincible"" and this surprises me. I suppose that maybe I am being a little too critical. Sure, ""Invincible"" followed a strict formula, even with its marketing campaign (the ""Inspired by True Events"" clearly marked across any and everything associated with the film), but the formula does worksomewhat. Even though I didn't care much for any of the characters by the end (feeling that the script did nothing to actually bring them to life and relied far too much on the actors to do so), I still found myself cheering at the exciting and well-written conclusion. It was a hopeful ending, but not a sappy one and worked well. Did I know that it was coming? Most certainly, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. On top of that, Mark Wahlberg and Elizabeth Banks gave their bests and did everything they possibly could to save their rather flat characters. I am very conflicted on what score to award ""Invincible"". I didn't enjoy it, but I am sure that many people will, especially if they skipped ""Remember the Titans"", ""Glory Road"", and ""The Rookie"". Though historically inaccurate (at all), horribly clichéd, and very predictable, there is still a small amount of fun to be hadand I suppose that it is just enough to warrant a watch.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Watching it at least once is not a bad thing, but don't expect anything new and don't think you know the true story.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)"
"johnboy3356","10","2","3","7 December 2006"," Perfectly captures the era, the man and the thrill of sports
","Just saw this movie on a flight home, and I must give it a high rating (9 or 10) because it so perfectly captures the emotion of sports, the personal story of Vince Papale and atmosphere of living in Philadelphia in the 1970's. I should know- I was there. There were several places where the story veers from reality (outlined below), but they are mere details for most movie-goers. I think they were playing up the ""down and out"" aspect of Papale's life before the Eagles and took some artistic license on the real facts.<br/><br/>Anyone interested in real sports movies and who likes underdog stories should see this movie. In addition, for me it was unexpectedly good, because I had not previously heard of this movie.<br/><br/>(By the way- my favorite sports movie of all time (ok, other than Caddyshack) is ""Downhill Racer"" with Robert Redford- check it out).<br/><br/>Some additional facts/ corrections for those of you who are hard-core fans or just want to know more. I don't think any of these are spoilers: <br/><br/>* Vince Papale did not live in South Philly, but in the nearby suburbs of Delaware County (Glenolden, PA), also my home town.<br/><br/>* He may have tended bar part-time, but he was employed full-time as junior high school teacher at least for 1972, 73 and 74 at my junior high school (Interboro Junior High, Propsect Park, PA). He taught business. Not sure what business means in junior high. He had also graduated from our high schools as a football and track star. He always had great speed and work hard at maintaining it.<br/><br/>* He may have played a lot of sandlot football, but he honed his skills for a number of years first in a semi-pro league as a member of the Aston Knights (Aston is another suburb of Philadelphia) and then for 2 years with the Philadelphia Bell (coached by Jim Mora by the way) of the short lived WFL. The semi-pro league was notorious for its roughness- no penalties for late hits, piling on, etc. Papale distinguished himself in this league as the toughest of the toughhe was able to take a lot of hard hits and keep playing (wide receiver, I think). He played in this league for like 5 years.<br/><br/>* He was much taller and thinner than Mark Walburg portrays him in this movie- wiry I would say, but pretty well built. He did not weight a lot for an NFL player (I am sure less than 200 lbs). He distinguished himself with speed, hustle and the ability to take hits.<br/><br/>* He worked out relentlessly. As a high school cross country runner, we were required to do two-a-day runs during the extreme heat of August. During a lot of these sessions, Papale was working out at the high school track and gym. By then he was playing for the Bell. He had a really cool car also (280-Z?).<br/><br/>* As a teacher, he was really a good guy- friendly, didn't take it too seriously like some teachers, never yelled at kids and played steady QB for us in our lunchtime football games- and I think this part of his personality came out in the movie.<br/><br/>The rest of it- try outs, interaction with Vermeil, was pretty accurate, I think. Vermiel had to fight his way into the Philadelphia fan base. Philly fans are notoriously brutal, especially then- and they took a perverse pride in that fact. Today, they love him- he still does ads for Blue Cross there.<br/><br/>I remember one Eagles game vividly- they were trying to make up 2 touch downs- on a kickoff the receiving team (maybe Giants?) were letting the ball go into the endzone for a touchback- when Papale came flying down the field- from nowhere- and downed the ball on the ½ yard line- literally grounding the ball with his arm while his body was mid-air flying into the end zone. He had that capability of injecting hope into a lost cause. This was also well captured by the film.<br/><br/>The movie also captured the depressed mood of Philadelphia in the mid-seventies- after Watergate and the initial gas crisis, during ""stagflation"" but before the Carter malaise. It was a terrible economy- and in a working class neighborhood that meant lay-offs and strikes. Sports was one of the few escapes available to everyone. In my (nearby) Philadelphia neighborhood, we lived for sports (and not any of this organized crap- it was all pick-up games)- all year round- football- basketball, street hockey (the real kind without skates), basketball, and of course stickball. Kids today need more of that, I think.<br/><br/>For just a slice of that- go see this movie. I can vouch for its authenticity."

"SimonJack","8","1","1","9 November 2017"," Very good sports drama set on the Philadelphia gridiron
","Based on a true story, ""Invincible"" is a first-rate sports drama. Touted as the story of a 30-year-old bartender who becomes a pro football players for the Philadelphia Eagles, the film actually is two stories in one. <br/><br/>The major story is that of Vince Papale, a pro-football ""walk-on"" for the 1976 Philadelphia Eagles. Initially shunned by his ""pro"" teammates, Papale was welcomed after a spectacular special teams play. In the regular season home opener against the New York Giants, he tackled a punt receiver, causing a fumble, and then picked up the fumble and ran it 30 plus yards for a touchdown. The overlapping story is that of the hiring of Dick Vermeil as head coach of the Eagles. <br/><br/>Both stories take place mostly over a single year – 1976. This is a Disney film, and as with any Hollywood production, some of the details are fictitious. In a nutshell, Papale played three seasons for the Eagles and retired after the 1978 season due to a shoulder injury. He played wide receiver and on specialty teams. It took Vermeil a couple of seasons to turn the Eagles around from a losing team, but in the third year they made the NFL playoffs. That also was Papale's last year playing ball. Two seasons later, Vermeil's Eagles made it to the Super Bowl, losing to Oakland, 10-27, on Jan. 5, 1981. After retiring a couple of times from coaching, Vermeil took over a losing program at St. Louis and took the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV, and a win on Jan. 30, 2000. <br/><br/>Here are some interesting facts and true details about how Papale and Vermeil got connected. Papale attended St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. The school didn't have a football team, but he excelled in track and field. He won or placed in several events during track meets. His highest clearance as a pole-vaulter was 15 feet, 1 ¾ inches. In his senior year, he won events in the long jump and triple jump. <br/><br/>Papale never played college football, but he played both years that the World Football League existed. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Bells in 1974 and 1975. Dick Vermeil saw video of Papale's play for the Bells and invited him to try out for the Eagles. Of course, he had to prove himself and earn the spot on the team. And, that's what is most prominent and accurate about the movie. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of interesting tidbits about Papale. He was nicknamed ""Rocky"" by his friends – a reference to the fictional boxer in the Sylvester Stalone movie who rose from the rough side of Philadelphia to become world heavyweight boxing champion. Papale is six feet, two inches, and Mark Wahlberg is only five feet, eight inches. But, Wahlberg, himself a tough guy with a tough upbringing and past, gives the part the guts and fire that Coach Vermeil says he was looking for and saw in Papale. <br/><br/>When Papale made the Eagles roster in 1976, he was 30 years old. Outside of kickers, he was the oldest rookie NFL player in history to not have played college football. He played in 41 of the 44 regular season games of the Eagles in 1976-78. He had two fumble recoveries and one interception for 15 yards. His teammates elected him special teams captain. In 1978, the Eagles named him the team's ""Man of the Year"" for his support of many charities. <br/><br/>Dick Vermeil was named ""Coach of the Year"" for his coaching at four levels – high school, junior college, college and pro ball. He took over three losing professional teams and turned them around. Beside the Eagles and St. Louis Rams, he revived the Kansas City Chiefs, building that team into a contender from 2001 to 2005. <br/><br/>This is a very good inspiring and entertaining sports drama."
"sam_smithreview","8","1","1","2 May 2016"," great sports film from Disney
","Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelphia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good story line, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved."

It is no far-fetched fantasy or glossy almanac of unreal heroes. It chronicles the struggles and the humility of the heroes we can identify with and easily relate to.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gives a heartfelt performance with his portrayal of Vince Papale. Not a single scene goes by without the raw emotion and quiet strength that his character exudes on-screen. The period 70s music and the wonderfully composed soundtrack mesh beautifully into the story and elicit the emotion, pain and the joy from the audience. Add to that flawless editing, and you have a rare offering from the celluloid world which transcends the screen and registers right in your heart. <br/><br/>A note to the non-sports fans: I am not an American Football fan.

"TxMike","Null","1","1","31 December 2006"," Really fine movie based on Vince Papale's entry into pro football.
","I am about Vince Papale's age. I very vaguely remember in 1976 when he began to play pro football for the Eagles. I invariably enjoy movies based on real people, and this is no exception to that rule. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look much like Papale at 30, and is a bit too old, but his working class background helped him become Papale for this movie. A very worthwhile viewing for anyone who likes a nice personal triumph. There is a very interesting 25-minute extra on the DVD which features the real Papale as they were making the movie.<br/><br/>Vince Papale was a part-time teacher and part-time bar tender. He and his buddies were rabid Eagles fans, when the Eagles had lost the magic of their former glory days. They spent a portion of their leisure time playing sandlot football in street clothes. Papale seemed to clearly the be the best of them, even though he never played college ball, and only one year of high school football.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear is Dick Vermeil, successful West Coast college coach hired to turn the Eagles around. To gain support of the local crowd he held open tryouts, not really expecting anyone to stand out. But Papale did, and he was given a chance at training camp, much to his own surprise.<br/><br/>Spoilers. At each cut point Papale expected to be called to turn in his playbook. Each time he was retained, and coach Vermeil went out on a thin limb to keep him on the roster at the final cut, against the advice of his coaches. Even though they lost all of their preseason games, Papale became a 'crazy man' on special teams, getting downfield quickly on kickoffs to pulverize the ball carrier. And in the first game, causing a fumbled punt which he recovered and carried in for an insurance touchdown. He gained the respect of the veterans, thrilled the home crowd, and had 3 very successful seasons. Plus, the Eagles turned it around and became winners again.<br/><br/>Very pretty Elizabeth Banks is Janet Cantrell, whom Papale met as a fellow bar tender, right after his own wife up and moved out without warning. Janet and Vince married and, as current film clips show, have a nice family with two small children."

Typical underdog story that I have always been a sucker for and this one is no exception. Has that ""Rocky"" feel to it with shades of countless other inspirational sports stories from seemingly the beginning of films. It is good at capturing the intensity of Philadelphia sports fans and also excellent at showing how blue collar folks in that part of the country interact, socialize and often struggle to make a living.

","Miracle, The Greatest Game Ever Played and NOW THIS!! I don't even like Football but Invincible is the perfect feel good film. Right out of the gate I must say that I do not agree with it's ""G"" rating. How can something like The Incredibles get a PG rating for violence and intense scenes but Invincible with a love scene, a scene of someone giving the middle finger twice, and a lot of violent football scenes gets a G?? There is no justice to the MPAA. BUT that being said Invincible truly is a story about overcoming fears and heroism and the film reminded me a great deal of the closest thing to Rocky I that has ever been done and yet that's a big compliment. First and foremost this film also takes place in Phillidelphia in the seventies so the setting and time feels very familiar to Rocky fans. You have a neighborhood guy that the entire city gets behind and all their dreams are in him. I am not a football fan but you honestly don't need to be. You will still find yourself rooting for this underdog. You also have a sub-plot of a serious recession that is taking it's toll on everyone in the lower income areas of Philly. You have a ""family"", a group of friends so close that spend their time at a local pub and lean on each other in the rough times.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg headlines the cast as substitute teacher, and football fan Vince Papale. I was never a fan of Wahlberg's despite some decent roles but in the last couple of years he has really impressed me with roles in the fantastic Four Brothers and now this. He shows some really impressive depth and character development. This is a role he can be really proud of because it's an important role that he does great in. Greg Kinnear plays new Phillidelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil who struggles with trying to be a brilliant coach for a losing team. This is the best role I've seen Kinnear play in a very long time. I think he's a great actor but some of his roles have been questionable at best. Still I don't think the story delved into Coach Vermeil enough but for what they gave us Kinnear did terrific. Elizabeth Banks plays Wahlberg's new love interest Janet Cantrell. She plays a great role, although rather small she does the most with it. She's strikingly beautiful, and delivers some laughs in her New York Giants fan role living in Philly. Her and Wahlberg have good chemistry but with better character development it could have been GREAT chemistry. Michael Rispoli plays one of the best supporting characters Max Cantrell. He owns the bar where everyone hangs out. He's always there for everyone and is like a brother to Wahlberg's character. He stands out more than everyone else on the supporting cast because of his strong personality and screen time. The rest of the supporting cast is terrific too. Kirk Acevedo, Dov Davidoff, Michael Kelly and Sal Darigo all play small but really great roles. They all have small sub plots whether it be trouble with their wives, finding a job, being laid off and they all do such a great job of bringing you into the story. They all set a tone and that is truly what carries Invincible.<br/><br/>For a first time big screen director Ericson Core does an amazing job because this film really does get much of it's charm from it's direction. In many ways the film is very bleak and foreboding but that makes Wahlberg's triumph all the more important in the end. Does the film follow a stale recipe?? Sure in some ways but for most people who love to feel great at a film you won't care that you've seen this before because this is new characters, strong actors and a moving, brilliant TRUE story. I don't know how some reviewers can say the emotion felt forced, or that scenes felt tacked together because I didn't for a minute feel the emotion was forced. Quite the opposite emotions ran high from one extreme to another and the scenes on the football field added into the action and watch-ability. I only don't score it perfect because at this point it is an old recipe and I felt like there should have been more story there but they did an incredible job and right now you won't find a better film to make you feel inspired and touched in the theaters. Go see it!! 9/10"

","I'll admit it's pretty easy to get me to like ""feel good"" sports movies and walking into this one you know what you're going to get. Two parts of the movie did surprise me, though, and in a great way.<br/><br/>1. The opening credits sequence. Set to Jim Croce's ""I Got a Name"" in it's entirety, this beautifully shot sequence gives a great set up to Philadelphia 1975. None of the actors from the movie are in it and it is perfect. And then that opening birds eye sweep into the stadium is pretty bitchin'...<br/><br/>2. The home opening game montage set to ""Stranglehold"" by Ted Nugent. This song kicks ass and has been used in movies to effect before (see: Dazed & Confused) but the way the pounding rhythm of this classic rock anthem parallels the football field poundings both given and received by Papale and teammates...well it makes we want to make out with the editors of this movie!<br/><br/>The music supervisors on this one really did a great job!"
"bobm5508","8","1","1","25 August 2006"," The ""nicest"" football movie you'll ever see!!
","This is a very entertaining, almost sweet movie, about the ""true story"" of a local Philly fan who actually makes the Eagles squad in the mid-70s. This has the Disney stamp of wholesome and I found it to be refreshing. A football locker room or practice field can fill up with expletives, but I recall only one scene where a friend is excited that ""...you made the freaking Eagles"". After being assaulted with ""realistic"" movies, HBO's ""The Sopranos"" or Showtime's ""The Brotherhood"", the toned down language was a welcomed change.<br/><br/>The performances are fine. Mark Wahlberg's typical laconic style is well suited and he certainly looks the part physically. Greg Kinnear toned down his usual smirky side, for a likable performance as well known good guy coach, Dick Vermeil. The female lead is pretty, perky and has a funny NY Giants alliance. The supporting friends and family are nothing new, but lend good humor and texture to the story. The direction is almost slow paced, which actually makes the jarringly exciting football scenes even more exciting. A nice touch was footage of the actual player and coach before the credits roll.<br/><br/>A good rule of thumb for sport's movies is that a ""non""-football fan (or Eagles fan) could watch it and still enjoy it. I think it passes that test easily. <br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining, exciting, uplifting story -- suitable for the whole family."

","I would only recommend this film if either you were a sports nut or a fan of Vince Papale. I, personally, did not see anything special or original about this film. The screenplay and dialogue were extremely tired and cliché, while the film itself drags along at a slow pace. This film doesn't even try to present the story of Vince Papale in an interesting or enlightening way. Instead, ""Invincible"" only uses the same old formula that every sports movie before it developed. I guess the writers just felt tired of trying and went through the stacks, taking ideas from ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Rudy"". I almost felt psychic. I've seen this same old crap a thousand times before and I don't need to see it a thousand times more. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against Vince Papale or the story of his life, but I think justice hasn't been done for Vince. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance, one word: disappointed. He's a great actor but he was just not at his best. Let me just say that this was one of the few movies I've ever seen in my lifetime that I actually felt like sleeping through. And that's saying a lot. People are going to remember Vince Papale, but they're not going to remember this movie."

","I'm not from Philly, nor did I every hear about Vince while he was playing. That being said, I had no idea what the film was going to be about. However, the accents made it impossible for me to understand what was being said and the sound quality was not crisp. Basically I watched the actors mouths moving and only got the occasionally line or two. I basically followed the movie by the scenes, which seemed very predictable. The only part that I found easy to follow was whenever Greg Kinnear was speaking. And because Greg's ""wife: was so similar looking to Vince's ex, I kept wondering if Vince's wife had left him for Greg's character.<br/><br/>I remember trying to understand the part regarding the knuckles and the color. I replayed it several times but had no clue what what was being said before or during, so I knew from the future scenes that that scene was important and that something about the color of the knuckles was related to the way a player was going to move.<br/><br/>I recommend that if you want to watch this and if you aren't from Philly that you play this movie with subtitles."

It's also based on a true story. While there are probably embellishments and diversions from the truth, it works fantastically as a movie.

Elizabeth Banks is also fantastic to watch (as usual). There are some cheesy scenes at times, but they don't detract from the story. It's hard not to become invested in Papale's journey. The NFL scenes seemed particularly authentic, instantly making the viewer feel like a player on the team.<br/><br/>Invincible also features a rockin' 70s soundtrack which really helps capture the feel of the era.

","SYNOPSIS:
Based on the true story of the 30-year-old bartender Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), who took advantage of open tryouts held by the Philadelphia Eagles and fought his way into becoming a professional football player.<br/><br/>REVIEW SUMMARY:
This is one of those films where I know technically it's not the most sound film, but I love the story, how it's told and it has a rewatch-ability factor for me. Mark Wahlberg probably should've shown a bit more emotion, but I kind've love the way he portrayed Vince. With a lot going wrong for him I think it's suiting to have a more helpless emotion. Of course, if this is never how Vince was, then I wouldn't encourage straying to this type of emotional portrayal, but I simply don't know. I also really loved Elizabeth Banks and his now wife Janet and I though Greg Kinnear was great as Eagles coach Dick Vermeil. It's reminiscent of ""Rudy"", but is different in a still heart-warming way.<br/><br/>-------------BREAKDOWN-------------<br/><br/>DIRECTION:
Directed by Ericson Core, I thought he gave life to Philadelphia. Through direction he made the community of friends a character of its own. In a story like this, that's always very important. There was an awkwardly places slow-motion shot in one of the friendly football games near the end, but other than that I have to say the direction was solid all around.<br/><br/>WRITING:
Not knowing how accurate this story is to the real thing it's tough to say how good the writing truly is. However, being a good movie is always going to be a priority for me and this is a good movie with strong dialogue. Strong relationships between Vince, Philadelphia, friends and loved ones really made this script special. The most important aspect of this script, however, was that it never veered off to focus on some sub-plot that didn't matter. The script focused everything on the story of Vince and surrounded him with the necessary elements.<br/><br/>ACTING:
Mark Wahlberg gives a rather emotional emotionless performance that I love. As much as that doesn't make sense, it does. He shows a spark of emotion at just the right moments and he's emotionless at just the right moments. Fantastic surrounding performances from Elizabeth Banks and Greg Kinnear. Everyone in this really brings this film together."

"hinkensdrew","Null","0","0","22 February 2017"," Overall review of movie
","What we have here in the movie Invincible, directed by Ericson Core is one of those classic sport-underdog-defying-the-odds movies that's been done over and over hundreds of times. But hey it always works, that's why a company like Disney Studios would make a movie like this, because its destined to always bring money to the box office. What makes it better is the movie is enhanced with the ""based on true events"" story line that helps connect audience more to the overall plot of the movie.<br/><br/>I must first give credit to Director Ericson Core because he was precise and specific with the plot of the film. Core graduated from USC's film program as well as a degree from the very prestigious Art Center College of Design. Throughout Core's college education he was surrounded by the world of sports. Overtime he was able to grow strong knowledge in the world of sports which helped him develop a movie that showed the economic hardships of one city, along with that how a hometown resident was able to make a name for himself. Something that was unusual was Core was also the Director of Cinematography in the film. It's honestly impressive to direct a movie and also to be in charge of the motion-picture photography. I thought this showed a deep passion Core had when producing this film, and it made the movie more enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>Within the plot and production of the movie it was able to capture the financially pressed hardships of South Philadelphia in the mid-1970's. The movie gives an authentic feel with the cheap beer, flowed back hair, ugly cloths, and the horrific carpeting. What I thought was the crucial part in the production of the film was the number of scenes that showed the economic hardships for the residents of South Philly. The movie showed scenes of workers protesting outside of factories and it made a connection to the audience of how depressing people's lives were during the mid-1970's. These crucial connections that Ericson Core incorporated throughout the movie would help increase the emotion the audience would feel when watching the film.<br/><br/>What set this movie apart from other sports movies was the character Vince Papale being played by Mark Wahlberg. I say this because Wahlberg has the body and physicality of a NFL Football Player. Along with that, all the scenes were shot with real football players and Wahlberg did his own stunts, every welt and bruise was the real deal. Wahlberg went to the next level and was able to make this movie feel more accurate to real life events. He took on the duty of making the audience feel his pain and struggles through the main character Vince Papale. Wahlberg took an extensive amount of preparation before the film was shot, he spent months of training physically to replicate what a traditional NFL football player would look like. Another important point was Wahlberg mentally prepared himself to understand the hardships that these players go through during the season. With the extensive preparation he took, it increased the level of catharsis I had towards Vince Papale. With the inspirational plot, true to life characters, exhilarating scenes, and easy to follow dialogue, this movie gets the thumbs up as a must watch film."

","I like Mark Wahlberg in some movies, others I think he is just okay. In this one, I thought he was just great. he plays a truly likable former high school football player (who never played in college), but still hits the ""gridiron"" in pick up games in South Philly in the late 1970s. He's lost his job as a high school teacher and his wife left him, leaving a note that he will never go anywhere in life. Well, things change rather quickly when Dick Vermil (played strongly by Greg Kinear) takes over for the desperate, losing Philadelphia Eagles. Vermil decides to give walk-on tryouts to Philadelphia natives, as a publicity stunt. One person gets called to camp, and that's Wahlberg's character. This is a definite inspirational story, which is based on a true story, where the guy actually makes the team. Wahlberg's character has speed, intensity, passion, and will, and he becomes a special teams expert, playing 3 or 4 years in the NFL. Only downside,as I have learned in many of these ""biographical"" movies, is that while it was close to the truth, there were many things in the movie that turned out to be just plain false. but if you're watching Invincible as just a movie, and not a biography, then this is great one, which didn't get the critical reviews it deserves."

","The story is nothing new except the locations, actors, directors, special effects etc. A poor bartender who has been deserted by his wife tries hard to meet the ends but the good thing is that he plays football. So eventually he is encouraged to play for the eagles team where he excels and makes a name for himself. Such rising hero stories are not uncommon in fact people like to get encouraged. People like such movies where a poor man rises to fame by hardwood. So I am not going into much deeper appreciation here. ""Rudy"" is also similar to this and I liked that too.<br/><br/>Mark has done a great job and so did the director. The 80s era was beautifully depicted. Others were also impressive esp Banks (she is beautiful !). The special effects were delicately made and the high points of Vince's rising was shown with time. The slow motions were catchy and every time raises your hackles. Ericson was safe by choosing a subject like this. I would like to see more of him when he tries something out of the normal. Watch the movie for a nice feeling at the end. You also feel you can do something and be known !"

This true life story about Vince Papale shows that anyone can do whatever they set there hearts too. A bartender in the late 1970's tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and makes the team. I thought this film did a very good job in looking like the 70's. Most Disney films always do a good job portraying the time period. The costumes and cars were awesome. Even the bar he works at has that 1970's look. I liked the story, thought it believable in the sense that a man in his thirties is still very physically fit and quit able to play pro sports. I of all sports dislike Football more then any other sport but do respect the pure tough sportsmanship of the game. I thought the sports play was shot very nicely with slick camera footage. I loved the actual news footage and recordings of old games they used. Very good film and one of Mark Whalberg's better movies."

","I generally liked the movie, but it was fairly slow and listless until the second half.

For example, I can't remember seeing any sports movie in which the score of all the games are simply left out. It's just strange.<br/><br/>Also - it's a bit slow and doesn't have the kind of energy / excitement level that usually accompanies such sports stories.

","A sports movie is not a genre, it's a formula. Try to argue that if you want, but how many sports movies have you seen where the hero isn't victorious in some way. The hero has either learned something about himself/found true love or he wins the big game. Simple as that. So with that in mind most sports movies are predictable from the start, but that's why we watch them; to see a good ol' underdog story. So if you're the least bit sentimental, or better yet if you like the sport, you're in a goldmine. If you're a pretentious film snob who is not at all open to a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie; look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Invincible is a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. Snobs: keep scrolling. It's also a Disney movie. Ouch. Two strikes right there. Snobs: you were warned. Does it have a paper-thin script? Yes. Does it have poorly fleshed-out characters? Yes. Does it have about a dozen too many shots of a lone Mark Wahlberg walking the streets at night? God, yes. Was there a moment every two or three minutes that I shook my head at for how poorly it was executed? Yup. Is it chock full of clichÃ©s? Yes. I'll stop asking questions now. But damn did Invincible get me choked up once or twice. Mark Wahlberg is a very likable actor, and while he doesn't have much to work with, he's just as likable as ever and he's good enough to root for.

Taking time to set up this story allowed me to see that football is a noble game that brings happiness and success to folks that don't have much to celebrate. It's what made the folks in South Philly get up in the morning and go to work. It's what makes failures feel like winners and that if you work hard enough, you can make your dreams come true.

Other than that, I thought the movie captured the feel of the times perfectly: the people, the neighborhoods, the music, the attitude. I found it very inspirational - a true life Rocky story. Of course, being an Eagles fan and former Hawk, I am a little biased. I agree with all the other submitters that Kinnear's portrayal of Vermiel is spot on. He earned the respect of his players by working harder than any other coach and working them harder than any other coach. I went to high school with the prior coach's son (Mike McCormack, Jr) and they were nice people. But Dick Vermiel was the reason that the Eagles turned it all around. Vince helped."

This movie by contrast felt realistic enough with the sports action while at the same time being character driven enough(though perhaps lacking strong enough supporting characters) to completely draw me in to the story and to actually care what happens to this guy. What I also appreciated was that this story was about a pedestrian enough character who wasn't saving the world or winning some championship game, he was just attempting to barely make the Eagle's special teams. His personal journey was the focus of this story and the struggling city that saw him as a symbol for inspiration made his struggle matter. Why do positive stories get the cold shoulder while movies about the depressing self-implosion of a character get raving reviews? My one glaring criticism of this film is the title which makes no sense whatsoever to me. This character was anything but ""Invincible"" which is exactly what the movie was about, his vulnerability and refusal (with the encouragement of his friends, father, and city) to quit. This is my first comment here and hope I haven't spoiled anything, I didn't check it because I felt my comments were innocuous in that sense."

Elizabeth banks did a good job of being cute as a Giants fan in Philadelphia. Once again because of its rating she really didn't get a chance to show us her real stuff. If you know what I mean. The movie was pretty accurate as far as history goes and Im sure Eagle fans love that aspect. If your an eagles fan its a must see, if not Ill leave that up to you...

","A fine offering from Disney Films that doesn't rely on violence, sex or vulgarity to tell it's story. Not being a major football fan, I tuned in for the inspirational story of a professional sports team walk-on that made it to the big time. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job of portraying said player, Vince Papale, a down but not yet out part time teacher and bartender. Casting wise, it was quite ironic to see him as a beefy, muscular player on the neighborhood football team, only to wind up being the smallest guy on the Eagles. The film takes you through Papale's ordeal in training camp, the first six pre-season games of 1976, and the first two games of that year.<br/><br/>What I found lacking in the story seemed to be the absence of any real thrill or intensity in Papale's accomplishment, as it was all played quite low key by Wahlberg. There also was a lack of any camaraderie between Papale and any of the Eagles in the movie, no mentor to serve as a buffer between the upstart 'old' rookie and the veteran players. Papale's relationship with Coach Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) was also portrayed in a low key manner, so much so that when Papale blew his very first play, it was a shock to see Vermeil's outburst.<br/><br/>There's a great scene though, featuring Papale and Vermeil as each was about to experience their very first NFL game; you can get nervous at all levels of professional sports.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this one will hold up with some of the other underdog true sports stories on film like ""Rudy"" or ""Hoosiers"", but it's a decent enough feel good story to catch at least one time. I'm sure if you were there in the mid 1970's and a rabid Philadelphia Eagles fan, you'll have a greater appreciation for the story. For someone who manages to catch just the Super Bowl once a year, this was a good tune up."

","The real life events of Philadelphia native Vince Papale (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's Mark Wahlberg) incredible ride into the NFL as a member of the Eagles. Vince was an out of work teacher and bartender who happened to make it to the NFL via Dick Vermeil's open tryouts, with no prior college or professional experience.<br/><br/>If you have seen Rocky, you kind of get the idea. It's Philly, its a blue collar town and during the 70's was in the grips of a severe recession. The director, Ericson Core (who's major contribution to this point was as cinematographer on the horrible Daredevil), does an adequate job of portraying this. Basically this is not really a football movie. I was having major flashbacks of Rudy. The whole point of the movie isn't football, but rather the underdog, the ""American dream"" accomplished. This isn't to say there isn't football in the movie. Most of it involves training camp and a few plays from the first few games. It is used to show that his accomplishment did not occur overnight, nor that it was easy.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a great movie, but its hard not to care about Vince. These movies make us care about these people, by making the point that if they could do it, why can't we. They could be us, so it is easy to relate. The standout moment of the movie is at the end, where we are given archived footage of the actual Vince and some of the plays he made. It single-handed validated the movie for me, to see the energy, pride and character of Vince Papale. This movie would be a welcome DVD to my collection, right next to Rudy, the Replacements and the Longest Yard (the original 70's version... please don't soil that movie with thoughts of Adam Sandler)."

","Invincible is about fired teacher and part time bartender Vince Papale who after his divorce in 1975 tried out for the Philadelphia Eagles football team. He made the cut and with a little help from a coach that liked his style did the pro dance. This is a real feel good film about raising yourself up from the dumps into a place of notoriety. While I like Mark Wahlberg, he seemed a little too starched in this one. Perhaps more of a planet of the Apes style would have been better, but that's the director's issue. Of course some spots were a little slow because the emotion level didn't meet the situation. If you liked Rudy and any other underdog film, you'll like Invincible. A class A film with few technical problems."

I thought they could have done more to show Vince's true personality as well. I would love to know also if it was true that Vince audibled the punt scheme when he saw the punt block rush was on.

One of the most intriguing aspects of film is how the directing and story are united to intricately describe one man's presence and how he represents a city and how he unknowingly inspires the team to perform. Whether or not this is completely accurate based on the true events, I don't know; but it was fantastically directed and presented. Wahlberg did a fantastic job. He is a breath of fresh air today's class of younger male actors that tend to be all looks and no substance.

","You've seen the plot of INVINCIBLE a hundred times, and yet the story never grows old. It is the same plot as ROCKY, and it just so happens the story takes place in Philadelphia in 1976, the year ROCKY was released. Mark Wahlberg is the underdog, a down-on-his luck, aging, divorced, part-time bartender from depressed South Philly who tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles, a team that has seen better times. A new coach (Greg Kinnear) tries the gimmick of an open audition for the Eagles, with no particular expectations. Unlike ROCKY, there are no bombastic moments until the very end. It is all very low key and underplayed, much like the guy himself who is very quiet and never believes for one moment he has a chance. A new love interest, in the form of fellow barkeep Elizabeth ""Slither"" Banks, gives the film an added touch. Wahlberg is great, proving once again he can act with the best of them, and Banks is very appealing as a savvy, not-so-young New York woman who has come to Philly looking for a new start. She also happens to be a huge Giants fan,which leads to some very funny moments."
"Pavel-8","6","0","0","9 December 2006"," A decent sports movie.
","If you've seen the trailer for ""Invincible"", then you know the story of Vince Papale, a Philadelphia everyman who earned a spot on his beloved Eagles through an open tryout in 1976. The fact that most of the plot is known is a negative in the sense that it robs the movie of most drama, but doesn't affect enjoyment much, because most sports flicks are straightforward anyway. Instead, the common underdog-turned-hero plot, along with strong lead performances from Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear (as Coach Dick Vermeil) makes for an easy viewing experience.<br/><br/>While Wahlberg is the headliner, Kinnear performs equally well in a parallel role, as Vermeil makes the jump from college football to the pros. He wisely chooses not to do a complete impersonation of Coach Vermeil, but does relate Vermeil's easy-going aura. If you have watched much of Vermeil in the last few years, then you will certainly find a few moments in the movie that make you chuckle and nod, thinking Vermeil would have said or done exactly that. As for Wahlberg, not many Hollywood stars would be believable as football players. Can you really see someone like Tom Cruise 0r Adam Sandler (ok, bad example) playing in the NFL? Didn't think so. But Wahlberg is an exception. He has the physique and attitude of an elite athlete (see: Calvin Klein ads), and in part because of his street background, he has the tough guy image down (see: ""Four Brothers""). But despite his evident charisma, he doesn't rise above his fellow cast members like Cruise sometimes does. Instead he represents the working man quite well and seems just like one of the boys from South Philly.<br/><br/>The energy of those everyday Joes is the gas that drives the movie's engine. Through Papale's circle of friends and family, ""Invincible"" captures two types of football passion wonderfully. Papale's bar pals exhibit the hardcore fanaticism that power any team's fanbase, and the generational enthusiasm that is passed down from father to son is also portrayed expertly via Papale and his dad. Both symbolize an ardor that transcends team loyalties, allowing fans of any team (except maybe the Giants) to share in the story. As everyone who has lived through 9/11 knows, sports can provide joyous moments, even in difficult times, and the movie effectively displays football as such an outlet without resorting to melodrama (ahem...""Rudy"").<br/><br/>In addition to these positive aspects, ""Invincible"" has many of the characteristics mandatory in sports movies. There's a wet blanket female, adversity to overcome, and a handful of scenes that induce chills. The crunching football scenes are good too, although most of the action takes place either in practice or isolation shots involving Papale. The quality of football ought to be high though, since this is the first movie since ""Jerry Maguire"" that was officially approved by the National Football League. The NFL's okay was vital in lending authenticity to the movie, as the real logos, name, and places create a fun game of who-was-that during the flick. Anyone who watched football in the 1970s will enjoy picking familiar names off jerseys, and recognizing names and venues as they are mentioned and shown.<br/><br/>Sports movies are men's equivalent to chick flicks, pointing out a difference between the sexes. Women want to fall in love; men want to be sports heroes. So even though the plot is fairly routine, ""Invincible"" provides solid sports entertainment, particularly in the current build-up to football season, during which Disney was smart to release the film. It surpassed my mediocre expectations, and that's good enough for a recommendation from me.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: As ""Rocky"" in cleats, it satisfies a fix, and does so in surprisingly efficient fashion. 6 of 10."

","For those who are fans of professional football, this movie is as good as the film ""Hoosiers"" was for high school basketball fans. The game of football is only for those who are not only tough, but determined, especially at the professional level. Injuries are common. Mark Wahlberg shows that he has what it takes as he continues his masterful portrayal of lower middle class characters, who overcome lack of education and poverty to show courage and insight and determination on the way to the achievement of success and victory. Greg Kinnear plays the legendary Coach Vermeil, who took an unmotivated and disheartened Philadelphia Eagles to victory in the mid 1970s and eventually to the Super Bowl. <br/><br/>Wahlberg and Kinnear have something in common. Both men started their careers doing something else than acting, Wahlberg as a rap musician and Kinnear as a talk show host. Both have achieved the ability to morph themselves into their respective roles in a convincing manner. <br/><br/>This is also another delightful depiction of the mid-1970's era, similar to that found in ""Boogie Nights,"" also starring Wahlberg. Wahlberg seems to have an affinity to films of that period, so full of chaos, violence, change and drama."

","You know that feeling you get when something seems a little too authentic? Like when you walk into an Italian restaurant, the table cloths are checkered, in discernibly romantic music plays and the maitre de talks like a Mario brother, you almost feel like you're in Italy but then you remember you are actually visiting a cousin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Everything is so on, that it just has to be off, ya know? Well, that's how Disney's latest effort, Invincible, feels (not the one with Billy Zane).<br/><br/>Invincible tells the story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg). A down on his luck bartender in South Philadelphia that tries out for the Eagles under new head coach Dick Vermeil. The year is 1976, the collars are blue, the city is entirely out of hope but the time is nigh for hearts to be warmed.<br/><br/>With the 70's songs jammin', the thick mutton chops or the nut-hugging shorts on dudes, you get the impression that Invincible is more concerned with period piece details than making a good movie. They talk about football as if it were a religion, hoping the viewers get lost in all of the lore and history of the NFL. To be fair, it does succeed on some fronts, like its portrayal of rotten-to-the-core Philly fans and the ownership that towns feel over their respective teams. These things are captured but really not as a product of this film but rather as a product of the bountiful lore and history of the NFL.<br/><br/>Speaking of rotten Philly fans, every shot of South Philly has a murky amber color treatment. Like we are watching everything take place at the bottom of a dirty glass of water. While heavy-handed, this does provide a nice dichotomy to the football scenes that are vibrant and alive with color, like a lucid bollywood dream.<br/><br/>While it is a fun trip, it's all a rehash. The buddies on strike, the estranged wife, the hope of a town riding on a hometown underdog, I guess I just don't see what separates this from other sports movies. It doesn't have the penned up emotion of Friday Night Lights or the mysticism of Hoosiers. It isn't a bad movie there just isn't much beyond a routine tale of triumph.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is the love interest, Janet Cantrell (Elizabeth Banks of Slither fame). See she's a Giants fan. It is amusing to see how the eagles fanatics respond to this blasphemy in the city of brotherly love but I wish that she came around in the end. Sure it is commendable when she stands up for her G-Men in a Philly bar. It is just reckless when she wears a Giants T-shirt to Veterans Stadium. And it is a downright shame when she roots for the Giants over the Eagles, the team that features the man she loves.<br/><br/>The film concludes with actual footage of Papale playing for the Eagles. This is the most inspiring stuff in the movie. In a film that strives for authenticity, this grainy film stock hits home. Papale makes tackles, returns a fumble for a touchdown and joyously hops around like a 6-year-old on Christmas morning. And anything that powerful is authentic enough for me."

Although Wahlberg doesn't look anything like Papale, his grit and go attitudes along with his agility make the story come alive. At a time during the Reaganomic years when jobs were disappearing like water on a hot stone, Papale a part-time teacher and bartender was selected by new coach, Vince Vermeil, as a walk-on to play on special teams. Playing largely on pure guts and natural talent, Papale went on to capture the imagination of Philadelphia fans and won a place in the hearts and imagination of all of us. The probability of such events are low but there is always that mythic hope that ""it could happen to one of us-- maybe even me."" This film which does not lavish a lot of time on maudlin themes has just enough sentiment not to be sentimental and enough sentiment to show the impact of a local boy making good when all the chips seems stacked against him. This is one of our most popular American myths and when we see it in films like The Rookie,Glory Road, Miracle and now, Invincible, which are built people slipping into fame and celebrity, we love it because it always sparks that hope that dwells deep in our American ethos."
"cashbacher","10","1","2","25 January 2019"," Excellent expression of a male fantasy
","On the surface, the Vince Papale story is one that all boys playing unorganized football fantasize about. Papale was working as a part-time bartender in his home town of South Philadelphia when he attended a tryout being held by the Philadelphia Eagles. He survived the tryout, attended training camp and was one of the last players retained on the roster. Papale became a hero to the people of Philadelphia, as he was living out what was for many the ultimate fantasy. Voted captain of the special teams, he played in the NFL for three years before an injury forced him to retire.
The movie is exciting and uplifting, as all embodiments of fantasies should be. While it is based on a true story, there are some serious actions of poetic license taken. For example, in the movie there is the dramatic touchdown where Papale tackles the punt returner forcing a fumble and then recovers it, carrying it into the end zone for a touchdown. In fact, Papale never scored a touchdown in the NFL, although he did force a fumble on a punt return. He is also portrayed as a football novice when he attended the Eagles tryout when he had played for two years on the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League. Therefore, he was not a complete unknown to the Eagle coaching staff. In the movie, Papale attends an open tryout where every nut with a football fantasy attended. In fact, his tryout was a private one to which he was invited.
While there is a lot of imagination put into the story, it is still one that uplifts you, for there are people that live or die in the virtual sense based on how well their home team performs. There is a lot of hometown pride inherent in people that are seeing the job market in their neighborhood collapsing due to changing economic conditions. Those aspects of the movie are very real."

He plays football with his friends and the whole city is in an economic malaise with strikes and lay offs. This one shot given by the new coach could be his way out of the slums.<br/><br/>I understand that the film really stretches the truth, however the way Wahlberg plays him even sexing up the story cannot ascend him from anything but a shy if dull everyman who is in a team that dislikes him especially the black players for some reason.<br/><br/>The film is actually pedestrian, even though he has no interesting personality he gets a hot girlfriend, moments of crisis which is only alleviated when he spends time playing football with his boys in the hood and a climax when he can actually block players running with the ball.<br/><br/>I suppose this could had been a better and more melodramatic television film. As a movie its OK but someone other than Wahlberg needed to play Papale."

","Invincible is the story of Vince Papale, a thirty year old bartender in the 70's, who won a spot on the Philadelphia Eagles, after attending an open tryout. Disney used this little known story in an attempt to re-capture the emotion and inspiration of their other sports films like The Rookie and Miracle, but sadly, they failed. Even for a sports movie, Invincible was very slow and drawn out. Mark Wahlberg does an adequate job of portraying Papale, but doesn't really bring much to the table. This was supposed to be an inspiring tale of overcoming the odds, instead it was the story of some guy who once made the Eagles, and didn't really do anything special. It wasn't impressive or inspiring in anyway. Invincible was simply about an old sports story that really wasn't anything special."

","I did not watch this until now because I expected it to be just another football movie. Boy did I almost miss the best.<br/><br/>I love the character development and the angles of the camera when showing the football plays. I felt like I was on the field, which I never felt watching other football movies. Most importantly, this movie shines for displaying why football matters to the local fans. Perhaps, that was the main theme of the movie. I also liked the fact that it was based on real story and real people.<br/><br/>Most movies these days are just trash or remakes, utterly lacking real purpose and originality. Like other viewers, I was engaged with this movie from the beginning to the end. And this without violence, sex, drugs, explosions, etc."
"go4matt","6","1","2","5 October 2006"," Matt's Review of Invincible
","These are my thoughts that were posted in the newspaper and online:<br/><br/>If you like films about football and underdogs, run a quick slant to the theater and see ""Invincible"". Cheerleaders and band members should skip this sports flick and stay home and practice.<br/><br/>In 1976, Vince Papale went to an open tryout for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles and against all odds he made the team. Mark Wahlberg stars as Papale. ""Invincible"" is based on Vince's real life inspirational story from bartender to professional football player.<br/><br/>Papale's life is well documented and he is a legend in South Philadelphia. This is a must-see film for anyone from that area.<br/><br/>""Invincible"" is definitely entertaining and I recommend it to fans of films such as ""Rudy"" or ""Hoosiers"" but it's by no means a classic. <br/><br/>What makes a sports film a classic is attention to detail but the movie's coaching staff drops the ball and fictionalizes aspects of Vince's life. I did some research and realized that many important facts were left out. In my opinion, it wasn't necessary and the film loses credibility in favor of dramatic license. It's like the studio didn't feel Vince's life was exciting enough, so they changed the truth.<br/><br/>Using Disney's logic, the next feel-good sports movie could be about the 1984 Chicago Cubs. Just change a few minor details and have them win the World Series. Bill Murray could star as Harry Caray.<br/><br/>There are numerous continuity mistakes but most people won't notice. Football purists will catch them. For example, the movie takes place in 1976 but a lot of the players wear modern facemasks. The oversights are not that big of a deal but it does make it fun to try and find the flubs.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the music. The early 70's soundtrack takes the viewer down memory lane and this adds a nice touch to the production. The oft-maligned Disney music department did their homework and dug deep for some musical gems.<br/><br/>There is some amazing unintentional comedy and ""Invincible"" puts the city of Philadelphia in a horrible light. The fans are portrayed as drunks and bums. The Director did get this part correct and my audience loved the performances.<br/><br/>The movie is rated PG because of on field violence. If you have children that play football, turn off the Xbox and take them to the movies. It's family friendly.<br/><br/>Matt's post-game report: ""Invincible"" is a solid picture but I'd rather watch a real game than pay to see a fake one.<br/><br/>Matt Bellner is an actor from Burbank. In 1992, Matt had a tryout for the Detroit Lions but did not make the team."

","This movie truly captures the passion, and the real love/hate relationship that Philadelphians have for the Eagles, and that if you work hard enough you can make your dreams come true. Even though this movie was filmed at Franklin Field at the University of Penn, (the Vet did not have bench seats, nor a track which can be seen in certain parts of the movie) the producers did a great job of recreating the true atmosphere of an Eagles game. <br/><br/>Even my non-football loving daughter liked this movie. For Eagles fans this is a must see. For everyone else, if you want to see a movie where the little guy beats the odd's, check this film out, you will not be disappointed, Philly fans love the Eagles, you will love this movie<br/><br/>--gfo"

","Being a life-long Eagles fan, I felt it almost a duty to go and see Invincible and see if it lived up to the good reviews it received. I remember Vince Papale playing for the Eagles in the mid 70's and remember him being a virtual crash dummy when it came to special teams. The movie did him justice. Beside some of the liberties that directors take in the name of artistic license, (Papale was actually from Delaware County, not South Philly) which only locals would know about, it was one of the better sports movies I've seen and I've seen most. It also shows parts of the South Philly that most people outside of Philadelphia don't see. I know that's what some of South Philly really looks like. Small, cramped row houses in tightly knit neighborhoods. Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Banks and Greg Kinnear give outstanding performances. Without them, the movie would never (pardon the pun) fly like an Eagle."

Besides... who cares? We like the main character and want him to succeed and win for his friends, family and mostly himself by the end of the movie! <br/><br/>I liked this movie more than I thought I would... being an old Dallas Cowboys fan, it was cool to see the producers cast actors that had the same build as the old Cowboys players of the 70's! I recognized the names of the Eagles players too and remembered their size and thought it was cool that they so closely cast actors to resemble those players! <br/><br/>A great popcorn movie... go see it at the theater and if you want to add it to your DVD collection later, well, do that too because this movie is worth it!"
"oneloveall","6","1","2","28 August 2006"," Football nobody hits hard but doesn't tackle
","Inspiring by-the-numbers, sports underdog movie that gets a surprisingly heartfelt, authentic treatment given the Disney pedigree and the general rehashed theme. This particular John Smith-soon-to-be- sports-star comes to us by way of Walberg's Vince Papale, the real life Philly Eagle who rose from obscurity to become one of those he was, only last season, seen idolizing. The general theme undoubtedly effects itself on the viewer, though the real life hopes of head coach Dick Vermille (the always reliable Greg Kinnear), in his unprecedented move to appoint Papale to the front lines due in part to the amount of heart his new star would infuse the tired old team, is doubtful at best. While the movie climaxes in a way that merely foreshadows the winning era these late 70's footballers were about to recapture, the validation Papale feels during his one victorious game seems sufficient enough to bring closure on this personal tale. Unfortunately, due to the intense but short starting period only being covered in this great career, the vision that Vermille saw in this player for building the foundation of his new winning team is hardly justified to the viewer, leaving with a conclusion that does feel warm and fuzzy, but not quite as powerful or realistic as film fans, especially sports fans would have wanted..This flies in the face of the otherwise realistic tone (albiet for Disney standards) that was taken to project the time and culture of this particular piece. Walberg continues to impress with the subtle refining of his craft, working throughout those long battle hardened years to peel away the macho posing which dominated his early life. His scaled back, nuanced approach lends itself nicely to the humble nature of his quiet character, beckoning audiences to cheer for his catches, and grunt for his tackles, in true Hollywood sports movie fashion."
"svhenry1956","8","1","2","25 August 2006"," What is your team?
","Football has been called the ultimate team game. The NFL is the ultimate football stage. What team do you root for? More importantly, however, what team do you play for? That's the question that must be answered, and gets answered well in Invincible.<br/><br/>Vince Papale loses his job; his wife leaves him, and then, to add insult to injury, she takes all of his stuff. At 30, he's reduced to asking his dad just for rent money. Philadelphia is going through its own crisis at the same time: strikes, layoffs, general economic malaise, urban blight. Vince's problems evidently were a microcosm of Philly's. Or were Philly's problems the result of a single Vince Papale multiplied a million times?<br/><br/>But Vince has one last shot at success. Every man's dream to play in the NFL. It's Rocky all over again. Curious that Vince Papale's football success happened in the same fall, 1976, that Sylvester Stallone's fictional Rocky became the nation's hero. Good year for cheese steaks, I guess. <br/><br/>Both sexes come together to get their needs met for this football movie The girls to see a really buff Mark Wahlberg in the locker room, and the boys to imagine that they would get that one in a million chance to play NFL football.<br/><br/>We all carry emotional baggage from the past with us wherever we go. Director Ericson Core, in his directorial debut, helmet butts us with the baggage symbolism. Vince carries his equipment bag from home to the bar to the locker room to the training camp dorm room. He has it packed and ready to go, when he gets the final cut notices. Perfect. We never let go of our old baggage.<br/><br/>How do we let go of the past? Does it motivate us to bigger and better achievements, or does it keep us from realizing our ultimate dream? It did both for Vince, as I suppose it does for us as well. Our past injuries leave scars; scars reflect healing, but forever remind us of the pain.<br/><br/>How does Vince let go of the past? His life failures were summed up in the note left by his not so understanding wife. He used it as motivation to make the team, but it wasn't enough. Only when Vince realized which team was his, did he realize his dream.<br/><br/>The mid-70's song soundtrack is the ultimate 12th man on both movie teams, always in the background, never overwhelming. Only true rock'n'roll fans will recognize ""I Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" without its lyrics as idiot Vince walks away for the second time from his new flame/coworker Janet (Elizabeth Banks). Plaid pants, polyester leisure suits, and huge shirt collars on the shirts definitely reminded us how bad 70's fashions really were. A good movie story without nudity, bad language, or gratuitous violence. Unless, of course, you're one of those wimps who call football gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how disappointed I was that a very young Dick Vermeil (played a little stiffly by Greg Kinnear) didn't weep like a baby when Vince scored. For those of you young fans that didn't know, Vermeil coached the Eagles long before he coached the Rams and Chiefs.<br/><br/>Best scene in the movie is when Vince answers which team is his own, and which team he plays for. You'll recognize it. Football doesn't get any better than that. Life doesn't get any better than that. If only all of us could see things so clearly. You'll cheer. Way to go, Vince. You figured it out..Then.Don't read the next paragraph if you don't want to know how it ends...<br/><br/>He got the girl; made the game saving tackle, recovered the fumble, scored the game willing touchdown, all in the last 5 minutes of the movie. If it weren't real, it would be too hokey to believe.<br/><br/>First, it was a Texan rooting for Notre Dame (Rudy) Then, a Lubbock Coronado boy rooting for Odessa Permian (Friday Night Lights) And now, a Cowboys fan rooting for the Eagles They did it to me again. Hollywood and football: what a magical combination. Go see it. Find your team."

","I'm a big Eagles fan, and I've always liked Mark Wahlberg's work, but I got to be honest here, I didn't find this movie that riveting or entertaining. I didn't expect it to be a perfect 10, but I had hoped for it to be an 8 or better on a scale of 1-10. I thought the movie missed the boat on a lot of key elements of Vince Papale's relationship with coach Vermeil, his relationships between other teammates and his old friends pulling for him. It seemed like everything was forced in this movie, not natural. Even the gridiron scenes were quite a bit over the top - Hollywood style. This movie was missing something, I think an authenticity of any kind, meaning it seemed detached and not in depth enough into the mind of Papale."

","** Mark Wahlberg, Greg Kinnear, Elizabeth Banks, Kevin Conway, Dov Davidoff. Directed by Ericson Core. We've seen this whole set up before, an underdog defies the team and does the impossible by achieving his dream in baseball, basketball or in this case football. This time the schmuck is Wahlberg who when a cruddy team holds open try outs they draft Wahlberg. Of course going over the clichéd obstacles of the other team mates and just making the cut with a new coach (Kinnear). <br/><br/>This whole set up is predictable and the wigs are laughable, some of the look like cheap toupees found on the sidewalk. The only thing INVINCIBLE about this is the story line which keeps going and going every year down from ""Remember the Titans"". Disney continues to prove dreams do come true, maybe next year so will mine, END IT. <br/><br/>Although I did like the cinematography, the playing in the rain and the symbolism of those scene and friendship. But after two long hours of nonstop training and running the movie much like the acting and everything else here gets tired. I don't hate sports movies but am biased against them like earlier this years ""Glory Road"". The all follow the same aspects in that genre. ""Invincible"" can only go so far before it stops"
"barberoux","7","1","3","20 October 2006"," Good Genre Movie
","""Invincible"" is a genre movie. It is a sports hero movie and of the type it was good. The genre calls for lots of male bonding touching, big handshakes, back thumps, hugs with back thumps, hugs sans thumps, etc. It also calls for a certain maudlin feeling in the absence of thumps and sports and this was in abundance in the life is hard dialog. A love interest is also needed and was provided by Elizabeth Banks whose tonsils were examined by Mark Wahlberg with their first kiss. I thought the photography outside of the football shots was pretty bad. I thought it was dark, blurry and grainy maybe trying to look depressing when contrasted with the footballs scenes. In short the movie provided just what you expect from the genre. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but I just wasn't impressed by the stereotypical set ups. The football scenes make the movie. Once they are start concentrating on the Eagles and Greg Kinnear as Dick Vermeil the movie was much better. I am not an especially rabid football fan but the Eagle's scenes were exciting. They were well photographed and choreographed and were exciting and affecting. Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear were very good in their roles and the rest of the cast were good given the dialog they were given. The basic story of a bartender given a chance to play professional football, especially since it was true, was uplifting and this movie portrayed the excitement and hope that this event gave to the city. If you're a football fan the movie is a must see. Others may find the maudlin tone of the non-football scenes too much. I liked the movie and recommend it."

In 1976, Vince Papale is a big Phili fan, but his life slowly falls apart, his wife of five years leaves him and loses his job as a substitute high school teacher, although he was night time bartender, it doesn't seem enough for him. Then the coach for the Philis' named Dick Vermiel decides to try some new talents by having try outs for the team, Vince decides to give it a try, but after Vince displays amazing football skills than most of the try outers, he is asked to come to sports camp.

","Imagine for a moment, not only meeting the players on your favorite pro-sports team, but playing on the same team - as a walk on from an open tryout !!! This is the backdrop of 'Invincible'. Mark Wahlberg plays Vince Papale - who is everyones favorite South Philly bartender/sandlot football player.<br/><br/>My major disappointment with the story is that the Papale character is played as quiet, almost shy - and to me, not very likable. I've seen recent interviews with the real Vince Papale - who seems affable and outgoing - so perhaps I was influenced by that.<br/><br/>Papale's wife leaves him after he comes home from a game of tackle and she challenges him to find a job instead of getting bruised about the face playing football in an empty lot (seemed reasonable to me). I understand Papale is down on his luck and out of work but even when things started to break his way, he is sullen and apologetic to anyone who will listen. C'mon Papale, you've been the Toast of the Town for 2 months and even though you have zero personality, the gorgeous blonde is after you - smile a little ...<br/><br/>The football action looks real and the soundtrack really helps sets the 70's mood. The scene of Papale making the team felt good but if I liked him more - the payoff would have been stronger.<br/><br/>Overall - an average film. Wait until the DVD or On Demand is available is my advice."
"Phillycursed86","9","1","3","27 August 2006"," Barely flawed but thoroughly enjoyed
","well in all honesty i wasn't sure whether I'd go to see this cause I've been apprehensive about seeing Disney films over the last couple yrs. (sans- pirates of the Caribbean). When I heard the story of Vince though before the movie I thought, what the hell. This movie felt as though it was based so much more on the environment than it was about the man. Vince Papale symbolized the spirit of 1 city better than any person I remember ever hearing of and that includes Rocky and Rudy. The only thing I have to ask and maybe this is because of my lack of age (20 yrs. old thank you) but what is or what was Columbo's? and not to get on someone's ass but when I'm watching scenes of the vet how come someone didn't have enough foresight to cover up the track around Franklin Field with Astroturf? Outside of that Mark Wahlberg does a great job thinking back to some of his more recent films I wonder whether he has a funny bone in him cause some of his lines could have been delivered in a more lighter mood. Oh well, great movie and please for the love of god don't spoil it with a dumb-ass attempt at a sequel."
"MovieZoo","7","1","4","25 August 2006"," Invincible - well, not quite. Reality outscores interest.
","I know nothing about the book written by Vince Papale other than what I believe to be true after seeing the movie. The movie appeared to be factual and thats why this movie was less than great. So much time was put into making Invincible look real that spectacle, glamor and intrigue seemed to be mostly overlooked.<br/><br/>I can relate somewhat to the movie as Papale tried to overcome hard times while just trying to stay alive - without hope for any future. Opportunity made the difference for Papale and intense desire carried him to a great future. Even if I had the opportunity, I do not know if I could have ever been one to stick with the goal he had made for himself. So, being able to relate; being able to understand his place in life, you might think I would say I loved this movie. I wanted to but I came away slightly disappointed. I didn't see any spectacle, glamor and intrigue.<br/><br/>He got what he wanted and the movie was over, or so it seemed.<br/><br/>I was OK with the acting - nothing really spectacular there. The story dragged for so long that it was easy to get ahead of myself. I don't think replaying relationships needed to be done so often. No wonder instant replays are limited in the NFL, they really DO slow things down.<br/><br/>I apologize to fans of 1970's music, but damn, they could have used a lot less in the movie. I understand they wanted the movie to look real but overusing the music cheapened the affect of the movie.<br/><br/>No matter, the movie was good enough to see and good enough for a couple chuckles and a few tears. Add this to the list of good sports movies but do not expect it to get inducted into the Hall of Fame.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear was an excellent Coach Vermeil(Vermeil is my all-time favorite coach). Mahlberg scored with his performance as well. Elizabeth Banks just gets better and better but can still be even better - and I am sure she will.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7 of 10. The overall story was good, though they could have played it out much better. If the objective was to get people into the theater, they accomplished their goal but it didn't win the game. They needed to try harder. It will make a lot of people glad they saw the movie but will not make the masses stand up and cheer. It just doesn't have that heart-warming that most great sports movies have."

","Like the movie's lead character, Vince Papale, ""Invincible"" is just good enough to be worth the price of admission. Fair warning though: while it may keep you in your seat, it's unlikely to ever keep you on its edge.<br/><br/>As a Philly homegrown living in Wisconsin, I found myself out of place inadvertently rooting on the dramatized Eagles games during the sneak preview I saw two weeks ago. The action was very real, and from the superimposed Veterans Stadiums backdrops to the opening chorus of booing from the often disgruntled Philly faithful, the movie facially carried a degree of authenticity.<br/><br/>Yet within the many layers and contours that are spoon-fed to you mercilessly (Papale represents the common man in us all; we live vicariously through our athletes, especially when they're homegrown; if you're a moral guy, you'll get the break and possibly the hot girl at the bar, etc. etc. etc...), you're left with nothing more than an artificial showcase dessert with a hollow filling.<br/><br/>Here's the rub: the movie lacks a niche. While ""Invincible"" is geared towards the kids (I'm not so sure ""darn it"" and ""heck"" were common lingo in the 1970s Eagle's locker room), the movie's legitimacy hinges on its fairly apparent devotion to historical accuracy. But unless you're an NFL die-hard or a Philly alum alive during this era, you get lost in the lingo and the football references. Thus, the movie has the tenor of a G rated flick, with the context of something significantly more mature.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Disney once again plagiarized from themselves by borrowing from their cash cow zero-to-hero storyline reminiscent of ""The Rookie"" and ""Miracle."" Sure this is a winning formula, but it gets trite after you realize that for the seventh time in a row you called dead-on what the next plot sequence would entail.<br/><br/>In the end, you leave slightly more upbeat than you started, and you smile cause we all carry a little Vince Papale within us. But when you wake up the next morning and the co-workers ask how the movie was, you'll surprise yourself when you have to pause and consider whether you actually saw a slice of movie magic or you were just briefly satisfied by a small helping of icing."

Its hard not to, another one of those inspirational sports-underdog stories that has you invested and cheering for a down on his luck local hero.<br/><br/>Mark Whalberg puts in a great performance here as Vince Papale, he's a hero we can relate to, just an average neighborhood guy trying to get by in a tough economy, working as a bartender after he loses his teaching job due to budget cuts, his wife has just left him (and a ""nice"" note) proclaiming he will never amount to anything. Vince gets his chance when the Philadelphia Eagles announce open tryouts for the team. At 30 and never having played college ball he doesn't expect this to lead anywhere, instead just decides to take the opportunity to stand on the same field as his idols.<br/><br/>The story here is very similar to 'Rocky' with the Eagles taking the place of Apollo Creed (actually when I think about it there's too many comparisons to count so I won't go there) It's a great movie regardless, lots of interesting secondary characters to get invested in, with the whole neighborhood garnishing hope from Vince's success, a budding romance, a coach that is very likable (Greg Kinnear) yet also out of his depths with this losing team.<br/><br/>This has been put on by Walt Disney Pictures so there is a certain amount of sugar coating to how this story has been told.

","The movies backdrop was football. Yet this movie really wasn't a football movie nor really a sport movie so it shouldn't be summarized based upon that fact. The story really is centered about a down and out guy named Vince, who seems to not have anything really going for him after losing his job and marriage. The only glue in Vinces sanity to keep him going is friends and brother and also their love for the NFLs Eagles in Philly. With great luck he as well as the city gets a chance to try out for the beloved team. So the story goes on with character build up making you feel sympathy for the guy and in that sorrow you start rooting for him to do well with the team. Its a classic underdog story, even to the understanding that the underdog will triumph at the end. I must say though that after further research on the real story, certain liberties were taken with the film but that is to keep the movie flowing and to entertain the audience. Even though this movie does not garner any awards its a good film to enjoy again."

","I'll have to admit bias on this one. Not so much because I grew up a Philadelphia Eagles fan, but because even more than that I am a huge fan or the underdog and outsider. Even better, Invincible is based on a true story of a man walking on to his hometown NFL team.<br/><br/>In the drab and recession-laden mid-1970s, the lowly Philadelphia Eagles are so bad that their new head coach, Dick Vermeil, announces team tryouts open to the public on live TV. While every Eagles fan and football-obsessed yahoo in town lines up, one standout athlete, a 30 year old bartender named Vince Papale is good enough to make the team and go pro.<br/><br/>In a style reminiscent of Rocky, the film's character struggles not only with his past failures amidst a new challenge of making the cut day-by-day, but he also grapples with his new role as a star and outcast in his own microcosm of working class Philadelphia life.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear and Mark Wahlberg are both convincing in their roles, and even if you're a Giants or Cowboys fan, you will be inspired to root for Papale as the underdog that delivers on game day.<br/><br/>written by Andy Frye, MySportsComplex.blogspot.com"
"cgallo","9","0","1","20 February 2011"," Well Cast Sports Film With Realistic Dialogue
","Mark Wahlberg continues to surprise and impress. This ostensibly is a sports film based on a true story, but the excellent cast delivers effective character driven scenes that elevate the proceedings into a watchable relationship drama. I love a good ""walk and talk"" scene and there are several. The director and editor are not afraid to have a fixed 2-shot during dialog (director Ericson Core is also the Director of Photography), more of a treat today in a world of herky-jerky hand held photography.<br/><br/>Period music is blended into a realistic background, especially in the bar scenes which are a backbone to the first half (heh) of the movie. My only quibble might be the casting of Elizabeth Banks as the love interest. The first time we see them in the same frame, well, the outcome is obvious. Ms Banks does a credible job and it is no negative reflection on her that she creates an attractive bar maid.<br/><br/>There is an interesting interview with Vince Papale over at DVD Fodder: http://www.filmfodder.com/dvd/archives/2006/12/vince_papale_in.shtml"
"ankysurfs","8","0","1","20 September 2010"," Just perfect..!!
","It's not perfect, but Invincible works well as an uplifting study in hard work, humility, and perseverance. I hate to use the word ""hero"" when talking about sports icons, but if you have to idolize a guy who throws around a ball for a living, Vince Papale is the one to pick. The film plays out perfectly, hitting every note with practiced precision. Its score deserves special praise, a stellar mix of period specific rock and some of the best underdog makes good orchestral I've ever heard. Like everything about this film, it's a moving, uplifting, and a surprise. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but Invincible lifts itself beyond the genre to tell the simple, true story of a man beating the odds through sheer force of will. Maybe Vince Papale isn't a hero, but like Rocky, Rudy, or any of the other classic sports figures we idolize, but he comes damn close."
"markymark70","8","0","1","20 May 2010"," Rocky on the Football Field
","Who doesn't like an underdog story? A story where the hero comes from nothing to make it at the very top. Rocky did it - but that was from the brain of Stallone, a fictional story and character. However, Invincible is about a true life Joe who overcame all the odds to be a pro-football player.<br/><br/>I'm from the other side of the pond - Ireland - and football to me means something completely different. Neither do I have any interest in American football and not much knowledge of the rules / set-plays / special teams etc. etc. But this movie transcends all that and delivers a message centered around belief, never giving up on your dream and most importantly of all - friendship.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is very good in his portrayal of Vince Papale - a 30 year old barman from Philidelphia who makes it on to a professional football team - Eagles - after an open try-out session organised by the new, desperate coach. Wahlberg has really improved in his acting as his career develops. Sure, he has duds (Planet of the Apes anyone?) but he has successes too (Basketball Diaries, Four Brothers, Shooter). This role is perfect for him. Even though he looks a little small to be a footballer, it simply adds to his likability. He is certainly well-built but his hangdog, everyman look fits so easily here that I, as a viewer, could totally buy into the fact that he was a down on his luck, out of work teacher trying hard to make his way in tough times in a tough city. He plays the role with such respect and pathos - that's its hard not to root for the guy. When he eventually makes it - I felt a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Mission accomplished from his point of view.<br/><br/>The direction of the movie is above average. First time director Ericson Cole does a good job on the scene setting, football sequences and some nice touches of CGI for some of the stadium shots. The opening montage depicting life in 1970's Philly to the backdrop of Jim Croce's lilting music is a fantastic introduction to the movie. I'm sure there are some liberties taken with the 'true' story but for dramatic effect there has to be - so no complaints here on that score. After all, for me, it is a movie first and a true story second.<br/><br/>Banks does a nice job with her (slightly underwritten) part as does all the buddies from Max's bar. Kinnear too is good as new coach Vermeil. But without Wahlberg stepping up to the mark - the whole thing could have gone down the toilet. But he is brilliant here. Even though Wahlberg has had his troubles down through the years (I could not stand him as Marky Mark) he has matured a lot and has a little rags to riches flavour about his own life too. Yet, he doesn't seem to act like a movie star. He projects the image of a quiet, hard working, prepared individual who knows how lucky he is to be where he is today and is not about to get all 'showbusiness' and lose it all.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is an uplifting, inspiring story with some great gravitas and excellent performances. The only quibble I have is the sheer number of scenes in the film which show Wahlberg walking alone down a street, away from the camera. Not sure if this was supposed to signify something or not but it just got a little tiresome after a while. However - that is a small gripe. The other downside to the film is it's promotion over in Europe was very low key. So low key in fact that I do not even remember if it had a cinema release or not. I know it's a tough sell because of the American Football element but the DVD could have been pitched better too. Not a criticism of the movie per se but rather of the distribution of it.<br/><br/>Great movie, great performances, inspiring stuff. 8/10."

","Very much in the 'ROCKY' style where an unknown gets his dream shot. I never thought i'd end up watching a Disney film on T.V at 1am but this had me hooked from the start, and also being a sucker for true story's it kept me watching. mark wahlberg was pretty out-standing, with the rest of the cast doing a fine job's. Maybe Hollywood has taken liberties with all the facts but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The film is paced just right and for me the sound track was spot on. This film defiantly tick's the underdog story box but also ticks the feel-good box too. And by the end i found myself giving a little fist pump for Vince. The only thing i didn't like was the sepia tint on the camera, maybe it was an effect to give it a more retro feel, but it is only a minor criticism."
"PudgyPandaMan","8","0","1","15 February 2009"," Down-on-luck guy makes it to the big time
","This movie is inspired by the story of Vince Papale. The basic plot is a bartender who plays street ball answers an open tryout for the Philedelphia Eagles. To everyones surprise, he not only makes it but goes on to play for 3 seasons.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the producers took dramatic license and altered some facts. First of all, Vince had played pro ball before - he played for 2 seasons for the WFL for the Philedelphia Bells prior to trying out for the Eagles. That fact was left out to make it seem even more unlikely that this average Joe can just walk on and make the NFL. Also, he wasn't from South Philly - he was from Prospect Park which is about 30 miles away.<br/><br/>But details aside, it is still a very inspiring story. Philly and a lot of the country was experiencing hard times in the 70's. Much like we are now. And everybody loves an underdog that rises form the ashes and makes good.<br/><br/>They did a good job in creating the characters that surround Vince to keep it interesting. I like the touch of having his wife walk out just prior to his trying out - and writing that nasty note that goes on to inspire him to NEVER GIVE UP.<br/><br/>There is nostalgia galore for those of us who experienced the 70's - from the crazy clothes (men playing football in short-shorts with tube socks), the great soundtrack music, the muscle cars, mutton-chop sideburns, and very BUSY wallpaper. Were the 70's really sepia-toned? (I guess it could've been depending on what you were smoking). They used some type of dark lens or color filter in the filming so as to add to the nostalgic feel.<br/><br/>There were some memorable moments in the film. It was heartbreaking when he comes home to his empty apartment to learn his wife has left and took everything, leaving behind a heartless note to add to his humiliation. You wait in breathless anticipation with Vince as he sits alone in his Training camp dorm room with his playbook in hand - listening to the coach's steps approaching outside his door, letting players go. There is the funny moment when you hear Vince ""losing his lunch"" in the bathroom before his first game, only to see Coach Vermeil exit the next stall - having just done the same. I think the neighborhood pickup game filmed in the rain was beautifully filmed (especially the slow motion) and communicated how much these guys loved the game. And who can forget the moment in his first home game when Vince finally sees success as he tackles the kickoff returner - and then stops and point ups to his friends who are going crazy in the the stands.<br/><br/>There is a lot to cheer for in this feel-good film. There are themes of friendship, courage, determination and, ultimately, about never giving up. It's also a film you can watch with the whole family, which is rare these days. You will leave this movie smiling and feeling inspired!"
"KMPadden","10","0","2","30 December 2008"," Mark Wahlberg & Gregg Kinnear made me a believer!!!
","What an inspirational masterpiece! <br/><br/>In my opinion, both Mark Wahlberg's AND Gregg Kinnear's performances of Coach Vermeil and Vince Papale (respectively) -made me believe that they actually WERE the guys who they were ""playing"". This picture transcends the boundaries of individual team loyalty for each viewer, and tuns EVERYBODY that watches it into an Eagles Fan!<br/><br/>As a life long LOYAL Green Bay Packers Fan, this is still one of the few pictures that brings a tear to my eye Every time I watch it - in spite of the fact (for me) that the team in the movie is NOT my beloved Green Bay Packers.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful scenes (for me) was watching the little kid run out into the street after the football - when Vince goes for a drive towards the end of the picture - and the kid turns his back on Vince to reveal his ""home made"" number ""83"" jersey - made with simple masking tape. Having grown up in Wisconsin during the ""Vince Lombardi Golden Age of Packer Football"" - this scene especially hits home for me - as we kids - whose parents could not afford to buy us a ""real"" Packer's Jersey - resorted to the exact same thing. I was that same kid in 1963...... but My ""masking tape number"" was ""66"" - for Ray Nitschke - the monster middle linebacker for the Packers.<br/><br/>In MY opinion - This film should be required viewing in all schools - because it stresses the moral of believing in yourself and never quitting no matter what. This is an inspiration for me, and whenever I need a personal morale booster - ""Invincible"" is one of the few movies I watch to get myself ""squared away"" and back into the fight.<br/><br/>Kudos to the Cast & Crew for a masterpiece that will be a classic for all time - right up there with ""The Knute Rockne Story"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"""

","""really wasn't all that good a movie  but he looked hot in it."" - female viewer.<br/><br/>Pretty much sums up the Mark Wahlberg vehicle, *Invincible*. Written like a Runaway Cliché by Brad Gann and directed well by Ericson Core, *Invincible* is one of those ""Inspired by a True Story"" films that is itself geared to inspire. Grimace. Though it is a heartfelt tribute to a Philadelphia Eagles footballer, its underdog-makes-good plot has been told once, twice, three times too often. Trouble is: if the plot IS the actual ""true story,"" how do you tell it any other way? Quandary.<br/><br/>In the mid-70s, while Sylvester Stallone shopped his invincible script set in Philadelphia, *Rocky*, a real life Philadelphia native was proving he truly was invincible. Vince Papale, a 30 year-old part-time bartender and street footballer, attended open tryouts for his lifelong football heroes, the Eagles, making it through the rigorous culling process and eventually joining the team. With Stallone's film released concurrently with Papale's unexpected rise to fame, Papale was often regarded as the real life Rocky.<br/><br/>In *Invincible*, Mark Wahlberg is Papale, bringing the role his legitimate, street-credible, freight train demeanor. Head down, do the job. Papale's only respite from the gloom of the '75 recession is the local football game with his pub pals (a cast of familiar serial actors, from The Sopranos, NYPD Blue, Law & Order, Oz, to name a few). Times are hard. Papale's wife leaves him. His part-time teaching post is cut. His NFL favorites, the Eagles, are continually losing.<br/><br/>Times are so hard that the Eagles bring in a new coach, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear, in a sincere performance of an insincere hairdo), who ""shakes things up"" by offering open tryouts to snare new blood for the despondent Eagles. <br/><br/>At the urging of his pub buddies, Papale tries out  and makes the cut. The reality must have been a thing to behold: the fact is, Papale WAS recruited by the Eagles in 1976  without one game of college ball under his belt - so he must have possessed some wild aptitude to shine above the engine-pit of Philly's dregs.<br/><br/>Core shoots the movie through a beautiful, tan-hued ""tobacco"" lens that lends it a vintage air  fashions, television broadcasts, vehicles, all reeking nostalgic 70s. We can almost interchange Wahlberg here with himself in *Boogie Nights* (1997). Conceptually, Wahlberg can also do an interchange with his character in *Rock Star* (2001), another story of a commoner who rises above the pit; who follows an institution and then becomes a part of that institution. (Coincidentally, this movie, like *Rock Star*, also lavishes Ted Nugent's *Stranglehold* on the soundtrack.) <br/><br/>Core captures Papale's isolation and subsequent adulation, all in Panoramic Formulaic. The clichés and foreshadowing are SO OBVIOUS that when we are slammed with them, we immediately feel dirty. Exhibit A: After Papale has played a few Eagles games, he visits the old neighborhood game, opting to watch from his car. One of his bitter buddies invites him to play, ""Don't know how long the Eagles might want to use you, but your friends could really use you,"" and Papale declines because he ""has a game tomorrow."" His buddy rejoins the game as it starts to rain.<br/><br/>Can you see it coming? Better, can you see it coming In The Rain? IN SLOMO? Sho'nuff, Papale steps out of his car into the rain, into the mud, into the slomo. Yes, Screenwriters and Plot Developers, this is why he's doing it - for the love. For the game. For the Boys.<br/><br/>Exhibit B: During open tryouts, there is a closeup shot of Papale looking up at the empty bleachers, obviously contemplating what it would be like to see them packed with fans. Which means we will see this same shot in the third act - but with bleachers packed with fans. We do. In slomo, of course.<br/><br/>Exhibit C: Throughout the movie, his friends fantasize a winning play (""Papale's at the 40, he's at the 30, the 20"") so frequently that we can do nothing but be caveman-clubbed over the head when this Defining Moment *does* come - whether we like it or not, and whether we like it in slomo or not; majestic soundtrack icing the play and the commentator's exact calling of the play as fantasized. Thank you, Disney. No, thank YOU, Vince Papale.<br/><br/>""He played like a guy who lived his dream  however long it was gonna last."" I don't know about the validity of the word ""inspirational"" any more. If you have the aptitude and the love for something, and if you're given the chance, and if you succeed, well, would you need to draw inspiration from movies such as *Invincible*? Your career fell into lockstep with your particular talents. Boo-hoo to anyone who says Life Is Hard.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in not realizing your potential in any field where your talent outshines those around you, *would* you draw inspiration from this film? Or would it be a bitter, cynical viewing, whining to those around you about the fallacy of golden opportunities, while they're just trying to ogle Wahlberg's biceps? It seems the ""inspirational"" element will only be gleaned by those who don't know any better. Following your dream might very well lead down a dead end, chillun, so keep it in perspective: the majestic music and the cheering crowd  and the slomo  would have us believe the Defining Moment was a transfiguration from bartender to god, but he just ran across a line drawn on fake grass. It's just a touchdown. He ain't curing cancer.<br/><br/>THAT - would be Invincible."

Hard to say that any new creative ground was broken with Invincible, but it was well done and con-Vinc(e)-ing enough to get a thumbs-up from me. We all love to see a deep underdog win, even if it's for the 100th time, and even in worn out Rocky-town. This was a football Rocky flick, yes, but the story moves our hearts just the same, as it is a profoundly human story that will always move us if well told, and this one was surely well told. Faith and hope are what keeps us all going, and this film was filled with both.<br/><br/>What I liked best is that it showed that people still can and do pull together for a common cause if their beliefs are strong enough, even if it's sports and not the world of real life(To these guys, the Eagles were more important than real life). Beliefs here were shown to be stronger almost than breathing, really more like a choice between life and death. The poor, struggling but tough-as-nails guys shown in this 'hood had such a hard time being even close to successful in life, but their faith in the Eagles kept them going until it all finally paid off in a winner, and especially for Vince Papali, the bartender/substitute teacher profiled so well here. And, he got the girl! Yo, Adrian, where are you when we need you?"

It was a good teaming resulting in a great story.<br/><br/>There is little point in recapping the movie as it has been talked about by others and it is a true story.

I found it fun to watch, there are some parts that will make you laugh, but the overall feel is pretty serious.

It surprised me, being yet another Disney movie about football. But it was really touching. After seeing it, it made me want to play football! The movie is about a man named Vince Papale who's life was going slowly downhill. His girlfriend left him and took everything, and he was barely surviving off of his job at a bar, and being a substitute teacher at a school, in which he got fired from by the way. Anyhow, I think the Philadelphia Eagles were looking for new players and without anything else to do, Vince went through vigorous struggle to get on the team.<br/><br/>In the end, he made it on the team and showed everyone that he could be a great player, despite him not taking college football.<br/><br/>I think the plot was very simple and kind of cliché. But it was still an excellent filmed. They turned something easy and simple into something complex and still interesting. So I would definitely recommend seeing ""Invincible"" and possibly go with a few friends, like I did. It'll make you laugh and smile. It's just fun.

","Ericson Core, first motion picture brings the usually impressive performance by Mark Wahlburg together with an inspiring true story. Invincible, to be grouped with the likes of Miracle and The Rookie, a string of true, inspirational sports stories adapted into motion pictures by the memorable Walt Disney family. This story in particular chronicles the ""mid-life"" of Vince Papale, a bar tender who outplays all of his childhood friends in weekly football games in the neighborhood. This formula is spot on as the film makes us root for the kid who never played college ball, and ends up making the Philadelphia Eagles. Ericson Core's experience with cinematography clearly shows in his motion picture debut as all his action shots are very smooth, and executed without any confusion. Along with all true stories this film comes equipped with a written conclusion before the end credits roll, explaining Papale's future and where he is now.

","Though Disney has had their ups and downs in the past few years, one thing has remained consistent: Their sports movies. Here comes a movie that is very similar in plot as another Disney sports movie, the Rookie, but this time it is with a football. Even though this movie is full of sports cliques (lets face it, how many really haven't), but can stand on its own quite well! Its a movie about second chances and how important sports play in the lives of regular people. I really do believe that Pro Athletes should watch this movie because it shouldn't be about the money, but rather, the feeling you get that your are indirectly changing people's lives for the better and they actually look up to you. I think this is very clear in this movie and this is what sets it apart a little bit! Another great thing about this movie is that it is univeral and can be watched by anybody of any age and still get the message! This is what Disney does best, making movies that families enjoy on different levels. Also for a sports movie, it has very little swearing so little kids can watch it which is rare with sports movies reciently (Longest Yard, Any Given Sunday?). Is the movie the greatest in the world? Probably not, but it entertains and gives a crutial sports lesson without using nudity, swearing, or excessive violence. This movie is definitely worth your time and money!"

It was interesting to watch, and took me back. I enjoyed that aspect of it.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Vince, altho i haven't a bloody clue as to whether it was an accurate portrayal or not. From my seat, tho--Mark was endearing and tormented, and it came across--even with little dialogue from him. I felt his struggle, and totally bought how desperately he worried over letting his friends and father down. But more than that--i totally bought how terrified he was that one of his fellow bar patrons (the bitter fellow constantly across the bar) was right: that despite any current luck--in the end--he would always be just like the rest of them--a big fat 0. Nothing.<br/><br/>The desperate times (the layoffs and strikes) added to the heavy feeling in the air, and the depiction of the 70's was true to form --imo. All said: I liked it very much, and without hesitation would recommend it to anybody who needs a good boost from a film. In my opinion--an under-dog making good in movies is always a wonderful thing to experience!"

I'm sitting thinking, 'columbos? I've never heard of it... gotta try it sometime.' Then when they get there it's Pat's! Why not just use 'Pat's' in the movie, I doubt they would care! Also, I wished they used an actual television station instead of the fictitious WDPA Channel 11. C'mon, with all the effort to recreate the Vet and get great shots of Philly... go the extra mile and include more realism.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought Invincible was one of the best feel good movies of the year! I highly recommend all sports fans check it out."

","Questions for you experts out there: <br/><br/>* Some players were shown but not others. You never see Bergey's face for example and he was a major part of that team (just acquired by Vermeil from Bengals, as I recall). <br/><br/>Did Disney have to front some $ to Dennis Franks and others whose likenesses were used? <br/><br/>* Was Bill Bradley still on the Iggles in 1976? You see his jersey in on a tackle on D somewhere in the movie.<br/><br/>* If Papale's wife is named Sandy, why'd they call her Janet in the movies (and even in the end credits where it says he lives with his wife Janet in Jersey). <br/><br/>Anyone know?"

","I felt this was my favorite movie experience all year. I've never been a big Mark Wahlberg fan, but he was very believable as Vince Papale and you can't help but cheer for him.

I feel that this film transcends football and will reach beyond the normal sports movies aficionados.<br/><br/>Kevin Conway was great as Vince's Dad. My favorite line in the whole film was, ""Just because I told you not to get your hopes up didn't mean I didn't get mine up."" It really brought home the way sports can have real meaning in our lives. I k now this is wishful thinking, but I would love to see this up for some awards.

","Ericson Core's ""Invincible"" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love. The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt. I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame. It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time. But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to. It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around playing football and bartending ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does. And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth. It's sick, but at the same time brilliant. And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it. It just is what it is. It's real. No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows. And no one does anything about it. In essence, ""Invincible"" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences. It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining."

"cwrdlylyn","7","0","1","30 August 2006"," INVINCIBLE: Refreshingly Not ""Schmaltzy"" & Entertaining... But Nothing Spectacular
","INVINCIBLE <br/><br/>Here we have Disney offering up another family-friendly, inspirational movie about football in the tradition of REMEMBER THE TITANS. This time it tells the story of Vincent Papale (played by Mark Whalberg), an average-joe bartender in Philadelphia who manages to land a spot on the Philadelphia Eagles by attending an open call. After making it into training with the losing sports team, Papale must fight to keep up with the pros and prove he not only has what it takes to earn a spot on the team... but he has what it takes to make them winners.<br/><br/>INVINCIBLE follows the many clichés one can expect from a sports movie like this. Every character has a redemption, everything feels uplifting, and everything is going to work out in the end with a climactic football game. However, INVINCIBLE manages to utilize all those clichés without ever getting overtly sappy.<br/><br/>The usual downfall of an ""uplifting"" movie is that it constantly teeters back and forth between schmaltzy and genuinely compelling territory. INVINCIBLE manages to remain on the ""genuinely compelling"" side longer then the ""schmaltzy"" side and a great deal of that belongs to the director and his star.<br/><br/>Ericson Core, in his feature-film directorial debut, manages to find camera tricks that capture the football field in ways I've never seen before. Especially compelling is his opening scan over a crowded snowy parking lot as the camera makes it's way over to the field. Aside from interesting camera-work, Core manages to keep the tone realistic at most times, keeping his actors from over-emoting or playing scenes for maximum emotional impact. There's a subtlety here that kept me from every feeling manipulated... for example, we're spared the cliché final monologue of motivational excess.<br/><br/>Mark Whalberg proves again that he is a better actor then many people give him credit for. He has always excelled at playing an honest everyman with honest aspirations for success. He did it in BOOGIE NIGHTS, ROCK STAR (yes, I liked it), and now here. Whalberg's acting style mixes perfectly with Core's tone. Whalberg has never been an actor who seems to be overplaying his emotions... as a matter of fact, he often underplays them in this film. Letting all his anger, all his happiness remain very internal. As a result, Whalberg's Papale feels more like a real person then a puppet used to draw tears from it's audience.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, despite it's quality production, INVINCIBLE remains incredibly predictable. And though it succeeds at never over-playing it's emotions... it also doesn't manage to really thrill the audience either. I found myself entertained by INVINCIBLE but not necessarily moved. Overall, it's a good effort and all performers do good work... but INVINCIBLE, though solid and entertaining, is not a stand-out in the genre.<br/><br/>... B- ..."

I had never heard of Papale before this movie, I'm not really a big sports fan either. <br/><br/>It starts by showing you how messed up his world is in a town where depression has hit hard, no jobs for anyone around as he has to work as a substitute teacher and part-time bartender to make ends meet.<br/><br/>There is an open call for anyone that thinks they have what it takes, so after a few of his friends keep after him to go and try out he figures what the heck, what do I have to lose.<br/><br/>The Eagles being his hometown team gives him almost a hero's status among his friends as he defies all obsticales and pushes his way into getting on the team then stays on for three seasons with the Eagles.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg does a great job playing Vince Papale in this film along with Greg Kinnear as his coach.<br/><br/>Again, if you like watching those movies about sports with an underdog, such as Rudy or Glory Road then you will probably like this one as well."
"MadeOfScars","10","0","2","29 August 2006"," Disney is GREAT with football movies
","First Remember the Titans and now Invincible. Disney has really got the right formula for making a good football movie. I actually think Invincible is better than Remember the Titans. If you like football movies then you will love this. And if you don't like football movies, you will still love this. It's that good.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story of Vince Papale, a huge fan of the Philadelphia Eagles during the 70's (a time when the Eagles were at a real low point). After a horrendous season, the Eagles hire Dick Vermeil to try and restore a little dignity to the franchise. Vermeil decides to hold open tryouts to any Eagles fan who thinks they can make the team. He's trying to put a little energy back in the fans. Papale, a 30 year who never played college ball, gets talked into going to the tryout by his friends. To find out more you will have to watch this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie isn't the football aspect of it (although I would be lying if I said I wasn't on the edge of my seat pumping my fist in the theater). The best part is Disney's ability to show the poverty the people of Philadelphia were suffering from. You really sympathize with Papale and everyone around him. When he suffers, you suffer and when he triumphs, you triumph. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get to the movies this weekend."

","This is an excellent movie. A movie I can actually see with my children and grandchildren without worry. No profanity, no sex scenes. Hollywood take note, great movies are not dependent on shock value. A good story with great acting is what Invincible is all about, and by adding a wonderful moral and lesson of hope makes it an outstanding movie. I would see this movie again. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. Its the best movie of the season. Mark W. played the role of his lifetime, I hope ""Oscar"" is in his future for this one. It was a punishing role physically, and emotionally it had to be a challenge, and he pulled it off with great success."

But coach Vermeil becomes amazed by Papales athletic skills, and offers him to come train with the team at training camp. But then Vince wonders if he can pull it off. A truly great film, Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are incredible in there roles. So is Elizabeth Banks as Janet, a long way from 40 Year Old Virgin role, she really proved she is a descent actress.

","I enjoyed this film, and was greatly impressed with the performances of Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear. I am glad that I did no homework on the true story of Vince Papale before viewing the film, since the filmmakers played it loose and cagey with the true football resume of the man, and just how it was that he became a Philadelphia Eagle.<br/><br/>The action was top-notch, and Mark Wahlberg deserves kudos for both his athleticism and for the amount of punishment he must have taken during the filming of this movie. (He apparently used no stunt-double, and he took a LOT of hits from some really big, real-life football players.) The guy is a stud in my book."
"andrewlstein-1","9","0","1","26 August 2006"," Perfect (well, almost)
","OK, I'll admit it -- I am Philadelphia-born and a die-hard Eagles fan since 1967, and Dick Vermeil's son was in my 12th Grade high school homeroom class. So maybe there's a little bias here. That said, I absolutely loved this movie, and was near tears 20 seconds into it and many times after that. ""Invincible"" shows how football is so much more than just (as my wife might say) ""a bunch of guys running up and down a big lawn"" -- it brightens our tougher days with hope, and, better yet, is something that can and often does inspire us to strive for worthwhile goals in our personal lives. Greg Kinnear faithfully captures Dick Vermeil's personality, mannerisms, energy and heart. The portrayal of the fans' feelings toward the Eagles in the mid-1970s is also spot-on. Most soundtrack song choices are very ""1970's"" and add to the mood. And often the attention to detail is astounding, like when the Dallas Cowboys' offense lines up for the snap and their linemen... (OK I won't give it away)<br/><br/>However, sometimes the attention to detail is really, really bad.<br/><br/>When oh when is Hollywood going to make a movie (or TV show) about ""blue collar"" Philadelphia where the people on screen actually speak with a Philadelphia accent? Isn't it someone's job to research this stuff so that the movie looks, sounds and feels authentic? Attention Hollywood: The Philadelphia twang is unique. (Think of Hardball's Chris Matthews and multiply by 2.) Philadelphians do NOT sound just like ""Rocky"" or street bums from Brooklyn, any more than Roman emperors -- despite what you hear in gladiator flicks -- spoke with a British accent. Use a REAL Philadelphia accent and it will add a charming and truthful dimension to your ""Philadelphia"" movie! Also: (1) Philadelphia sportscasters in 1976, like most big-city sportscasters, were articulate, well-dressed and well-groomed; they were NOT dimwitted, punch-drunk slobs; (2) There has never been a local Channel 11 in Philadelphia; (3) The Italian neighborhoods in South Philly in 1976 may have been modest, but they were almost always clean and tidy, not awash in garbage and filth; (4) The exterior of Veterans Stadium is faithfully cloned, so how come the interior turns out to be Franklin Field (which the Eagles left after the 1970 season)?; (5) The opening words to the Eagles' fight song ""Fly Eagles Fly"" are (surprise, surprise) ""Fly Eagles Fly"", not ""Fight Eagles Fight"" -- and to my knowledge Eagles' fans did not sing the words until much more recently than 1976; and (6) Likewise, the ""E-A-G-L-E-S"" cheer, to my knowledge, did not appear until around 1980 (when the Eagles went to the Super Bowl), and back then it was chanted much more slowly than it is today. If you Disney people can't find a ""Philadelphia"" consultant anywhere in Tinseltown (or Anaheim, or Burbank, or Lake Buena Vista, or wherever the heck it is you make your movies), you can hire me. Just feed me a ""Cheese With"" from Cosmi's or Tony Luke's -- but not the non-existent Columbo's -- and I'm yours for the day.<br/><br/>Glad that's out of my system. Now, back to the main point -- don't miss ""Invincible""."

","Bottom Line: Same premise of Miracle, only involving a local guy making the football big-time on the longest of shots. Above adequate performances by Wahlberg and Kinnear make this an entertaining picture. You can almost say it has a slight Rocky flavor, as well. Not only because it is based in Philadelphia, PA, but the story of an underdog reaching for the stars. Thing is, you're guaranteed not to see a Invincible 5. (or is it going to be 6 soon?) <br/><br/>If you grew up a football fan in the late 1970's, you will enjoy the nostalgia of the mention of the big names from that era. <br/><br/>Although a Disney film, I feel Invincible is targeted for the male crowd age 12 - 100."

"XFLRWF","9","0","1","26 August 2006"," ""Invincible"" is inspring!
","When a true life sports movie is done well, it will make you cheer on the subjected team or individual despite the known outcome. With ""Invincible"", Disney scores yet another winner that makes you applaud for Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Philadelphia Eagle's longshot Vince Papale. The stellar supporting cast that includes Greg Kinnear and Elizabeth Banks only further rallies the audience's support for Papale to succeed. The excellent work of the cast not withstanding, it is the direction of Ericson Core that the story really takes shape. Core's guidance shows the hard times that befall the City of Brotherly Love and the inspiration and jubilance of their hometown boy's success. In Rocky-esquire style, ""Invincible"" triumphs over the typical underdog formula with rousing cheers and inspiration.<br/><br/>In 1976, the Philadelphia Eagles restructured the team by placing UCLA Coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) as their new head coach. Vermeil announces that the Eagles will be holding open tryouts to find new players who want to join the team. Among them is 30-year-old bartender Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg). Encouraged by his friends, Papale goes to the tryouts and is the only person to make the initial draft. With the weight of an entire city on his shoulders, Papale struggles with personal and profession obstacles to achieve his dream.<br/><br/>""Invincible"" marks Core's cinematic directorial debut and he triumphs as great as his subject matter. Core's story-telling ability keeps the audience informed and entertained while covering several areas in the film. He does not simply cover Papale's rise to the pros but also shows the desperation and despair of a city rattled by unemployment and layoffs. Core's depiction of the city mirrors the events that exist in Papale's own life. When the people are unemployed and down on their luck, Papale is undergoing his personal doubts of professionalism and hardship. When Papale succeeds, the city brightens up in accomplishment. Core shows that the success is not only about one man but of the entire city.<br/><br/>Brad Gann's script is formulaic in the ""rise-from-nothing"" story. We know that Papale comes from the bottom of the barrel and will rise to meet his goal. Gann's character development of Papale, however, is the most thriving part of the script. He does not write Papale as superhuman by simply defying the odds. Instead, Papale is an average human being. He doubts he can make the team, he has trouble paying the rent, he has relationship problems, etc. As we see each of these struggles, we can relate to them and it is in those human traits that we want for Papale to succeed. Gann's character analysis of the former Eagle is what wins over the audience.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gives one of his most inspiring performances as Vince Papale. His greatest ability comes in capturing the emotion in Papale's personal feelings and often without saying anything. Even when Papale makes the draft, Wahlberg shows the doubt and anxiety the player must have experienced. It is clearly read in his face that he knows he is going up against professionals and that he may very well be in over his head. The determination Wahlberg shows that he wants to win not only for himself but also for his family and friends who have supported and stood with him. As the regular Joe who just wants to play football, Wahlberg taps into that essence to better identify with the audience. Greg Kinnear's performance as Dick Vermeil shares many of the same characteristics as Whalberg's Papale. As he is also a new addition to the franchise, Kinnear exhibits the coach's anxieties and doubts that he truly belongs in the big leagues and the pressure he is under to turn the team around. He is constantly studying plays and questioning if he made the right decision for the team. Through this dedication, Kinnear brings out the heart of the man that also wants to win for the fans and not just for him. In many sports films, the female lead is often cast as the woman who stands behind her man. As Papale's love interest Janet, the talented Elizabeth Banks is unfortunately little more than that. Banks brings out the supportive quality of Janet as she wishes him luck and sends him care packages. However, she is not much more than one of Papale's friends and cheerleaders.<br/><br/>Through the double helping of motivation by Wahlberg and Kinnear, ""Invincible"" ranks as another great film to instigate people to not give up on their dreams. Director Core shows that these individuals are everyday people. They do have personal difficulties and yet they can make their dreams come true. The film may not make you feel invincible but it will make you inspired.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
