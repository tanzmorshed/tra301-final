"kylopod","8","278","329","19 August 2006"," Shyamalan's most under-appreciated film
","I don't think I've ever been more shocked by how much I liked a film. I had very low expectations when I decided to watch ""The Village,"" because I knew how much critics had panned it. I'm not saying that I regard the consensus of the critics as sacrosanct. But the movies I love are rarely ones that have earned critical scorn, so by the law of probability I doubted that this one would be any good. Besides, I had noticed a steadily downward slope in the quality of M. Night Shyamalan's films since ""The Sixth Sense."" When ""The Village"" was released and subsequently panned, it seemed to fit the pattern that I myself had noticed. So I didn't go and see the film. Only recently did I take a look at it on cable, more out of curiosity than anything else.<br/><br/>And alas, I found the first fifteen minutes rather slow. The movie has a lot of characters, and it doesn't quickly establish which ones are the most important. All we see is this primitive nineteenth-century village in the midst of woods that the villagers believe to be haunted by ominous, sentient creatures who will not harm the people as long as they don't set foot in the woods. The villagers have all sorts of rituals to protect themselves from attack, such as avoiding the color red (what is it with Shyamalan and red?) and wearing yellow hoods. But rules are meant to be broken, and a quiet, mysterious young man played by Joaquin Phoenix wants to journey into the woods so that he can visit ""the towns"" on the other side, which boast superior medicine. Among other things, he wonders if he'll find a cure for his mentally handicapped friend (Adrien Brody). In the meantime, he's falling in love with the blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) whose role in the plot will expand as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The love story between Phoenix and Howard is well-handled and believable, transcending the romantic clichÃ©s. The two characters seem to possess a common understanding and don't have to talk much in order for us to feel the developing bond between them. But what they do say to each other is intriguing. My favorite line is ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them."" Their personalities also transcend stereotype, particularly with Phoenix: while stoic and courageous, he's also shy and withdrawn, as revealed in scenes where he passes letters to the public council instead of speaking in front of them. His ultimate significance to the story turns the heroic convention on its head.<br/><br/>Everyone in the village speaks in an oddly formal manner, using big words and avoiding contractions. The accents are American, but the diction is like that of a nineteenth-century English novel. Amazingly, the actors make this language sound natural as it rolls off their tongues. The cast includes several familiar faces: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and the aforementioned Phoenix and Brody. But the star of the film is the as-yet unknown Howard, who delivers a performance so compelling that it's a shame the film was trashed by critics.<br/><br/>Much of the film concerns the relationships of the characters in the village, but the mystery of the creatures also dominates the plot. This is more of a quietly creepy ""Twilight Zone""-style tale than outright horror. Like Shyamalan's other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. But Shyamalan does not forget his horror roots. No other Hollywood filmmaker today is better at crafting scenes where a character is being haunted by an evil presence. These scenes work because of Shyamalan's acute sense of how nightmares feel. Like all skilled horror directors, he knows not to focus on the monster itself but on the panicked reaction of the character being stalked.<br/><br/>While the use of a blind character is hardly a new device, Shyamalan handles the scenes with Howard in an interesting way. Instead of the usual approach of teasing the audience by showing exactly what the blind character doesn't see, he practically makes us blind along with her. He has the camera follow her as she walks, so that we don't see what's in front of her. We soon realize that we are seeing little more than what she is able to discern about her surroundings. In crucial scenes, we are effectively almost as much in the dark as she is.<br/><br/>I cannot say much more about the plot without ruining the movie's surprises, which are abundant. Critics dismissed ""The Village"" as a crude exercise in plot manipulation. I couldn't disagree more. While I'm not certain that the logistics of the plot work in every detail, most of the criticisms I have heard reflect a superficial reading of the story.<br/><br/>The film has the same basic structure that Shyamalan always uses, where we are swept up in the events and only at the end do we find out what the movie was truly about. From there, we have to think backwards to understand the ultimate meaning of the story. I have seen the movie three times now, noticing new things each time. The social themes make me think that Shyamalan is familiar with Joseph Campbell's works on primitive societies and the origin of drama. The back story is very well thought out compared to that of the average thriller, and I feel some disappointment that more people aren't able to appreciate it. The beauty and genius of this film is a well-kept secret."
"baba44713","9","1044","1292","9 November 2004"," a very underrated movie
","I like clever movies, and I like scary movies. And because of my disposition I already spent money on two very awful movies that came from Hollywood this year: abysmal ""Godsend"" and at first glance promising but ultimately stupid and disappointing ""The Forgotten"".<br/><br/>That's why I proceeded with care to the latest Shyamalan's work: ""The village"". The trailer looked promising: a desolate turn-of-the-last-century village, sorrounded by the forest in which some horrible creatures live. Promising, but being careful lately, I first checked around the net...and was amazed to see a big load of negative reviews. Roger Ebert for instance, whose opinion I usually respect, gave it a horribly low grade! Great.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I chose to see it, and I must say was quite pleasantly surprised. Here, ladies and gentlemen, you have a very nicely shot, atmospheric thriller with great cast, good story and a few finishing touches of Shyamalan's cleverness (which could be simply called brilliant when compared with the latest scripts that the Hollywood vomits over its audience!).<br/><br/>Why the lousy reviews? Well, there are basically two kinds of people that will want to see this movie: first the horror fans, who will expect a gruesome and chilling and potentially bloody tale, and the puzzle-movie fans, who are more or less not interested in the movie itself, but in ""solving the latest Shyamalan's puzzle"" of what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>The horror crowd will be disappointed. There are scares in this movie, but way too much characterization and drama for their taste. As for the other crowd, well people, the twist is there, but this time it's very guessable (although Shyamalan still has some tricks up his sleeve, as you'll see).<br/><br/>It seems that Shyamalan will always live in the shadow of his masterpiece ""The 6th sense"". People still remember getting their socks knocked off with its powerful ending, and keep expecting that to happen again with every following movie. What's worse, Hollywood realized that the twists are trendy, so lately we have lots of movies with a final twist, most of which are stupid/cheap/illogical. People today set their expectations too damn high, especially if they see Shyamalan's name at the movie poster.<br/><br/>This movie is great. The atmosphere is great, the cast is fantastic, and what I mostly love about it, it's clever. It's logical. And whatever you say about it, it's CONSISTENT. Compared to the other Hollywood crap we are getting served lately, this is a VERY good movie.<br/><br/>Watch this, but not as a puzzle, but as a great movie in itself.<br/><br/>Well, just my 2 cents."
"abrnavarro","9","46","52","20 July 2016"," This film deserves a higher score
","I thought the introduction, middle, and ending of this movie was excellent. M Night creates unique horror movies that are not just blood and gore. The ending made sense with the plot and direction of the film because when I first saw the movie, I noticed that the living quarters of the characters seemed very new. If you re-watch the film, you will see how the village homes are polished and don't looks like rustic log cabins. The ending was a strong point of the film because it makes sense how people who experienced violent crimes or lost loved ones in real life would want to create their own utopia.I think this movie has a strong political and spiritual message: People do not change. This movie also reminds of the Twilight episode called ""Looks Just Like You."" In this episode, the men and women undergo cosmetic surgery to turn into the ideal male and female standards of health and beauty. Although this utopia is created through physical improvement, M Night's is achieved by shunning modern technology."
"Liquid-Snake","8","12","12","19 September 2006"," Just watch it and learn something
","I've just watched the movie for the first time and I have a confession.<br/><br/>I knew there were a lot of people who didn't like this film. I knew there was going to be a twist at the end.<br/><br/>What I didn't know that I would spoil the film for myself.<br/><br/>I had completely forgotten about the supposed year of 1897 shown at the start, so while I was watching the rest of the film I tried to work out the twist based on how the village related to the present-day. My very first suspicion was that the village was some sort of sociological experiment that kept a community living as if was the 18th or 19th century. I wasn't too far off. The revelation that it was 2004 failed to shock me (I thought it was the present-day all along not because I actually worked it out but because I had no reason to believe otherwise).<br/><br/>When I found out about the tombstone's date all I could think was, ""What was the need for giving us that information?"" It would have made no difference if we didn't know it was 1897 and it slightly devalued the film. It was a bare-faced lie to fool us. But because fate allowed me to ignore the lie, I am not angry. It shows our friend Shymalan made a huge error. What if there are others who have perhaps missed the opening minute? As an experiment, show this film to someone (with some degree of intelligence) who hasn't watched it before, but from after the funeral scene. I bet they won't find the it's-2004-twist surprising.<br/><br/>For me this film was about innocence lost and going to great lengths to regain it. It was an extreme thing to do, but understandable. Adrien Brody's character harboured the two sides of every human in their extremes - the completely innocent and the insanely violent.<br/><br/>The connotations become more and more obvious as you think about the film, which in the end is a very entertaining commentary on the modern-day world.<br/><br/>Despite everything, a very good movie."
"BrandtSponseller","10","244","307","6 February 2005"," One of Shyamalan's Best Films
","The Village is set in a small, rural community living in a kind of 19th Century self-supporting agrarianism. Woods surround the town, and the villagers maintain a strict perimeter, as there are creatures in the woods with whom they've reached a truce so long as the borders are not breached. Tension mounts as the creatures start breaking their normal pattern, and one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), seeks permission from the town elders to travel through the woods, to the towns and ""those we don't speak of"", so he can acquire medicine for his fellow villagers.<br/><br/>For anyone seriously interested in the art of film, The Village is worth a viewing just for its cinematography and score. That's not to say that the story isn't good. It's a captivating tale of a very odd small town, complete with a twist, as is characteristic of director M. Night Shyamalan. The twist may not be as shattering here as it was in some of his previous films, such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), but it is still a change that catalyzes an eye-opening recontextualization and reassessment of the previous material, making the film and the final resolution of the story even more poignant. It is also interesting to note the many possible metaphorical readings, ranging from political insularism to religion, or even more literal comparisons to social and geographic segregation (from ethnic enclaves to gated communities).<br/><br/>Shyamalan could be said to have a directorial gimmick, although that might not be the best word because it's usually taken negatively, and I don't mean it to undervalue his approach. He makes genre films in the guise of realist dramas. So far, all of his films since he hit it big with The Sixth Sense have used this interesting device, each in a different genre. The Sixth Sense was a horror/ghost story. Unbreakable was a comic book film. Signs was sci-fi. The Village is fantasy/adventure. It also has some horror elements (as do Unbreakable and Signs).<br/><br/>Part of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that he can achieve the usual responses associated with those genres using such unusual, relatively mundane and realist material. For example, in The Village, he is able to build up an incredible amount of suspense in relation to two very simple things--flowers of a particular color, and beginning a walk into the woods. A simple walk into the woods is also the beginning of an adventure just as grand as any depiction of a quest for the Holy Grail, say. And the ensuing plot developments, although very ordinary on one level, have a profound, redemptive effect. Many of the most important developments in the climax aren't even directly stated; they're just subtly implied in what we're shown, yet they all work extremely well. While Shyamalan's style may require some adjustments for viewers more accustomed to chaotic, MTV-paced genre films, or on the flipside, for viewers less accustomed to elements of fantasy in their films, it is worth altering your preconceptions about pacing and content.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. I'm not usually the biggest fan of William Hurt, but I even loved his performance. Joaquin Phoenix and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard are amazing. The film wouldn't have worked without the right person in either actor's roles. Both were perfect choices. There is also a wonderful, very slight surreal quality throughout most of the film shown in the behavior of the villagers towards each other.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard's score may be his best to date in a very long list of credits. The music always provides just the right atmosphere, sense of wonder/mystery, pathos and suspense. Roger Deakins' cinematography is equally brilliant, capturing a slight eeriness, sense of foreboding and comfort all at the same time, and with an ingenious use of colors. Much of the film leans towards rich yellow/orange hues and tints, with strong green accents in the grasses and trees. Whenever red is introduced, it is appropriately intense. The framing of shots and staging of scenes is equally impressive.<br/><br/>I know that this film has had its detractors, but I cannot see why. For my tastes, The Village is yet another masterpiece from a very creative, innovative filmmaker."
"dave-1930","8","11","11","21 August 2005"," the village was good
","I disagree with other commenter. the ending twist was not obvious. I found this to be a thoughtful, deep movie with effective dialogue. I had to give Shamalan props as the result was not the typical Hollywood plot. If you go into watching it wanting a horror action movie, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it with an open mind and like drama/suspense with a good premise, this is a very nice movie! The camera work was effective. Adrian Brody plays a good role albeit not a large one. Rating the Shamalan movies, I'd say The Village was second only to Sixth Sense. It was better than both Signs and Unbreakable. Definitely turned out to be a pleasant surprise."
"dog_bites_back","10","744","992","16 October 2004"," Extremely Underrated (NO SPOILERS)
","M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.<br/><br/>Although many have made scathing remarks about the ending of ""The Village"", it is perhaps his most perfect since ""The Sixth Sense""; though by no means a huge surprise, it nevertheless settles into the ambiance and leaves the film with a tinge of melancholy that belies the trailers.<br/><br/>It is a film of startling imagery, with a theme of 9/11-inspired innocence versus corruption that creeps into the mind and stays there until it unfolds over and over again. Many have called the acting ""wooden"", but a second viewing of the film would change that opinion; it is, after all, part of the point. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) lights up the screen in an astounding premiere performance as the blind Ivy, Adrien Brody delivers a searing portrayal of longing as the dim-witted Noah and Joaquin Phoenix heightens the moody tone with his strong, silent-type Lucius. ""The Village"" is about these people, this community living in fear, not the monsters of which they have been warned; it is about the psychology of fear rather than a horrific portrayal of it.<br/><br/>It must be said that the only thing wrong with ""The Village"" was the promotion for it. The adverts made it seem like a thrill-ride of Gothic horror, like the scariest film yet to be filmed - and audiences were running in their droves to catch yet another Shyamalan Twist. Instead of investing their emotions in the characters, viewers kept their distance in the knowledge that they would be hoodwinked, that the entire thing was a set-up to catch them out anyway. Wrong as this is, it was ultimately the undoing of the movie; had it been promoted as a thoughtful, stark, moody piece of film-making, then both the critics and the public would have been satisfied.<br/><br/>This is not a film about The Twist Ending, but about wrapping its beauty around your mind, and the quiet, haunting finale is what helps to keep it there."
"harrylosborne","8","20","22","28 May 2019"," Ignore the Shyamalan stigma - this is a gem
","In recent years, M Night Shyamalan's reputation has taken a serious beating, having directed universally panned Razzy films (such as The Last Airbender and The Happening), and even some recent successes (Split, Glass) haven't been enough to salvage his career. However, slightly earlier in his directorial filmography sits this genuine horror-mystery masterpiece, criminally underrated and judged undeservedly.<br/><br/>The Village is a different take on a horror trope, detailing an isolated community's resolve against a hidden threat in the surrounding forest. As this genre goes, the cast does not get any better: Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson all feature prominently, as well as relative unknowns Jesse Eisenberg and Dallas Bryce Howard in some of their earlier roles. All are individually excellent and well-cast, perfectly depicting the repressed fear of a society without outside influences.<br/><br/>The plot of is consistent and of genuine quality, which doesn't often translate in the horror genre; however, do not be dissuaded by the premise of horror - The Village plays more off the resulting drama than cheap jump scares, and slow burns until the revelations in the second half blow the script open. The forest village is the ideal setting for this hidden evil, sparsely populated and somewhat bleak - the integral use of red and yellow elevate the cinematography further, making the environment more distressing.<br/><br/>The Village should be a must-watch purely on the merit of the plot: some may not connect with the subtleties of the script and the nuances of the story, but those who take the time to invest will be thoroughly rewarded with a quality film."

","It is very sad to see such a beautiful movie being so underrated, I believe the problem with it is that it was promoted as a horror film, this was a huge mistake because it attracted the wrong audience. Horror film fans won't like this film that's for sure!<br/><br/>The village is a beautifully directed film, with wonderful cinematography & atmosphere, great performances (I loved Bryce Dallas Howard powerful performance and of course Joaquin Phoenix & Adrian Brody as well) and brilliant story! James Newton Howard's score fits perfectly with the film's atmosphere and is also very powerful & touching.<br/><br/>As a conclusion..

"bradleykryan","10","183","241","17 January 2005"," Sociologically fantastic
","This movie absolutely blew my mind. I grew up in a small village in Central Illinois. My village is on the map solely because of the Amish community which has established itself in the rural area around the town. ""The Village"" is reminiscent of all things strived for by the Amish community. Whilst ridiculed by many and misunderstood by most of the rest, the Amish and the community in ""The Village"" long for the same things: a return to simpler times when the good in life was much more prolific. Although it could be argued that the members of the village have their ideals based upon and rooted in fear, that doesn't differ drastically from many ideals held throughout the world. The negative aspects of our ideals may not be as obvious and spelled-out to us like those of in ""The Village,"" but they remain similar none-the-less. ""The Village"" is a real thinker's movie and I commend M. Night Shyamalan for another remarkable movie. I can't wait to see what's next."
"Bennan","Null","314","432","1 August 2004"," Not necessarily a horror film, but a character study with elements of horror
","I went to see M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" today.<br/><br/>First things first... I won't even discuss a SINGLE aspect of the plot, here, so you can read this safely. I will say this: If you plan to see the movie, do not read a single review (besides mine!). As with most of Shyamalan's films, the less you know about the plot going in, the better.<br/><br/>As far as the quality of the film... it is solid. Beautifully directed, well acted, dramatic, scary, sometimes funny, and with some great plot twists. It is not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but it's probably not fair to keep comparing Shyamalan's work to his first big hit, one of the best psychological horror films ever made. A director could work his entire career and never make a SINGLE film as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", let alone recapture that movie's amazing brilliance.<br/><br/>But, I hear you asking, is ""The Village"" better than ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" (Shyamalan's second and third films)??? Well, that depends on what you thought of those films. Personally, I'd probably say that it is a better film than those two. At the very least it is more sophisticated, with stronger themes, a much bigger and better cast, and more subtle surprises than in those two films.<br/><br/>""The Village"" continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot, but this time there are SEVERAL of them and they occur sporadically throughout the film... not one big one at the end. You WILL be surprised by the film, but don't expect to be bowled over.<br/><br/>I would describe this as his most subtle film, and also as more of a character study than a horror film. The characters here are very rich, and their interactions and relationships with one another are very rewarding in big and small ways. The acting is phenomenal, most noticeably by Academy Award winner Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix. But first time actress Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver all give solid performances as well.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is a character study of how a community and individuals respond under pressure and fear. And while it has elements of horror, I'm not even sure I would describe it as a horror film.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, there are some real scary moments in the film... just don't go in expecting a roller coaster ride. While I was watching it, I kept thinking about some of the better episodes of The Twilight Zone that had a few thrills but left you thinking about human nature more than anything.<br/><br/>Go see ""The Village"", but bring someone with you."

","It is as good as Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. It's a parable & it's great.It's a microcosm of life where we create rules within ourselves to protect us from vulnerability. Yet our nature is such that we are forced to seek truth , may be unknowingly, like the blind girl. What we know in the village is non-knowledge. Science is true knowledge,in this case the medicine. Yet the giving, receiving and using of medicine is shrouded in non-knowledge,though it might help Lucius Hunt. It shows how a cult takes shape. Here it is harmless but dangerous potential exists in such communities. If one looks into one's own mind one can see that we have our own ""villages"" hidden deep in in our own psyche."

The acting from Lucius and Ivy (her especially) was superb and I think that drove the movie forward even when there was slow downs in action. Their relationship felt very genuine and was very sweet, especially a scene on their porch.

Here's a clue: If you're an MSM movie critic and see and dislike one of this fine director's movies, spare yourself some professional embarrassment and recuse yourself. ""The Village"" isn't a complicated movie, but it does explore some quite interesting subject matter--what constitutes and sustains a community, what role does the individual play, how do the tensions between individual and community play out and, in that process, how deeply does this interplay challenge and touch our hearts. Touch-feely critics whose critical faculties are formed in our therapy-driven society apparently are just not equipped to see or understand any of this."

","Therefore, all the hatred and horrible reviews ensue. Roger Ebert gave this film 1 star. Unbelievable. He either had a petty gripe with the filmmaker, or this film went right over his head. The former I suspect. If you've read Ebert's reviews over the years, you will see he misses the boat on many great films. This is one.<br/><br/>This is a film that defies genre. That apparently is too much to handle for a great many film goers. It also comes with a profound twist. This film is best appreciated if one doesn't know about this on initial viewing. Many people who knew about the twist ahead of time trashed the film. Many others were expecting a gruesome horror film.<br/><br/>'The Village' is loaded with profound thematic material. In the character of Noah, we see the origins of evil. Petty human jealousy leads to a 'crime' as Walker puts it. This is what the founders of the Village came to escape.<br/><br/>We also see the creation of a mythology in Ivy's journey. Every budding civilization required its own mythology. The story of Ivy and Lucius underscores and edifies the vision of the founders.<br/><br/>Its not a perfect film, but I found it to be so fascinating, I re-watch it every year or so.

I have to admit that after the reveal that there were no monsters and it was just a cover up by the elders I thought the action had stopped but no, the final chase was incredible and the shot where the camera pans out and you see that she is standing in a field of red berries creates dread beautifully.<br/><br/>All in all, great movie, really worth the watch."
"irocz78","Null","210","326","1 August 2004"," Brilliantly nuanced, subtle, smart, and expertly played
","It's not what you think it is. It's not horrific. It's not gory. It is however a very well written and played thriller drama, with a fantastic love story woven into it to keep it from getting overbearing. <br/><br/>I've seen the 6th Sense and thought it was fantastic, and passed on Signs because I'd already been sick of alien movies by then, though it looks like I should see it.<br/><br/>I went into this film without preconceptions about M. Night Shyamalan or his previous work. I wanted to see a good scary movie. Good it was. Scary it was less. Don't go into it expecting to get horrified, and you won't leave the movie upset about it.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot, largely because it caught me by surprise at many points. It's too easy to spoil the movie if I mention why though, so I'll just say you have to see it for yourself. <br/><br/>The acting, particularly by Bryce Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt, was played well with the right subtlety and nuance to make the characters believable. <br/><br/>Howard's role as the smart, emotionally strong tomboy who also happens to be blind was played with an understanding you don't often see in a period role. She was Ivy, and she was living in the late 19th century. She showed an innocence that she could only have gotten away with in this character, and she played it like the time was hers.<br/><br/>There was no doubt of who she was. She conveyed the strength (both her real strength and that which she exuded with a feminine machismo) of her character very well, but never pushing it over the top. She never shouted an emotion; she whispered it, but it was loud and clear. When she spoke about love and fear, you felt it. When she cried she wasn't hamming it up; she exuded grief from eyes, face, and body. She was brilliant, and I can't wait to see her on screen again. She also happens to be incredibly beautiful. Did that cloud my judgment? Go see the movie. <br/><br/>Phoenix continues to upstage his previous roles in every movie I've seen him in. His expressions are classic. The theater laughed more from his modest look of confusion in one scene than I've heard at the last 3 comedies I've watched. He was being more serious than ever, but the comedy of his emotions, however brief, was transmitted perfectly through his stone cold face, only barely showing what he felt inside, but saying everything. Throughout the movie, he was quiet, thoughtful, brave, and pure of spirit, and he said it all in so few words. When he spoke of emotion, it had a power that gripped me. The lines he delivered, though incredibly well written, were meant for him.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's dialogue helped, in that it was rarely obtrusive when spoken by these actors. <br/><br/>About the story: It twists in ways few could imagine. That makes it a bit upsetting. Expect to be let down a little. If you're not looking for gory horror, then you might just love it. When it's not changing directions though it's fantastic in it's subtleties. I can't avoid that word because it applies well to how Shyamalan put this together. <br/><br/>I don't buy many movies, but I will be purchasing this when it comes out on DVD."

","I'm not going to write a long review, I hate long reviews. There are two reasons I loved this movie.<br/><br/>The first reason: I love 'fear of the unknown'. For me, that's probably the only fear. If you know what's coming, than it's automatically far less scary. Maybe not even scary at all. So that's a big plus.<br/><br/>The second reason: I love the big twist somewhere in the middle of the movie. It changes from horror movie to romantic drama. Beautiful. I understand that almost all the negative reviews on this movie come from the fact that the movie changes so drastically, and a lot of people feel this isn't good for the point the story tries to make. I love it. I love the fact that a movie isn't predictable. Also at the end there is a second twist, revealing the whole back story of the village.<br/><br/>So, I loved this movie. And yes, a '9' is a very high number. I'm entirely aware of that. Enjoy!"

If you haven't seen this before, you need to ignore the criticism and go into this film with an open mind and open ears. Pay attention to every little detail, every little thing that is being said. Yes, we all know Shyamalan will drop a bombshell with a twist- but leading up to that point in his movies includes a lot of important information about the plot and the characters.<br/><br/>This film is emotional, and it's intense.

"keenekatie","7","33","48","6 February 2005"," ""The Village:"" Dystopia or Utopia?
","I began watching ""The Village"" with reservations. I thought it would be a basic thriller. After viewing, I was pleased to find the questions it summoned...essentially, is the depiction of the Village a Dystopian or a Utopian society? Interesting elements are contained in the film that lead to an answer. First, what is the motive behind the attack of Noah Percey (the mentally challenged character) on Ivy Walker (the blind girl) in the woods? Was Noah's motive (a) to help Ivy navigate the woods, with his eyesight and experience? (b) to find his playmate and continue to play the games in which they often engaged? (c) or had his madness/jealousy escalated to the point that he was seeking her out to kill her, as he had attempted to kill Luscious, her fiancé? Furthermore, what was the purpose in his adorning the costume, was it (a) to escape the village people, as they were holding his captive for his attempted murder? (b) merely a costume for a game? (c) did he become a true creature of the woods? It is my opinion that the jealousy Noah experienced in hearing the news of Ivy and Luscious's engagement heightened his madness, causing him, first to attempt to kill Luscious, and then to similarly go after Ivy, with the intent also to murder her. Evethough the creatures in the woods were a fictional creation established by the elders to contain their society in the boundaries of the village, a real creature of the woods was created by Noah. Thus, their fictional creation morphed into a reality proving that the village, in fact, is a dystopia. The experiment made by the history professor was unsuccessful in that the society found they still can not escape the tragedy that befalls human beings. Jealousy, madness, and murder are not created by modern society but rather are inherent to the psyche of human beings. These human traits can not be stopped by isolation.<br/><br/>Interested to hear other perspectives."
"Sunder1496","10","32","47","9 February 2005"," Amazing movie, don't listen to critics
","The Village is an excellent movie in all respects, possibly not Shyamalans best, but definitely up there. I really can't imagine why reviewers gave it low scores, I don't know anyone personally that dislikes the movie at all.<br/><br/>The Village centers around a quaint 19th century village in the middle of nowhere. The inhabitants of the village are relatively happy, despite the constant fear of the horrible creatures in the woods surrounding the village.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely believable and beautifully crafted. Granted, there is some broken dialogue, and it makes one cringe at one point or another, but it is not common and does not ruin the characterization. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as usual, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, a new face in the cast of Oscar winning actors.<br/><br/>The plot is a typical Shyamalan twist fest with a little romance added for good measure. This does not take away from the atmosphere at all, however, and is done very well. There are a couple parts that are quite chilling, but not SCARY per se. I definitely felt a tingle run down my spine a few times. The ending, if it hasn't already been ruined for you or you don't figure it out half way through the movie, will leave you in shock.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazing movie, I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone; you will not be disappointed."

","As with M.Night's other movies, I enjoyed this latest outing, especially the performances of the leads. I think the movie suffered in overall response due to a poorly conceived marketing plan.<br/><br/>The movie was sold as a horror film and fans of that genre went into this with that mindset in place. When the film actually turned out to be a look at how we try and protect those we love from the horrors of the ""real world"", fans were upset and rightly so. As anyone that has enjoyed M.Night's movies, all is not what it would seem. I think the marketing pushed too hard the horror aspect which created an expectation that was not going to be met.<br/><br/>I think if you go into this movie expecting another commentary on spiritual and moral themes, you are going to like this. If you are going into this for the scare factor, you are going to be left empty."
"acedj","9","4","4","3 February 2020"," Criminally Underrated Film
","This is the story of a small village, isolated in the woods before the advent of indoor plumbing or electricity. The story is somewhat centralized on the Walker family. The eldest daughter is played magnificently by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is blind and has an undying love for Lucius Hunt, played by the unequaled Jaoquin Phoenix, who refuses to acknowledge the mutual attraction. He had just denied the advances of the other Walker daughter, Kitty. Lucius is not the only gentleman that would have her though as there is a mentally deficient fellow named Noah Percy played by Adrien Brody with his usual excellence, who has desires for Ivy (BDH). The village seems to be idyllic in every aspect, but soon we find out that the color red in bad, as it attract and angers a race of creatures that dwell in the woods surrounding the village, called ""those we do not speak of"". The village elders had come to a peace accord with the creatures, but soon they start to find slaughtered animals within the village boundaries, making some fear that those we do not speak of (twdnso) have broken the accord. Life goes on, as it does and Lucius and Ivy announce they plan on wedding. In a rage Noah stabs Lucius. Against the will of the elder council, Edward Walker dispatches his blind daughter on a trip through the creature filled woods to another village nearby to get medicines to save Lucius. Will she succeed or will twdnso kill her before she can save her love?
This movie has one of the best casts ever assembled and this is in turn a great movie. I do not know where all the hate comes from. It is slightly more predictable than other works by M. Night, but it is still a great and solid entry by the man."
"vibrationsofdoom","8","4","4","8 December 2019"," Interesting thought on why societies are created...
","Watching this movie going in, I had no preconceived notions. I read a small plot summary and that was it. Nowadays I kinda stay OFFa if I don't want to know much of a movie going in...<br/><br/>This movie for me started off a little odd. The way the characters spoke in the beginning of the movie sounded quite a bit off. Ivy, declaring her love for Lucius rather foolishly, and some of the playful interactions of the multitude of younger characters put me off greatly at first. However, that is a HUGE point of the movie that is discussed later on.<br/><br/>This isn't meant to be a horror movie, even if it is built upon the foundations of one. Mysterious creatures live in the woods just beyond the borders of this almost Amish, 19th century village. Or do they? The ""elders"" of this community all have something in common though, which you find out later when the origins of the town are discussed. And one of their ""rules"" is to never go into the forest. You can probably make out where this is headed.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much, the innocence of the townfolk seems a little TOO contrived. But when the pieces of the puzzle are put together, certain things like the absence of money, the isolation (seemingly) from the rest of the world and the rather playful and simplistic values of the villagers seems... It makes you think for a moment ""ah, if life could almost REALLY be like this. Hope, love and joy."" Is it NOT a utopia that many would see brought to the forefront?<br/><br/>Except the creatures. But they aren't the real problem here; what IS the overwhelming issue is what is not known or discussed with the villagers. There was a TV show on once about a last remnant of humanity that was put to cryo sleep and awakened 4000 years in Earth's future... Without revealing anything, secrets often betray far worse issues than the ones seemingly most apparent.<br/><br/>Overall, the ending becomes somewhat revolutionary, with further details giving you ""aha!"" moments throughout the film's final 25 or so minutes. And then once you ""get it,"" all falls into place rapidly, as long as you have been paying attention and letting the ""facts"" stack themselves up. It's kinda like watching Star Wars Episode 4, 5 and 6, and then by the time you get back around to 1, 2, and 3, on Episode 3 you KNOW what's going to happen because you've SEEN it in episode 4. Shymalan's brilliant storytelling mirrors the way Lucas chose to approach the entire Star Wars universe by starting the story practically in the middle. This isn't exactly on the same lines, but you get the idea. Memento utilized that ideology in reverse, and good storytellers can hook you in from the beginning, middle OR end. Though simplistic, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.<br/><br/>Will probably have to go back and watch it again to see even more ""aha!"" moments..."

The cast is great as well, all top class actors and actresses so bad acting isn't present in this movie.

Something isn't right here in this village. There were a good number of people to mistrust through the entire affair. And multiple plot lines were tied up nicely.<br/><br/>I haven't found a fellow-reviewer, yet, who sees the social message underneath all this.

Critics only dislike it because of the ""dissapointing"" twist, which is a shame. Shyamalan made two movies with a twist, and critics started to expect it. I love the ending.

The speach William Hurt (one of my favorites) gave to convince the elders he had to risk everything ""for the right and knoble cause"" just gets me every time. These people created a harmonious community in hopes to remove everything horrible in the world and create a sanctuary.<br/><br/>I often look at the amish and think how womderful it was. Just a community that lives for eachother and they do so without all the technology that is supposed to make are lives easier. In reality we have every horrible thing happening in the world piped right to our brain.<br/><br/>So in summation, its a beautiful movie, from a world far less complex than modern day society."
"Grosik_Stim","5","142","249","23 December 2004"," So Many Good Ideas... So Little Execution
","Yes, this film was marketed poorly. Yes, the trailers were misguided. But yes, this is also not a very good film.<br/><br/>The problem is that Night has introduced too many concepts, ideas and sub-plots with not enough time to fully realize any of them. The casting is wonderful; Hurt does his best ""intellectual every man"", Phoenix is a decently stoic enigma and newcomer Bryce is actually fantastic as the lead. But Sigourney Weaver is given little to do and some difficult, mundane dialogue to act her way through. Brendan Gleeson is inexcusably underused and Adrien Brody seems to have been edited out of any real emotional impact.<br/><br/>What this film wants to be is a comment on contemporary America - where a group of intellectuals (with the funding of one very wealthy family), disenfranchised with modern street violence and urban decay, could conceivably remove themselves from the modern world and live in the perceived utopia of a rural 19th century. But too many easy answers, tacked on script ""quick fixes"", and multiple convenient solutions expose the many holes in the film making. It always feels like Night was tacking on justification scenes as the film posed questions instead of having a clear vision at the script stage. I won't go into all of the examples - but there are many (costumes hidden under floorboards, a blind girl, a mentally challenged man who can't expose the truth of the woods, a clearly quick-fix line about someone paying off the government to not fly over the commune, etc). You never get the sense that Brody is in love enough to kill. You never really fear the ""woods"", you are never really forced to wonder what is in the boxes in the elders' homes, and the creatures should never have been shown (first rule of mis-direction-based suspense!). I'll offer this one question as an example indicative of the other problematic elements: Why - if the ""elders"" know that it is really not the 1800's, and also know that they are living in a protected area set up by the Walker family - do they make such a fuss about Ivy going for medicine? They know what she will find but not be able to see. Unlike Night's previous films, the mystery is not guarded in a realistic way. He makes these elders seem suspicious and mysterious solely for the benefit of the audience, but there is no real justification for the characters themselves. This is troubling throughout the film and ends up like most badly written suspense films where the twists only trick the viewer but seem ridiculous and improbable if you just deal with the fictional world contained in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, it's overly-simplistic; the equivalent of the ""it was all a dream"" device. While I was not disappointed that this film was not the horror thrill ride that the trailers would have you believe, I was disappointed that a clever idea was so badly edited together (it looks like hours of footage was shot, but slashed down to its essential plot points for time) and never realized. It's a shame, it could have been a great film if Night would have stuck to a couple fully developed characters and plot paths and really got us to invest in them."
"Lyceus","10","24","36","29 August 2006"," A great movie, it shouldn't be underestimated
","I didn't really like Signs, but Shyamalan's later movie, The Village, was a great surprise for me. It's a really good mystery film, however, it was promoted as a horror movie and that might make people feel weird when they watch it. It was a terrible mistake, but if you decide to see the film without prejudices, you'll surely enjoy it.<br/><br/>The cast was very good, specially Bryce Dallas Howard. I didn't know her until I watched this movie, but I love how she plays the blind girl. I love when she gets into the woods and is attacked by the fake monster. She knows the monsters weren't real, but she remembers that there were in fact legends about them. I also like the shocking ending, when we realize nothing in the movie were as we have thought.<br/><br/>I also like how colours appear in the movie. Red and yellow are good options to represent danger and security."
"DrMMGilchrist","10","76","132","8 December 2004"," Thomas Hardy visits 'Sleepy Hollow': a moving, disturbing fable, revealing real monsters...
","'The Village' is not the 'scary monster movie' some reviewers wanted it to be. It is a subtle mood-piece, a Hardyesque rustic love-tragedy, a heroic quest, and a fable exploring the use of fear and deceit as tools for social control and manipulation. The 'twists' are, more accurately, keys to the mysteries and apparent anomalies. What is truly disturbing is the conclusion: a chilling 'happy ending' which raises serious moral questions. <br/><br/>The first scene, the funeral of a child, Daniel Nicholson, tells us it is 1897. Covington is an isolated Pennsylvanian village with its own rituals and customs. It is some sort of pacifist commune run by a council of Elders, reminiscent of the Amish, Mennonites and Shakers, or - given the prominence of women - of 19C progressive experiments such as Brook Farm. But the idyll is precarious: in the surrounding forest there are mysterious Creatures which the villagers placate with animal sacrifices and other rituals. Everyone has to stay within the village bounds; the colour red is forbidden, while yellow offers protection. When the truce between the Creatures and the villagers is broken, livestock are found skinned and doors are marked with red. <br/><br/>Against this 'Little House in Sleepy Hollow' folksy/Gothic background, a touching romance develops between shy, hard-working Lucius Hunt and Ivy Walker, a lively and indomitable blind girl. There are complications: Ivy's sister Kitty sets her cap at Lucius; Lucius has to overcome his own emotional reticence; and Noah Percy, a waif-like, mentally handicapped youth has a crush on Ivy. It's Thomas Hardy territory: the spirited young heroine; the quiet, stalwart hero; the rival marked for tragedy. (Imagine Giles Winterbourne or Gabriel Oak competing with Abel Whittle for a visually-impaired Elizabeth-Jane!) <br/><br/>****Spoiler**** This triangle provokes crisis. Seemingly the last to know of Ivy and Lucius's engagement, Noah - distraught, at the mercy of emotions he cannot articulate - stabs Lucius. His wounds become infected, and his only hope is for someone to cross the boundary, to brave the woods and the Creatures, and bring medicine from 'The Towns' beyond. <br/><br/>'The Towns' are forbidden territory, regarded as evil, violent, corrupting. We have already begun to learn that Covington village was founded by people fleeing 'The Towns': the Elders (including the parents of the young protagonists) had all lost family members, and sought to build a peaceful life. They are oath-bound never to return. Earlier, after the death of Daniel Nicholson, Lucius had himself contemplated making the dangerous journey for medical supplies, to prevent other children dying. Now it is Ivy, determined to save her beloved, who sets out on the quest. Her blindness is regarded as an advantage, in that she will not see, and thus not be tempted, by the world beyond the wood - if she can complete the journey. <br/><br/>We are now in the world of folktale: the valiant young girl travelling through the forest in her hooded cape (in this case yellow!), to bring back potions for her lover. But on the way there are several important revelations for us and for Ivy. We learn more of the Elders: of the society which they have fled, and that which they have created. We discover the true nature of the Creatures which manipulate and intimidate the villagers. And when Ivy does reach help, we see what she cannot - what really lies beyond the woods. <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is splendid as Ivy, a strong-willed and endearing young heroine. Adrien Brody is heartbreaking as the desperately vulnerable Noah: despite the harm he causes (which rebounds on himself), this viewer ended up clinging to a slender thread of hope on his behalf. I was less certain of Joaquin Phoenix's Lucius. He's likable enough, and I was certainly rooting for him to pull through, but 'strong and silent' can veer dangerously close to 'inexpressive and wooden': Joaquin is generally better in more demonstrative roles. Perhaps he and Adrien should have swapped roles? Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, as Alice Hunt and Edward Walker, sensitively convey a tentative relationship, within the constraints of late 19C rural puritanism (he is married). Brendan Gleeson is also good as the bereaved Nicholson. Both music and photography are superbly atmospheric. <br/><br/>Like most fairytale quests, Ivy's is a success. But to describe the ending as 'happy' would be misleading. It is *disturbing*. The Elders, especially Ivy's father, are still determined to cling to their deceptions. The most frightening moment in the film comes when Walker asks a couple to allow their child's (presumed) death to be co-opted to reinforce the community myth. The real monsters are in the village itself, not the forest: still-traumatised, manipulative adults, who claim to be acting for the good of others - to the cost of the most vulnerable. <br/><br/>Some have interpreted the film as a parable about the US government's use of terror-threats to create a climate of fear in the present, or about its own nationalist mythology. It may also allude to affluent 'white flight' and gated communities (the all-white composition of the village is, I suspect, deliberate). But the deeper themes are international, generically human. Organised religions have used myth and legend as instruments of intimidation and social repression. Yes, urban life is sometimes insecure and haunted by fear of crime, but is a retreat into a simple rural life the answer? Nostalgia for an 'innocent' past can be dangerous (children killed or handicapped by treatable illnesses). But perhaps there is hope for the future, when courage and love such as Ivy's can prevail."

","When we go to the movies, we have certain expectations in mind. These expectations are increased when one attends a Shyamalan film. He is known for his intricate plots, mind blowing twists, and thrillingly suspenseful style. His newest feat, ""The Village"" more than lived up to his reputation.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that will make you gasp, scream, and jump from your seats while also making you think, which is rare with today's movies. The viewer is never quite sure what will be around the corner and that is what makes this movie so great.<br/><br/>All of Shyamalan's movies (ie. ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs"") have a certain mysterious essence that makes them stand out from other suspenseful films. He makes the audience feel many emotions besides fear, in fact, the presence of so many emotions in The Village adds to its quality. He manages to weave a romance into his story, thus making the audience truly feel for his characters. His films tend to have in underlying them, whether it be hope, courage, faith, or in this case love, and that is what makes his work so superb. Go to this movie expecting to feel fear, and every emotion in between."

","Shyamalan has enlisted an impressive cast in this film who all give fun performances. Unfortunately, like the plot itself, the great cast is ultimately left to dry. I'm beginning to wonder if Shyamalan makes the same film over and over again. The films always open with such promise, creepy, suspenseful. Like with his other films this one revolves around the ""suprise"" plot twist, but this time around it doesn't quite work. The ""surprise"" is pretty obvious and revealed much too early, pretty much killing the suspense. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot, but all visual quotation of classic landscape paintings seem to distance the viewer more than bring them into the story. Sometimes the film sweeps you away with its sensuousness, but in the end it leaves you feeling cheated."
"TxMike","Null","14","21","9 February 2005"," A study of group dynamics more than a scary movie.
","I saw ""The Village"" on DVD, picture and sound are superb. We have a small village in the wilderness somewhere, it appears to be the late 1800s. They are self-sufficient, have no contact with the ""outside"" world, avoid anything red, and the elders meet to make decisions for all. They appear to be one big family, the younger ones appear happy, the elders somber. The movie is NOT about what it seems initially, and I do not discuss that until after the ""spoilers"" warning below. Not one of the best movies I have seen lately, and in the end not very thought provoking, but still and enjoyable almost two hours. <br/><br/>Feb 2010 update: After almost 5 years I saw this again. I was only planning to watch a small part of it but found myself immersed and watched the whole thing again. Knowing the basic ""twist"" didn't matter, in some ways it was more enjoyable to see how the story was constructed. Just a bit prolonged and slow in some scenes, but overall a very good movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. William Hurt plays Edward Walker, chief elder and father of the blind girl, Ivy, played by Opie's daughter, Bryce Howard. Their few buildings and modest sized field are surrounded by Covington Woods, which the elders say are inhabited by 'those who we do not speak of.' Occasionally they will see a strange looking creature dressed in red flowing garb, and some of their livestock and chickens will be found dead, and skinned. Sometimes even large red ""slashes"" painted on some doors, after all villagers emerge from their hiding places in cellars. Only Lucius appears unafraid, saying ""I don't worry about what might happen, only what needs to be done.""<br/><br/>The whole thing is a ruse by the elders to keep the youngsters from straying. They created the red costumes and hide them under floors, and only use them when necessary to reinforce the fear. We only find out at the end, when Edward opens a secret box, and see newspaper clippings, all the elders were there because they had lost a loved one to violence related to the love of money and other material things. Edward, a Pennsylvania professor who also lost his wife, took all these people into a remote section of a Game Preserve to attempt this experiment, to live in isolation from the rest of the world and worldly treasures. A simple and pure life. <br/><br/>Their plight is illuminated when Jucius (Joaquin Phoenix) is mortally wounded by the village idiot Noah (Adrian Brody) who become jealous when Ivy and Lucius decide to get married. Since all the elders had pledged to never leave the Village, and Ivy had pledged her love for Lucius, she was allowed to go through the forest to find a town and medicine to cure Lucius' infection. Noah discovers a red costume and follows her, in a very forced plot twist, and she tricks him into falling in a pit. At the end of the road she climbs over a wall, is spotted by a modern time Ranger in a vehicle, no one is supposed to be in the Game Preserve, she tells him her story, he finds medicine at the nearest ranger station, she brings it back to the Village, we suspect the Village will continue in its experiment."

","This is my first ever review of a film, but i felt so moved by this fantastic piece of history that i just had to say something. I have watched a lot of films in my life, but none yet have made me feel the way 'the village' did. At first i was very surprised because i didn't think the trailer did enough for it. i missed the first 30 Min's the first time round because i was flicking through the channels one night, i was so excited by it i bought it the very next day, since then i have watched it 5 times and each time it gets better and better. The actors are amazing, perfect casting. The way it is filmed just takes the breath away, and the clashing of red and yellow as good and bad just does the job perfectly."

","How does one write an intelligent, coherent review of a movie that made me feel like I was not only cheated, but done so at a shameless way? M. Night Shyamalan has, for the last three out of five movies, focused on making sci-fi/horror films that rely on only one thing: a fantastic twist at or near the movie's climax or critical point, which of course, would make you, the viewer, do a double-take and applaud him for doing something so breath-taking and original that it would, in itself, trump the big revelation in VERTIGO (1957) or the final big denouement scene in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (also 1957). With THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) he had a honest hit, a revelation of a movie director with talent to spare, but once he made SIGNS (2002), it was clear the cheap twist is all he is about.<br/><br/>What can one do when one has to listen to the most God-awful dialog in recent film history? Judy Greer, whom I've seen in movies of varying quality and the TV series ""Arrested Development,"" decides to proclaim her love for Joaquin Phoenix with an intensity that rivals that of Peter Finch's speech (take your pick, there are at least five) as Howard Beale in NETWORK (1976), but since here her lines are so horrible, it's unintentionally funny. As a matter of fact, everyone speaks in that odd pilgrim-like choice of words and utters sentences like, ""What is your meaning"" and ""I know that thing that is in your head"" as if it were written by Paddy Chayefsky or Joseph Mankiewicz or even Shakespeare. It is done so totally deadpan that it becomes painful to watch and more than once I looked at the time to see how much more I would have to endure, because when a story like this is devoid of even a slight bit of humor and is equally pointless, actions must be taken.<br/><br/>For a director to state that he has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, there has to be some proof in his work. Choices of takes and scenes, choices of actors/actresses, choices of stories to tell, music, among other things. Shyamalan may say he is influenced by (Hitchcock) all he wants but if he is so, I can't see it. The use of red here -- an important part of the story -- has been done masterfully by Hitchcock in the aforementioned VERTIGO (1957) and MARNIE (1964), and better still by Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS (1972). Also, Hitchcock was The Master of Suspense: he gave us enough information for us to know what is happening at the moment, and then cranked up the mounting intensity to a fever pitch like the masterful Albert Hall sequence in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956) or the scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) where Cary Grant is left waiting for his ride in the middle of a cornfield and slowly but surely, a plane materializes. We know there is something about to happen, just not what, or if it will actually take place.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, there is zero suspense here. The events that take place in Covington, PA, fail to cause any sort of empathy or reaction, and the only real scene that introduces danger about to strike a major character seems so contrived it begs for a reason to exist. Why would Bryce Dallas Howard stand at the threshold extending her arm outward when it is clear there are things out there in the dark? Because the plot had her do so, not because there was a need for it.<br/><br/>So many ways to have told this story and genuinely introduce the twist without cheating the audience with holes as large as the ozone layer for the convenience and whims of the ""plot."" Shyamalan decides to cop out, waste some good talent (or, if seen differently, use high profile names like Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Adrien Brody fresh out of his Oscar win, to ensure viewers), make some easy money, cash on his new-found fame, and produce a hat-trick that doesn't have a rabbit and basically gives no new insights. And that is a sad thing for a director to do, if he purportedly is to consider himself serious.<br/><br/>And one last thing: Shyamalan needs to take his name off the title of the movie, since he is not at the stature of a Kubrick or the aforementioned Hitchcock. He needs a little lesson in humility and return to making actual movies, not travesties."

"bob the moo","Null","39","70","9 September 2004"," Without the twist there is nothing else to really get into and it is boring and false (this review contains major spoilers for this film and Dark City)
","In the late 19th century a small village lives peacefully in a valley surrounded by woods. The only threat to this peace is those who are not spoken of  a race of strange beast men who live in the woods. Over the years, a truce has developed between the two races where each will stay in their own area. However when skinned animals start to turn up within the boundary, and markings appear on the buildings show that the others appear to be breaking the truce for some reason. Meanwhile, with the death of one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt appeals to the elders to allow him to go to the town to collect medicines  however the elders want the village to continue to be protected from the town.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's recent films have tended to divide opinion pretty successfully  with Unbreakable and Signs bringing both praise and derision in pretty equal measure. For the record, I quite liked both of these films but I left the cinema bored and frustrated with a film that offers very little aside from the main twist. The film suggests several narratives but none of them go anywhere but to the twist. The script is full of well-observed detail of the period and lots of character interactions but these are all for nothing because the film is only using them to fill and distract. For this reason the film drags quite a bit and feels a lot longer than it is  time spent on stilted, nervous romances is boring because we suspect (and later know) that they are only being used rather than being intimate background to the main story. With 6th Sense, Signs and Unbreakable I didn't feel that the twist was the whole ballgame  there was a story being told and the twist was the conclusion to it. With The Village I didn't feel the twist was a conclusion to the story  just a conclusion to a premise. In fact the twist can be seen coming and, even if it isn't obvious to you, it is delivered so flatly that it loses its impact  contrast it to the twist in Dark City, it could not have been weaker.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole idea is good and it is interesting if you are talking about it  but not if it is stretched out over 2 hours. I watch a great many short films and, trust me, The Village is a short film  albeit a long short film that could run between 30 minutes and an hour. Shyamalan has come up with another premise that gives him his twist but has no substance to it. He adds substance the best he can but he knows that the twist is all and he only adds the substance that he needs to get there. I found this frustrating and rather boring; the characters were thin and only the beasts offer interest (and I suppose at least produce one or two jumps) but again they are nothing more than filler really, part of the twist to the premise  certainly they are not the focal point that the marketing and majority of the film would have you believe. No, they are removed from the film in one quick moment and are only brought back in the form of Noah in order to raise the tempo again and to keep the audience guessing about the twist that they know must be coming; sure, it is a scary moment but it is as fake as the village itself.<br/><br/>Despite his failings as writer here, director Shyamalan and his cinematographer do well here and produce a film that looks great and manages to produce some images that are memorable and effective. The village looks great, the forest looks innocent but daunting while the beasts are fleeting and had potential. The use of strong colours is particularly effective thanks to the look of the film  so much of it is washed out that the reds do actually look bad and too strong to really fit in. However this is little consolation to the many of us who will have struggled through what was essentially filler in order to get to a rather unsatisfying twist. I'll accept that it works better when you think about it and that the premise is interesting but as a film it needs to work and it simply doesn't.<br/><br/>The cast try hard but, with few characters to go around, many of them struggle  I think that it must have been apparent to them that they are only part of a loose premise to facilitate a twist, they are not meant to do anything other than get the film to the twist. Certainly Phoenix knows this. His performance is fitting to the slow tone of the film and he tries hard but he is betrayed and left with nothing to do. Howard steals the film. Her actions may grate as they seem so very unlikely but her actual performance is very good and she makes a good heart of the film once she is moved into that position in the second half. Brody is OK but is just a plot device to get to the twist. Hurt is strong and delivers well, but people like Weaver and Gleeson really deserve better; they have nothing to do and what little material they have to work with (eg Weaver and Hurt's affection) is only out there to fill and distract  as the twist approaches it is simply forgotten about as if it never mattered, which, I suppose, it never really did.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a bad film  just a badly delivered one. The premise is OK but, as others have said, it is a Twilight Zone episode or a short film. Stretched to two hours means that filler is put in, red herrings are thrown in, characters are partially developed but only to fill the gap not as part of writing a good script. Given that the whole point of this film is the twist, I was surprised how very limp it was  at least Shyamalan had the guts to appear on screen himself (as the ranger) to try and justify some of the logic! But it is weak and, although it looks great and had potential, it all amounts to nothing and, unlike his other films that had substance and a twist, The Village has only a premise and then a twist  there is no substance of value here and many viewers will find themselves bored and annoyed."

A beautifully told story which might frustrate haters to see it's actually possible to create something that deep while cinema is flooded with superhero flicks every quarter. In the village human dreams seem to come true only to find out evil and jealousy can be found everywhere. It's a social study about community and belonging vs egoism and crime. (Spoiler !)The residents of the village yearn for a life away from civilasation... not only geographically but also chronologically. Kudos to Mr. Shyamalan for tackling such a topic and transform it into an amazing and relevant movie experience.
The village is eerie, mystical almost poetic with an extraordinary cast and one of the most beautiful score ever created.

","Sometimes a film suffers cruelly from viewer expectations. This is such a film. But I can't lay all the blame at the viewers' feet. A lion's share of the blame belongs, I think, to its marketing people. The Village was advertised as a horror film. It is not. At its heart, this film is both a tenderly executed love story and a thoughtful morality fable. The Village hits upon a hidden desire within many of us to escape the hectic, dangerous modern world and live a simpler, more tranquil life. It speaks of a love kindled between two young people who have grown up as chums and who, on the cusp of adulthood, discover their feelings for each other run deeper than friendship. It shows how one man's love for his wife tempers and restrains his love for another woman. And it warns that we may succeed in fleeing the evils in the world, but we cannot escape the evil within ourselves. The twist came as a surprise to me personally because I really wasn't looking for it. I was too busy watching the movie. Perhaps if critics had simply done that, they wouldn't have given this film such bad reviews. The Village is cerebral, heartfelt, and, yes, leisurely in its pace-intentionally so. If you're looking for an endless stream of jump scares and fast-paced adventure, this is not the film for you."

Nice to watch alone a rainy day."
"cwoliver-1","1","84","164","6 October 2005"," Nice concept - poor execution.
","The village was an so-so movie based on an interesting idea. All the actors were believable in their parts (save one), the scenery and cinematography was good, the set was rather neat, and the suspense and mystery was satisfying though not gut wrenching. So what's wrong with it? <br/><br/>Well first off is the thought that you could have a sufficient size plot of land to support some 100 people in the middle of Pennsylvania and, 1)keep it secret from outsiders, 2)keep it secret from insiders. While PA is not wall to wall city, it certainly is settled enough to make this impossible. And the ""no planes flying over"" agreement was priceless - in a heavy air corridor on the east coast? <br/><br/>Next, fine group of progressive liberal thinking social workers this bunch is. When they're attacked just like the people they're supposed to help, and the going gets tough, what do they do? Work with the police to increase patrols? Form neighborhood watches? Set up security cameras, buy sling shots? Nope, they cut out. Truly dedicated social workers.<br/><br/>Back to the village. As the story begins to get interesting, one of the characters is injured. So who do we send for medicine? I know, let's send THE BLIND GIRL, she'll do anything. What!!! If you believed that there are evil beings in the woods, or at least say you do, why, why, WHY would you send the BLIND girl? Even woods not filled with evil creatures would be treacherous enough that you'd never consider sending someone who is blind.<br/><br/>OK, so off she goes. Now Bryce Dallas Howard who plays Ivy Walker, the blind girl, did a fine job - except that from time to time she forget she was blind. Merely having someone look at the ground and moan ""foo, I wish I could see"", is not enough.<br/><br/>In the woods she encounters one of the evil creatures - and deftly dispatches him like a Navy SEAL. What? Was he blind too? No. Then how could a young blind girl trick a sighted creature into falling into a hole? Either she took lessons from the blind Kung Foo master or she used ""the force.""<br/><br/>She reaches the outside wall and somehow immediately knows to climb over it - going around it never crosses her mind. She doesn't even explore the breadth of it to see if it's possible to go around. Maybe there's a lower section, stairs, a doorway, a gate, a fallen tree. No, SEALs only travel by straight line so over she goes.<br/><br/>Once over the wall she encounters a security guard. She's not the least bit curious about this wonderful hard, flat, and wide path she's on or even if she's made it to the next village. He isn't very curious about where a blind girl might have come from and she doesn't seem to know. But he agrees to help her get the medicine and off he goes - leaving the blind intruder standing in the middle of the road. Some security guard.<br/><br/>He arrives at the guard shack and is conveniently (for the gaps in the storyline) admonished about what happens to those that talk to intruders too much and, in case he was wondering, told why planes don't fly over. He then walks to the medical supply cabinet (which is there for all the intruders that get attacked by animals but never get over the wall and make it to the village?) The cabinet has the exact medicine(s)and hypodermic needles needed (lucky us). The supply of medicine in this cabinet would put a Long's Drug Store to shame. How many intruders do they have anyway? Thank goodness they're not kept under lock and key, and there's no need to sign them out. <br/><br/>Presumably he returns to Ivy with the medicine(she's still standing in the road, I guess) and gives it to her - then he drives off no questions asked leaving the mysterious blind intruder still standing in the middle of the road. Or maybe he helps her over the wall. Brilliant.<br/><br/>I'll stop here. You're tired, I'm tired, and my ability to dismiss reality is stretched well beyond its limits. There is more but I think you see why I'm less than thrilled with this movie."
"Sublime_1977","1","61","116","12 March 2006"," Very Dissapionted, read on to find out why...
","When i first looked at the trailer of this film, and from what i had heard, i was quite excited to view what looked like an exciting fantasy/monster style film. The other thing that enticed me was that Joaquin Phoenix was starring in the film. Okay, so the fist half an hour drew me into the film with promises of tension, suspense, fantasy and the craziness that i yearn for.<br/><br/>We meet various characters including a blind girl who can see ""Aura's"" around the people she associates with. We also meet Joaquin Phoenix's character, the stud/down to earth guy who you assume will be the one who battles these demons of the woods. excited? so was I.<br/><br/>I find this review very difficult to do without spoiling the film so excuse me, but it all needs to be said.<br/><br/>We'll start with the Aura seeing blind girl. Now, if this was a fantasy, as i had initially thought. Then a blind girl viewing peoples Aura's would be all very well and good. But this film is not set in a fantasy world. It is set in the very real and very normal present world. A world where blind people do not see auras, in fact, blind people generally see nothing. Now if the Auras were the only thing that annoyed me, i would not even think of mentioning it. But the stark moment of stupidity for me, was when this blind girl runs through a forest, not once, but twice. yes blind (thought i would just punch that one home for the next part). Okay so a blind girl running through a forest, may not sound easy, but plausible... i agree. In this case... no. She runs at break neck speed through the forest, surprisingly missing the various millions of trees she encounters. in my mind, not possible. OK, so on the first journey she nearly falls down a hole. But to add insult to injury, on a long journey through a forest going in one direction, she manages to remember where the hole is in the opposite direction so that she stops right in front of it to trap her mysterious pursuer. I have met blind people and yes, they know their house inside out and can manage to find there way round using various techniques. But if any one of them were to run recklessly through a forest, i guarantee that they would at the very least trip on a branch or scratch themselves to hell.<br/><br/>So what more could infuriate me about this film? The star of the film in my eyes was Joaquin Phoenix, and in many ways was one of the only reasons i watched this film. So it shocked and greatly displeased me, when after only a short time, his part in the film was extinguished. I wont say what happens, but it caused me to verbally (quite loudly actually) express my great displeasure in the cinema... In my eyes, you don't kill off the star of the film in the first 20 minutes of the film, unless you bring him back from the dead. The only person who was holding this film together. tut tut. <br/><br/>Imagine this, you are a 20-30 year old red blooded male growing up in a village that is haunted by creatures that lurk in the woods. Although it is made very clear to you that the woods are dangerous, you have noticed that everyone is very much alive, and no-one has died. Well, no one has died from being brutalised by hell bound creatures of the dark. If there is one thing you can count on in human nature, it is curiosity. Curiosity is what makes characters in horror movies walk up the stairs leaving their safe exit from the house, so that they might at least know what knifed their boyfriend/girlfriend to death. So i find it hard to believe that they have had this village for so long, yet none of the proud male (or female even, i'm not being sexist so don't even start)... i dunno, start a revolution against the evilness that submerges the forest.<br/><br/>To explain the next part and not ruin the plot is impossible. Someone gets hurt badly in the village. Out of everyone in the village (population being... oh i dunno, around 100 or so) they pick a blind girl (sigh) to journey through a forest to get some medicine from a wildlife ranger style hut based near the borders of the area. Now... OK, someone is hurt, fair enough... you would want to help. The plain and simple truth is, why on earth did the people who originally thought up and created their idea of a self sustaining village that does not have the influence of the evil £/$, not think to bring the basic essentials... IE medicine. People will get ill and people will injure themselves. separating people from external forces forcefully is one thing, keeping them there by scaring them with stories of monsters is quite another. But to create a society with no external influence, without thinking to bring the vital components such as antibiotics and the likes, is unforgivable.<br/><br/>I have gone on and i'm not sure how many people will even see this review, let alone listen to what i have to say. However, truth be told, i needed to get it out of my system as i feel like i have wasted hard earned cash on this film. its not much, but money is money and i would have much preferred to buy some paint to watch it dry than to witness this travesty to cinema. See the film and make your own opinion, adiós."

","I was SO glad that I took a chance, and saw this film at the theatre. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but it also introduced me to Bryce Dallas Howard - for which I'm forever grateful. She left a lasting impression with her role in this movie, playing Ivy Walker - a blind girl who ""sees"" (but just not as we see), Bryce is quite a wonder to behold. People will complain how, for a supposedly ""blind"" person, she manages to get around pretty easily/know where she's going and seems fairly familiar with her surroundings. If you actually pay attention, you will hear that she was not born blind. She obviously got to know the place where she grew up and familiarized herself with her surroundings/how to get places before she lost her sight. Even after that, she still ""sees"" people's ""colours"". So there's actually an explanation for the way she gets around, you just have to listen.<br/><br/>At its heart, this movie is a tale of romance (in its purest form). What holds the movie together is the love story between Bryce's Ivy Walker and Lucius Hunt (portrayed perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. No wonder he's a perfect fit - as the role was apparently written for him). It's also no wonder that Shyamalan cast Bryce without an audition from her and after only having seen her on stage. She's quite the find. Her chemistry with Phoenix is a large part of what makes the film work. There's a purity and innocence to their love for each other. Their interaction/dialogue really gets to the heart of what love is/should be about. I especially liked her trust in him and his faithfulness and loyalty to her.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also does well. William Hurt is excellent as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver is quite good as Lucius's mother, and Brendan Gleeson is great as always (though a little underused). Meanwhile, Adrien Brody has a tough role, playing Noah Percy (who is literally ""the village idiot""). He'll probably get on some people's nerves, while some might just find him unintentionally amusing. I thought he played the role well, and I even felt a twinge of sympathy for him. Judy Greer is also good as Ivy's sister, Kitty (and she shares one especially amusing scene with Lucius. Both she and Phoenix are excellent in the scene where she makes her feelings known to him). Apart from the wonderful relationships of lovers, father and daughter and mother and son, there's also the love/relationship between two sisters on display.<br/><br/>The film itself looks great. Very moody and atmospheric, nicely gloomy and cast-over. The night scenes are brilliantly done - taking full advantage of shadows and the only light source being candles. I just cannot say enough about how good this film looks. It creates the sort of place one would almost want to step into, walk around in and be a part of. It has a mystical sort of quality to it, yet everything is grounded in a 'reality' of sorts.<br/><br/>Speaking of, the elements to this film that may feel 'supernatural' in nature are actually handled really well. There is an explanation for everything that happens in the film, but like with all good movies, you can't expect answers straight away. You have to pay attention and be willing to go along for the ride all the way. Obviously, after Shyamalan's other movies, people are expecting a 'twist'. Thing is, if you go into this movie for the sole purpose of *looking* for what the twist might be, then chances are you may figure it out. I myself went into the film not actively seeking out the twist, and was able to sit back and just enjoy the movie for the story it had to tell. The 'twist ending' is not the main thing you should be worrying about here. It's the story that matters - and it was a story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Some may possibly feel that the film just sort of ends abruptly, but I think that if you've been paying close enough attention to the journey that the character of Ivy Walker goes through, you'll realise that the somewhat open-ended final scene can only have one natural resolution. It's really left up to you to decide, but I know that I was happy with how I thought the film ended.<br/><br/>It is one of those cases where you either 'get' the film or you don't. And I absolutely 'got' it. It addresses issues about today's society and makes you really think about what the world has come to. What are people - as a whole - like nowadays? Not exactly the best examples of human nature are on display in today's day and age. People, in general, are deeply flawed, and The Village ponders what could be done about that to escape the unpleasantness. I very much appreciated this film and, after having recently re-watched it yet again on DVD, I love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it at the theatre (maybe even a little more). Out of all of Shyamalan's films that he's done, this one is easily my favourite. It's a truly under-appreciated gem of a film."
"bsinc","7","8","11","18 December 2005"," James Newton Howard saves the day
","I am kind of baffled by this movie  I have problems describing it!<br/><br/>""Unbelievable lack of advertising strategy"" would be my first observation. M. Night Shyamalan has made his career with suspenseful thrillers with plot twists at the very end, but ""The Village"" takes a somewhat different step, perhaps unnoticed to the untrained eye. The entire movie still looks and feels exactly the same as the rest of M.'s previous movies, which, in this case is more of a negative than a positive thing, yet at the same time it's exactly this rich quality of production that gives it the strongest assets. Let's face it, ""The Village"" is yet another one of M.'s misunderstood movies due to ""poorly educated"" viewers. I'm talking about the type that doesn't get the blatantly obvious or the blatantly irrelevant and writes posts like ""what color does Ivy see in Luscious and her father"". A Non-important, Irrellevant one, btw!. The exquisite ensemble of actors and actresses (special kudos to the sexy redhead Bryce Dallas Howard) made the script breathe and gave sense to M's story. But what saved the whole movie was the musical score. James Newton Howard singlehandedly brought life to ""The Village"". What this man does is beyond me, I can describe it only as perfection. Every score he has so far composed for M felt like the movie was made after the score so it could blend in just the right way. The music editing deserves a ton of recognition and praise as well because it gave the movie just the right tone and atmosphere. M's movies have always demanded the viewers utmost attention, and so far this has always been rewarded many times over. ""The Village"" will probably be remembered as one of his weakest and least liked movies, and I have to understand why. He has been using the same style of story-telling since 1999 and this movie should have been an exception because it stands out. The story is minimalistic (as are the ""twists"" towards the end) and if one doesn't pay enough attention the main theme of the movie gets easily lost. It's love! I think. The plot, the motives, even the explanations are pretty shaky but this movie delivers numerous amazing moments that I know I'll just want to see over and over again. M is THE MASTER of subtlety and if you won't see it in ""The Village"" you won't see it anywhere else! And it's exactly these incredibly subtle, thought-out scenes that have immense power and are the best parts (literally) of the movie. It's because of them that I enjoyed ""The Village"" as much as I did and looked past the simple story that never even intended to be the key thing here (it's even revealed before the end). It's unnoticed things like cinematography that treats the character of Ivy differently that any other character because she can't see, it's the barely noticed tear on her left cheek that falls down her face when Luscious declares his love to her, it's the expression that he makes when he gets stabbed, it's the breath-takingly perfect last 5 seconds of the movie, then the score with instant fade to blackpriceless! I sincerely have to admit I have no idea what happened to the 60 million dollar budget and where it went to, but ""The Village"" does feel rich (despite mostly being in a very minimalistic location), full of details, and manages to provide the absolute best of sound, style, cinematography, acting and music making it an absolute treat for the senses. And I actually like the fact that this movie is generally hated, it makes it more mine on some personal level. 7/10<br/><br/>Recommendations: any avid fans of M, you are the ones that will appreciate this movie, anyone into great sound and music editing, cinematography, outstanding acting performancesthe works. BUT A WORD OF CAUTION-don't expect much from the story, this time the movie relies completely on the actors and the solid production."
"dtb","7","8","11","8 October 2004"," WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! Who Are THE VILLAGE's True Monsters?
","THE VILLAGE is flawed, but better than it gets credit for. People were probably disappointed because the film was sold as a thriller when it's a mood piece about how fear and paranoia impact a community, a timely theme in our post 9/11 world. Instead of misrepresenting THE VILLAGE as a twisty shocker a la THE SIXTH SENSE, the marketing department should've tried another approach: ""M. Night Shyamalan as you've never seen him before!"" :-)<br/><br/>Unlike MNS's previous films, it's easier to see through this story about the citizens of Covington Woods, an 1890s-style farm community, who won't venture beyond their village's borders because of their uneasy ""truce"" with the ""creatures"" outside, including jettisoning anything colored red, the ""bad color"" that purportedly attracts these creatures. The narrative transparency causes the dreamlike effect of MNS's usual leisurely pace to peter out too soon. Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention. Former co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver reunite as village elders Edward Walker and Alice Hunt; for once Hurt's slightly dazed soft-spokenness suits his character! :-) Joaquin Phoenix, re-teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into ""the towns"" for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths. Phoenix is well-matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy. I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out. No surprise that Adrien Brody signed on for the role of mentally-challenged Noah Percy (or as his character has been dubbed by smart-alecks, ""the VILLAGE idiot"") as his first post-Oscar role. It gave him an opportunity to work with a hot director (turning MNS down at this point in his career would've been like turning down Alfred Hitchcock in the 1940s and '50s), and most actors can't resist playing handicapped characters. Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems. In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out. His behavior reminded me of autistic/ADHD children I've known, so I was particularly moved when Lucius wonders if ""the towns"" might have medicines to help Noah ""sit still and learn."" (Seeing Brody in 1890s-style clothing got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films ...SLEEPY HOLLOW again!) The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced. Up until this point, Lucius, Ivy, and Noah have been a trio, with Noah responding affectionately to Ivy's kindness. That changes forever after the engagement, when Noah turns up on Lucius' doorstep with grief in his heart, tears in his eyes -- and a knife in his hand. After the attack, Noah's parents find him rocking agitatedly on the porch, frightened of ""the bad color"" on his bloodstained hands. When Ivy finds out, she confronts Noah, who holds his arms out to her, clearly sorry and hoping for forgiveness, only to have Ivy start shrieking and hitting him until she's dragged off him. Although what Noah did was horribly, unforgivably wrong, his howls of anguish and wrenching sobs almost brought me to tears. (I'd love to see Brody's and Howard's performances get award nominations!) When Lucius' wounds become infected, Ivy must trek to ""the towns"" to get medicine. Here's where the twist (and the *SPOILER*) comes in: Walker gives his daughter what turns out to be a prescription, and the foreshadowing (particularly various Villagers' revelations of losing loved ones violently in ""the towns"" in their pre-Village lives) pays off. Our villagers *don't* live in the 1890s. The time is now...the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives...the creatures were fabricated to keep the young people in line and in the dark, with various townspeople -- including Noah in mischievous-child mode -- donning creature costumes and skinning small animals periodically to scare everybody. And Walker masterminded it all! A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi-Brigadoon in an isolated area of the Walker family's game preserve, with the adults conspiring to keep the village going with various deceptions. I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her); I'm all for the idea of living in one's own little homemade world! :-) But why the hell would supposedly intelligent modern people like Walker & Company set their new community in an ersatz 1890s (even the gravestones list 1890s dates!), a time without *antibiotics?!* The film begins at the funeral of a little boy who, it's made clear, is one of several children who died of illnesses that could've been cured with the right medicine. I can't believe Walker and the town doctor didn't take precautions to have modern meds available just in case, to say nothing of medicine/treatments that might have helped poor mentally-stunted Noah and maybe even Ivy's blindness! It's unconscionable that, however well-meant Walker's power trip is, he and the others would let their children die or be damaged for life rather than go into ""the towns"" for help, even if it means their elaborate ruse might collapse around them! (Amish people come to cities for supplies or trade in real life, so why couldn't Walker and the villagers do the same?) THE VILLAGE would've been more compelling had the script delved deeper into that aspect of it, with the secrets, lies, and power the elders have, but at such a terrible cost. Then MNS might have had a future classic on his hands, not just the cinematic equivalent of a nice try."
"almonetts","Null","86","175","21 August 2004"," an interesting concept but the film fails to deliver on the premise
","M. Night Shyamalan, presents an interesting concept but miserably fails to deliver on the promise of an excellent trailer. Then again, the trailer did do its job i.e. get my but into the seat. However, the primary reason for the movie's trapping lies squarely on the shoulder of its director. Undoubtedly a talent, he can set perfect moods from carefully constructed scenes and camera angles (see Signs) and has modernized Hitchcock's style of movie making. However, audiences have come to expect a surprise ending or twist. As such many are going to head into the theatre with the intention of figuring out what is the twist. You can almost do that immediately in the first few frames. If you miss it, there is a likelihood that you'll be bothered and miss the true revelation of the movie (which lies in one of the best star making turns in recent movie history). <br/><br/>Given the above, I must be vague. The movie revolves a community which is almost Amish in its characteristics. The villagers are self sufficient in their world. It features a great cast led by William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson. However, the talent is so wastefully squandered with too rare, fleeting moments of interaction, notably with Weaver/Hurt and Brody/Phoenix. That star making turn mentioned above, is the acting debut of Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of director Ron Howard, who plays Hurt's daughter and girlfriend of Phoenix. She reminds me an awful lot of Kate Hudson in ""Almost Famous""....very sweet, idealistically driven, and strong willed. Each time she takes the screen you can't help being transfixed. Although a supporting character, the movie thankfully belongs to her.<br/><br/>The elders of the community (Hurt, Weaver, Gleeson and others) have prohibited the villagers to venture into the surrounding woods, as there are ""Creatures of which we do not speak"" living within. They wear red hoods and red is a color which they are not allowed to cast their eyes upon. The community is in turn paralyzed by fear. As history would have it, there has been bad, spilt blood with these creatures and a truce was called. The promise of the truce, is that neither party is not allowed to set foot into the other's territory, or else it will be considered void. Sounds ominous and promising and there are a few genuine scenes which make you jump out of your skin. There are a handful of moments when this movie could have kicked into high gear. However, the plot becomes so transparently thin, and the movie is let down by the acknowledgment that it could have been so much more."
"alexduffy2000","1","54","107","2 August 2004"," See Not This Movie, Burn This Village
","""The Village"" is just awful.  I feel like I was suckered into giving up $20 by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan himself, and that he should personally apologize to my wife and I for tricking us into watching this awful film. Since that's not going to happen, first I will rant, and then go into some well-marked spoilers.<br/><br/>
*RANT*<br/><br/>This film promises one thing and delivers something completely different.  I was fooled by the advertising campaign, I thought this was a HORROR film, not a nearly two-hour long episode of the Twilight Zone (and not a very good one either).<br/><br/>Ron's Howard's daughter's acting really sucks!  She's the ""blind girl,"" but until she tells the audience she's blind, you'd never know it.  She looks right at people, runs through fields without tripping, etc.  Her emotional range is so limited that I thought she was autistic as well (but that's just bad acting).<br/><br/>All I can say is DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.  It is a waste of time and money, and most likely, you'll feel ripped-off.  Buy not the ticket, it will show you the bad movie.<br/><br/>
***SPOILERS AHEAD*** ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** ***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Warning:  Don't read what follows unless you've seen the movie or don't care if certain scenes are spoiled for you.<br/><br/>The premise of this film is that in the 1970's a professor and some other folks are part of some ""recovery group"" for people who have lost loved ones to violent crime.  So he gets a forest preserve (somehow), prevents planes from flying over it (somehow).  In the center is The Village built on a glen and fields, and surrounding the fields is a forest, and surrounding the forest is a tall wooden fence, which is patrolled by guards in jeeps.  Who pays for all this?  Who cares.<br/><br/>The professor sets up this village so the people of the recovery group can live in ""innocence"".  Supposedly there will be no crime or violence. However, he and the ""elders"", the original members of the recovery group, decide that the best way to keep the generation of kids that will be born in the village away from the outside world is to fill the woods with ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"", essentially were-porcupines who wear red robes.  The were-porcupines are actually the elders, taking turns being ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"".  25 years or something goes by from when they set up this Village, so now, in 2004, The Village is filled with a new generation that knows nothing of the outside world.<br/><br/>Now, I paid money to watch a HORROR movie.  I was very curious as to what the creatures in the woods were.  I was hoping the villagers would get tired of being bullied by these creatures, and would rise up against them, but they would be going up against tough supernatural creatures, so the battle would be long, exciting, tense... we'd learn more about these creatures, their origins, religion, society, etc.  But I wanted above all to see a SUPERNATURAL THRILLER, what I felt the trailer promised.  Instead it was an episode of the Twilight Zone.  You can almost hear Rod Serling:  ""For man has only one real enemy to fear.  It is man himself.""  Aw geez, gimme a break!<br/><br/>Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan's script is just bad.  The film begins with scenes from The Village, where everyone is talking in this fake sounding 1890's American English.  No one, and I mean NO ONE ever spoke American English this way.  If this is supposed to be particular to The Village, then okay, but if this is supposed to be reflective of 1890's speech, give me a break.  Shymanlan should have read ""McTeague"" or another famous novel from the 1890's to get some kind of flavor of how people spoke in those days.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody is just WASTED here as the village idiot.  This is the guy who one the Best Actor award for ""The Pianist"", remember?  He could have been working on a real project instead of this tripe.  And if he is the village idiot, how does he know how to find his parents' were-porcupine costume, put it on, escape from a locked room, and find the EXACT location of Ron Howard's daughter in the woods?  Did he have GPS?<br/><br/>Eventually, The Village would rebel against the creatures, regardless of hurt.  They are just a bunch of were-porcupines, there's no way they could stand up against an entire Village determined to kill these vermin once and for all!<br/><br/>Why aren't the kids in The Village more curious about the creatures?  How come none of them have ever stumbled upon their parents dressing up in a were-porcupine suit?  Isn't it odd to the kids that on some nights their parents disappear, then appear tired in the morning?<br/><br/>Also, there's no way the fake ""joy"" in The Village could be sustained over a course of years.  The kids, especially the teenagers, would get bored and rebellious.  Even some of the adults would want out, and once on the outside, they'd open their big fat mouth and tell the world about this Village.<br/><br/>Boring, unconvincing, just plain bad.  Steer clear of this Village."

","When this movie released in August, I was simply overjoyed and immediately wanted to go see it. Because of my busy schedule that summer, I didn't have the time to go see The Village. When I did have that spare moment, I didn't bother to go see it because the majority of my friends said it was crap and a waste of money.<br/><br/>Just a few weeks ago this movie came out to rent on DVD. Looking somewhat forward to renting it, my friend spoiled the enormous twist at the end just to prove it was a stupid movie. About a week later, I went to the movie store looking forward to renting a comedy, but ended up getting the Village. I wasn't expecting it to be so good.<br/><br/>I think that most people didn't enjoy this movie because the twist was disappointed, but since it was spoiled for me, I found absolutely wonderful! Besides the Notebook, the Village is now my all-time favourite movie. It captured my attention from the first title on the screen, to the very last.<br/><br/>I'm really upset that none of the actors got an Oscar nod; especially the actor who plays Ivy Walker. Another element of this movie that was amazing was the music.<br/><br/>I think this movie is underrated and deserves a 9/10. It is worth seeing. I don't think movies get much better than this."

","""The Village"" is not a horror movie, so the first step to enjoying it is to stop looking at it that way. Now, granted, it WAS marketed that way, which was a very wrong and misleading thing to do, but seriously, GET OVER IT. View the film within its own context and you might actually like it. I think Touchstone Pictures really nailed themselves into the ground with the misleading ad campaign. Naturally, audiences were confused. But, do I have any sympathy for these audiences? No, not really. I was also mislead, but I managed to get past that and so did about 44% of the nation's critics who saw it. Out of about 183 reviews counted on Rottentomatoes.com, 80 of them were positive. So, there are SOME people actually do enjoy this movie. I actually found myself in disagreement with my favorite critic Roger Ebert on this one. He slapped the movie with a pathetic one-star rating. I'd like to believe that Ebert was simply angry at the time that he wrote the review. I have tremendous respect for Roger Ebert, I just disagree with him. In his July 30th update on RogerEbert.com he called the film a ""shaggy-dog story"" which is ""a long, drawn-out anecdote ending with an absurd or anticlimactic punch line"". To the average cynical American viewer, the end of the movie will be exactly this. But, for those of us who still have the ability to suspend our disbelief for two and a half hours, the climax of the movie will exist as, in the words of the critc Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, a powerful anecdote about ""the ways fear can manipulate"".<br/><br/>Some critics have argued that ""The Village"" is a distinctly political film and I think that if you really look hard enough, you can see it. However, that's the not the movie's real point. Just like M. Night Shyamalan says on the DVD, ""The Village"" is really just a love story, a ""romance"" movie. (Note the DIRECTOR of the film saying that it isn't a horror film). The relationship between the film's heroine, Ivy Walker, and the quiet, but dignified Lucius Hunt is a thing of beauty. Shyamalan directs their love affair with incredible restraint and talent. Watch the night-time ""porch"" scene featuring the two and prepare to have your insides melt. Seriously, it's gorgeous.<br/><br/>I'll close here with another excerpt from Travers' review of the film that I think is appropriate: ""Know what? Let the film speak for itself. The Village, even when its step falters, is on to something more provocative than seeing dead people. Its power, unrelated to digital monsters, comes from the tension building inside the characters"". (Rolling Stone - Jul 28, 2004)."
"Coventry","1","49","97","3 February 2005"," The Village is nothing but humbug! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
","NO spoilers don't worry; I won't ruin the precious (!) story I surely am going to be criticized for this again, but at least I hope to reach some people M. Night Shyamalan is nothing but a phony storyteller! At first I just thought he was over-hyped and untalented but the more films he delivers, the more it becomes clear that he's actually laughing with his fans and audiences for keeping up with his lame so-called ""mystery"" tales. It wasn't my intention to watch Shyamalan's latest so quick after its releaseIn fact, after struggling my way through that dreadfully irritating ""Signs"" I took an oath never to waste time or money anymore on his films. Luckily for me, a friend wasted his money on this because, I assure you, ""The Village"" is absolutely worthless humbug. Shyamalan once made a partly successful film called ""The Sixth Sense"" using some stylish elements. Since then, he shamelessly repeats this formula and all you'll ever find in his films are an exaggerated use of ominous music and silence, a very slow tempo and a cast that is overacting in the opposite way (meaning they do their best to look depressed, unworldly and silent). Would somebody please tell the director that atmospheric aspects like these only work when you've got a story to tell? The premise of a little village inhabited by social outcasts who're terrified of the creatures living in the nearby forests is dull, ultra-thin and definitely not suited for a compelling mystery tale. And then, of course, there's the famous ""twist-near-the-end"" which pretty much has become Shyamalan's trademark. Well, the ""twist"" is this film is so ridiculous, so predictable and so pathetic that the entire project instantly turns into a comedy! Actually, I wouldn't refer to it as a twist but as a confirmation that our precious director is completely uninspired and overrated. What amazes me the most is that so many respected actors are almost battling to become part of this fake hype. Surely Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt know better than to accept awful scripts like this? Hopefully naive fans won't start shouting that opponents of The Village didn't ""get it"" and that the film actually contains several brilliant metaphors and underlying messages The only underlying message featuring here is that M. Night Shyamalan's constantly growing star-status is one giant hoax."

","A couple of weeks ago I was part of a family get together and like all family get togethers boredom rapidly set in , so one night my sister rented a couple of DVDs* with one of the films being the horror movie THE VILLAGE . "" Ah "" I piped up "" I know the ending of this and it's not a horror movie "" and promised not to tell anyone the twist ending . The titles came up and my sister asked who the director was as M Night Shymalan rang a bell . I explained that he was the writer/director of THE SIXTH SENSE ( Overrated ) and UNBREAKABLE ( Brilliant movie ) . About half an hour later my sister asked if anyone was still able to follow it and at this point my brother admitted he'd seen it at the cinema and it does pick up .<br/><br/>This sums up everything that's wrong with THE VILLAGE - Imagine if you have no idea who Shymalan is and you're expecting a horror movie watching this will be a dire ordeal . It's makes a snails pace look like a speed OD in comparison . We're treated to a series of sequences that on the surface make little sense like people burying red flowers in the ground . This all might make sense after the ending is revealed but what ruins the movie - Even if you know the ending - is the editing , the scenes jar without any sort of flow and as many people have pointed out this feels like a twelve hour movie cut down to a two hour movie with a lot of important scenes cut out . For example we see an attack by the mythical creatures then there's a jump cut to the next day which is very disjointed ,it's not well into the film that it's revealed that Ivy is blind when surely it would have been obvious at the start . Little things like that leads me to believe there's been large chunks cut out of the narrative along with characters that seem to be underdeveloped . And on top of all this the director insists on shooting several scenes in slow motion as if the movie isn't already slow paced enough <br/><br/>! !!!! SPOILER !!!! <br/><br/>As for the ending where it's revealed that the village is part of the 21st century and has been built by people wanting to escape the violence of modern day America it's by no means as clever as the endings of THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE . There's also a lack of internal logic to this . For example if the younger villagers believe they're living in the 19th Century then why do they wear 19th century clothes ? If they were wearing flares and tie dye T-Shirts they'd still believe they were living in the 19th century if that's what they've been conditioned to believe wouldn't they ? The characters also have odd sounding 19th century speech patterns . Again why would people not knowing what century it was have to speak in 19th century speech patterns ? They could easily use 21st century speech patterns which would make the dialogue easier to understand . Ah but that might make the audience cotton on to the fact that this isn't a 19th Century village after all , the whole film revolves around the twist that it's the 21st Century . As many , many people have pointed out similar ideas have been done much better in a third of the running time in THE TWILIGHT ZONE and without a doubt THE VILLAGE is Shymalan's weakest movie <br/><br/>* Just for the record COLLATERAL was the other movie we watched that night"

Bryce Dallas Howard was simply amazing and this movie was perfect for her. Sigourney Weaver is my all time favourite actress. 1. because shes beautiful 2. because shes a brilliant actress. 3. because she stared in the best film ever made (alien). 4. Oh god i just love her, shes sooooo amazing. The one thing i didn't like about it is that the town elders sounded a bit evil making up the creatures like that. Still they were trying to protect the villagers from the outside world. I would love to live there as long as Weaver lives there. It seems so peaceful and quiet, the setting is brilliant. Lady in the water is my second favourite Shyalmalan followed by signs ... i have sadly not seen the sixth sense of unbreakable yet nut i hope i can see then soon.

","What I suspected from MNS starting from his Unbreakable appeared clear in Village - he is interested in developing as a drama director. I will not be surprised if one day he decides to screen Shakespeare. <br/><br/>If you are a pure horror movies fan either quit seeing MNS' movies or start seeing other aspects in them. <br/><br/>Another suspicion, which became obvious in Village is his strive for minimalism. Not in the way Lars von Trier does (handheld shooting, no props) but in terms of playing and the picture. Remember the Sixth Sense booming of each scary scene and rewind to the most dramatic episode with the knife in Village when there is no sound at all. Remember the limited set of colours in Village, shooting unnecessary heroes from a distance, etc. This is the most minimalistic movie I've seen from mainstream Hollywood in years.<br/><br/>The movie does not lampoon GW Bush administration as it could appear from many comments. At wider scope the issues raised in the Village equally concern e.g. Hitler and Stalin, elections in Ukraine, etc. Bad colours, somebody we do not speak of, etc. The novelty of the Village is that in contrary to his latter movies (e.g. childhood problems, family relations, etc.) MNS now took even more difficult philosophical aspects to explore (place of individual in community, manipulation of masses, etc.). Respect.<br/><br/>The only reservation I keep is the minimalism in playing, which I agree to be somewhat numb. The most of actors are little underused. Better use of simple human emotions imho wouldn't spoil the minimalistic set. <br/><br/>The script, picture, camera-work, soundtrack (which is a masterpiece), proper use of sound/visual effects, and philosophical background make the Village deserve 9/10"
"StevinTasker","Null","17","32","10 November 2004"," Great Stuff
","This is a welcome change for me and as such it stands tall amongst other Hollywood offerings. As with his other movies there is a gimmick attached to the plot but I am glad M Night Shyamalan gave us a simple story with two fine performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard amongst a strong ensemble cast. People who view and review Shyamalans movies often concentrate on the gimmick 'I see dead people' Sixth Sense; 'an indestructible man' Unbreakable; 'alien beings' Signs; when I believe these elements come a close second to the characters and how they develop throughout the story. For me Unbreakable was about discovering love and meaning within your life (Bruce Willis gave up a sporting career for the love of his wife, a love which slipped away in the face of life's mundane disappointments) and in Signs it was about Mel Gibson letting go of the past to live for the future and reaffirming his faith. Children and family feature heavily in the two latter stories and their fathers, although loving, are lost within them selves and are unable to see the love and joy available within their family group. The story progresses and the plot gimmick, when realized allows the character to move towards their niche in the world. <br/><br/>I found similar themes within the Village. For me it's essentially about faith and romance; faith in yourself and again the joy to be found in companionship and love.<br/><br/>The movie starts slowly immersing the viewer in the village community; I found that this time was well used to develop character and setting and serves to allow the viewer full access to the characters thought process when making decisions later on.<br/><br/>Some have said that you can figure out the ending, so what? At least it's done well; I rather liked the idea myself, although, I understand that it has been used before but then so has 'dead person finally realising they're dead' (Sixth Sense) and this was met with rave reviews across the world! Who cares if its been done before? This is a deftly handled piece of film-making; I reveled at the innocence of the characters and the beginnings of the romance between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. I found simple enjoyment in setting up their feelings for one another and then putting them to the test such as when she steadfastly believes he won't leave her in danger and the moment he finally holds her hand again. I think I enjoyed this romantic aspect because it was subtle but powerful. In many respects is difficult to place the movie in a genre; one reviewer was disappointed because they thought this movie was going to be a horror film; I found this incredibly difficult to believe given the amount of information on offer before it went on general release and can only assume that this particular reviewer doesn't get to watch many movies. I found the movie offered some eerie moments and some genuine excitement. <br/><br/>While it may not tick all my boxes its miles better than many of its contemporaries and definitely worth a look."

","I'm sorry, I just don't get the popularity of M Night Shyalaman. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but everything I've seen after that (and with the exception of Lady in the Water, that's everything since)has been either a load of horse puck. I thought that the guy was a one-trick pony, and I think this movie pretty much confirms it.<br/><br/>And so to the Village...<br/><br/>Well, it started off promisingly enough, with the mysterious sounds from the woods and concerned looks during a Village outdoor dinner, but the film was terrible. Not just the pseudo-olde-English (how did the actors keep a straight face when they were reciting their lines?) to the inexplicable ability of a blind girl to run 100 metres without colliding into a single object whilst in other scenes, she was fumbling about for a step on her own front porch. There were many surprise goofs, gaffes and scenes consisting of pure untainted cheese that was enough to set off the giggles, and once the first unintentionally funny moment crops up, the film just throws up more and more.<br/><br/>I guess what made the film so funny was the sincerity and dignity in which it was acted and delivered. Add to that prolonged moments of tedium and then BAM, someone says or does something so unutterably trite, clichéd, or inexplicably stupid that you just have to burst out laughing. It's like someone from the RSC reciting a soliloquy from Othello and accidentally letting one rip.<br/><br/>All said and done, though, I sussed the ""Big denouement"" of the film about 1/3rd of the way in, and that's saying something, cos normally, I'm a bit thick when it comes to twists. Maybe it's because it is expected of a Shyalaman film, or maybe, like ""Signs"", it's all been done before but presented in a way that gets movie snobs thinking that it's the first time that particular tale has been told.<br/><br/>It's a good trick, but nothing more. Shyalaman really needs to remember that a good plot is more than just a twist. If the build-up sucks, then the denouement is really going to lack a punch."

You have a very simple story which in its unraveling makes you wonder and question everything about society and the what we hold dear.

","This is a great movie, one of my favorites, but it is destined to be an outcast.<br/><br/>It is a classic period piece, with beautiful music, visuals, people, and language. The plot is near perfect. Every time I watch it I notice something else that hints at the core climax of the plot, but so subtly, I only see it after many viewings. The characters are nearly perfect as well, and Adrian Brody, if his character were more prominent, would have won an Oscar.<br/><br/>It is also a thriller, with mystery, violence, and moments that make you jump as a horror film might. It will make you scared of the woods in autumn almost as much as The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>The fact that it is these two things at once, there lies the dilemma.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie without expectations, you will be disappointed, because it is fluid and changes, and is never quite what you thought it would be even as it ends. If you watch it with romance and Jane Austin era expectations, you will be disappointed because it is blurred together with something completely different. And if you watch it with Thriller expectations, the same thing happens in reverse.<br/><br/>I believe no one could truly love this film as they first view it because of all of these truths. I know I didn't care for it the first time. However...<br/><br/>If you are reading this review, and have not seen The Village before, you have a chance! A very small chance to truly enjoy an amazing movie, without knowing why until it is over.<br/><br/>Let the film be what it is, a truly unique outcast that will never really belong anywhere, and enter in fully, as if you are there in the story.<br/><br/>There are no guarantees you will fall in love like I have after just one viewing, but you might!

","If you go into The Village hoping for high-stakes horror and jump scares, you'll likely be disappointed. That is not what this film is. It's an atmospheric, patient rumination on pain, fear, and loss. It's a wholly original film that grips you right out of the gate, rife with symbolism and the anxieties that lie deep within all of us. Delivered in stunning fashion by its insanely talented cast, Shyamalan's story is elevated to a place that it may never have traveled otherwise. The Village is meditative, suspenseful, moving tale - one better understood if approached without preconceived notions."

"view_and_review","8","2","2","5 December 2006"," M. Night Shyamalan does it again
","With M. Night Shyamalan movies I have come to expect the unexpected. The Village is no different. The movie is about a simple people who live in a simple village in the woods surrounded by ""those that they do not speak of"". They lead a life of blissful coexistence with the monsters in the woods. Their life in the village is one of innocence, purity, and morality. But their bliss is shattered when a crime is committed. Do they venture into the woods to go to the towns for medicine to save the victim, or do they stay within their protective bubble safe from the monsters?<br/><br/>You can tell that a lot of thought and effort was put into this movie just by the way it unfolded. The movie portrayed nothing but the innocence of the people of the Village while dropping subtle hints of secrets about the people as well. The entire movie is a build up towards finding out the truth of the Village, its residents, ""those that they don't speak of"", the towns, and the secrets. M. Night Shyamalan did not disappoint, the ending was worth waiting for and it gave plenty of food for thought."

"shanfloyd","8","2","2","17 March 2006"," Different from Shyamalan's other films... one needs to know that to appreciate it.
","Although being a fairly good admirer of M. Night Shyamalan's previous three films I did not go to see ""The Village"" in theatres when it came out, partly because I was very busy with my work then and partly because I received negative comments from friends who saw it. I finally saw it on TV and am now regretting the fact that I missed its theatre screening.<br/><br/>To speak things clearly, ""The Village"" is not primarily 'a suspense-horror film with a sharp ending twist' as the popular description of his films goes. It is essentially a beautiful and faithful love story in the backdrop of an unusual situation. This backdrop has those elements of suspense and horror only to enrich the story, not to contaminate it. The film's social and political undertone shows how Shyamalan is growing more mature in writing cinematic materials, with several conflicting points of view interwoven with one another. And his visionary about the village and the woods is simply amazing. That makes it a visually stylish film too. And about the so-called 'plot twist', I think it was intentionally given away much too early, otherwise the original love story would have been largely affected. One must appreciate the film's ending, even if it does not contain any 'twist' as one might expect.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard completely steals the show with her dedicated portrayal of Ivy; I'd definitely look for her future works. Joaquin Phoenix as an actor is also nice to watch. Adrien Brody remains a little under-utilized in my opinion. And one must not forget William Hurt's excellent acting as Ivy's father.<br/><br/>The bottomline: To watch this film and appreciate it, it must not be compared with his previous films. It does not have their elements, but it has something new to offer. Keep and open mind for that."
"Sammileigh","8","2","2","30 March 2005"," Never the same movie twice
","M.Night Shyamalan films have recurring themes in his films, and some have gone so far as to suggest he makes the same film over each time. This is rather like saying Picasso used too much blue. The hues and tones of each Shyamalan study are completely different. The Village is a beautiful consideration of the human condition. Shyamalan is a symbolist, and the layers of this film can be peeled back revealing the extent to which our inner demons isolate us, the past of adults and how it can determine the paths taken by their children,and a theme many with children will surely warm to - the horror that can be created when an elder is trying to protect a youth. The environment he creates in The Village is lush,the colours are deep and rich, the characters complex and naive at the same time. The Village stands surely on it's own merits, actually the film is rather like beautiful, many layered poetry."
"what3v3r","10","2","2","24 March 2005"," A must watch , although only once
","Mind Boggling plot twists are undoubtedly Shyamlans prerogative. The entire span of the movie is basically a contrivance aimed at involving the viewer in a mindset which would warrant all sorts of ""sighs""and ""wows"". Although the movie does have a few shortcomings, the contrivance itself has been very well crafted. The ending truly does baffle you. However, with repeated viewings , a bunch of incoherencies do tend to crop up. But that is the case with almost every movie in this genre.<br/><br/>That sense of originality which is the quintessence of Shymalans movies, is very much present in ""The Village"". And as ever, the final sequence of event will leave you guessing and contemplating. This movie is somewhat chillingly creepy and tends to send pulses up and down your spine at times. The Village beats The Sixth Sense in the race for ""Shyamalan' masterpiece"". Personally, ""The Sixth Sense"" was more predictable than this one. With this movie, he does live up to every expectation warranted by his previous works.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard irrevocably deserves more laurels for her performance in this movie. Playing a blind woman, she is the epicenter of all emotion and thought that this movie extols."
"LRRHood-1","10","2","2","15 January 2005"," Brilliant!
","M. Night Shyamalan has such great creativity! He kept this story simple and believable. I enjoyed Bryce Howard's and J. Phoenix's performances, and I can't imagine any other actors who would have been better for their parts. Its nice to see a movie that doesn't seem to be ""trying too hard"" to impress the audience. I felt like the story moved along at the right speed, with no slow scenes--this made the movie seem much more professional than others that have come out recently. There were some really funny moments, as well, which I think makes a story closer to real life. The Village was an absolute joy to watch, from beginning to end, and I look forward to Shyamalan's future creations."
"valadas","7","2","2","10 November 2004"," Evasion
","A few people (The Elders) decided to evade this world of crime, anguish and pain and found a community in a secluded place surrounded by woods where they lead a life of peace, purity, love and quietness, dressing like 100 years ago and dispensing with such niceties as electrical power, cinema, radio, TV and motor cars. The way how they managed to get into this remains unrevealed to the viewer until the end of the movie and even then it doesn't become 100% clear. Well but what could be an Eden-like life is spoiled on the one hand by the belief that no one can go out of the village and cross the woods that surround it because they are inhabited by strange hostile creatures who will not only kill those who dare to do it but will also attack the village and on the other hand because human passions cannot be suppressed with all the distress they can cause and even jealousy and crime. This leads us to the vexed question of knowing if the solution for the evils of modern society lie in the evasion to supposed retired paradises where in spite of that, drama will be always present because the freer men are more drama will take place in their lives. And what to do when crime happens or the illness comes and you don't have the adequate means of dealing with it? But this story is indeed well told and homogeneous in narrative terms and will rivet your attention. Bryce Dallas Howard has a superb performance in the part of the blind girl who courageously faces danger in order to save the life of the man she loves. To sum it up we are in presence not of a masterpiece but of a good movie anyway."
"Mercian","Null","2","2","27 August 2004"," A Far Better Film Than Advertised
","'The Village' suffers from 2 major problems: the advertising campaign, which insists on trailing it as a mainstream shock-horror film, and the refusal of many movie-goers to shift mental gears and accept the film on its own terms.<br/><br/>This film is not about whether or not the audience can ""see the twist in the plot"", nor is it a conventional horror tale; it is a film about layers of complexity, an acutely observed study of human pain and fragility, and an unsettling examination of an ethical dilemma. The Elders of the village have created a solution to the problem of their pain by rejecting the outside world and its values. However, their simpler life is built on lies and deceit which, no matter how well intentioned, cannot be sustained without serious negative consequences for their community. In order to protect themselves and those they love, deception is layered upon deception, and the entire edifice of lies is in continual danger of crashing down around their ears. The fact that the village is generally relatively tranquil does not detract from the severe ethical compromises made on a regular basis; the Elders have locked themselves into a pattern of irresponsible and dysfunctional behaviour from which they cannot escape even when given the choice. When it becomes clear that there are opportunities to allow the younger members of the community to make their own choices based on the truth, they choose instead to give only partial information instead, obscuring the Big Lie which is fundamental to their way of life. <br/><br/>Joachin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard shine as the most truthful and courageous members of the village, whose insistence on doing what is right and decent discomfits the Elders. Their nobility is never showy, always simple and honest. Hurt and Weaver turn in beautifully low-key performances as their parents, each making bad choices for good reasons. Brody's performance invites the audience to be simultaneously appalled and compassionate; his strange behaviour is both destructive and malignant, and yet this malignancy is laced with innocence.<br/><br/>The closing scenes provide both hope for the future of the community and the probability that the Elders will continue on their path of lies, leaving the audience unsettled and uncomfortable with the knowledge that the inhabitants of the village may never come to know the truth; that if they do, they will be irreperably damaged, and if they don't, they face a bleak future in a slowly declining isolated community."
"Carycomic","Null","2","2","2 August 2004"," Once again, previews act as misdirection.
","*quite a few spoilers*   This movie seems to fall in between ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs,"" quality-wise.   It isn't as good as the former.  But, it's way better than the latter.  And, while you enter the movie theater, thinking it's going to be an outright thriller, it gradually becomes a touching love story. The movie starts out with the funeral of a child, in what appears to be an Amish-like community, circa 1897.   This increases the resolve of the normally introspective blacksmith Lucius Hunt to bring some much needed medical advancements to the Village.  This, in turn, helps him admit his love for the somewhat clairvoyant blind tomboy played, so sweetly and convincingly, by Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter).   I won't spoil the twist ending, except to say that I was half-expecting something along that line.  And, while it was a stroke of genius, Mr. Shyamalan (pronounced ""Shom-a-lon"") seems to be sending an even vaguer message than he did in ""Signs!""  I have an older brother who thinks the events in the latter film were all part of a faith-restoring dream sent by God on behalf of Mel Gibson's character.  But, with ""the Village,"" I don't know whether the moral of the story advocates a similar approach to dealing with modern problems. Or, if it's pointing out that, sooner or later, every Garden of Eden invariably gets its share of snakes.  I would like to think it's the second one.  In any case, I give this...3.1 stars (out of five)!"

","The Village has some creepy moments but its not as good as M. Night Shyamalans previous work. A tranquil 19th Century village enjoys an isolated living surrounded by woods which are home to strange creatures. For many years, they remain segregated, but one day, the villagers discover that the creatures will no longer leave them alone once an impetuous young man (Joaquin Phoenix) bravely ventures forth into the forbidden territory. The plot sounds very scary and with a talented cast this should have been a lot better. The film runs for 108 minutes but it feels a lot longer because there's a lot of boring moments. The script needed some work as there were a lot of holes and stuff that didn't make sense. The ending was good and I didn't see it coming but it also didn't make a lot of sense. The cast is great with the best being Bryce Dallas Howard, she's very talented and should will easily find work in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver both do a good job and Sigourney might be one of the most underrated actresses today. The last main person worth mentioning is Adrien Brody who does a good job but his character was really annoying. M. Night Shyamalan also does a good job of directing making The Village look and sound creepy. Even with a great cast and director the movie just didn't work as well as it should have. I do think critics were a bit harsh on this movie though as it wasn't as bad as they were saying. Rating<br/><br/>6/10, this seems to be a hate or love it type of movie as you will either like the ending or you will hate it and feel like you have been ripped off badly."

","This movie tries to live off the reputation of its writer/director M. Night Shymalan and is a big dose of disappointment following months and months of hype. Covington is a small town in late 1800s rural Pennsylvania. It is an Amish-like community chaste and pure of thought governed by the fear of mythical creatures that inhabit the woods that surrounds it. The daughter(Judy Greer)of the town's leader(William Hurt)proclaims her love for a young man(Joaquin Phoenix)who has the inner strength to stand up against community policy. Phoenix has no interest in Greer, but actually loves her blind sister(Bryce Dallas Howard). Phoenix wants permission to go through the woods and go into the outer cities to bring back modern medicines. Before his departure he is stabbed by the village idiot(Adrien Brody). Howard in spite of her lack of sight has the fortitude to enter the woods with intent to reach the cities and bring back needed medicines to save her young lover's life. <br/><br/>Plenty of drama; but where is the thrills and horror implied by what seems like six months of hype. The movie drags along and you wait and wait for something to happen. If you momentarily doze off you risk missing a subtle hint of what this story is really all about. Not only is Phoenix wasted, but so is Sigourney Weaver who plays his mother. I dare say that Brody steals the show. Howard(daughter of Ron Howard)is very impressive. Also in the cast are:Celia Weston, Brendan Gleeson, Frank Collison and Fran Kranz."

","M Night Shamalayan or however you spell it is supposedly this God of a director according to most movie reviews i have read on the net. Well, i went to see The Village when it first came out based on this statement and i can't begin to put in words how bored i was! At one stage of the movie my friends and i bet on who could throw a Kool Mint at the guy making out with his girlfriend in the row below us. I would've walked out of the movie if it wasn't for the fact that i was having to much fun laughing with disbelief at how bad the movie was. The first 20 minutes of the movie i will admit was quite excellent. It looked very promising indeed and i was actually relatively interested on what was going to unfold. M Night Shama-whatever his name is, did an excellent job building up the interest and suspense over the first 20 minutes so the audience was intrigued. Then for some strange reason, he decides to destroy the whole basis of the movie and went against every single marketing ploy The Village received. Disappointed is not the word; rather, when the town elder tells his daughter (who is forced to travel through the village to get medical supplies) that the whole pretense of beasts in the village is in fact phony and made up i think my first reaction was laughter at the fact that the director and whoever wrote the play destroyed the basis of their story.<br/><br/>From this point on, whatever events unfold in the story are really just a joke and the audience has already lost its interest. Really, it is apparent from much earlier on that the whole pretense of the movie is a hoax. If the fact that the movie reveals that its story is a hoax isn't enough, it then goes on to try and re-invent the story by having the token retard of the village dress up as the beast to scare the girl without anyone knowing. And the girl, conveniently blind, somehow manages to dodge the retard (focus on the fact that he is a retard, not that in reality she is blind and would have no chance)in what is a slow motion jump out the way of the retard who conveniently falls into a gaping whole (i had to laugh at this point) right behind the girl and dies.<br/><br/>The reason i decided to spoil the entire movie for you is so you don't go see it with expectations of a good movie, but rather expectations of seeing a movie that was intended to be taken seriously, but turns out to be a complete joke. Whatever your view, if you did enjoy this movie, i urge you to get a life because i would rather sit through a token black comedy like ""Guess Who"" or even a Hillary Duff movie (God help me).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The Village is crap and i hope the idea of what M Night Shamalyan classes as a thriller, suspense type movie doesn't catch on or else we'll all be bored shitless at the movies."

I burn as a never-ending fire in the deepest pit of Hell. And I thirst for revenge, for recrimination, and for the recoupment of my six pence. For thine is the foolishness, and the folly, and the awfully written screenplay that thou hast so miserably directed and produced!<br/><br/>I hate thee in thine overall conceit, thy trickery and thy lies, thy foolish fear of prescribed colors (red). Most of all I hate thoust terrible dialog, much of the wretched squabble consisting of the phrase, ""those we dare not speak of."" Such foolishness, indeed! Because in point of fact, much of the entire scenario consists of witless fools speaking of such!<br/><br/>I hate thee to thine very core, thine deepest marrow and beyond. I despise thy story from whence thoust came. I am sickened by the deceitful acting, and the foolish costumes, and the ridiculousness of the otherwise good player Brody, who is senselessly depicted here as rather a foolish clown! I am revolted that the other good players, the Hurt and the Weaver, these fine performers who were trapped into the folly and who surely knew not of what was to come! And I pray that with the grace of God, these pitiable persons, both elders and young ones, such as the Dallas Howard, will not suffer unduly hereafter due to their dreaded missteps into this pointless and misguided debacle!<br/><br/>I hate thee thoroughly and finally. I hate not merely the whole, but every wretched portion. I hate each damnable frame, every putrid sprocket hole, each and every foolish and misbegotten conceit that was dredged from some dark and damnable place and foisted upon thy glorious silver screen! <br/><br/>More than anything, I hate thee for this simple reason: that good and uncorrupted souls duly followed thou into thoust folly and were betrayed! Good and proper Cinema lovers, knowing full well their monies could never be refunded, trusted and waited, hoped and dreamed! But such was not to be. Because when thoust light flickered from thy projector, and when those damnable images burst forth and the foolish voices spoke, those blessed patrons were shocked and shamed beyond words! Time and precious money gone, hopes and fanciful dreams crushed. Good and proper minds laid to waste by such unfathomable nonsense and misbegotten folly! <br/><br/>And more's the pity! that many of these trusting souls held thoust in highest regard due to thine past work, thine prior achievements, which in mine humble personal regard, may not have been divine masterpieces as such, but, it can be said, were good and entertaining diversions -- to a degree.<br/><br/>But -- blast!

Dost thou arrogance and contempt know no Earthly bounds? Hast thou no shame!? Indeed -- for in perpetrating such degrading folly, no greater fool is revealed -- than thee!<br/><br/>Thine pretentiousness overfloweth! Indeed, thine lack of ability and talent has never been more true or fully evident, and thine justification for ceasing all future moving picture production now and evermore I dare say has never been more plainly clear! <br/><br/>And so I say unto you, sincerely and with full clarity of purpose -- on behalf of not merely myself, but of all good and righteous persons whom witnessed this unholiest of debacles: cease and desist, now and forever! Do so immediately -- if not sooner. For if such is not accomplished, I fear greatly for the future not only of all good persons, but the future of the Cinema itself! Alas! it may be too late already -- because those pitiable souls who suffered the boredom and the pain of the wretched awfulness have already paid the ultimate price -- and likely shall not be the same ever again!<br/><br/>I, however, shall do my humble part to stop the madness: I will promise, in all truest candor -- from this day forward to the end of mine humble days -- to keep this dear prayer closest to mine heart: that none so wretched, none so foolish, and none such wasteful and awfully- written folly should ever spring forth upon this good Earth to desecrate the Cinemas, and blacken the hearts of Men!<br/><br/>But whether such madness is again perpetrated, and whether the suffering shall continue, this I say this from the bottom of my most broken and tormented soul: I hate thee truly, madly and deeply, singularly and solely, and dare I say for all eternity -- or perhaps even longer.<br/><br/>Amen."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","5","8","27 January 2005"," The movie promises more than it really is.
","The main problem with ""The Village"" is the story. The beginning of the movie drags on for too long without seeming to go somewhere and the 'surprise twist' comes too early. The best part of ""The Village"" are the last 30 minutes. Funny, because it where the last 30 minutes that were the worst part of M. Night Shyamalan's previous movie ""Signs"".<br/><br/>I think that the marketing is one thing that killed this movie. The movie was presented as a scary supernatural horror/thriller. What you got when you watch the movie is a thriller with too few real thrilling moments and a dramatic love story. Basically all the excitement in the movie was already in the trailer.<br/><br/>Still ""The Village"" is a perfectly watchable movie mainly because of the cast. I think it's fair to say that the movie is better as an actors movie than as a thriller. Especially Adrien Brody was surprising good in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress (although she was not really a convincing blind person) but her character is not strong enough to carry the entire final part of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's characters disappears way too soon out of the story, the movie could have really used his character.<br/><br/>I know that M. Night Shyamalan and Roger Deakins deliberately choose bright colors for the movie but I can't say that I'm completely happy about the visual style. A more of a foggy ""Sleepy Hollow"" kind of atmosphere would had done wonders to the movie I think. It would had certainly made it more exciting.<br/><br/>All in all a movie that promises more than it really is and that lacks some good and realistic excitement that all other M. Night Shyamalan movies thus far had. Disappointing but most certainly not unwatchable!<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ReadingFilm","10","3","4","30 March 2019"," A cinema study in truth
","Night channeling Hitchcock in this study of cinema truth, here he crams the tiniest mechanics inside even smaller frames, while his contemporaries move bigger and wider. Look how there is no horror but it has the frightening beats of music. What is the film scared of exactly? People going around in costumes? Look how it's the 1890s and 1990s at the same time. All these multiple love stories going on bringing this clash of truths in the micro and macro. Bryce's inviting human eyes, playing the same function as Story, she serves as the invitation into the artist's mind via humanism and sincerity, perfect with those folky flutes. I like all the rules as well. Don't go past the sticks. Don't use the color red. Don't say the name. Often his films are providing we the audience rules for what we're seeing, meaning here it's his characters watching the film, not us.<br/><br/>Now if really wanted to mess with us, he could have left some of it ambiguous so that you would walk away debating which reality is true, what era was the right one, which rules were to be followed. Though for 2004 being Bush era, the new village would be relevant for the Trump age of 'truth'. He would've added other villages; the experiment on one being losses, another maybe being failure. Expand algebra into calculus. My favorite were the magic stones as it's such a nonsense last ditch effort to hold onto the lie. Then the unraveling of the compound seems inevitable. Noah's mother will break. Questions will be asked. Lies cannot last. Lastly of interest, the photos being the twist reveal rather than the car; again the Hitchcock nod of the recorded form exposing as the camera in Rear Window stopping the villain. Better the box, like those boxes 35mm film prints are carried in."

","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen... and I suppose that my comment and rating differ from the most of the others because I don't like any other movie made by M. Night Shyamalan. I don't like movies that can't even theoretically be placed in the real world, I just don't buy that stuff.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies by Shyamalan, this one is (almost) not about ghosts, monsters and superpowers. Instead, it's about utopia (in my opinion) and psychology of the characters with deep emotional scars. Of course, it's scary. I found it much scarier than most of the horror and fantasy movies that I've seen, simply because I find them funny and unbelievable.<br/><br/>So, if you don't like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, etc. and if you like let's say The Beach you will probably like this one."

I was recommended to watch it by a friend - and the movie certainly did live up to expectations.<br/><br/>The woods were freaky! And the movie was not just pure horror - but interesting and had a great plot. This is the kind of movie that I want to go and watch it again.<br/><br/>The twist at the end - where the Village turns out to be set in the 21st century and most people didn't know, was really unexpected.

"infinajt","7","3","4","12 September 2008"," Blind State
","Some people in the industry are just lost causes. I really have given Shyamalan chances, many more than any other on/off director has gotten. That's because he seems to have pretty solid ideas about giving a movie that special personal touch, which is always an appreciable trait. And because he DOES have ideas that, now and then, are more valuable than your average episode of Outer Limits.<br/><br/>The main problem is just that as a writer, he is horrible, and perhaps because of his ""slight"" egoism, there seems to be no one to tell him when he crosses the line. I think 'Unbreakable' is his only good movie, and that's because there was a narrative trick that was too simple to be screwed up by what was actually happening in the script (Bruce wasn't the main character!).<br/><br/>This is his second best, I guess. It IS flawed, but has some interesting stuff going on. I actually felt bad for a while for Shyamalan, because the marketing section falsely decided to advertise this as a horror movie - which it is not, as many have pointed out. But that's not the issue here: the idea in this one is all about seeing the structures that build up a society. Terror as a way to control. Tragedy as a trigger for change. Secrecy for 'greater good'. Outcast as a monster. All 'seen' by a blind girl as our lead. Of course the blindness here is just poor symbolism, but it's important that SHE doesn't see. In the end, she still can't be sure if the threat exists. Has the lie lived so long that it has become real?<br/><br/>But it's constructed poorly. Shyamalan wants his twist, so the entire narrative builds just for that moment, and after that, it dies completely. And before that, all commentary is lost because we just want to know the catch. I wonder what it would have been like if WE had known the truth from the beginning? Not scary at all, of course, but maybe a bit more meaningful. Compare, for instance, 'From Hell' the graphic novel to its movie adaptation.<br/><br/>Actors do okay with their paper-thin characters. Shyamalan's use of camera and cuts, which I considered refreshingly original in his earlier movies, is already becoming boring here. Afterwards, in 'Lady in the Water', it's just stupid.<br/><br/>But nice try, anyway. At least here he didn't cast himself as the writer who saves the plot."
"jazzpiano-","7","3","4","10 August 2007"," It's really not that bad...
","People write the most accusatory things when they don't get what they were expecting. While not a masterpiece, it is definitely Shyamalan's best film since ""The Sixth Sense"", with the most engaging protagonist since the lovable, mature Cole Sear.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is the story of a small community in the 1800s in Pennsylvania, living their simple lives in their utopia, under the threat of omnipresent monsters who dwell in the woods - Those We Don't Speak Of. While the social commentary of this film on American society, post-9/11, may be overly simplistic and misguided, several aspects of this film are nice. While it tends to drag a little at the end (Shyamalan likes quiet, slow moments), the pacing is generally quite good. Technical aspects, such as cinematography, acting and music and are all brilliantly executed - especially Bryce Dallas Howard's performance - she's so fun! When she laughs, it makes you smile. Her character, Ivy, is so full of joy and Howard animates her to endearing effect. Adrian Brody similarly stands out, but Sigourney Weaver is wooden throughout the majority of the film - disappointing given her reputation.<br/><br/>Everyone should know by now that ""The Village"" was marketed completely incorrectly. In the ads, it was dumbed-down to a shock-horror using the brazenly obvious symbolic code of the colour red and some nifty, atmospheric shots through twigs. There is more to this film than twigs and red: The characters are generally well developed. Ivy is a splendid character, one of Shyamalan's better ones, especially since the devastatingly dull, stunted Rev. Graham Hess who dominated ""Signs"". Joaquin Phoenix's character, seemingly similarly underdeveloped, is revealed to be loyal and sensitive, and surprisingly masculine. Even the retarded 'village idiot', who initially seems included for comic relief, has a greater purpose in the development of the plot, with a bizarre love triangle emerging. Most of the other characters are either left untouched, or the rest is left to the audience's imagination (particularly with the elders).<br/><br/>The music is stunningly good, and (in a rare case with Hollywood films) actually enhances plot development by being closely affiliated with the protagonist.<br/><br/>The plot - It's been said before but I'll say it again! It's a love story. Awww, how nice. Ivy and Lucius are a cute couple, and even if you were expecting a horror film, their romance is strong enough to carry the film. However, one of my major qualms with the film lies in the plot, concerning how much time is devoted to the elders, who frankly, aren't that interesting. Interesting in concept, maybe, but the actors who played the elders were stoic and stiff! But, at the end of the day, ""The Village"" is definitely not the worst film ever made - it was made with love, with the actors going to a boot camp to learn how to perform typical 1800s activities, and a score that mirrors the protagonist's 'internal struggle'(if I can use a clichÃ© term). However, my one criticism of M. Night Shyamalan is this: Please stop trying to rely on one shot to carry a scene. The audience goes to a film expecting just that - and if you're not using that one shot for an effect, such as suspense, please stop pretending that you're directing a play. Yes, I realise you specially cast theatre actors so they could deal with long takes - but long scenes of one take is just ridiculous. The last scene with the elders exemplifies my frustrations perfectly. But, the long take is used to great emotional effect in the scene on the porch between Ivy and Lucius. I commend Night on that scene, but I think my criticism is fair.<br/><br/>Look, basically, you're into this kind of slow-moving, genre-hybrid, dystopian fantasy, or you're not. It's up to you."
"demon-drifter","7","3","4","3 February 2007"," The Containment
","M. Night Shyamalan has produced a decent film in The Village. It is interesting how he has used the village and its people as a metaphor to show how fear can keep us imprisoned, contained and controlled. It takes a rebellious mind to break free. It is also striking to see that people could theoretically be contained within a time period. We see the village living in medi-evil times while a few short kilometers away the rest of the world lives in the 21st century. It is an intriguing film to watch and attempts reasonably to get the audience to feel the fear of the villagers. It is a worthwhile film for those who like twists and turns. M. Night Shyamalan has become somewhat of an Alfred Hitchcock with his cameo appearances, and with films like The Sixth Sense he is not too far off."
"papabearEG","9","3","4","27 August 2006"," the plot twist for me was at the beginning
","I rented this movie thinking it was a cheap horror/thriller flick because my partner loves that kind of tripe. So for me the plot twist was a very pleasant one at the beginning when i became engrossed in the film and realized it was a beautifully crafted drama/suspense. It isn't horror at all and thriller doesn't work, suspense is better for a choice of categories. I found a lot of similarities between this story and Little Red Riding Hood. My partner was dreadfully bored and disappointed. I was enthralled and loved it. Like so many other good movies it was badly marketed (like the Iron Giant). Marketing people in Hollywood need to go back to flipping burgers. I suspect they would be better at it. There was one goof mentioned that has me puzzled. The goof on this site mentions a point where an elder is wearing a more modern suit when they are meeting behind a barn. When I first saw him in that scene I thought so too. Later there was a close up of him and while the tie is modern, the rest of his clothes aren't. I think its more likely that its an intentional foreshadowing element. Or maybe its just a tie."
"ackstasis","8","3","4","21 July 2006"," Definitely Underrated! **(NO SPOILERS)**
","This film is hardly a horror movie. In fact, I'm certain it was never really meant to be. Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) is a master at creating his own fairy-tale worlds, and his films are wreathed in beauty and symbolism.<br/><br/>This film is certainly a beautiful one. The art design is fitting, and James Newton Howard's musical score is beyond perfect. The film moves slowly, as it must to achieve this level of beauty. I believe this is why the film is often misunderstood- many watched it expecting to see a quick-paced, terrifying suspenseful thriller (not unlike the brilliant 'The Sixth Sense') but, instead, were met with something quite different.<br/><br/>I will not delve into any details about the plot or the characters, since I think it would be better off to approach this film with as little prior knowledge as possible. Just don't go expecting a genuinely scary thriller, because it's not what you'll get. If you keep an open mind, you might just see something even better!"
"blanche-2","7","3","4","7 April 2006"," odd movie from Shyamalan but has his touch nonetheless
","I had no idea what to expect from M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village,"" since I had heard nothing but awful things about it. It wasn't awful; there was a lot good in it, as Shyamalan, unlike some, is a thoughtful filmmaker. I don't think he's the man with the problem. I think it's his audience. They go, as they did in Signs, expecting to see a scary alien movie and are disappointed. With Shymamalan, it's never what's on the surface; it's always what lies beneath. And no matter the plot, what lies beneath an M. Night Shyamalan film is spirituality and some of life's fundamental questions.<br/><br/>The question here is: Can we really isolate ourselves from evil? A little village, bordered by a forest that contains some sort of evil creatures, is threatened when the creatures, for the first time, seem to be encroaching on the citizens' territory. When a near tragedy strikes, one of them (Bryce Dallas Howard) must go through those woods into the town - something never done.<br/><br/>There are some scary scenes, to be sure, but Shyamalan for me is never about the scary scenes so I'm not going to object that ""The Village"" wasn't terrifying enough. What I will say is that it does not have the pacing of his other films. It is drawn out with some slow patches in which nothing happens. Atmosphere is one thing, and it has plenty of that - but when that's all there is, a little judicious editing is called for.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind Ivy, seems to have inherited the family acting talent - she is a real find and does a marvelous job with a large and difficult role. Joaquin Phoenix as well is very good. And then there are the actors with whom I was young - Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt - class casting for sure, and the two pros give beautiful performances. Hurt is really making a niche for himself as a character actor. Weaver is still beautiful enough to play leads if she can get cast in one. Broadway star Cherry Jones seems to be a favorite of Shyamalan's, and she is again on hand in a small role. To cast even a bit part with a double Tony award winner shows good taste.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody has had an odd career since his Oscar win. I advise him and Halle Berry, while we're at it, to get new agents. He plays what can best be described here as the village idiot. At first, I thought the character had Tourette's syndrome - well, there was something wrong anyway, and while I suppose he was good, I agree with one of the posters. He was annoying - a manic in a sea of soft-talking, well-mannered people.<br/><br/>Be advised - M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make horror films. Strange sometimes, surprising, spiritual, romantic. But the aliens et al are just bogeymen asking us to confront what needs to be confronted."
"tiomkin","8","3","4","15 July 2005"," It's all about our expectations.
","After seeing previous Shyamalan films, I'm a little dumbfounded that I did not see this one coming either. Shyamalan seems pretty savy at using audience expectations. It puts him in pretty extraordinary film company (Hitchcock, etc.).<br/><br/>What is wonderful about this film is many of the same things that are also wonderful about ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"". Scenes that are given time to develop. A certain rhythm. Untold mysteries that never quite get explained.<br/><br/>And really quite wonderful to see such a powerful performance by William Hurt, who has been missing in action for awhile.<br/><br/>Well, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" or ""Sixth Sense"" because you had about given up on film making of that order, you will not be disappointed by ""The Village""."
"AndyVanScoyoc","8","3","4","22 June 2005"," M. Night Shyamalan outdid himself this time... **Spoilers**
","I will start this review off by saying that I am NOT a fan of the work of M. Night Shyamalan. In my opinion, he relies too heavily on the ""essence"" of the unexpected and the end result are stories that are only mildly eerie, but not as effective as I'm certain he planned.<br/><br/>With that said, yes I was one of those irritating people that did not enjoy ""The Sixth Sense"" because I had it figured out from the very beginning. I picked up on the major giveaway right from the get go and therefore, the rest of the movie was a bore for me. ""Unbreakable"" nearly bored me to tears and I can't tell you when I was so disenchanted by a movie as I was with ""Signs."" However, I decided to give ""The Village a chance, and am glad that I did. The imagery that M. Night creates with the 19th century village seemingly lost in time, sort of a ""Witness,"" from a suspense movie maker's viewpoint is both chilling and strikingly realistic. Not many times have I believed in a character as I did in Ivy Walker (played with stunning realism by Bryce Dallas Howard) and I found myself creeped out far more by the people of the village than I was with what could possibly be out in the woods. Ivy Walker though, is the innocence of what humans are and one can't help but feel every pain she feels and see the world in a different light through her sightless eyes. I am not, in any way a fan of Adrien Brody, but he must also be commended for a job well done as the simple, bumbling, but oh so human, Noah Percy.<br/><br/>The movie is not fast paced and those who expect non stop thrills and chills will be sorely let down. However, if you pay close attention to the film, you will see that each scene as it unfolds is necessary to the story, to why the elders of the village are as guarded as they are and why it is imperative that they ""keep secrets"" as Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) accuses his mother, Alice (Sigourney Weaver) of.<br/><br/>I must admit that I did not expect the twist at the end of the movie and that led to my feeling that M. Night did actually outdo himself with this film. In all of his other movies I ""saw"" the end nearly from the beginning of the movie, and was disappointed before it ever arrived.<br/><br/>Being a professional author, a storyline is important for me, with a work of this caliber. Your blood and guts or schlock movies, one doesn't always expect a great storyline and that's not what brings the crowd in, but for a thriller/suspense movie, a storyline that grabs the watcher is imperative. Mr. Shyamalan has succeeded in doing so with this movie and I give him all proper respect.<br/><br/>M. Night weaves a brilliant storyline in this movie, absolutely brilliant and I would highly suggest this movie, if for no other reason, than simply for the stunning storyline."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","3","4","1 February 2005"," My Sixth Sense and All Signs tell me to wait for the next M Night's film on the Unbreakable DVD somewhere in The Village
","My husband and I have seen M Night Shyamalan's most famous four films together, and our opinions were very much the same until we saw ""The Village"" about a week ago. We both loved ""The Sixth Sense"" so much than when ""Unbreakable"" was released, we rushed to see it on the opening weekend. We liked it but not as much as TSS. After we saw ""Signs"", we both decided that we were not going to see Shyamalan's movies in the theater. We waited for ""The Village"" DVD and managed not to know anything about the big twist in the end. To make the long story short, he did not like ""The Village"" and would watch the next Shyamalan's movie when it comes on the network. As for me, I went from dismissal - ""where on earth did he hear people talk like that?"" to ""is this guy as retarded as Brody's character?"" to ""he sure knows how to make a nice looking film"" to ""hey, it is not a horror movie at all"", to ""the idea is really interesting and goes way beyond this movie"" to ""if he only had a sense of humor and did not take his films so seriously"" to ""if only the final result would match the original idea"" - and here where I finally stay. I keep thinking about the film and I find it intriguing, interesting but flawed and often laughable where it did not mean to be. That's what Shyamalan misses, IMO - all his heroes are the pale lifeless shadows, life seems to be drawn out of them. In some of his films, it works, but most of the time, I could care less what happens to them. Besides, even his avid fans mention holes in the plot, and huge ones, I assure you. The whole concept of ""The Village"" is holding on the girl's blindness. Take it away and what do you have? The nice cinematography and music, the good actors who had not much to play, the Brody's character who made me laugh hysterically every time he was on the screen and I don't believe that was the writer/director's intentions, the moody atmosphere (again, I've been in his atmosphere, all his films have it), and sometimes, ridiculous dialogs. <br/><br/>I think, I will wait for the next Shyamalan's film's DVD and I believe ""The Village"" is better than ""Signs"" but inferior to ""The Sixth Sense"". I also believe that he was on the top of his game when he told the story of one little boy's struggle with his gift/curse and not when he tries to embrace the global problems. <br/><br/>The Village 6.5/10 The Signs 4/10 The Sixth Sense 9/10 Unbreakable 7/10"

","This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I love the way Night makes his movies they are always original and creative. He makes you really care about the characters and you hope they will be OK... the ending was great though most people didn't like it. I can't wait until his next film. If you want to watch a good movie this is it. Scary,creative,chilling,original these are just some of the words that describe this film. Go get it on DVD it's great. The DVD contains a old movie that Night did when her was just a kid, it's like indiana jones its pretty funny. Night is my favorite director and will remain my favorite because he never disappoints he makes great films."

","What can one say about M. Night Shymalan? Perhaps, ""Wow I never saw that coming!"" or ""Jeez! That was completely OBVIOUS!"". He basically had no grey shades. You love him or hate him... I was a lot closer to hate from the beginning.<br/><br/>If what I say is true and I do hate him than why to I continuously give his films a chance? Perhaps it's the pedigree of his actors (Mel Gibson. Sam Jackson, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, recently Paul Giamatti.) But I'm thinking it's his uncanny ability of creating an interesting premise... unfortunately his talent goes limp from there. The story of 'The Village' centers around just that: A village. Run by a council known as the elders, the town is constrained to a wooded boundary, outside of which there lie ""Those Who Shall Not Be Spoken Of"" who run around in red robes.<br/><br/>Soon, the plucky blind girl of the town must venture past the woods to another town. WHY? Her lover is sick and she's going to get better medicines. First, however, she must have something revealed about not only the town, but also about what lies beyond the village. This is a film where every performance is lackluster and every word is less believable than the next. It's one of the worst films in recent memory."

Most critics love Sixth Sense, and dismiss everything after that.. well, I hated Sixth Sense. He tells you upfront that Bruce Willis DIES and yet people are surprised? I felt this thought the whole movie, why is Bruce Willis's character an angel? He died. Are Americans that dumb? <br/><br/>So, He releases The Village, which is 100% correct on the assessment of how the government treats the 'common people' or 'masses'. We know better that you, so trust us. Don't think outside the box. The truth is, this movie, with the amazing actors and actresses, and plot reveal, and political commentary, is the best memorable movie I can think of in the last 20 years. Later in history we will see more people respecting this movie. Honestly, It is M. Night Shyamalan's Opus. I've seen all his movies and this is the masterpiece that is HIGHLY UNDER-RESPECTED. I guarantee you, that if he would have released this movie in 2017, it would have been nominated for SO MANY Oscars!

"pfgpowell-1","6","4","6","2 October 2008"," Thoroughly entertaining but by no means a masterpiece
","The various reviews of The Village by IMDb members follow the usual - and I am bound to say, rather unchivalrously - American pattern: it seems this is regarded either as a work of quite unparallelled genius (as in 'this week's work of quite unparallelled genius') or it stinks so much to heaven that it's a wonder the writer, director and chief bottle washer dares show his face in public. But that's the Americans for you: never like to do anything by halves. This rather reserved - Americans might say buttoned up, but they would be wrong - Brit thinks The Village is a rather entertaining, well-made horror flick, but which, at the end of the day, pulls is punches. In hindsight, the plot is so full of holes, if it were a fishing net, a shark would have no trouble escaping. But that is in hindsight: while you are watching, from the spooky opening funeral to the final scene, its rather good, very entertaining, will quite often send a pleasant chill down your spine and will keep you guessing right until the end. It is, in fact, a difficult film to write about because revealing only one of the plot twists would rather spoil the viewing of someone who is seeing it for the first time. So just let me repeat: there are twists aplenty and anyone who knows where it will all end at any point is a better man than I am. The saintly Roger Ebert gave it a very sniffy review when it was first released in 2004, and although I understand the points he raise, his judgement does seem unnecessarily stern. (And his judgement might well be questioned by asking just how much attention he was paying. He did, after all, get one plot point very wrong. The village idiot was the heroine's brother, not just some unrelated village idiot.) Certainly, this has more in common with a shaggy dog story than Macbeth, but then who says that is a crime. Look, I'm struggling to describe this film without giving anything away. Every time I think of a point, I realise that making it might ruin the film for the first-time viewer. So just let me end by saying that everyone from Joaquin Phoenix through Ron Howard's daughter to William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver acquits themselves well, Roger Deakins photography is, as usual, great, and even if the film does, in a way, cheat by (at least to this viewer) by making out it is raising a few quite interesting moral points, only to drop them one by one unceremoniously without a second thought, you could do a lot worse than spend 103 minutes watching The Village. Expect a solid piece of entertainment, not a masterpiece."
"MaxBorg89","8","4","6","18 June 2008"," Not a masterpiece, but well executed and better than they want you to believe
","After a seemingly invincible double hit consisting of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan hit a slightly false note with Signs, which is quite good but was strongly criticized nonetheless, mostly for its admittedly weak ending. The Village seems to continue in that direction, at least according to the majority of critics (Roger Ebert's review was particularly harsh). The reason I said ""seems"" is because The Village is a competent, enjoyable movie - not a masterwork, and occasionally less accomplished than Signs, but still undisputed proof of Shyamalan's gift as a storyteller.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from those preceding it is the setting: the titular village is located somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the date is the 19th Century. The village, inhabited by the elders, their children and grandchildren, is surrounded by woods, and no one is allowed to enter them. Why? Because the woods are supposedly populated by Those We Do Not Speak Of, some kind of monstrous breed that won't attack the villagers unless directly provoked. They occasionally show up after dark, and they're repulsed by the color red.<br/><br/>Among the people living in the village who deserve to be mentioned are Lucius Fox (Joaquin Phoenix), a brave young man who doesn't fear the creatures like everyone else, and Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind girl with whom he has a special bond. When Lucius suddenly falls ill (to reveal more would spoil the fun), Ivy volunteers to travel to the city to find medicine, unafraid of defying whatever's hiding in the woods. Amongst the general protest, her father (William Hurt) expresses his approval with a cryptic phrase that gains significance as the story progresses.<br/><br/>A slow start notwithstanding, Shyamalan manages to create a sense of quiet dread very quickly, thanks to expert use of camera angles, cinematography, and of course James Newton Howard's tunes. Subtly evoking The Wicker Man with its atmosphere, The Village drags the viewer into a different world, an uncontaminated society devoid of any real evil. In that sense, the film is a clever twist on the utopia genre: generally, these worlds exist in the future, not the past.<br/><br/>However, that's not the kind of twist we expect from the director, and that's where the film's major disappointment reveals itself: the usual shocking final revelation is practically spoon-fed to the audience halfway through, not to mention delivered as flatly as is humanly possible. This does detract from the twist's impact, but it doesn't diminish its intelligence: taken on its own, it's worth comparing to the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.<br/><br/>Then there's the cast, another partial misfire: although Hurt is warm and reassuring, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver have practically nothing significant to do in the film, and Adrien Brody's demented role is nothing but a contrived plot device. On the flip-side, Phoenix is very good (the scene where Lucius tells Ivy how he feels about her is the most touching tender moment Shyamalan's filmed), and Howard, cast without an audition after the director saw her in a stage play (he didn't know she was related to former Happy Days star Ron Howard), is mesmerizing: playing her first major part without much experience (a few cameos in her dad's movies don't really count), she portrays Ivy as good-hearted and a little naive but never stupid, which is why she manages to hold the entire second half of the picture on her shoulders pretty much flawlessly.<br/><br/>Bottom line: quit nagging about the ending. As I said in my review of The Sixth Sense, a good conclusion is no big thing if the overall movie disappoints. Well, the opposite applies too: a sub-par epilogue doesn't completely ruin an otherwise fine film.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","I loved this movie! The tone and mood were staged beautifully. Without knowing where your headed at first you get swept up into a fantastic story that keeps you guessing throughout and until the end. I loved the characters, and felt for them every step of the way. The tensions was just right without overpowering the plot. And I did not expect what the twist would be, but it was amazing. It really makes you think. But I was very satisfied, as I believe everyone will be after seeing this movie. (That is if their not just going in for a cheap thrill. Which is unfortunately what some people expect after having seen The Sixth Sense. And that's a shame because M. Night Shymalan is a great story crafter.) I would describe this movie as an intellectually stimulating piece of art."
"paul_tremblay","6","4","6","20 May 2005"," Metaphor of a culture of fear...
","The year, 2004, how to create a lie, an alternate reality? One of the deleted scenes (from the DVD) includes a drill in which Walker (William Hurt) rings the alarm bell and everyone scatter back to their houses and hid underground. In the finished product, there is such a scene (not a drill) where a creature intrudes in the village and the same bell has everybody running to the basement. The scene is reminiscent of a 40s or 50s government drill (remember the black and white clips in which children jump under school desks and entire families gather into anti-nuclear shelters?) Another deleted scene has Noah's father his family about the murder of his brothers, blaming it on the creatures, then claims that this is not to frighten them, just to ""inform you"".<br/><br/>The theatrical version had already enough information for us to conclude that there is a negative nudge towards, not only the 50s, but also the present White House administration: the creation of fear, of an enemy, the blaming of another (the other) for your own mistakes, the elaboration of a propaganda campaign in order to submit a population to your agenda. Isn't't the forbidden color, red, is also reminiscent of communism.<br/><br/>The Village then reveals us that it was all a farce, a hoax created to keep the good citizens of the place into both ignorance and seclusion.<br/><br/>Two points here: One, the deleted scenes make the movie even more subversive, so I assume they have been discarded for a political reason. Secondly, how not to see the symbol of storytelling and ""true story"" as manipulative techniques of persuasion, to ""inform"" with lies. Actually, Walker says of Noah's death the ""he made our story real."" You do not need reality to make a story, just a credible series of facts that you connect accordingly with a made-up context. Remind you of anybody lately?<br/><br/>In a more aesthetic level, is the movie at the level of what you should expect of the director of The Sixth Sense? No, the ""revelations"" to Walker's daughter are laughable and anti-climatic at best. But it is unfair to compare with such an ingenious work of art. <br/><br/>Recommended."

"crueltwistoffate","10","4","6","18 January 2005"," where's the love?
","There are films that come out that live up to all the hype and leave you with such a lasting impact that your somehow changed by them. The Village is that type of film to. The Village is the 3rd horror/thriller from writer/director M.Night Shyamalan following his mega hit ""Signs"". Well after The Village came out I noticed a strange pattern to Shyamalan's film...he makes the more mainstream film then he follows it up with a more personal artistic thriller that the public never quite gets. Well this pattern was proved correct so far when The Village didn't live up to the hype that was set by Signs. Is that Shyamalan's fault that the average person isn't smart enough to get his more personal artistic thriller? You damn right it is. If this film is too smart for you people then go watch Charlie's Angels or something because your official brain dead.<br/><br/>Script wise...God,Shyamalan is my hero here. Not only is he a master story teller but he makes me(a person who really hates dramas) really dig the drama of the film. This isn't your standard thriller, this is a more dramatic classic horror story then a thriller. This film is about characters...not the damn creatures. The creatures serve the plot but...they are NOT the plot. That's important. Here we grow to know the people in the village and understand them and their fears. It's that understanding of the characters that gives the film it's REAL TERROR. If you don't spend time with the characters and get to care about them...then what's the point of putting them in danger when we don't even care. Hollywood makes so many horror movies. They make film after film with stick figure characters that get put through hell that you only really watch to see them die. Here Shyamalan crafts a perfect tale of love and then tests that love put putting it through terror. This film is about humanity and how they are willing to deal with things beyond their control. The characters here are so well written and the story so well played out that you just can't help but to love it. Then there's the spoken words... god, they're so poetic that it's gives the film a real fair tale feel that takes this film to a whole other level. To hear the characters talk is just amazing to hear...it's masterful. I loved hearing every line and I never wanted the film to end. Then I really loved the way the film was structured. This film has it's own of telling it's story and of back tracking so you understand what's going much better. What I also liked was the morals of the film...the Elders of the village started the village to get away from the horror of society but human natured proved that the horror they thought they left behind still found them. It's amazing to watch.<br/><br/>Cast wise...Oh my god. Talk about an all star cast. And I just don't mean because they're big name actors...no it's because they're all great actors and bring real class to the film. First you have the star, Bryce Dallas Howard, and I do mean star...not only because she stars in this film, but because she carries this whole film. She's the daughter of former TV star and award wining director Ron Howard...but here Bryce breaks the hold by being a real actress and not just a girl who's trying to act just because her Dad is famous. Here, Bryce brings so much to her role as Ivy Walker that with just a movement of her eyes she can send your heart beating. God, she's an amazing actress and is so natural with the setting.She has this down to earth personality that you really care about and cheer for. Give me an hour and a half with Bryce and you can keep your slutty Lohan and big butt J Lo. I'd rather watch a real actress any day. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always and really under plays his own personality and gives the character of Lucius a real sense of reality that never goes away. Another thing I like is that the actors brought so much to their characters then I'm sure was in the script. Another great surprise was Adrien Brody who plays the ill Noah Percy who through out the film is amazing. At first glance you think he's just playing the village crazy but if you really pay attention you'll see there is more to his craze then what meets the eye. There's a reason why he acts the way he does and when it's revealed...it's amazing.<br/><br/>Directing wise...wow.Shyamalan delivers more than I ever thought he could. He delivers a lot of movement to the camera and a voyeur way of shooting that makes us feel more personal with the film. This film is master story telling at it's best. Shyamalan really keeps up the amazing script with an even more amazing way of telling the story. There's there's the SINGLE SHOT scenes that left me in awe. God, talk about amazing. They were done so well that we felt the same danger that many of the characters felt. Not only does he use the camera to tell the story but he also uses every trick in film make it to use it to tell an even better film. There some scenes were everything goes silent and with the film's directing...it impacts you harder.Shyamalan is the first director I've seen to really use sfx to his talent. <br/><br/>At the end of the film, I was left with an impact in my deepest core. I LOVE THIS FILM. This film is the type of film I want to make. This film is the bar for me and if I could make a film just half as good then I could die a happy film maker."

I completely fell for the story, and just let the movie take me wherever it was going, it was a very nice experience. I was often scared, and sometimes moved. I almost cried when Noah was killed. I liked the reflection on how much should you protect your children from the ""real"" world, even at the cost of their own lives. It makes you think that you cannot shield yourself from the bad and try to live in a ""perfect' world, as madness, sadness and pain are a part of life. You got to deal with it sooner or later.

"Krabat_v2","8","4","6","14 September 2004"," A masterpiece and Shyamalan's best so far
","This movie is for you if you, like me, loved Signs. These two movies are very much alike, especially if you compare them to The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Of Shyamalan's movies I saw Signs first and I was impressed with how he makes you think he's telling you a story about Aliens and corn circles and it's really about something else. (Trying not to give anything away here) The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable seemed kind of simple after that. Yeah, they were nice to watch, they had their twist endings but they just didn't have that emotional side I like so much about Signs.<br/><br/>But now let's get to The Village. From the trailers I didn't really expect to see a movie like Signs, I was more expecting a Sleepy Hollow kind of experience. Boy was I wrong. Sure, it's creepy and it works much better at keeping suspense up than some people want to make you believe. But there's much more to this movie.<br/><br/>First of all I've got to say that when watching The Village it was the first time since I don't know when that I felt I was watching a piece of art, not just a flick that wants to entertain. The images Shyamalan shows us are just beautiful. The colors, the composition are right away amazing. At some points in the film I actually felt like I was watching a painting come alive. What also adds to the art is the music. If you are at all interested in classical music or movie scores you will not be able to get this solo violin out of your head. When I first heard it I knew I had to get my hands on that score.<br/><br/>OK, so the movie is presented in a nice way. But is it any good? Yes it is. It is IF (and I can't stress this if enough) you liked Signs, you don't want to see exactly what the trailer seems to promise and you don't mind slow films. 'Cause slow it is. Not in a bad way though. Shyamalan just takes his time to build up his characters and to create an authentic almost tangible atmosphere. In that he's supported by a great cast, especially Phoenix and Howard. Phoenix is good as usual but Howard just blew my mind. They start you off into a story that begins as a horror movie but then evolves into something far deeper and far more emotional. And if you let that happen to you, if you don't just sit there and wait to be scared you will really love this movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10 because Shyamalan totally achieves what he tried to do in this film. You just shouldn't think it's about scares and twists."

"SO_HIGH","1","11","23","3 March 2005"," What can I see... Skip it
","Let me start off by saying I like The Sixth Sense it was a good movie even if you knew the secret it was still a good movie. The story was built on character development and good development of plot. The Village however lacked everything. Let me start out by saying that this movie is a knock off of another story written about 3 years ago and you know what that story was dumb then and its dumb now. I hated this film from the beginning. When I think of a guy whose name utters ""one trick pony"" M. Night Shyamalan, I mean come on people the guy needs to stop making this boring ""thrillers"" and try to branch out not every movie can have an ""exciting twist"" to it. So the film follows a bunch of people living in an isolated village, (that doesn't seem to be from any time period) hmm... I wonder what could be going on just from that comment any one with half a brain can guess this plot I watched the film for 5 minutes and I new how this one was going to end. The work seemed to lack the flare that Shyamalan had in the Sixth Sense it also seemed to be on of his most boring films yet. He doesn't even really give the audience a chance to get to know or like the characters. Right off the bat we see that a child has died because the ""Village lacks medication"" that can save the boys life and we are supposed to pity these poor folks, come on now, Plus we meet the boring cast of characters the first one I'll call THE CYBORG aka Joaquin Phoenix if there was a film about a guy with no emotions and seems to play it off very well it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Keanu Reeves geez can any one say WOOD. He gives his performance with almost no incentive its like hi I'm here where my paycheck and Joaquin Phoenix is a pretty good actor in other films like Buffalo Soldiers and Quills but his performance seemed wooden. The there's the ""Mentally Challenged Character"" sorry Brody but I'm not even going to point out how you ruined this one ""one hint though there a difference between being mentally challenged and being stupid and Brody performance was stupid. Adding shame to the handicap is the ""blind girl"" who the audience is supposed to pity THE only pity I had for her was that she was in this movie. The movie seemed to trudge on and on and on. At one point we are seeing one of the lamest wedding sequences I have ever seen the next moment we see a character stabbed I mean if you wanted to steal someone else story at least steal a good one. The next person who deserves the (Holy crap you bored the audience to death award) would be William Hurt (Mr. Gonzo himself) he seems to be bored out of his mind to the point where he doesn't even care about the movie he like a talking prop through out the film. There a moment in the film when the audience is supposed to feel bad for Kitty walker whose just been dumped as she confesses true love. I couldn't help but laugh then I notice the entire audience was laughing that called bad storytelling I mean when someone tries to hard for one of those ""hall mark"" moments it seems to be another gag on the blooper reel Shyamalan. So I hope you all enjoy The Garbage I mean Village because all you stuck in the I'm a Bi+ch to the blockbuster need to get out and expand your mind. *out****"

","This movie was terrible! And yes it had nice photography. With a budget of $65M you can afford good technicians and a great DOP, but that doesn't help you out of your story. The only discovery at the end is that Shyamalan is just another Hollywood director trying to seduce an audience. And even if he was good with actors in other films, in this one they are stiff and boring. There is no character development and for the most part 'I saw dead people'. The movie was based on a child book ""Running Out of Time"". Unfortunately, they've adapted the story for a public of 6-year-olds. If you want to be frustrated and disappointed, go waste your money on this pore excuse for a movie."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","7","13","11 August 2007"," When a Retard Loves a Woman (spoilers throughout)
","M. Night Shyamalan is such a frustrating director. Here's a man with a few of the skills necessary to be an exceptional filmmaker  he has a good eye, an ability to create mood and he usually comes up with interesting concepts  but he keeps throwing it away on pieces of rubbish. He just can't seem to shake off The Sixth Sense  he goes to the well over and over and over again.<br/><br/>But what makes it even worse is Shyamalan's inflated self-opinion. He really does think he's making works of art rather than disposable fluff. He really does thinks he's an auteur rather than a hack. He really does think he's some sort of magician rather than a con artist. There really is nothing to his films. All he can do is try and attempt to pull the wool over your eyes.<br/><br/>Now I guess someone could look at The Village and say its some sort of comment on modern society  look at the way these people have isolated themselves and tried to revert back to a simpler way of life. Or they could argue that it's a typical post 9/11 work. Those We Don't Speak Of (the monsters who surround the woods) could represent a raised fear of outsiders. This is a community that fears it's under constant threat of attack. But all of this would be to give Shyamalan far too much credit. He simply wants to try and give us a few scares and shout, Robot Chicken-like, 'What a twist!' <br/><br/>I guess he also wants to pull our heartstrings, but the love story here is laboured and unconvincing. We have a blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard  who actually is rather good) falling in love with Joaquin Phoenix (who seems to be comatose). But not only do they have little chemistry, but Phoenix is stabbed halfway through the film by a ridiculous retard (played by Adrien Brody), meaning that it's almost impossible to invest in their relationship.<br/><br/>Having said this, the couple do get one enjoyable moment. There's a scene early on where Those We Don't Speak Of attack the village. Ivy (Howard) stands in the doorway, holding out her hand for Lucius (Phoenix). For an agonising amount of time her hand remains empty, and the monster outside is getting closer, but at the last moment Lucius appears and takes her to safety. It's all shot in slow-motion and it has a poetry to it that the rest of the film sorely lacks. If only Shaymalan could create moments like this more consistently.<br/><br/>But when you think about it the film basically revolves around a resentful half-wit. Here we have a guy who has the hots for Ivy, but because he can't have her, tries to kill her beau instead. So then Ivy has to scramble through the woods to find medicine for her love. And apart from the crap twist, that's it. Therefore I think The Village should be retitled When a Retard Loves a Woman. It's an instruction on not to let horny half-wits try and fall in love with you  the film shows us that the consequences are disastrous.<br/><br/>But such is Shaymalan's pomposity that he tries to turn the half-wit's demise into a tragedy. You see, after we're told that the village is actually set in the here and now and that Those We Don't Speak Of are really men in suits, the imbecile, seemingly by magic or lacklustre writing, appropriates one of these suits and follows Ivy into the woods. He terrifies her a little bit but the cunning lass leads him into a trap and kills him. In his final shot we see him lying broken on the floor, his face revealed and his body still covered by the costume. Shaymalan obviously wants to show us that he's become half man half beast  look at how the horn has corrupted this poor imbecile  and asks us to feel pity, but I couldn't care less. The moron got what he deserved.<br/><br/>However, I must point out that the village idiot is actually present in one the film's other good scenes. The moment when he stabs Lucius is well filmed. I like the way the camera creeps up on Lucius as his back is turned to the moron. You know something is going to happen and you're expecting a typical Shaymalan cheap shot. But instead there's no attempt to make you jump. Simply the next thing you know Lucius has a knife in his belly. And it's a bit of a surprise, when Lucius falls to the floor, that the idiot continues stabbing him. It's quite brutal for a PG-13.<br/><br/>But although this is quite well done, everything else is poorly handled. The twist, for instance, comes far too early and lands with a dull thud. Plus, to find out that Those We Don't Speak Of are men in suits at such an early juncture renders the final third without tension. Of course, Shaymalan tries to suggest that there actually might be real monsters in the woods, but it's a feeble effort to try and keep our interest.<br/><br/>Then you have Shaymalan turning up himself in an acting role. Just hearing his squeaky, obnoxious voice is enough to bring me out in hives. You can feel the arrogance and the self-importance seeping from every poorly delivered line. When did this guy get it in his head that he can act? He can't. He makes Roger Moore look like Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>Plus Shaymalan think he's a talented writer. He's not. Structurally the film's a mess and all the dialogue is stilted and juvenile. And somehow he manages to wrest an awful performance from Sigourney Weaver  something I thought was impossible. If only Shaymalan left the writing to others and stopped being so precious he might make a serviceable hack."
"dbdumonteil","7","7","13","24 August 2004"," a forest... (the Cure)
","SPOILERS...<br/><br/>Because of great movies shot these last years such as the indispensable ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999), a new film by M Night Shyamalan is always eagerly awaited. After ""Signs"" (2002), ""the Village"" was launched in 2004 and oddly, it somewhat disappoints without we know very well why. You come out of the projection with a certain bitter taste. Why?<br/><br/>However, a spectator who would neglect the qualities that this film contains would be someone with a lack of judgment. M Night Shyamalan's making is still as sumptuous and his work is scattered with strong moments like the scene when Adrien Brody wounds Joaquin Phoenix. Moreover, the director often succeeds in making us jump. There's also a magnificent photography that reflects well the colors of the fall and it is quite easy to detect in the nocturnal sequences a careful work on the light. To go on, ""the Village"" has got two common point with Shyamalan's previous work, ""Signs"": a will to use special effects at a minimum and the fact that this village is located in the heart of a deep forest supposedly haunted really gives the impression to be ""In Camera"", just like in ""Signs"" with Mel Gibson's farm. At last, to write his screenplay, we can conclude that the director, in the first part, essentially drew from ""Witness"" (1985), a movie by Peter Weir while the second part when Bryce Dallas Howard disappears into the woods, quite obviously recalls ""the Blair Witch Project"" (1999). All these assets reveal M Night Shyamalan's will to distinguish himself very clearly from the Hollywood influence. All of this would be perfect if there weren't any faults and sadly there are some in this film.<br/><br/>First, Shyamalan couldn't avoid one of the traps that the topic was tending: the stereotyped characters, it is the case with Adrien Brody whom we can consider the mad man of the village. Then, one of the strongest points in the previous works shot by this talented filmmaker partly lied on excellent performances from all the actors which created a sort of harmony. In ""the Village"", I must admit that the performance remains patchy: William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard manage well but Joaquin Phoenix is rather inexpressive. As for Sigourney Weaver, I read that she was so much excited by the script that she had sleepless nights but I think she has only a minor role. Furthermore, the beginning of the film is labored in the way the director lingers on the presentation of the main characters in the village which delays the beginning of the plot.<br/><br/>Now what to say about the outcome? Like Alfred Hitchcock, M Night Shyamalan understood that in a detective film to make the suspense last, nothing must be disclosed until the end of a film, the surprise will only be bigger. Besides, he had insisted that the journalists didn't reveal the end of the story. Personally, I can't make up my mind whether the outcome is stunning or poor. In a way, it is stunning if you take care of what Hurt says at the end of the movie and so, the whole story makes sense. But it can also be considered as poor for the spectators who expected to watch a fantastic movie and it can explain why most people felt disappointment about ""the Village"". On IMDB, the popularity rating is only 6,4 out of 10.<br/><br/>But we can opt for another interpretation. Maybe M Night Shyamalan wanted to play with the spectator and to laugh at him by leading him on wrong tracks and revealing him that the supposedly haunted forest is just a pure invention from William Hurt. Roughly, the film can be taken for a farce.<br/><br/>You will be able, according to your mood, find the end of the movie and even the whole movie, clever or poor. One last thing, there's no denying that in spite of plenty of obvious qualities, M Night Shyamalan's works are getting less and less appealing. I can only wish this: that he recovers"
"mr_vercetti_69","1","12","26","5 July 2005"," traumatizing
","The village is possibly the most disappointing film i've ever seen. immediately the audience is deterred by the disastrous script at which one finds himself/herself cringing at the hap-hazard attempts at older Pennsylvanian speech (which can be explained by the conclusion - but we don't know that while we're subjected to hearing it!). <br/><br/>Added to this is how pathetically ""those we do not speak of"" (a title which contends in idiocy with the ""younglings"" of Star Wars episode III) are presented to the audience; besides looking like inside out fish with porcupine spines the techniques used to create tension around them is unoriginal and ineffective. Such clichéd methods as passing an image quickly across the screen accompanied by a spontaneous loud noise does nothing more than wake the audience members who have already fallen asleep.<br/><br/>If this isn't bad enough, the film loses all credibility with lines the would be more appropriately suited to Scooby Doo, such as when Noah claims that she will be protected by magic rocks - come on! <br/><br/>The actors' contribution hardly helps to lift this cinematic tragedy out of the hole into which it was sure to fall. Adrien Brody, whose performance I have never before been dissatisfied by, cannot distinguish whether his character has Downs or is simply mad, and needless to say neither can the audience. <br/><br/>If there's one film you see this summer make sure its not this one for you will be utterly disgusted and disappointed and most likely to such an extent that you will decide not to get one next season."

The story is a little ridiculous. The script was pretty well of inferior quality. The direction was of the amateur level.

"the-evil-cult","10","6","11","8 August 2007"," Don't Believe the Trailer. It is a Noble Lie.
","The Village is about a group of people who isolate themselves, similar to the Amish. They have been told that there are creatures around them. Fear grips the community when dead animals are found all around them and they hear noises coming from the woods.<br/><br/>We later learn this is not the case at all. The monsters that surround the village are fake. Everything is an elaborate hoax perpetuated by the elders designed to keep the villagers from leaving. It is done to keep the villagers' way of life alive, to protect their culture.<br/><br/>I didn't watch this movie in the cinema where it was perfectly quiet or on DVD where I could read subtitles, but instead I watched it on TV, so sometimes it was difficult to hear the actors talk. In most if not all Shyamalan films, characters tend to talk very quietly, often whispering. This I don't think is a problem if there is enough silence in the room.<br/><br/>This is not a horror movie like House of Wax where we are served endless blood, gore, and homicides, all delivered with sudden music swells during moments of silence to shock the audience. I thought the mood was creepy and throughout the film there was a mild feeling of anxiety, but no masked killer will appear from nowhere to make you jump in your seat and there will be no over-the-top torture scenes to make you cringe like in Hostel.<br/><br/>One member of IMDb, bartond57, gave what I believe is a very good commentary on the film: ""I felt is was a story about the power of myth, and how far people will go, even for good reasons, to perpetuate their myth. Innocence is a topic as well. How does one keep people innocent and trusting in a evil, sinful, world. And how far should someone go to 'protect' one's innocence? I grew up in a conservative religious subculture. This movie speaks to that experience. In the end, the decision by the elders was to continue their myth, regardless of the circumstances. I found this disappointing, but how true is it today with many religions? Religion can be a good thing, but it is always a struggle to know how much 'innocence' should be protected. How sheltered should we be? But even in the movie, the evil they were trying to run from (murders) took place in their own edenic setting. In other words, we can't run away from human nature. It is part of the human condition."" <br/><br/>I feel the same way. The movie says a lot about how much of a role deception plays in keeping communities together. It reminds me of what Plato said about the Noble Lie, how the survival of a population relies on grand myths. People need to believe in ideas greater and more significant than their own individual selves or else they will descend into nihilism, which leads to chaos and a breakdown of society. These ideas are still popular in modern times with people like Strauss and even today's politicians like Wolfowitz."

","I think the reason this is such an underrated film is because people watch it expecting a horror, it has some scary moments but that's not why i like this film so much. It has fantastic performances by some of the all star cast list, not least of which William Hurt. This film highlights many flaws of the modern world and while being a bit 'black and white' it gets it's message across well. In my opinion the main point which the film is trying to get across is that innocence is a virtue and should be admired, not sneered at. Too many people today almost deliberately want to loose their innocence because it is seen as un-cool, this is a film that is very close to my heart."

It's not a good movie, nor a bad movie, but for a director of his talent it is a rather boring movie.

It would have been an excellent movie had it only consisted of music and photography. Unfortunately...there was dialog. Joachin Phoenix - who I like (and who was actually better than Russell Crowe in ""The Gladiator""), was wasted in this movie. On the other hand, Adrien Brody was perfect!! The fewer lines he delivers - the better! His Academy Award for Best Actor in ""The Pianist"" had to be the absolute worst Best Actor award ever given. (It should have been the ""Best Mumbling Award""). He does a fine job of mumbling in this film as well. As for the story, a lot of other online reviewers seem to have found it ""profound"". Oh-oh....I think I'm going to start laughing again. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to sit through the entire movie. My wife had enough after the first fifteen minutes and would have preferred to watch ""CSI"" re-runs instead. <br/><br/>My only possible take on this movie is that Shyamalan is ""goofing"" on everyone - and for this I have to give him a lot of credit.

"NotTheOne000","10","9","19","11 February 2005"," M Night: genius and subversive
","M Night Shyamalan is an allegorical director  this is the thought that must be remembered whenever you go to watch one of his films. Unbreakable, for example, is not a film about a man who realises he has super powers; it is actually a story examining the relationship between a man and his wife and son, and the relationship between the individual and his or her more general relationship with society.<br/><br/>So it is with The Village  look at the details: <br/><br/>1) All the inhabitants are white and middle or upper class. <br/><br/>2) There is no alcohol or pre-marital sex. <br/><br/>3) There is no rock or rap music or TV or internet.<br/><br/>In other words, The Village is an idealised modern gated community of the type springing up all over the US.<br/><br/>So: <br/><br/>dangerous towns = urban life <br/><br/>invented monsters = imaginary paedophiles and drug dealers <br/><br/>bad colour = blood  the obsessive fear of any kind of physical harm <br/><br/>Ivy's blindness = blindness to fear, which allows her to see what people are really like inside <br/><br/>Lucius's bravery = an ability to overcome fear, this affords him the desire to explore the world <br/><br/>The watchtowers = the creation of unnecessary security measures to further strengthen the fear needed to control the villagers <br/><br/>Noah donning the monster's robe = the real dangers often come from within our own community, and grow out of ignorance, of jealousy and even, sometimes, love.<br/><br/>One of the most significant points is made when Ivy leaves the Village and is surprised by the kindness of the young guard she meets. The only genuinely altruistic act of the entire film is carried out by a total stranger, who provides help to Ivy for no gain at risk of loosing his job. This is M Night telling us that goodness of heart does not come from indoctrination, but comes from normal human nature.<br/><br/>In other words, rather than a failed horror film with an intrusive twist at the end, The Village is actually an intelligent commentary on the lies and deceits that neo-con white middle class America is perpetrating on its youth out of unjustified fear in a desire to engineer an ideal community based on ignorance and naiveté.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has become so devoid of genuine imagination and intelligence that it can't spot genius when it is right under its nose. <br/><br/>10/10 from me."

The reason why it was so good, was because it wasn't about some maniac killer who likes to cut people up into bits and pieces, or some freak video tape that kills people. This movie is actually plausible, without containing gallons of blood, gore, or obscenities. M. Night Shyamalan mainly focuses on the storyline of the movie. That means he is not concerned most with just scaring you out of your skins. Granted, startling moments do occur, but they are in good taste. This movie is something that you could watch over and over again and still watch it as an actual movie, not something you save for Halloween(if you get my drift).

","I continue to see bad reviews for this movie and am somewhat perplexed as to the reason. I can only surmise that many viewers have missed the satirical aspects of the film and have over-looked how M. Night took blatant stabs at modern organized religion. The Village itself is a parody of any religion as it draws boundaries around people and teaches that if they ""step over the line"", there is harsh punishment, administered by an evil being. Many believe modern religion, namely Christianity, was drawn upon in order to keep the masses of an otherwise uncontrollable society in order. This idea is portrayed in this film as the village elders use the same type of tactic to keep the village children in order. Much as many religions try to shield their followers from influences that may disagree with their respective teachings, the village elders do exactly this as they prevent their children from experiencing any outside societal influences, lest they be swayed to no longer follow the belief system of the village. I encourage everyone to see this film, but see it for what it is, a religious satire, not a love story and not a horror film. Watch this movie with an open mind, regardless of your religious beliefs...you just might learn something."

The story is purely that, a romance. There are two more themes in the film which should not be overlooked. First, the preservation of innocence. The elders of the village were trying to protect the innocence of their offspring, that was their excuse for taking them to the woods. The Seconed, the idea that the elders had of not taking any evil with them. Their flaw was the village ""fool"" Noah. He was infatuated with the idea of violent creatures in the woods, and this was the root that poisoned the village. Basically, I would have to call all critics that rated this film as a poor effort, extremely pig-headed and inexperienced in reviewing movies. I am a film student, and i would highly recommend this film to any students or teachers to teach and/or study this film for story lessons, and beautiful directing.

I think there is a good movie in here somewhere. It can do without the drama. I'm sorry, I have just been looking for a good horror film lately. I'm slowly dying of my love for the genre. Sad, is it not? ""The Village"" did not satisfy me, and I cannot see how it would satisfy any other movie lover.

The movie builds up suspense, like the creatures are mad and coming, just like the previews. Then the movies turns completely in another direction. Lucius gets stabbed, and they send Ivy to get medicine. At this point they reveal the creatures aren't real, leaving you to watch the rest of the movie disappointed.

","In an undefined time and location, in a small isolated village leaded by the ancients, the villagers do not trespass the border of the surrounding forest and never use red color. The population have an old agreement with the weird and evil red dressed creatures called ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" in this regard. When the crazy Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) hurts the brave Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), his blind fiancée Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) decides to challenge the menacing creatures, allowed by her father and leader of the community Edward Walker (William Hurt), and to go to the town to get some medicine to heal the wounds and save her beloved future husband. <br/><br/>I heard so many good comments from friends of mine about ""The Village"" that my expectations of watching an excellent movie were the higher possible. Indeed, the creepy beginning of the story was very scary and intriguing, supported by a great photography and atmosphere. However, after 60, 70 minutes running time, the plot becomes very boring and does not work well, without any twist. Suddenly, the plot point is disclosed very early, ending the mystery and the reality is not a great surprise to a conscious viewer. I was quite disappointed with this promising but overrated suspenseful movie. The sound effects contribute for some scary moments, but in the end, the excellent cast that has great performance deserved a better conclusion for such a mysterious story. Further, it is hard to believe in such a plot in the Twenty-First Century. Maybe, if the story took place in the 60's or in the 70's, it would be more credible. It is also amazing to see how easy is to the leaders to control a frightened society! My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Vila"" (""The Village"")"

","I thought this movie was nothing more than good for the most part, but the twist is just to bold and leaves audiences scratching their heads and wondering how ridiculous this is instead of connecting the plot and it's twist. The whole idea of a industrial society living isolated from a modern day society is just pushing it, the unrealism of it is to much for and average audience to comprehend. You cannot base a movie on monstrous beings and elaborate on them so much and have to audience totally submerged in the current plot and then just lift up the blinds and show them this completely different plot with a completely different mood. A twist should have an audience saying, ""Hmm, thats intelligent and surprising but still logical and reasonable."" This twist made me just say no, it;s to far over the top, just a over fabricated idea to the point of utter improbability and confusion."

","I had a lot of expectation for this movie. With some famous names in the list of actors, I thought it would be a nice movie for a lazy, rainy, Saturday night. But I was wrong, the story is really shallow, the acting is so bad, I cannot remember when was the last time I saw any movie like this.<br/><br/>The movie is a fiction, like ""field of dreams"" and if I had this in my mind before watching the movie, I would have given it a 4 or maybe a 5, but as it is now, I can not give it more than 2 very generous stars that's only because I like to see William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>The idea of the movie is interesting, an Amish like society isolated from the outside world where a group of elders decide about the important issues. An utopia of American dream, where girls and boys become adult and chose their partner and get married and life is as good as you can imagine in a perfect Christian way of living. But as the movie goes on, it looses its strength and becomes a boring un-realistic story.<br/><br/>The part that disturbed me most was the scene were Edward Walker (William Hurt) refuses to shake hand with Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) because he has feeling for her. That reminded me of the meeting of Iraqi deputy prime minister with secretary of State, when he refuses to shake her hand, that was the level of fanatic stupidity promoted by this movie.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed at Hurt and Weaver to take part of such a bad movie. They are much much better than this."

","...because despite the fact that I saw the twist coming about 30 seconds into the movie, this was a fantastic movie. I think the reason for the transparency was that we've now come to expect the twist, and so we're looking for it. The most surprising thing that MNS could do is make a movie with no twist at all.<br/><br/>But set that aside for a moment. Let's talk a bit about the performances, which are uniformly magnificent, and sadly, all of them are lost in the overwhelmingly negative hype the film has received. Particularly great are J. Pheonix (I can never remember how to spell that name), Bryce Howard, and especially Adrien Brody.<br/><br/>Portraying the mentally challenged seems to be a rite of passage for all serious Hollywood actors, and here Brody does his turn at it with panache, keeping you sympathetic even when you're recoiling in horror.<br/><br/>Bryce Howard, in what appears to be her first major adult role, is both talented and beautiful, and her next project is a Lars Von Trier film, which is the most exciting fact I've heard in ages.<br/><br/>I've never been a particular fan of Pheonix, but he's fine here, playing the brave loner. All of these roles evoke boatloads of pathos, and even when the script takes a turn for the ridiculous, I was completely caught up in the humanity of the characters.<br/><br/>Anyways, the problem, as with The Others, is actually not one of quality, but of context: Had this film come out before The Sixth Sense, it would have been regarded as fantastic, but I think that at this point, Shyamalan has now both codified and exhausted the ""twist film"" genre. However, I believe that if he can move beyond this singular limitation, he has several truly landmark films in him. He's far too talented and unique not to."

","FOLLOWING COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS...I THINK! Okay, you can't really spoil this movie because the ending is telegraphed from the start when the cameras pan the landscape and show a reasonably modern tower that's in stark contrast to the rest of the set. When I saw it at first, I really thought the director/camera guys had made a mistake by including it in the shot. But then it showed up again and again. (I must confess, I visited this movie set right after the filming and was certain that tower was for use in filming, not in the movie! When I saw it in the first shot, I was amazed at how dumb it was.) To all other appearances, the villagers of The Village look like they're from the 19th century, they talk very much like they're from the 19th century, but because everything is soooooo very 19th century, it becomes very apparent, very early on that this ain't no 19th century village. It's just been set up to look like one for purposes of the Village ""elders"" -- a group of very self righteous, very sure of themselves Amish-like folk who try to explain away the scalping of village animals and the partial painting of village doors by claiming it must have been a very big coyote. Yes, a coyote with a knife and a bucket of red paint. Even 19th century villagers aren't that stupid. The folks who made this movie must be basing the intelligence of the average American viewer on the intelligence of its current leaders, but to say this film is an insult doesn't quite explain why the writer/producers/director feel like they have to lay the whole thing out so plainly and so early on. The isolation of the Village always feels self serving, always contrived. Monsters in red cloaks? Eerie sounds emanating from the woods. And paranoia about the color red? Nothing in this movie makes sense either literally or metaphorically. In the end, it's just a silly love story with lots of scary music to make you nervous. The only violence is the stabbing by one villager (whose scary behavior is to shut up for most of the movie) by another (whose scary behavior is to giggle, dance and drool -- before becoming a homicidal maniac, of course.) The only really evil character (the real village idiot) falls into a hole and dies. The purported evil beings of the forest who terrorize and seem to imprison the villagers are cartoon characters when you see them about half way through the film. Just like the aliens in the ""Signs"" these are poorly conceived, almost stereotypical villains that make this a C, not even a B, movie. In the end, the resolution isn't really a resolution at all. Just verification of what you figured out in the movie's first few scenes. The scariest thing about this film is that there are people out there who actually thought this was a thriller and was any good."
"Quinoa1984","4","6","12","7 August 2004"," The curse of the damned legend- a film worthy of both Oscars and Razzies
","Make no mistake, M. Night Shyamalan, the filmmaker behind The Village as well as the hits Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, has carved a niche in Hollywood that will still be relevant after his latest.  His style as a director is unmistakable, as he lays on the dread and suspense for the audience with his stories of the supernatural and citizens at the mercy of outside forces.  One problem though with Shyamalan's series of films since his monumental success with 6th Sense, is that either the audience expects a good twist or two in the third acts and Shyamalan sticks to this ideology, or he feels that he has to do it to keep the audience on edge.<br/><br/>While it may be coarse to suggest that The Village would be more terrifying in its third act as something of an exploitation horror film, the way it turns out The Village becomes, well, sort of silly.  It's the kind of third act that tries to get the audience thinking deeper past the realm of a super-natural suspense thriller, but the logic behind it doesn't work.  To me, the screenplay is deserved of a razzie nomination.  On the other hand, at least half of the performances are better than expected by the main cast. Though some of them might seem to be over-acting (i.e. William Hurt), under-acting (Joaquin Phoenix), and only finding the balance in here and there (Adrian Brody's performance will disappoint those expecting him to astound as in The Pianist), at least one comes out with a slight breakthrough (Ron Howard's daughter Bryce, playing a blind character, with the only flaw in the performance being it's not always believable that she's blind).<br/><br/>Shyamalan gives us these characters, some of them rather archetypal, and they all live in a Village that keeps everything hidden and darkened by the elders.  When one of them (Howard) has to leave, it leads to the climax, and the twists.  But the best side to the film, outside of the flaws in the story and acting, is the look of the film, the way the images are presented and cut together.  Even if Shyamalan doesn't have every bit of himself as he has before in the script, he does seem to have a distinct, intriguing style via the marvelous Roger Deakins and editor Christopher Tellefson.  Indeed, it was that end alone that kept me in my seat, and occasionally gave me some goose-bumps.  And yet, by the end of the film, I felt more cheated than surprised and ecstatic at what came as the finishing touch.  The Village is a mixed bag, worth checking out but not at the same time. C+"

"Anonymous_Maxine","6","4","7","2 February 2005"," It's all about the scenery.
","I read one IMDb user's review of The Village which stated that M. Night made a mistake releasing The Sixth Sense because it made everyone in the world expect some earth shattering twist at the end of all of his movies, which is almost right. Luckily, this reviewer goes on to explain that M. Night has been trying ever since The Sixth Sense to recapture that awe that he created in his first major audiences, which IS right. In The Village, M. Night tries too hard to lead the audience in one direction that when we are brought back to reality it inspires an ""oh, please"" reaction rather than awe.<br/><br/>I have tremendous respect for the immense film-making talent of M. Night Shyamalan, so I am not willing to fault him for making a weak film, but I am also not willing to see him create a weak film and then not say that it's a weak film. The look of it puts the time period sometime in the 1800's or an Amish community in Pennsylvania in the 1800s, 1900s, 2000s, etc. M. Night actually claims in the making-of documentary included with the DVD that the movie was set in the 1800s because he wanted to create an atmosphere of innocence. A small village of people seem to have been living under an agreement with some sort of malicious creatures that live in the woods that surround their village. They don't go in the woods, the creatures don't come out and hurt any of them.<br/><br/>Because of M. Night's reputation for surprise endings, I doubt that many people read reviews of his movies unless they've already seen them. Even so, here is the obligatory spoiler warning  SPOILER AHEAD! What I like about the movie is that, while the twist is firmly in the realm of the ludicrous, it is at least very well explained, even if not ever credibly. There are vague explanations about how government officials have been paid off to prevent airplanes from flying over the village and terrifying the townspeople, no one is ever allowed to go into what is called an animal preserve, and in one of the last scenes, newspaper clippings reveal the suffering that many of the founders of the village have suffered, thus inspiring them to create it.<br/><br/>I can certainly understand their motivations, especially since they have all suffered extremely, through the murders of loved ones, rape, burglary, etc. I live in Los Angeles and anytime I get a freaking parking ticket I just about want to move out of the country. But the problem is that they respond to their suffering by creating a society that is maintained by instilling fear in all of its residents.<br/><br/>This fear is maintained much the same way that the fear of Voldemort was maintained in the Harry Potter stories. He is referred to as ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" by everyone except Harry Potter, who uses his name freely due to a total lack of fear. The creatures in the woods in this movie are referred to as ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" as they are constantly spoken of in never-ending efforts to keep everyone scared.<br/><br/>It is an interesting exploration of M. Night's technique, but the payoff is such a tremendous letdown that it is almost difficult to pay attention to the explanations that justify the possibility of the village's existence because of the disappointment. The movie is well made, the script is not."

Dialogues were at time even irritating for how they were obvious and bad. Cinematic ally speaking the film had nice images, not special though but that's the job of a cinematographer who is another person employed for the film. This director strangely enough writes and direct overrated movies, still manages movie after movie. For one thing is very skilled of is finding financiers and producers because anyone else coming out with those ""thin"" scripts with one plot would be impossible to sell even the ideas. I believe at film school they might teach story constructions and all but perhaps he didn't even go to a film school. He was already a genius, check out his homemade film he is so proud to show in each DVD. It's insulting the intelligence of the audience. I wish only that the reviewer would write honest article when his movies are released but because of what probably the distribution companies pay to the magazine by the time the film is going into the theaters all reviews are great (even though many magazine don't even get a screening copy or preview, weird isn't it?!) but months after that the same film magazines publish other reviews and usually those are more ""realistic"", in fact the latest I read finally told the truth, this movie sucks!!!"

Let this be a lesson to all major film corporations: Just because you have a well-established writer/director, doesn't mean you can fully trust him.<br/><br/>Okay, first of all, the advertising for this movie is horribly deceiving. ""The Village"" being advertised as a horror movie is like getting a student to take ""Advanced Calculus"" by telling them it's ""an exciting outer-space excursion to a land of rainbow-colored gnomes and chocolate-covered unicorns that's both fun and uneducational! No math involved!"" It's neither fair, nor honest. I had seen ads starting back in February that got me and a lot of my friends anticipating this film. ""Finally,"" we thought, ""a movie that will live up to 'The Sixth Sense'."" Boy were we wrong.<br/><br/>Then, there's the plot. This movie might as well have been a 2-hour documentary of an Amish community. Now I know this concept may seem WAY too action-packed for you to handle, but don't worry, M. Night uses vast movie-making powers to dull it down with unoriginal camera work, and what's more or less a total lack of a musical score. I'm sure you can imagine the exciting events that would take place in this setting: ""Will Jebediah's cow give enough milk for his 17 sisters to make it though another week? Can Ezekial find love with his cousin, Mary, or will his father, Jacob, get to her first? Will this year's harvest live up to expectations? Tune in next fortnight to find out!!!"" Then, of course, there's the obligatory 'holy crap I didn't see that coming now the whole storyline got turned upside down what's gonna happen not that I care' plot-twist that causes someone to take action and leave the village. Who could this be, you ask? Why the blind girl of course! Who better to send through a supposedly monster-ridden forest than a sight-less chick armed with a giant stick. Incredible writing here, folks! So now, after being bored for a good hour-and-a-half, we get to watch little Helen Keller run aimlessly through the woods with a hiking stick until she finally runs into a large brick wall. If you haven't left the theatre/turned off your TV/turned off your computer and deleted the illegally-downloaded piece of crap, you'd see the story deteriorate even further, as any respect you once had for Sham-aylan is lost, along with all sense and logic in the film.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie should contain a warning label on it reading ""WARNING: This movie may induce boredom, drowsiness, and severe loss of intelligence. If watched in it's entirety, you may experience a profound feeling of being cheated out of a couple bucks and two hours of your life. Do not operate heavy machinery within a day of watching, as the over-whelming frustration and confusion you will feel when finishing it could cause you to lose focus, causing massive injury to yourself and others.""

For the first half an hour I was happily entertained, It all looked nice, I smiled, I laughed, I jumped in fright, this isn't so bad. Shyamalan really does have polished skills as a director and can create and hold tension like few others. I could (but won't) like so many others, go into great detail trying to rationalise and question the reality of the film. There's no question in my mind i found the premise absurd but I feel that so many people are missing the whole point by petty squabbling about it being unrealistic or predictable (I didn't see it coming too early, then again I do tend to go all passive whilst entertained). No, the problem wasn't with the directing, it is the writing. You see in my opinion there's one blinding error in the writing and when you see it it opens the whole thing up to it's hollow bones. I think it is this,he writes all of his films backwards from the twist. He paints himself into a corner with what he considers a great surprise ending, then goes backwards spending all the time in the film before the twist,simply arguing his way out of the corner. And that is just bad storytelling. Given this knowledge you can then watch the film again and see that almost every line of dialogue leading up to the inevitable twist is simply explaining away any questions about the validity of the twist. About as naturalistic as mj's looks and to be honest I was simply left cold and slightly angry. Gotta give him credit though he's made a career out of films which you can write in 30 seconds and simply fill out to 2 hours. I'd suggest letting someone else do the writing next time.

"jackasstrange","5","3","5","27 November 2013"," Almost as bad as i was expecting
","I had a curious story with this film before watching it for the first time. I avoided it like the plague in the last month, mostly due to a bad feeling about it. Seriously, i missed lots of opportunities to see this film. I generally don't listen to critics opinions and stuff, but i don't know. In this case, it's like if something were holding me back to not watch this film. But today i finally gave up , left my fears and watched The Village.<br/><br/>Well, it wasn't as bad as i thought it was, but still, is indeed not a good film in any means in this planet. The plot is awful if you really think about it. The dialog is very vague, pointless and cheesy. 90% of them don't adds nothing to the story, which s a very bad fact. Some events requires way too many suspension of disbelief to really appreciate it. As far as i watched,a blind girl which can do absolutely everything as a normal person does and a retard smarter than people with implied much more intelligence than him are quick examples of how much you needs to suspend your disbelief. The character development is just normal, and there is no setting in any ways to be able to do this 'suspension'.<br/><br/>The acting is not exactly in the level of what you are used to see coming from this relatively ensemble cast, but i don't put the fault entirely in the actors. They don't have that much to work with, besides the poor dialogs and the dull pointless events. The cinematography, the art design and the soundtrack are top- notch though, but a film is not only about these technical aspects.<br/><br/>Not recommended. 5.4/10"

","Maybe the Best that can be said is this Movie is not as Bad as the Director's other Mega-Disappointments, Lady in the Water (2006) or Signs (2002). But that Certainly isn't saying Much. So let it be Said that this Film isn't all that Persuasive in its Conceit or all that Entertaining.<br/><br/>The Movie Looks Good and Manages to Evoke some Atmosphere, until it goes in the Woods and then it Completely Collapses into Utter Boredom and Insignificance. The Plot Plods along for almost Two Hours and then, Surprise. But Maybe Not. For most Viewers who go in for this sort of Thing (Horror/Suspense/Thrillers) the Screams of Discontent Replace the Screams of Scary Stuff.<br/><br/>The Director Loves Movies as He has said Many Times in Many Interviews where it is Revealing that He may Love Himself even More. So His Underestimation of the Target Audience is Puzzling. His Schtick has Become Sick in its Obviousness and Pretension<br/><br/>Overall the Film is not Awful, just Tedious and Trite. It is Overwritten and Smug and Remains a Curiosity. The Mystery is how a Director's Name can come before the Title based on a Couple of Excellent Movies. It used to be that was an Earned Honor based on a Body of Good Work."

","The Village tells the story of a large clan of people who live in an enclosed Village (Duh), The Village is surrounded by a forest. In this forest lives ""Those we shall not speak of"", I'll call them creatures from now on. The Village people have an assortment of rules to keep themselves safe from the creatures. Don't let the bad color be seen. It attracts them. - Never enter the woods. That is where they wait - Heed the warning bell, for they are coming. They have these rules because they organized an agreement with them, they stay out of the woods, they won't harm them, but if they go into the woods, they're will be consequences. But a man named Luscious walks into the woods, the creatures decide to unleash these consequences on The Villagers, and now we have The Village. <br/><br/>Now The Village is often regarded as Shyamalans first bad film, it's been accused of false marketing, a dumb plot and a disappointing plot twist. <br/><br/>First of all, I don't think it's fair to downgrade a film because of false marketing, I personally don't remember the marketing for The Village, but it's wrong to accuse it of something out of the directors hands.<br/><br/>Secondly, this is a bit subjective, but I thought that one of the best things about The Village was it's interesting story. It's original and compelling throughout the film.<br/><br/>Lastly, the plot twist. It is undeniably not very good at all, it's horribly unveiled in the film, it's not very thought provoking, it's kind of dumb too. I'm sure there was plenty of other ways Shyamalan could of went with it, he could of even avoided a twist and I would have been fine, but it happened and it wasn't very good. My problem is that people are completely attacking the movie just because of the plot twist, of course it isn't good at all, but think about how good it was before the twist was unveiled.<br/><br/>Now, I'm giving The Village a 8 out of 10 because of how much I loved the first hour and a bit of the film, it certainly would of got a 9 or 10 if it wasn't for the twist, but sure what can you do. What I loved so much about The Village was the syrup thick atmosphere throughout the film, you could almost feel the mystery of The Village in the air. This atmosphere is established by the beautiful score which I'm glad was praised by most an nominated for an academy award, and the riveting performances.<br/><br/>The performances in The Village are some of the best I've seen in a while, especially that of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy), she stole every scene she was in. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius)& Adrien Brody (Noah) are both also very good, they completely owned there characters. Everyone in the film is great, but those three were the standouts. <br/><br/>The setting of the film is very picturesque, and the beautiful cinematography really brought it out. The script is also something that was very stick out for me, the dialogue between Lucius and Ivy was just so well written, not to say that the rest isn't but it's definitely something worth mentioning. I am disappointed that The Village does suffer from the horrible plot twist, which is a shame."

Every detail was precise, every actor acted their hearts out (especially Bryce Dallas-Howard), the music was haunting and there was a second twist that I never saw coming. Just watch it, guys.

I also believe that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan is just like a great magician ,who holds all his tricks and twists within his sleeves , which is called as directorial gimmick.. I still cant forget the Twist in the Sixth Sense ..<br/><br/>The village is a Atmospheric Fantasy Mystery thriller , It continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot , But this time there are several twists which will reveal periodically.. Character study is very deep , and realistic ... But don't take it wrong with horror genre (of course it contains horror elements,but not much)<br/><br/>Coming to the cast , Bryce Dallas Howard played a role of Ivy Walker , which will be remembered through out the years.. As from my point of view , ""The village"" cant be imagined without her...The rest of the cast is pretty good but Bryce Dallas Howard steals the show..<br/><br/>Coming to the plot , It is flawless and good...and picking up irrelevant plot holes is meaningless...""In village"" we can clearly observe that ""How screenplay can effect a movie"".. The story is good , but with perfect screenplay the movie is truly appealing.. The plot has periodical predictable and unpredictable twists which will grip the suspense.....<br/><br/>Coming to the the background Score , It is perfect....It helped in maintaining pace of a movie...<br/><br/>But don't expect it to be another ""Sixth Sense"" <br/><br/>It is very underrated movie , as from my point of view this is the second best in Shyamalan's career...<br/><br/>If you have any idea of the true cinematic art or if you believe in it , then ""The Village"" is worth your money...<br/><br/>If you didn't get a chance to see it yet, Go see it now..<br/><br/>My Rating : 8/10"

","The Village is an excellent film by M. Night Shyamalan, it focuses on a small community who although seem happy, are living in fear of mysterious creatures in the woods which surround them. 'The Village' is a beautifully made film, it has an engrossing story with detailed characters in a unique setting. The film also has artistic cinematography and like all M. Night films an expertly composed score which suites the film perfectly. This is one of those productions in which every line of dialogue and every camera shot have weight and meaning as well as being a joy to watch. I really cannot say enough good things about this film, it is something I would be happy to watch every day of the week as it demands repeated viewings. To conclude I would say that if you have any intellectual capacity at all, you will most likely enjoy this film."

","I think this film has been given a bad rap by people who judge it based on the quality of his trademark ""twist"" at the end. Was I able to anticipate it before it was revealed? Yes. But that's not the point. For my tastes, this film speaks to one of my favorite themes in movies like Dark City or The Matrix, namely that no matter what the appearance of the world you're seeing, that appearance is an illusion.<br/><br/>The movie asks us to consider in its microcosm the bigger question about the validity and reality of the world we inhabit. There's a metaphysical movement that is gaining momentum in these times about how much of what passes for ""common sense"" and the nature of reality is not nearly as true as we suppose it to be. What we've been learning at the leading edges of sciences like quantum mechanics and epigenetics is that many of the dominant ideas about how our world works are merely illusions beneath which a more nuanced and surprising circumstance waits to be discovered.<br/><br/>Our world is not what most of us have been taught it is. And films like The Village pose a simple but very important question, namely ""Is what we think the truth of things are really the truth at all?"""
"moonspinner55","6","3","5","6 December 2008"," Exceptionally literate psychological drama, with intricate threads interwoven in compact yet complex plot...
","M. Night Shyamalan wrote, co-produced, and directed this deceptively simple whirlpool of deceit and consequence. This is the kind of human study (with a suspenseful undercurrent) that might have become legendary as a paperback novel, a swift read on a rainy Saturday afternoon. An isolated East Coast community in the late 1890s, apparently made up of simple farmers and their families, have made a pact with the ominous creatures who live in the forest which borders their hamlet: do not cross into their territory, do not offend the creatures with the color red, feed them raw meat for supper, and be thankful for every day they've had without upsetting Those They Dare Not Speak Of. After a backwards villager has stabbed an innocent young man on the verge of getting married, his intended (a wise but blind lass) asks permission to travel through the woods to find medicine in the neighboring town. Shyamalan always runs the risk of upsetting his own core audience by not coming up with amazing-enough answers to his own circumstances. The scenario here is fully dimensional, the narrative is absorbing and intriguing, and all the players are wonderful...yet, Shyamalan is perhaps too logical in his storytelling (and too methodical in his approach) to satisfy a thriller audience with this story (in the end, it isn't audacious enough). On the other hand--purely as a psychological study--the movie has layers of complexity that seem even deeper in retrospect, and the dialogue is so well-written and delivered it nearly doesn't matter that the scare factor is all a sham. **1/2 from ****"

","Incredible intelligent plot! It reminds me Hitchcock ones. I came to watch this movie loving all previous Shyamalan works and get not disappointed. The trailer said: ""Do not tell the secret of this movie to anyone!"" I can help falling on that, and it is exactly what happens. I usually try to find out the secret but it is not possible. And I have to confess that I used to know many fiction plots including this kind of psicologic-anthropological-fiction one. There are so remarkable philosophic and psicologic insights during the film that I can not quote one. It should be seen and think about them all after. It is amazing how Shyamalan movies are easy to talk about after seen. There are always key points that drive the plot to a interpretation that, as you do not know the end, should lead it to, but they simply ""pass me by"" unconscientiously. I was capture by the image (and specially the sound) of the creatures and simply could not think, just feel as the images pass by. At certain point I tell to my wife: ""The creatures is showing on! So, it can not be fake, spiritual, man-dressed or something like that. So what is it?"" She was to afraid to respond. And that is the point. You do not have to be afraid but you will. That is the key point why some people tell me that they hate this movie. The fell betrayed cause the are afraid during all the movie and then the end came to shake then to our world with a fantastically punch. Some friends tell me: ""The end revealed an impossible and fantastic issue that remains illogical and improbable."" Then I answer: ""That is why I love it."" As Sherlock Holmes said: ""to solve a problem, after removing all the impossible explanations, the ones that remains, even it looks improbable, it still be true."""

The flick has some of the best actors in the industry and yet we do not see enough of them. I feel as though the whole film was made to focus on Bryce Howard; not her character but Howard, herself.<br/><br/>It is also very annoying that all the actors seem to talk in a soft monotone that is hard to make out. I suppose the sound was better in the theatre but on DVD or on the TV it is not a pleasant experience to keep having to turn up the volume.<br/><br/>Why would you go to the trouble and expense to hire some really big box office actors and then hobble them with lame dialogue and incomplete character development? Why would you rather shoot dismal scenery than these wonderful actors? I would have rather seen more of Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody than I saw of mudslides, water, leaves and scary outlines of tree branches.<br/><br/>The ending is ridiculous; Bryce Howard goes through trials and tribulations and gets fantastically muddy-dirty-nasty but in the end she is clean as a newborn babe....come on!"

It should have been advertised as a mystery/drama type film, as I know I would have liked it more, as there's nothing more off putting than having your hopes and dreams in a film shattered.

There are more ways to scare people than the ever popular hiding behind a tree and then turning to see what you are hiding from is right there. AHHHH! oh wait that was in the trailer too.

The first thirty minutes contains some intense scenes but everything else was downhill. The performances were all rather bland with Brody giving the worst performance I've ever seen from an Oscar winner.

","Even if you're a follower of M. Night Shyamalan's first three films, his latest effort will test both your intelligence and patience as a viewer. ""The Village"" is a beautifully-photographed, goose-bumpy stinker with a (you guessed it) twist ending. <br/><br/>It seems Mr. Shyamalan is content in making the same movie over and over again, and though the plot, characters and settings may be different in each film, there is still that terribly clever plot twist.<br/><br/>What the surprise in ""The Village"" is, I won't say because I don't want to spoil it for fans of this sort of thing. However, by the film's end, I will say I felt cheated. I groaned out loud because I couldn't believe the final twist could be that silly. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The late, great Rod Serling wrote these kinds of morality plays 40 some years ago but those were classic examples of mood and storytelling. Most of these ""Twilight Zone"" episodes taught a moral lesson or commented on a social issue and many of them had an O. Henry-inspired twist ending. These scripts also had a wry, satiric sense of humor and were crafted with great skill by Mr. Serling. The script for ""The Village"" is not.<br/><br/>As a director, Shyamalan creates a foreboding atmosphere and a few chilling moments but his flat, clunky screenplay fails both he and the audience as the film draws us to its rather mundane ending.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's terrific cast of actors tries hard but even the seasoned pros can only do so much with some of this corny and stilted dialogue. I hope these actors were paid very well for their work here.<br/><br/>Of the ensemble, William Hurt does the best, especially since the dialogue seems to flow naturally off his tongue. One of my favorite actresses, Sigourney Weaver, is basically wasted in a colorless role.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is dour and very serious indeed and pretty newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard, has plenty of charisma as Mr. Phoenix's love interest. In the role of the ""village idiot,"" Adrien Brody is way over the top but he's obviously having a rollicking good time.<br/><br/>The film looks spectacular thanks to the rich, burnished cinematography by Roger Deakins, who photographs the backgrounds in ""The Village"" as if they were paintings created by Dutch masters. Kudos to Mr. Deakins for an outstanding effort.<br/><br/>Though Mr. Shyamalan has created some interesting characters and situations in ""The Village,"" they're basically abandoned for what is a rather ridiculous and implausible ending. But by that time, no one really seems to care."
"GTeixeira","4","4","8","12 August 2013"," An excellent concept wasted in a boring and dull soap opera
","Typical of M. Night Shyamalan, 'The Village' is a film that tries to create a solid story in order to hit the viewer with a clever twist that totally changes the perception of the story you just saw.<br/><br/>In here we are introduced to an isolated village, which maintains itself thanks to a pact with the creatures who inhabit the surrounding woods. But when one young villager proposes to cross the woods to find medical supplies, the creatures start to act up...<br/><br/>The twist, whether you expected it or not, is very clever. It is easily the best thing in the entire movie; however, it becomes almost ridiculous and laughable when put it together with everything that led up to it.<br/><br/>'The Village' is slow, boring, and visually dull. The dialogue is terribly written, seeming more like a bad soap opera than a period film, and the acting is horrible. Adrien Brody is nothing more than an irritating caricature of the village idiot, acting like a retarded clown and destroying any and all scenes he is on. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard have no chemistry whatsoever, and their scenes together are cringe-worthy; even separated, Phoenix is apathetic most of the film and Howard seems to forget her character is blind from time to time. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are merely decent.<br/><br/>There is no atmosphere to go along with Shyamalan's tries at creating thrills. There are a lot of glaring logic problems, too: Shyamalan forces his characters to make nonsense decisions/actions, and sometimes disregard logic in order for some plot elements to work. The fact this is meant to be an allegory for terrorism or whatever (sincerely, some people look too far in order to justify crap) only makes this somewhat laughable.<br/><br/>This had the potential to be excellent, but ended up as a complete bore. The twist, the excellent soundtrack (one of the best I can remember of) and the way 'Scary Movie 4' spoofed it are the only favorable things I can think of in regards to Shyamalan's 'The Village'."

Unfortunately, i'm still stuck for good comments about this film! I've watched 'The Village' three times to give it a chance, but this effort by Shyamalan is such a disappointment compared to its predecessors!

Yet 'The Village' was so unbelievably boring that i couldn't believe that it had been written and directed by the same man! Honestly, the only thing i can say about this film is that after about 1hr 45mins into the film i suddenly realised that pretty much nothing had happened and therefore the only reason i continued to watch was the sheer belief that surely something good had to happen soon! I even told my friends that they had to see it just to see exactly what i was telling them! Towards the end it picked up very slightly where the blind girl was running through the forest and it had his usual clever twist which did work, however when it finally finished i was in such a state of confusion and disappointment that i couldn't stop laughing!

After 60 minutes watching to some retarded dudes that are told by there parents not to enter the forest cause the evil monsters that live in there would kill them if they do.. you are ready to punch in your TV screen and hope the monsters will slaughter them all. There are basically 5 reasons why this movie sucks <br/><br/>(1) The concept of a village with people locked from the outside world surrounded by a forest full of monsters could be good if A: there was good acting B: there was a decent script and C: YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SEE MONSTERS SLAUGHTER PEOPLE.<br/><br/>(2) After hearing the parents say after 1 hour for the 10th time the words :THEM WE DON'T SPEAK OFF"" (meaning the monsters) you ask yourself this question why am i still watching and how can a movie be so boring?<br/><br/>(3) The love romance between the blind lady and the retards are so NOT amusing and the talking so immense long with nothing then boredom and more boredom. Don't even have me started about all the parents that talk about each other like a club full of over-aged grannies that have nothing better to do. For the 5 seconds you see the fake (monsters) you don't have to watch this movie either cause its really not cool at all.<br/><br/>(4) Even if the movie makers didn't had the intention to make a horror movie but some kind of psychological drama about the scars that some people carry and why they want a other life away from the (normal world), it is still no excuse to make such a boring movie with almost no action or horror or a good plot line at all. On the moment they actually enter the forest you already know the monsters are fake (yes they are) and so the movie is shot by his self.<br/><br/>(5) The casts acting is so robotic and the script so boring( did i just say boring for the 10th time? and YES IT IS THAT BORING) that this movie drags his self to the end and you don't care at all about their stupid little village outside in the woods and their reasons to stay there.<br/><br/>This movie was a waste of my time and gets a 2 star."

","OK....nice premise to this and clever advertising. I finally saw this movie on one of the movie channels and am glad I never wasted any money either seeing it in the theater or renting it.<br/><br/>I certainly understand that there is some suspension of belief involved in watching movies, but this is worse than even some of the Jason movies where people just act dumb and beyond what is normal behavior.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the village people seem to be all a bunch of non-thinking brainwashed weaklings. No dignity in facing death or scary things...just shrivel up and hide. C'mon...how many of you are there? Can't you gang up on just ONE alien and kick the snot out of it? Where are your guns? Even older societies and Amish people had guns. Where are your rebellious teens? We all know teens think they're invincible, so why don't a bunch of them gang up with wooden planks and go after this monster thing? Stooopid.<br/><br/>Next....a BLIND girl walking around in the forest finding her way out AND back into this place? Oh...right...her other senses must have made up for the MILES of non-directional sounds of squirrels, deer and other creepy-crawlies out there in the woods. Why don't deer and bears set off those alarms or get the monsters angry? After finding out what the monsters are (SPOILER) you would think that those who walked out into the woods just once would have done that while all of them were sleeping and not dressed up as one. How did the people dressed up know when someone walked past ""the line""? Motion sensitive cameras? Infrared heat-seeking alarms? No...where would they have been hidden? Then...when the girl does find out it's all a sham and even goes so far as touching the costume to know it's all a crock...why then is she afraid when she confronts the monster in her walk out of the woods? Secondly...WHY (please tell me) would the crazy idiot dressed as the monster spread red flower petals (or feathers or whatever they were) around wherever he was to try to scare a blind person with a visual effect? Clearly that was an effect to make US think a monster was coming...it would and should have no effect on the blind person. Why did he have to dress up to scare her? She couldn't see the costume anyway. Stooopid.<br/><br/>How also does she know it's a monster, not a deer, possum or even a monkey? SHE CAN'T...and this is a bit beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. Why doesn't the ""monster"" just walk right up to her and slash her or whatever it was he wanted to do with her? She couldn't have seen him coming? Maybe she could have heard him...but then there's no way she could have outrun him. Stoopid again! Instead running and falling into a pit that she really had no idea how deep it was...but somehow she knew right when to duck out of the way. I think they stretch the Helen Keller abilities of this blind person into more comic book superhero for what this movie was all about.<br/><br/>Lastly, wasn't it just SO convenient that she walked out of the woods and just happened to have the boy scout of boy scouts find her and then not ask too many questions. And then happen to have the right medicine and get by the incompetent and supposedly bad guy park ranger dude who sorta knows what's going on.

"doughelo","4","4","8","26 April 2005"," Half-hour plot crammed into two hours
","This was well-filmed and decently acted, but there's not enough there there. M Night is a good cinematographer and knows how to set up suspense, but he should have put more complexity into the story. The plot twist is not terribly surprising and less clever than his previous films, even ""Unwatchable"" (sorry, ""Unbreakable""). It's really only enough for a Twilight Zone plot, probably because it pretty much WAS one - the episode with Cliff Robertson in a wagon train where he sets off to get medicine for his sick boy. He inadvertently crosses into the modern world and returns to his time with the magic medicine (penicillin). Except for the time travel aspect, that's pretty much what happens in the Village.<br/><br/>A few other problems - a settlement completely isolated from the outside, yet with absolutely immaculate, finely finished clothing, housing and furniture (they've been there at least 18 years, remember); almost no sign of crops; a seeming abundance of leisure time and no shots of anyone working in the fields or at looms, even though constant, grinding labor would be needed to support that many people. I fail to see why the Federal government would accept a bribe to keep flight paths away from the area (no one's ever strayed over it?). None of the young men in town have ever tried to fight one of the creatures, and no one's ever seen the elders heading into the woods with an outfit tucked into their arms? No one's ever stumbled across one of the outfits? William Hurt mentions the elders made the creepy sounds from the woods, but never says how - a solar-powered recording? <br/><br/>Not to mention the morality of forcibly holding your children ignorant and superstitious. There are far easier ways of maintaining a sanctuary while still being aware of the outside world. And obviously the experiment failed, as they were not able to shut out passions and crime."

","I am a true fan of all of M. Night's previous movies, but this was 1:40 of the most boring ridiculous dialog. There is no suspense in the movie at all and no action.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's daughter does an adequate job in the lead female role, although half the time she acts blind, half the time it appears she can see well. How can she run through the yards with no problem, but then she needs her cane to move around her own house? And how is she able to navigate through the woods on her own? <br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix plays the most wooden character to come along since Pinocchio. He disappears from the screen about ¼ of the way through the movie, giving him no chance to redeem the role.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's previous films were full of so much suspense, it would make my skin tingle.

","I suppose that if I'd seen 'Sixth Sense' from the vantage point of knowing in advance the sort of films Shyamalan makes, I might have expected the twists, and been less amazed. It didn't happen with 'Unbreakable' though - again he kept me glued until the revelations, especially the totally unexpected last one.<br/><br/>When I came to 'The Village', though, I had all that foreknowledge, together - having seen 'Signs' - with the awareness that MKS is entirely capable of making utter dogs as well. 'Village' was not a real surprise, therefore, except in its sheer awfulness.<br/><br/>This is deeply bad, and you have to wonder: does MKS know it? Is he spending the time between these successively poorer works writhing internally, tortured by his inability to reclaim the magic? Pressured by the expectation of his peers and his public to produce more rabbits from his now apparently empty hat? It's clear that he's reaching for the same formula: 1-2-3 dazzling revelations in close succession that leave the audience giddy with delight and admiration for the way they've been manipulated and misled.<br/><br/>It's not working anymore, though: and the mutilations of plausibility that bringing these revelations to light entails have become so grievous that they go way past what is possible with mere suspension of disbelief, and now require either base intellectual negligence or hallucinogenic drugs. Sure - send the blind girl! Yes - lock the loony in the room with the costume under the floorboards! Fine - let's make the first guy she meets have access to antibiotics! Perfect - no-one will notice! <br/><br/>You should have quit while you were ahead, M, which was just after 'Unbreakable'.

I do think that M Night's style is interesting but outside of that, this movie failed on all accounts. I think that Howards performance was retched. I keep hearing people praise her performance as a great performance and one of the only redeeming points of the movie, but I cannot disagree more. She looks people in the eye when she speaks with them and it took me a while to realize that she was blind. I cannot respect a character who will put up with a totalitarian style government such as the one in this town. They try to pawn off Phoenix's character as a person with will unlike anyone else in the town. If he had such a will, he would have taken matters into his own hands and left the village without the blessing of the elders.<br/><br/>I don't even want to start with the ending because it is completely incomprehensible for something like this to happen. I read the ending when it was leaked on the net about a year ago. I was under the impression that they went back and re shot the ending so I was looking for something different. It was a horrid ending when I read it then and it was a horrid ending when I viewed it now. To tie all this off, I hated this movie. M. Night, stop trying to trip us up with a surprise ending and just make a solid movie. I liked The Sixth Sense and I loved Unbreakable, but Signs and The Village just irritated me.

"efrain-2","1","4","8","28 January 2005"," The biggest disappointment of 2004!
","Ever since the the success of his only good movie, The Sixth Sense, everyone, including the media and himself, seem to think of M. Night Shyamalan as the next Alfred Hitchcock. If this is so, he's got a very long way to go...<br/><br/>The Village plays like it was made by an absolute sell out of M. Night's early work. Don't get me wrong, he can still utilize bits of suspense when he wants to -- but suspense is supposed to lead to something, which in the case of his last three films, has been a true disappointment. Furthermore, if he is to be the next Hitchcock, he's got to learn that one big suspenseful twist per movie will not make him the new ""Master of Suspense."" He'll need to approach his films with the notion that the entire film he's creating needs to be suspenseful and mysterious to fill Alfred Hitchcock's shoes.<br/><br/>M. Night shows a lot of potential, and I'm convinced he can do so much better, and trying to be original is not a bad thing. But, when trying to be different is the main factor between making a good movie and a bad one, maybe simplicity isn't a bad thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps The Village would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth if it weren't billed as a Mystery/Suspense movie. The last half of the movie plays like a family movie, and the ""big twist"" became apparent one third of the way through. Furthermore, the advertising campaigns, the very misleading Sci-fi channel special (similar to the Blair Witch Project's special a couple of years back), and even blatant lies from the parties involved when in a magazine interview, it was stated that this movie was not a Science fiction movie (like Signs), but rather a genuinely scary movie, with actual creatures in it (they even verified more than one creature) gave the notion that this was a very different movie from the finished project. I truly felt mislead when I saw this film, and I hadn't felt this cheated and insulted since the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>Having seen it a second time, I don't think this was a bad movie. Had it been billed as the Disney movie of the week, I might not have even minded it. However, because of its misleading marketing campaigns, and it's weak and not so very thought out plot, I still find it to be the biggest disappointment of 2004."

Surrounding the village is a forbidden forest, where ""Those We Don't Speak Of,"" (glorified dark crystal beasts,) run amok, slaughtering and skinning dogs, leaving their glistening corpses on villagers doorsteps, all sinister-like.

What worm hole does the food, 80 foot banquet tables and fine linen materialize from? Is this the very same wormhole that the script appeared from when it landed on M. Night's desk?

The Village, Please stop him making any more films.<br/><br/>This was his last chance for me, really. Shyamalan is a master of setting, there is no doubt. It is when he just plain uses the ""insert twist you just KNOW is coming"" he falls apart. Let's get this straight with him: He is NOT the master of THE TWIST. He caught a lucky break with the pop culture buzztalk of 6th Sense and that is all. He had master cinematographer Roger Deakins (of Coen Bros. films and perhaps one of the best in the business as far as I'm concerned) working for him, but it's an untapped talent gone to waste in this pretentious wad of ego. He had top acting talents such as Weaver and Hurt, but they are merely skirted to lackluster supporting roles.<br/><br/>(I wanted to give Hurt a dang comb the entire time he was on the screen.)<br/><br/>The plot as you well know, revolves around a 19th century village (gee, hence the title) that is basically kept there by some monsters lurking in the woods.

The Story, predictable.<br/><br/>By the previews I was really hoping for something with some substance. Perhaps a modern interpretation of a pagan myth element come to life in the vein of a Hammer picture? Nope, it was just a Shyamalan-a-thon. A loss of innocence tale done with a generalized heavy hand.<br/><br/>When I went, 8 people walked out when the twist was finally revealed. Were they let down or was it that too many people in the audience were cracking jokes and laughing at this mess?<br/><br/>I know his work is greatly respected by people. His simplicity of story and attention to atmosphere is perhaps the most ambitious in Hollywood, but the mix never really turns out right. It's like oil and water. And with his popularity on the Hollywood A-list, it seems to me that his film-making will only get more ""M. Night Shyamalan-esque"" and that is just a crying shame. 1 outta 5"

It is an experiment in how to become extinct, both - for the movie folks as well as for Mr. Shyamalan. Thankfully the experiment works. One example -He has forgotten to do his homework and has miscalculated on precisely how much of land (area) is needed to sustain a community of 40+ individuals. Unless of course Mr. Shyamalan has arranged for the ""you-know-whos"" to provide the supplies when ever the ""you-know-whos"" visit the village!.

","Okay, I did not expect much from this film and there were no satisfying surprises for me, either.  My wife put it best: M. Night tries to make films that will appeal to an intellectual audience but is not as smart or clever as the audience he thinks he is appealing to, so his movies just seem silly or dumb.  Anyone going to this thinking it is a horror movie is bound to be disappointed - although there are monsters in this film, it seems as if the writer/director actually FAILS to recognize them for what they are: sadly misguided misanthropes who are so smugly self-centered that they feel their piece of fabled security is worth the despicably glib manner in which they utterly fail their children... but that is another story.  This movie plays upon our collective desire for a safe place in the worst, most cloying post-9/11 way, and if it were not for some of the most wooden dialogue outside of an Ed Wood movie making this the director's most laughable film yet, there would be little to distract from the ugliness of the picture.<br/><br/>Rarely have there been films where you find actors struggling as hard to make dialogue believable (and by the end, it is impossible to believe that the characters would have naturally talked that way).  I saw the ending reveal a mile away (from the preview even, though just because I'm a touch cynical and tried predicting what ""surprise"" ending was going to  be in store).  But forgiving that, and respecting that the director clearly uses genre material to draw his audience in with the hope of achieving something which, alas, his talent is not able to deliver, it is still hard to forgive the movie as a whole.  I will grant that it is beautifully shot and has one interesting character and maybe three good performances.  But it has a truly dreadful story, full of attempts at suspense that lead nowhere, and a sickening final act wherein the movie's true monsters present to themselves the error of their ways and completely miss the mark.  In the end, there is no moral message here, although it plays as though there is.  So much the sadder for the audience.  <br/><br/>Leaving the theater, we heard lots of grumbling, not a single nice thing being said about the movie.  This was the Saturday night crowd.

If they had chosen to set up a commune type arena where they could escape the troubles and speed of the modern world, fair enough, so be it. But why would they choose to wear the 19th century clothes and talk like they just arrived from 'ye olde ship crossing the passage from foggy olde London town'? Is it so they can warp their children's minds in being retarded as much as theirs? The music for the film supports this idea with 'sea-shanty' type music throughout, confirming that we are most likely experiencing colonial America.<br/><br/>Now let's move onto the monsters that haunt the surrounding woods that they 'dare not speak of' but talk about them all the time. It is revealed very early on in the film, that there are no monsters, it's idiots running about in done-up suits, keeping anyone from leaving the village. So let me get this straight, in order to protect themselves form the modern world, and the horrible things that happened to them in the real world, they decide to move away to an unknown location (not in today's world), and create a 19th century village where they all dress up and talk like they had just landed in America from Britain. Furthermore, they decide to keep anyone from leaving this new village, by pretending to be monsters running about in the woods that the viewers know aren't real from early on in the film.<br/><br/>Watch this film if you want confirmation that there are more stupid people out there than you realised who will like this film and spent money on it to see it.

Those more discerning victims who weren't so keen on it observed that the movie was Boring, Pointless, Awful and a Snoozefest. Here's another word for it  Pants! And, as IMDb has informed me that this comment is too short to be accepted, here are some more Funereally slow, Ridiculously-plotted, Woodenly-acted, Mind-numbingly and irritatingly-scored and Stultifyingly-derivative. At a mere one hour 43 minutes, it's still just about the longest movie I have ever sat through, and makes Abel Gance's 378-minute 1927 silent epic Napoleon feel a commercial break. Advice?

","M. Night is losing it, as far as making movies goes. I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans. His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of 'material'.<br/><br/>The behind the scenes, DVD, show all that was involved in making ""The Village"". I was particularly interested in how much work and training the Joquen Pheonix did to prepare for his role. I think his total amount of dialoge was about 2 minutes for the whole movie.<br/><br/>At the last check, the movie has grossed well under the approximate budget.<br/><br/>I will certainly think twice before I spent any more money on his movies."
"Superunknovvn","4","5","11","16 February 2005"," Less than average movie
","M. Night Shyamalan is for movies what The Strokes are for music. He's made a critically acclaimed and commercially successful debut and now it's going steadily downhill for him. ""The Sixth Sense"" was highly original and very successful and bought him some time in Hollywood. ""The Village"" indicates that this time is almost over. Shyamalan movies have never been famous for fast pacing. They take some time to get started, but about halfway through you should be well into the story and starting to get all thrilled by the events. The problem with ""The Village"" is, it never gets started. It goes quiet scene after quiet scene with LOTS of whispered dialog. With so much dialog you'd think you get some character development. Wrong! The characters remain shallow and uninteresting and the whole movie is just an incredible bore. The direction is absolutely horrible, too. Why would Shyamalan always shoot people's backs? Seriously, sometimes it seems as if the director just put the camera anywhere and went to have a cup of coffee while the actors were performing. Maybe, the idea was to show how everybody in the village is keeping a secret by shooting people's backs all the time. Even if this was the intention behind it, it was still executed badly and seemed very unprofessional. From the last three movies Shyamalan has made, we know that he always tries to come up with a surprise ending. Problem is, the twist is too easy to figure out this time. Although the idea itself isn't half bad, it could have used some more (or better) story lines around. As it is, ""The Village"" merely would qualify as an episode of Twilight Zone. If Shyamalan doesn't come up with something really great next time the audience is going to lose interest. It's sad because he has shown in the past that he is capable of delivering intriguing and original work in his best moments. ""The Village"" definitely doesn't fall into this category, though."
"trelloskilos-1","3","5","11","18 December 2004"," A great comedy. What do you mean it wasn't supposed to be funny?
","OK, I've watched ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", even ""Unbreakable"", and whilst Shyamalan's films have all been a bit hit-and-miss, ""The Village"" really sets an unprecedented low.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on a village completely surrounded by a forest full of monsters who seem to be attracted to the colour red. The villagers live with the monsters in an uneasy truce, neither of them infringing on the borders. However, when skinned baby animals start appearing from nowhere, the villagers suspect that someone has breached the borders and angered the monsters.<br/><br/>In the village, live Ivy, a blind girl, and Lucius. A quiet, but mature boy. The majority of the plot centers on them and their developing relationship in the midst of the potential peril.<br/><br/>OK, the plot seems capable enough. The storyline does have a twist or two, but the film made me burst out laughing unintentionally several times. (Not a good thing, especially if the film is supposed to be creating an 'ambience'). The actress who played Ivy could not have done a worse job in portraying her blindness. Clumsily fumbling around while stationary, and confidently running through unknown territories, negotiating obstacles and not hitting a single thing. You've got to see her turn corners and wave her stick around. So appalling was this that I found myself sniggering several times over.<br/><br/>Secondly, the dialogue was very long and drawn-out. I know it's supposed to be set in the late 19th century, so the English is very ""olde worlde"", but surely even during this time, people didn't take 30 seconds to deliver a single line.<br/><br/>There are films which do take a while to build up some sort of suspense, then deliver a payoff for the audience's patience. Takashi Mike's ""Audition"" is a great example (although the payoff was a little more gory). Unfortunately, the payoff in ""The Village"" was a flat, and fairly predictable twist. I pretty much knew there was a twist coming, guessed what it was, and surprisingly, was right. Unlike Shyamalan's other films, this twist has been done before.<br/><br/>Perhaps I found this film so funny because I was expecting some form of entertainment, and was gravely at risk of being bored stupid. Maybe I'm a philistine for denouncing such a high profile film in such a manner. Bottom line, though, is that if the film did do its job and offered a semi-decent thriller with polished acting and a more intriguing build-up, I would not be sitting in my chair in fits of laughter at how bad the film is."

","It's far from a perfect film, but I have to give it a 10 to combat the mediocre ratings because of a collective bias against M.

Writers take note. There are various forces that keep the two lovers apart from each other throughout; it's through DISTANCE, rather than through kissing and sex scenes, that keeps the tension strong. and that tension only adds to the thrills. <br/><br/>And the violin score is equally thrilling, haunting and gorgeous.

","On a Monday night, as a sleet/snow storm loomed here in the NYC area, I watched another film from M. Night Shyamalan--my second Shyamalan film in two days, following ""Unbreakable""--and it was another one that I greatly enjoyed: 2004's ""The Village."" In this one, a small, rural, Amish-like community, in what would appear to be the late 19th century, lives in mortal fear of the surrounding forests and the creatures that inhabit it. The writer/director keeps the suspense ratcheted up fairly high throughout, leading to another of his patented surprise/twist endings. Actually, I knew what the ending was before I watched the film; as with ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is almost impossible NOT to have heard about this ending before going in. Still, that did not interfere with my enjoyment of the film, and actually allowed me to marvel out how adroitly the director plays fair with the audience throughout. The picture is gorgeous to look at in high def, and features a most impressive cast of pros: (Ron Howard daughter) Bryce Dallas Howard (whose performance I had enjoyed in the recent ""Jurassic World""), Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg and Brendan Gleeson. I really don't know why this film has been so savaged by critics. Roger Ebert apparently detested the film, putting it on his ""Most Hated"" list, while the Maltin guide calls it ""downright ridiculous."" I suppose that the film is a bit contrived in parts, but that didn't take away from its artful qualities and ability to frighten, for me. Most assuredly recommended!"
"zkonedog","7","2","3","8 March 2017"," M. Night's Final Trickery
","The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are three terrific suspense/mystery flicks from director M. Night Shyamalan. Lady In The Water and The Happening are two of the worst. The Village falls right in the middle; the final time that M. Night truly entranced us at the theater.<br/><br/>I wish I could give you a little plot summary, but this is the type of film where the less known about it the better. I will say this: Whereas today's ""wonderboy"" director JJ Abrams is all about time travel and relative physics concepts, M. Night's trademark was misdirection. You think this movie is about one thing, but in the end it is 180-degrees of surprise.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy the 104 minutes while you can, though, as after this effort M. Night was never quite the same."
"generationofswine","10","2","3","10 December 2016"," An Honest Review
","The hate again is geared to the fact that it is a Shyamalan movie and it's hip to hate on him now.<br/><br/>It always seems to be that way, shocking how many people hate on things because it's hip and not really because of any honestly valid reason: ""It sucks because, because, it's a Shyamalan movie and we all think he's self-important."" The fact is that, yet again, he gave people something new...and they despise him for it.<br/><br/>But not only that it is a great allegory for 2004. Terror threats were common back then. We were told to live in fear. Today is an orange day, be scared. Today is a red day, be terrified. And nothing ever came of it, but a frightened population is a controlled population. It's a population that doesn't explore or ask many questions.<br/><br/>The Village does a great job of expressing that. A society controlled through fear and fear used to hide an enormous secret, to cover up a big lie with another lie.<br/><br/>But again, in typical Shyamalan fashion, it is a subtle parallel. It's one that doesn't stand out in the glaring fashion that you'd see in any other political movie.<br/><br/>And, again, it is original, but because of that, like all his other movies that broke away from the re-boot, re-made, re-hashed style of Hollywood, he got labeled and people hate him for being unique and having the courage to make his own stories come to life."

","The Village (2004): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver: Underrated fourth film by director M. Night Shyamalan who created such bizarre masterpieces as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. A curse surrounds a remote village where the occupants never venture into the forest thus disturbing the creatures of the woods. When such an offense occurs red paint is slashed upon every door and small animals are found skinned and mangled. M. Night Shyamalan brings mood through atmosphere with an underlining sense of suspense through its blind heroine, played by Bryce Dallas Howard who accepts the task of crossing the dangerous territory to obtain medicine. Joaquin Phoenix also entered the forest in acceptance of the same task until fate had other plans. Adrien Brody steals scenes as a mentally handicapped who has penetrated the forest but seen as innocent. William Hurt is effective as a village authority, and Sigourney Weaver plays Phoenix's firm yet concern mother who warns him of the dangers of the forest. Stunning production aid this underrated thriller that seemed to go unappreciated by those who may not have gotten Shyamalan's twisted storytelling here. It contains strong themes regarding sight and strength of the will as a blind woman undertakes what no one dares. Score: 10 / 10"
"TheMovieDoctorful","10","2","3","2 August 2015"," My Favorite Director's Best Movie
","I have no problem admitting that M. Night Shyamalan is my all-time favorite director. Shyamalan is such a master at crafting truly relatable and lovable characters that get you so damn invested and creating worlds both beautiful and haunting. I'll admit that ""The Last Airbender"" was one of the worst movies of all time and ""After Earth"" was outright painful to sit through, but everything else he has done has been decent at worst and perfection at best. ""The Village"" is perhaps his greatest example of true cinematic perfection. It's beautiful, emotional, intelligent, wonderfully shot, wonderfully scored, wonderfully written, wonderfully acted. In my opinion, ""The Village"" is easily one of the best movies of all time, and without a doubt one of the most criminally and tragically under-appreciated.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is also one of the worst marketed movies of all time. In case you saw the trailers or TV spots for this film and got the wrong idea, let me give it to you straight; ""The Village"" is NOT a horror film. Hell, M. Night Shyamalan even went out of his way to CONSTANTLY tell people this film was not a horror movie despite being marketed as such everywhere. While fear is a very important theme in the movie, there are no scares to be found here. ""The Village"" is a romance story with elements of a psychological thriller, and a beautiful one at that. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix simply ooze chemistry, and that really made me all the more invested in what were already truly well written, relatable and likable characters. Their chemistry was just PERFECT. For the sake of spoilers, I can't go TOO in depth, but about 1/2 into the movie something terrible happens to Phoenix's character Lucius Hunt, and you can just feel the horror and pain that Dallas Howard's character Ivy Walker is going through.<br/><br/>As I may have implied, the acting across the board is outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as Lucius Hunt, he is an extremely emotive and impulsive character and Phoenix is able to get a lot of emotional weight into his performance. The criminally underrated William Hurt does a fine turn as Ivy Walker's father Edward. Edward is a good man whose made some VERY questionable decisions for the greater good of the village, and you can really see the pain and regret on Hurt's face.<br/><br/>Of course, the best performance in the movie is without a doubt, no question about it, Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Walker. I love everything about her character; she's a wise teacher beyond her years, she's totally and completely selfless and empathetic, she's unbelievably proactive and brave and she has a desperate hunger for the truth as painful as it may be. Dallas Howard's performance was truly the heart and soul of the movie, she is responsible for the film's most emotional moments and is really something of a role model in how she handles some truly tragic and harrowing situations.<br/><br/>This movie looks and sounds amazing. Everything from the sets to the lighting to the editing just carries this incredible beauty to it. It's truly a work of art. Even the musical score maintains that sense of beauty and artistry that's all over this fantastic movie. James Newton Howard's score can be calm, inviting, tense and emotional, sometimes all at once.<br/><br/>The messages and themes of this movie, such as materialism, fear, love and even the well intentioned but flawed nature of Communism, are also explored in really deep, subtle and meaningful ways. The real antagonist in this movie is fear; Edward Hunt's fear of the corruption and possible death of his family and friends, Noah Percy's fear of losing Ivy, Lucius's fear of commitment. Fear clouds the judgment of many of the film's characters, causing them to make some really questionable decisions. But for most of the characters, it is their love that allows them to navigate their way out of the fog and mist of fear and paranoia; Ivy's love for Lucius, Edward's love for his family, e.t.c.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is a masterpiece and a true diamond in the rough. I can't find a single thing wrong with it, and I love it more and more each time I watch it."

","The Indian auteur burst onto the scene with the classic 'The Sixth Sense' and followed it up with the equally impressive 'Unbreakable.' However, since then, his record at the box office has been shaky to say the least.<br/><br/>In my opinion, 'The Village' (despite receiving mixed reviews) was his last excellent film, although I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea. Those expecting a straight out horror film will be disappointed. And anyone hoping for bucket loads of blood and guts will be sorely disappointed. The Village is a slower affair, moody and well-shot as a group of people refuse to leave their village for fear of the creatures who live in the woods all around them.<br/><br/>Perhaps The Village could be best described as a 'love story,' as the relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is central to the story.<br/><br/>The film boasts an impressive cast, all of whom play there parts subtly and with great understatement, all of which adds to the overall creepy, isolated environment.<br/><br/>It's very possible to enjoy this movie, but only if you're in the mood for something a little more subtle. It's a slow burner if ever there was one, well shot, well acted and often overlooked. Give it a go if you're up for something a little different."

In fact, after it was over, I felt like a was one of only a few people in the audience who were completely enamored with this film.<br/><br/>I knew most people went into this movie expecting a heart-racing, horror-themed thriller... and while that may carry up to it's somewhat bulky ending, it's essence lies with it's gorgeous cinematography, brilliant blocking (of the actors), and an unforgettable soundtrack which should be ranked in any top 10 Best-Soundtrack-Of-All-Time list. Bravo James Newton Howard and Hilary Hahn.<br/><br/>The perspectives in this movie also mesmerized me. Most notably: Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) running blind through the woods. Filming her face only (blinding her along with the audience to where she was running) was a masterful move up in the ranks of Jean-Luc Godard.<br/><br/>The film is listed on Ebert's ""Most Hated"" list... but lately, it has seemed to carry into cult status and has gained a more positive reception.

Instead The Village is good story - within the story lies a horror which is plausible. The movie is a group of people wanting to get away from all the bad things in mainstream modern society and go back to a simpler, more peaceful way of living - or so they thought - and that is where the horror lies... away from modernism.<br/><br/>The entire cast was wonderful in this movie!

"hung_fao_tweeze","6","2","3","19 September 2011"," Worth a viewing
","Shyamalan tries to be a latter day Hitchcock - even down to his cameos. Unfortunately he is lacking something. I've seen Hitchcock's 'Psycho' numerous times and despite knowing the ending I am still compelled to see it again. Meanwhile, I've seen Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' once and am not compelled to see it again. Both movies have twisty endings but nothing in the performances, nuances, camera angles, etc., manage to make me want to see 'Sixth Sense' again. The same holds true for 'The Village'. It's a good story. Everyone in the cast does a good job and the plot twists are very interesting - yet, after the movie ends I don't feel like I've just seen a 'great movie' with layer upon layer of subtle and magnetic character idiosyncrasies. It's all fairly straightforward ultimately. Besides, I pretty much figured it out long before the end. Something didn't quite gel in the props department for me to believe that this was supposed to take place in the time period implied. In all honesty I did think about the film quite a bit afterward. I was mostly wondering how it would hold itself together --- enough on that though. Bottomline: It's a film worthy of a viewing - definitely, but it's like Chinese food -- you'll be hungry in an hour and not necessarily for more Chinese food. I gave it a 6 simply because there is little replay value. It is at least a 7 though."
"mnpollio","Null","2","3","6 August 2011"," Shyamalan well on his way to obscurity
","Director M. Night Shyamalan was considered something of a wunderkind when he burst upon the scene with the hit The Sixth Sense. His follow-up film, Unbreakable, was bound to underwhelm. This was largely because The Sixth Sense was so absurdly over-hyped that nothing could equal it, even though Unbreakable was arguably a more intriguing film. I even enjoyed Shyamalan's Signs, which was a big hit but which detractors slammed because they did not like the final reveal regarding the aliens. Shyamalan's next entry, The Village, is fairly indefensible.<br/><br/>The film is set in some non-descript place and time, although the dress and characters seem to indicate the rural 17th or 18th century. An isolated village is populated by a large number of hard-working folk, who fear to cross the village boundaries lest the evil creatures that inhabit the surrounding wilderness terrorize them in rebuke. There is a love story of sorts with young village blacksmith Joaquin Phoenix spurning the flirtation of flighty Judy Greer in favor of village elder William Hurt's beautiful blind daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, who in turn is the unrequited love of seemingly harmless village idiot, Adrien Brody.<br/><br/>There are a huge number of problems with the film and the majority of them stem from a writing/storytelling standpoint. The biggest problem is that Shyamalan has fallen into a trap wherein he apparently feels his films MUST follow a certain formula. Introduce a conventional story told fairly well and then cap it with a big twist that no one saw coming to make the viewer go back and re-evaluate all that went before. This works well in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, has mixed results in Signs, and fails miserably here.<br/><br/>It is particularly tragic here because Shyamalan handles the opening passages regarding the village, its denizens and their fearfulness of the unknown waiting just beyond the village outskirts quite well. The film captures the flavor of a Grimm fairy tale and there is undeniable suspense when Phoenix, testing the boundaries of the village taboo, moves beyond the village limits and the mysterious creatures descend upon the village to launch an attack during a wedding. If the story continued on in this straightforward vein, Shyamalan may well have had another hit on his hands. Unfortunately, he unleashes one far-fetched and wrong-headed ""surprise"" revelation after another in the final two-thirds that shoot the film in the foot and then run it off a cliff. And for the record, I was able to predict the ""shock"" ending while standing in line looking at the poster and pontificating aloud that if Shyamalan really wanted a crummy climax this is what he would do...and he did it! <br/><br/>Shyamalan has compiled a solid cast, but they are often not well used. One can forgive Shyamalan for having a shocking Hitchcock-style attack on a main character that sidelines them at the midway point, but when one sees where this set-up is going and how wasted the actor in general ends up being, it just becomes lamentable. The only cast member to truly come out of this smelling like a rose is Howard. She is appealing and charming and provides some much-needed energy to the film. By contrast, the normally reliable Phoenix has been instructed to play his role in such an introverted fashion as to appear catatonic. Hurt is uncomfortably affected as the village elder and Sigourney Weaver is sadly wasted as another elder and Phoenix's mother. The film seems to be building to something between her and Hurt, but then forgets about it. However, all of them have it made compared to Brody, who is strait-jacketed into the role of the happy mute idiot who abruptly turns into a psychotic stalker by plot fiat. <br/><br/>Finally, we come to the final third of the film, which puts the nail in its coffin. Sadly, we come to realize that the entire point of this exercise was an excuse for Shyamalan to wow us with this asinine twist. It does not work. It does not work because the story worked immeasurably better when taken at face value. It does not work because a twist without a decent story to back it up is pointless. It does not work because scrutiny of the dates on the cemetery grave markers bely its foolishness. It does not work because it relies upon an almost impenetrable suspension of disbelief in regard to the motivations of the elders. Why would supposedly ""sensitive"" and well-meaning people place their purportedly loved offspring in such predicaments, attempt to rob them of their free will, and then absolve themselves from helping when matters hit rock bottom? This latter is especially irritating when Hurt makes his various revelations to his daughter. After copping to the truth of the reality of the village, why on earth does he not make the final journey himself instead of sending his blind daughter off into the wilderness on an arduous and potentially deadly rescue mission, particularly when time is of the essence? The lack of credibility in these actions is mind-numbing. One can just imagine Shyamalan thinking how novel and suspenseful it will be to send a blind woman off on an adventure without wondering whether it makes any narrative sense to do so. It is also absurd that the film never gives Weaver's character any kind of soul-searching moment in these final passages considering what is at stake. Do none of these village elders have a conscience? Between the misused cast, the narrative and logic lapses, the predictable yet laughable twist ending, and the promising opening squandered on folly, the film is never more than a painful memory and never less than a monument of a filmmakers tragic overindulgence. I would say better luck next time, but alas Shyamalan seems to be on a spiral downward with his subsequent follow-ups."
"despaina","9","2","3","6 June 2011"," A Moving, Suspenseful Film
","I really don't understand why this movie got such mixed reviews. Upon watching again recently, I am still intrigued by it in many ways. The dialogue matches the tone that these characters would create in their conceived society- that of respect and honesty. The backstories of the ""grandmasters"" of the society is compelling and moving. I do not feel creating such a society from their traumatic experiences was outlandish at all.<br/><br/>As for the ending twist, I think Shyamalan did a superb job. For one, I felt it was believable. This, for me, made it all the more intriguing. I'm not sure what audiences or critics were expecting or wanting instead. A sci-fi, improbable ending? Or were audiences disappointed because the ending wasn't scary enough or the explanation was too simple and logical?<br/><br/>In the end, it's unfortunate that films such as this end up being underrated. Why is it that a director's follow-up film has to go above and beyond the previous hit, in this case, ""The Sixth Sense""? And if it doesn't, the director has somehow let us down and hasn't done his/her job? The film should be strictly critiqued on it's own merits, and this film for one, was greatly misjudged."

The Village is a definite autumn movie, like Hitchcocks The Trouble With Harry. The color scheme is amazing, all the tones of yellow from cold bleak woods to warm light of the candles. Everything accented with dark shadows and occasional reds. This is one of the most beautiful movies to ever hit the screens.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also amazing with the violin played by Hilary Hahn. The sounds are a perfect companion to the cold late autumn visuals. The ""Those we don't speak of"" scene may just be one of the greatest moments on film. The combination of sound and visuals is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The story has been bashed many times. In a movie with such powerful artistic touch, I don't see the plot that important, but I also don't see many faults there. There are a few scenes, which may seem a bit ""fantasylike"" and one unnecessary explanation, but despite these, it's a very clever and well thought of story. Shyamalan must have exercised his brain really hard to make the story work, and in my mind he succeeded very well.<br/><br/>Even tho there is a twist in the end, the movie is not completely dependent on it, unless you yourself put all emphasis on it. If you do, you may feel a bit let down, because it's not 100 % in your face revelation. If you only expect the movie to drop you off your chair in the end, you will miss a lot, as this is a movie of emotion and subtle nuances.<br/><br/>It would be fun to see this movie again, without ever seeing it before and never having heard anything about it. Now I feel the first time I saw it was ruined a bit by all the negative hype. As it is, I find myself returning to this movie at least once a year, even if I know the story already."
"freemantle_uk","4","2","3","5 January 2010"," Shyamalan decline begins
","After hitting the world with The Sixth Sense M. Night Shyamalan was considered on of the hottest directors around. He got himself Oscar nominations and was considered to direct Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. His next project was Unbreakable which did fairly well critically, but not so successful at the box-office. His follow-up was Signs, which won critically acclaim, and is a film I like, but has split film fans into lovers and haters. After all that Shyamalan started going down. His next film The Village was not so successful, critically or commercially, before really loosing the plot when making Lady in the Water and The Happening.<br/><br/>The Village is set in a small rural community at the turn of the century. It is run by a good of village elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt), Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) and August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). It seems to function like early colonial towns in America, with town meetings to decide issues. However, this is no ordinary town: in the woods are strange creatures that could attack the village. Anything red is bury because it's considered the bad colour, whilst yellow is the colour of protection. There is a truce between the village and the creature, but something ends up attacking and killing some animals. One of the younger members of the community, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) offers to risk his life to get medicine from the nearest town. He would have to walk through the forest to do this. He believes that the creatures wouldn't attack him because of his noble intentions. But the elders refuse. Lucius also rekindles his friendship with Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind woman and daughter of Edward. They start to fall for each other and end up getting engaged. However, Lucius gets stabbed, and Ivy ends up having to leave the village to get medicine for him.<br/><br/>The Village was marketed as an interesting horror film, but has a was really a film about social control. The social control idea by itself is interesting, but the way it was handle should have been a lot better. I think it would have made a better film as a proper horror film in a period settling. It could have been very scary and effective with a proper fresh twist. But Shyamalan did not do this. Shyamalan is a director who is famous for having a twist in his films. I don't mind that, but if you see that ended up trying to make a more grounded film at the end it ends up making the film fall of plot holes. This twist doesn't work like it did with the Sixth Sense. The writing is the problem, but Shyamalan's direction is decent. He's not perfect but there are some good shots in the film.<br/><br/>The film's main strength is the cast. Bryce Dallas Howard has a strong debut and is a pretty interesting character. Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody are both normally good in their films and they don't break that trend here. William Hurt was a little hit and miss, but he does have a really good moment when arguing with the Elders. However Sigourney Weaver offers a weak performance compared to what she usually does, and Brendan Gleeson's (who I normally like) character may as well not have been in the film.<br/><br/>There are some interesting ideas and decent scenes, but it should have been a lot better."

","This user comment is my own personal feelings, it is not a review that I make in the hope of turning anyone's opinion to that of my own, no mater what anyone says or does, my feelings for the film will never change.<br/><br/>I see a smartly crafted movie about fear and hope, a community living in fear of the outside world, I see involving characters to follow with interest, I see a gorgeous setting that intrigues and engages me.<br/><br/>Manoj Night Shyamalan's fourth mainstream picture is now, as we can all agree, a victim of a terrible marketing campaign, wasn't it? For there are horror elements in the film, of which I don't wish to spoiler write about, the horror elements are there, they just aren't the boo jump scary monster variety that many had hoped for. The ending to the film disappoints many it would seem, but it doesn't to me because it is here that the film has most resonance and the point is well and truly made. It's acted out with style from the majority of the cast, and Shyamalan directs with a steady caring approach. It's not without flaws for sure, but this is a very tidy piece that's saying quite a bit if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board. All told, it's a very solid and thought provoking piece that's made with much film making care. 8/10"
"samhill5215","6","2","3","29 September 2007"," competent but incredible
","First the good: technically, The Village is a visually engrossing, well-crafted and photographed film. The cast is more than up to the task, especially Bryce Dallas Howard who is absolutely engrossing. The basic concept, the pact with the creatures inhabiting the forest that allows the villagers their idyllic existence, is believable if one leans toward the supernatural or at least for its entertainment value. The story moves along with plenty of drama until the moment when everything is revealed and then it all falls apart. Of course there are hints that all is not as it seems, that this is not really a pre-industrial age era. The women's liberated behavior is proof enough that we're dealing with enlightened people here. The problem as I see it is that customary human emotions and faults are not accounted for. How is it that for all these years the leaders (the elders as they're called) of this community have shown no jealousy, competition or envy toward each other. How is it there have been no defections? How did they manage to keep their secret this long? Call me a pessimist, but people are guided as much by these emotions as by the cooperation, goodwill and love the villagers exhibit.<br/><br/>By placing the plot in the present all of these issues come into play and must be dealt with. The fact they were not left me incredulous. It would have been better if the villagers were survivors of an apocalyptic war and the woods were inhabited by mutants. Or if the villagers were actually colonists on an earth-like planet surrounded by aliens in the forest. These scenarios would preserve the fantasy instead of stretching our credulity by expecting us to believe all the villagers (with the exception of Brody's character) were altruists."
"athosusmc","10","2","3","22 October 2006"," Virtue without courage
","Seldom do I wake up in the middle of the night and think about a movie. When I do, I buy that movie. I then ask myself why the film penetrated my imagination so completely and then set out to study every camera angle, every piece of dialogue, every character until I understand. Naturally, this is a time-intensive process but, thankfully, only a handful of movies have affected me like The Village has. I adore almost every aspect of this film; However, I wish to comment on one element that had great impact on me: M. Night made me want to live at Covington. The simplicity, the community, the peculiar but polite speech, the seeming virtue of the place caused a yearning within me. I wanted to be there. But after the second, third and subsequent viewings, I began to question my desire. Covington was a place of traditional values, where men were gentlemen and women were ladies, democracy mixed harmoniously with authority, a place aloof from crime and corruption and danger (somewhat). But in avoiding danger I believe the fictional town sealed its own demise: For all their apparent virtues, the citizens of Covington lacked courage. With the exception of Ivy and Lucius, the population had the moral stature of sheep. The children were taught to fear and to hide. The very foundation of the town was based on running away from problems instead of facing them. As C.S. Lewis once pointed out, ""...courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point... A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions."" The tragedy of The Village, in my mind, is the degradation of that moral conviction called courage that, unfortunately, negates all the intended good that the founders of Covington sought to create."
"Silberfalke","2","2","3","14 March 2005"," Just bad!
","I love art-movies. I love thriller and horror-flicks. I loved ""The 6th Sense"" but whats up with Mr. Shyamalan's Follow Ups? ""Unbreakable"" was okay, ""Signs"" pathetic and bad so I don't know what brought me to try it again with ""The Village"". Okay, the Camera-work is great. So is the atmosphere. But anybody with a brain finds out quickly what its about and is just disappointed by the lame ending, that doesn't live up to the expectations. I'm afraid that M. Shyamalan is desperately trying to repeat the success of his disturbing surprise-end in ""6th Sense"" so he just doesn't think about a strong storyline anymore. The creepy atmosphere of his movies gets more and more boring with any further minute and after a while you just don't care anymore. And the missing logic in the village can not be undone with a thick atmosphere. You are just leaving the theater unsatisfied or ask yourself, why you had to buy the DVD before renting it. Some mistakes you just have to pay for. ""The Village"" is one off them..."
"grghull","Null","2","3","2 March 2005"," Doesn't know its movie history
","Mainstream directors who try to make horror movies without being fans of the genre frequently embarrass themselves. They think they're bringing something fresh and imaginative to the genre without realizing it's been done before, often better. Mike Nichols' WOLF is entertaining when it examines the effects of lycanthropy on office politics but its werewolf scenes are retreads from old Hammer and Universal horrors. Barry Levinson's SPHERE doesn't know it's ""clever twist"" is straight out of FORBIDDEN PLANET from fifty years ago. And M. Night Shyamalan's VILLAGE lifts its central conceit intact from Roger Corman's drive-in classic TEENAGE CAVEMAN without, I'm sure, even knowing it. Even the so-called ""monsters"" looked like the suits in Cormon's old movie. I have nothing against Mr. Shyamalan. I've heard interviews with him and he seems like a good guy. But the ending of his SIXTH SENSE was obvious to anyone who's seen TWILIGHT ZONE a few times, and the ending of THE VILLAGE was just as predictable. I saw it coming from just about the halfway mark, and it frankly made me feel ripped off. He needs to sit down with a bunch of old movies and a stack of FAMOUS MONSTERS and discover that the stuff he thinks he's inventing was invented before he was born. Then maybe the surprise twist of his next movie might actually surprise someone."

"custardpringle","9","2","3","5 August 2004"," Of course the monsters are real . . . (MASSIVE SPOILERS)
","********MAJOR SPOILER WARNING-- DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE********<br/><br/>When reading comments on this movie, what annoys me more than anything is seeing people say that the monsters aren't real. The monsters are real. There may not really be humanoid porcupines in red capes stalking through Covington Woods, but there are most certainly monsters in this movie. Sure, I was disappointed that there weren't any ugly creatures running around tearing out people's guts to see all the pretty blood, but there was so much other cool stuff going on that I really didn't mind.<br/><br/>What the Elders fear, and wish to keep away from their children, are the monsters of greed, jealousy, and hatred, and the people outside the woods who have become consumed by them. When it is said that the Villagers ""have always had an understanding with the creatures,"" the reference is not to the literal but fictional creatures in the wood, but to the people inhabiting the world outside, seen as monsters by the Elders who founded the Village. In this light, considering the common association of animals with fundamental innocence, it is significant that the Elders would choose to found their community inside a wildlife preserve. Animals are also associated with a lack of romantic love, which is even more significant, since love seems to replace money as a fundamental but corruptive motivation for the inhabitants of the Village, as represented by the Villagers' horror of the color red. (Walker is most likely aware of this shift, which may be why he refuses to act on his supposed attraction to Alice, but he is also aware that there is nothing he can do about it.)<br/><br/>However, even in the first generation of children, we can see the Elders' plan beginning to fail. Money-- the corruptive agent particularly abhorred by the Elders-- is unknown to them, but another currency has replaced it: that of love, normally a relatively minor corrupter. A notable example is Ivy's younger sister, who can almost be thought of as an obsessive shopper among men; she becomes covetous of Lucius one day, becomes hysterical when unable to have him, but within days has married someone else without a spare thought for her past ""love."" Even at their wedding reception, though, we can already see her becoming discontent with her prize, and it is not hard to imagine that she will be lusting after yet another man quite soon. Other characters-- Lucius and his mother, for example-- also appear to be more obsessed with romantic love than might be expected from people in the ""real"" world. Noah, however, provides the most obvious example of love-as-money in the film: just like the Elders' loved ones were murdered over money, he attempts to murder Lucius for the perceived theft of Ivy's love.<br/><br/>The supreme irony in The Village, and what I see as the point of the movie, is the Elders' inability to prevent their community from being corrupted. When the skinned livestock begin to appear in the Village-- presumably courtesy of Noah-- the timing coincides with the increasing overtness of the attraction between Lucius and Ivy, and Lucius' final admission of his feelings comes as a direct reaction to the ""monsters"" themselves invading the Village. Again, love is serving as a metaphor for money, and the ""monsters"" represent the corruption of the community to which their relationship will soon lead, and this corruption manifests itself shortly afterward in the attempted murder of Lucius. At that point, Walker realizes that the monsters cannot be kept at bay forever; he is forced to send Ivy-- who is the only practical choice, since her blindness gives her protection against the film's metaphorical monsters-- into enemy territory in order to obtain the very ""weapons"" that will save the Village from its monsters, if only this once.<br/><br/>When the monsters are seen as metaphors, the ending can be read as similar to those of most monster movies. Ivy returns successfully with the ""weapons."" She has not been corrupted/attacked by the monsters, but she has nonetheless defeated one: specifically, Noah, the direct agent of corruption within the Village. With that ""monster"" dead, the community is safe for now. However, the Elders specifically name Ivy and Lucius as those who will continue to maintain the Village's isolation when the founders are gone-- and, through their intense romantic love for each other, they have already been shown to be indirect agents of corruption. As in many other horror movies, the immediate danger has been eliminated, but the future is still uncertain.<br/><br/>OK, didn't mean to write quite that much . . . sorry.<br/><br/>9.5/10, by the way, because Ivy's blindness *was* pretty unbelievable."

","First, I have to disagree with what seems to be the majority opinion. I thought this movie was M. Night Shyamalan second best movie (behind Sixth Sense). It's not without its flaws, but I thought it was very well acted by almost everyone, and WELL worth the time to see it.<br/><br/>But bottom line -- Bryce Dallas Howard steals this movie! I don't know if it's just her, or a combination of herself and her character (great character), but she is truly amazing, and has a great career ahead of her.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie a lot, and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>And if Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't get a nomination for best actress, then some heads and hearts ought to be examined."

","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>There's been a lot of divided opinion on this film, and I do actually understand why someone may not like it, it's not a horror film so don't go in expecting jumps at every corner and bucket falls of gore, nor is it a stereotypical 19th century thriller, the dialogue is all mixed up with modern-day English and 19th century dialect, but that's because the town is created in the idealistic image of the original designers and people who thought up the idea.<br/><br/>Like Shutter Island I would argue that this is infinitely better on a second viewing when you see all the subtle hints that all is not conforming to the usual Victorian rural village life. On my first viewing I would only have given this a 6 or 7/10.<br/><br/>The acting is beautiful and the three main characters played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody is quite frankly Oscar worthy. Every shot is very subversive and surprisingly hands play a huge and abnormal part in this, in the forest each branch is snagging forward creakily as if it's a hand and in the scene where Joaquin's character is stabbed the angle the knife goes in and all four of their hands being in shot is unreal and tense. Also, the music by James Newton Howard is actually fantastic and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard!<br/><br/>Not all critics and people will love this film, and that's fine as everyone has a different view and I understand why this film may not be liked, read Roger Ebert's scathing review of it for example, and he's certainly no fool.<br/><br/>9/10: Unique and worth two viewings if you've only seen it once"

At first glance, this village seems happy , but this close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding forests .At night , animals are mysteriously killed and when one man dares to enters the woods , a retaliatory attack sends the astonishing villagers fleeing to their basements . The evil and foreboding force is so unnerving that none dare venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods. The villagers live simply under the strict leading of a group of veteran people (William Hurt , Sigourney Weaver , Brendan Gleeson , Cherry Jones ,Celia Weston) who forbid them to venture into the neighbouring woods . They talk in fear of those we don't speak of : creatures lurking among the trees ever ready to attack . But when curious, obstinate Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the unknown, his bold move threatens to forever change the future of the village. Their Days Of Peace Are Over . The truce is ending. I: Let the bad color not be seen. It attracts them. II: Never enter the woods. That is where they wait. III: Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.<br/><br/>This eerie and mysterious movie depicts the tale of an isolated town confronting the surprising truth that lies just outside its borders , they live under the control of a few elders until a revelatory twist at the end . M. Night toys with political ideas , but at times , he buries them under an illogical and rather unpredictable tale . Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan got a good feel for the time period, in fact there were nearly 300 people in the scenic and construction department in order to achieve nice settings. Focusing here is on security , self-preservation , frightening to society and conservatism , all key post-9/11 themes , as revealed in the tale of a remote rural community in 1890s America. Main cast and support cast are pretty good , full of young and veteran players such as : William Hurt , Sigourney Weaver , Brendan Gleeson , Cherry Jones , Cherry Jones, Celia Weston , Judy Greer , and of course , Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody . A main draw is the cast as newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter , as a visionary blind girl and other young players as Jesse Eisenberg , Michael Pitt, all of them put in great performances .<br/><br/>Well written/produced and directed by Night Shyamalan . The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving . M. Night delivers his first period piece putting the entire cast through a 19th century ""boot camp"" at a creepy retelling with several surprises and it took the crew about twelve weeks to build the set for the village. Competently produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : ¨Signs¨ , ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in water¨ , ¨The Incident¨ , ¨The sixth sense¨ , with exception for an extreme flop as critical as boxoffice : ¨Airbender¨. Shyalaman usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location . Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable"" , ¨Multiple¨and ""Glass"" belong to the top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy.

Mr. Shyamalan has attempted a very difficult task of creating a horror-like movie with a major twist. In an effort to use audience's past impression of his prior works, Mr. Shyamalan taps into this impression in a major way to create an illusion - the major premise of this film. In an effective, though not entirely satisfactory way, Mr. Shyamalan is able to pull off a very human, sensitive, and thoughtful thriller that reflects more of humanity than on the occult or horror. It is impossible to know if any other director/writer could have improved on Mr. Shyamalan's attempt in this movie since he is operating on a singular premise of fear, horror, and monster-mythology in a way that is perhaps unattainable. He is to be commended for his efforts at an entirely different way to perceive reality and reflects both the confusion in today's world to another alternative way to seeing it that in the end may have not ultimate resolution.

","Daniel Yu March 5, 2017 The Village<br/><br/>With great expectations for my film class, our class started the semester by watching a film called The Village by M. Night Shyamalan. This film started out in suspense, just like how thrillers are supposed to start. The setting seemed like it is set somewhere around the 1700s. The movie starts out with people having worried facial expressions and a sort unpleasant atmosphere. To even further keep the audience on an awkward mood, there is also a failed proposal to one of the characters. With all this happening, we later found out that the village is under constant pressure from a creature that attacks the village. Because of this, people don't leave the village even in an emergency. However, when one of the characters needed medication from an injury, the main character goes in an adventure to through the wood to find the medicine. <br/><br/>This film is not one of those ""action-packed"" film that modern people find these days. It is a slow-paced movie with a rich story line. There are many times when we must think for ourselves to understand what is happening. Therefore, this is a film for higher class thinkers.<br/><br/>Personally, I did not appreciate this movie. There were way too many times when I thought nothing was happening and the story line was not moving forward. I also thought that the setting that was set during 1700s didn't interest me. However, the thing that bugged me the most was the major conflict and the solution of this film. I personally thought that the major conflict of this film is not very important and came out of nowhere. The conflict happened in the middle of the film and came unexpected. There were no follow up or any sort of clue that the conflict was going to happen until it happened. Lastly, there was not a conclusion to the conflict; the movie ended in an abrupt manner. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film only to people that come to think. For viewers that want a straight forward story line, this would be one of the last film that I would recommend. This was a meaningful, but a not-so-interesting film."

However Shamalayan has not his skills as this movie just crumbles unto itself with its boring, endless dull scenes and terrible lack of pace! We have left with some beautiful Gothic American pastoral landscape (as seen in the movie parodied in my title), a few really tense moment but most of the time, i have been bored and used my remote control to give first aid to this comatose movie! It's funny to notice that in 2017 i just kept watching Hurt in movies and that Phoenix is still unable to give us a character with passion!"

It is slow, it is not for everyone, but if you enjoy solid acting, consistency and a good story line then give this a try, some films on IMDb and rival sites have ratings that do not correlate with the actual films standing, this is one of them. I would give the film a higher rating, but i watch a lot, and apart from the likes of, ""IF"" or ""Life Of Brian"" i rarely pass out 9's or 10's. Of course, anything with Mr Phoenix is watchable, he excels in himself and rarely disappoints, and if you ever come across the directors cut of ""Walk The Line"" i strongly recommend you put by some hours for one of his best performances to date"

"jrodibaugh-322-644341","6","1","1","24 June 2015"," Enjoyable, but flawed film
","The premise of this film is that a group of adults each experienced an event so violent and traumatic during their lives that they felt compelled to retreat from the modern world entirely. They set up an isolated commune in a nature preserve, recreated their idea of an idyllic 19th-century way of life, and coerced their children to remain in the village by terrorizing them with tales of ""The Others"" who lurk on the fringes of the village and kill those who stray too far from its borders. <br/><br/>However, in the process of shielding themselves and their families from the big bad modern world, they have also had to cut themselves loose from its benefits. One of these benefits is modern medicine. However, these adults are so afraid to venture back into the violent world they left behind that they will merely sit and cower in the village and allow their children to suffer, die, or miss out on badly needed psychological treatment rather than go for help. <br/><br/>The only one in the village whose love is greater than her fear of the outside world is, ironically, a blind girl. She ought to have the most to fear from leaving the village alone, but at the same time she is the only one who CAN leave without destroying what the villagers have created because she can't see the truth of what they've left behind. Additionally, we should note that this girl has already experienced great trauma (losing her eyesight), and has not allowed it to ruin her life. Therefore, it stands to reason that she is the bravest out of everyone in the village and is able to overcome her terror of the outside world to obtain the medicine she needs to save her fiancé. <br/><br/>The problem with this film is the setup. During this period of his career, Shamalayan's name still carried a great deal of weight. People expected him to present a huge mystery with a mind-blowing twist at the end. That's what he does here. He creates this entire world of the village where everyone is afraid of ""the Others,"" whoever they are. He sets up this whole mystery about who ""the Others"" could be and what they might want . . . and then it turns out to be a bunch of control freak elders who started a cult and would rather let their own children go blind or die than walk five miles to get some antibiotics. It requires too much suspension of disbelief, and feels like a betrayal of trust that the director had you invest so much time in a construct that turned out to be a lie that was ultimately not worth saving. The film is obviously trying to say something deep about the nature of fear and love, but the twist feels cheap. <br/><br/>But the film is worthwhile for Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. I've been waiting a while for Howard to star in something that showcases her talent. I guess I'll have to wait a bit longer. She seems to be landing film roles, but they're mostly girlfriend roles or small parts in blockbuster films. I think she's a good actress, and if you like her, then you should definitely watch this one."
"Samiam3","Null","1","1","16 May 2010"," Beautiful, Eerie, and psychologically frustrating
","As I was exiting the theatre when the Village ended, I was not happy. It wasn't so much that I was disappointed, but rather that I was annoyed. I expected a ghost story, and what I saw was more of a psychologically themed, semi-thriller, with a lame third act twist that almost turns the Village into two different movies. The second time I viewed it was years later, and somehow, I think I saw it in new light when I realized what Shyamalan was trying to do. The Village is enjoyable if approached a certain way. There is something kind of primal and antique about the nature of the film which is distinctive. It is fairly aesthetic for a horror movie, yet there is the catch. This isn't really a legitimate horror movie, and if you attend it with that mind set, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Set in late 19th century Pennsylvania, the story takes us to a charming little village in the woods, and introduces us to our prinicle characters. We have Ivy Walker, and her two best friends, Luscious Hunt and Noah, who is a harmless but unstable. The village remains at peace, just as long as no one enters the woods which surround it. Lurking within, are 'Creatures they do not speak of'. At the halfway point a violent incident, leaves Luscious on death's door step. With his condition almost beyond help, Ivy wants to travel through the woods to fetch medicine from 'the towns' on the other side. The Village are seemingly unwilling. There reason's for disliking the towns have remained secret, but now could be the appropriate time to reveal the truth, when lives are at stake.<br/><br/>With its beautiful score, and photography and occasionally cute banter, The Village is quite charming, but when it wants to, it can turn quite eerie as well. The film sets itself up well, and as it progresses it gives us an exiting idea of what is to come, and then suddenly, it flips its wheels on us. The twist that Shyamalan throws in at the beginning of the climactic act, almost literally turns the premise of this film into an illusion. It is presented in a way feels sloppy and not very clever. <br/><br/>Depending on how you look at it, the twist could be a positive or a negative. Seeing as it spoils the chance for a dramatic climax, I call it a negative. It is clear however, that the Village has something to say about human nature. Shyamalan wants us to ask ourselves, what is it that we choose to do when we are driven to question whether there is any good in life. <br/><br/>The village in the end is kind of a morality story. It turns out not to be a bad movie, but it does something that cheats everyone in the audience who goes into the film expecting edge of seat suspense as good as that in Sixth sense or Signs."
"extantabstractxx","7","1","1","6 May 2010"," Oh Shyamalan, you done it again
","The Village is a suspense/thriller by M. Night Shyamalan. I thought it was good, though a bit slow. To sum it all up, if you like typical M. Night movies and stories, you will like it quite a lot. It takes a little while to offer real explanations for the behaviors of the villagers, but it is also easily predictable. At times the movie can be a bit scary, but I would not call it a horror flick, as the scares are short and don't do much more than make you jump a little. The movie is relatively clean of plot holes, except for the blind girl being able to navigate her way through a dense forest alone with nothing but a stick. I was pleased with the beginning and middle of the movie, but the ending was extremely disappointing. It ends with a pretty bad cliffhanger, as is typical with M. Night's movies. The concept of the movie was well-thought out, and kept me captivated throughout the movie. It would have been a bit more exciting, however, if it was not so predictable. If you get lost in the movie, however, I believe it would be fun to watch and not hard at all to pay attention to. I also liked the costumes for the creatures, they were enjoyably creepy."

","""The Village"" had a very interesting plot. The whole village was made up of people who went to a counseling center to recover from a horrible thing happening in their life. They cut themselves off from the rest of the world and led a simple life based back in the 19th century. Personally I find that idea rather dumb but agreed with the intentions behind it. The director did a good job at hiding most of what was going on and revealing it slowly only as needed as the movie progressed. I enjoyed the fact that the three misfits of the village are the main characters and how much joy the village idiot brought to the film. Although most of this movie left many questions unanswered, overall it was OK. I think the movie was a little dry at points but that is to be expected from something of that time period. I was confused at how the village idiot just magically knew where the blind girl was in the woods or as to why he didn't speak to her knowing it was the girl he had feelings for. The blind girl did a good job at bringing the movie an extra sense of suspense because she had no idea what most of the noises would be in the woods. I think that overall the actors did a good job at telling a drawn out and semi captivating story. Although to me the ending was very dry and pretty much just ended without explaining what was to happen to the village."
"harryelsucio1212","Null","1","1","4 June 2007"," The Emperor's New Clothes
","Much has been said already so I shall be brief. This film made me immensely sad - which, in a way, was a good thing because it was all that prevented me from falling asleep with probably the severest attack of boredom I have experienced whilst watching a film. I was sad at the thought of a magnificent cast being so wasted, and because this subcontinental director of undoubted talent who could produce films like ""The Sixth Sense"", which I never tire of seeing again and again, and the lesser masterpiece, ""Unbreakable"" should turn out such pretentious rubbish as this and ""Signs"" (whose star also has the irritating tendency of taking himself too seriously).<br/><br/>The film is a fine example of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" of the H.C.Andersen story. Self-styled intellectuals patiently enduring the pedestrian unfolding of the plot at somewhat less than the speed of a Japanese tea ceremony, can see all manner of portentous and significant things invisible to more modest eyes like my own. It is as when a talented and competent painter finds he can get ahead better by squeezing a tube of Chinese white on a plain dark blue canvas instead of sticking to his original technically and inspirationally demanding style appreciated by the man-in-the-street. Though this strategy, if strategy it be, appears ,quite deservedly, not to have been a commercial success for Shamalyan.<br/><br/>I was especially sorry for the wonderful Adrien Brody, perhaps even sorrier than when he was being brutalized by the Nazis (except for one nice officer) in Polanski's ""The Pianist"". But, in a way, this actor disclaimed any responsibility for this fiasco by playing the village idiot! However, I should imagine that most if not all of the cast secretly wish they had never had anything to do with it.<br/><br/>I give the thing 3/10 stars: one out of respect for the misused cast and the talented but ill-advised director; one for the highly competent technical side of the production; and one for the music which was nominated for an award and, as befits a good soundtrack,does not impinge upon the consciousness of the viewer even when he is dozing off."
"refresh_daemon","6","1","1","5 February 2007"," Well directed, but the plot puts holes in the film
","Like many of his films, M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense film has many things going for it. For one, Shyamalan is a very talented director. He has a great grasp of what it takes to direct art and is very obviously influenced by a master, Alfred Hitchcock. His attention to artistic details, including mis-en-scene, color, kinetics, framing, diegetic manipulation and so forth are all top-rate. He peopled the film with a very capable cast. And he's very capable of plotting very twistily. This film has a great number of surprises and if you don't like being fooled, you will not like this film. Despite the fact that you go in knowing that there will be a very major plot twist, he still gets you. That's impressive.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some glaring problems with this work. First of all, the dialogue is filled with excessive verbiage and unnatural phrasing. It's not quite inane, like Lucas' latest endeavors and fortunately, after being immersed in it long enough, you stop noticing it, but it immediately distances the viewer. Secondly, it's lacking in story. True, Shyamalan is a very capable plotter, but when it comes to providing a strong and compelling story, this film lacks it. Motivations and characters don't always follow correctly and he creates a particular character, seemingly because he needed that character to tie his plot together, which takes away from the writing's credibility and also threatens to expose his plot--which I was usually able to keep ahead of.the plot, although at times, I was indeed fooled like most. Lastly, the film isn't able to keep itself controlled because of the need to follow the plot. Holes exist and inconsistencies appear that aren't really explainable, despite my attempts to defend them.<br/><br/>When the film ended, I thought I saw one beautifully directed, well acted, but ultimately shallow film, particularly because of the emphasis on plot over story. With the right co-writer or script, I think he's going to be capable of a whole lot more, but I think it's time to take the actual storywriting a little bit out of his hands. It helped the aforementioned Lucas, it will likely help Shyamalan. Still, as far as a suspense thriller with a whole lot of surprising craziness and strong direction, it remains quite watchable. But I'm guessing it will be a divisive film to its audience. 6/10. Make your own call."
"drystyx","9","1","1","6 November 2006"," Good movie, part easy to guess (but in good way), part surprising
","I don't believe anyone could dislike this movie. It has a soft style, and is directed and written with an emphasis on ""Twist"", with a logical sequence which keeps the viewer guessing, but informed. It is probably best described as an actual horror movie, but not one of those ho hum slasher movies of which there are so many it is hard not to be numb to them. Instead, this relies on acting, story telling, writing, and directing, and I dare say it succeeds admirably. In an isolated village (and the viewer keeps wondering why it is isolated, and that is explained little by little), the elders warn the younger members that there are hostile creatures in the forest which won't bother them as long as they stay in the village. There are secrets kept by the elders, but also secrets by some younger people. The writer, director, and others involved in the movie, knew most of us would guess right on the secrets of the elders quite early, so they provided another surprise that was harder to guess at involving the younger generation. On reflection, the viewer is left to wonder whether this was the end result of the decisions of the elders or it would have happened anyway. To say more may spoil the movie, but it has a lot of messages, and a lot of entertainment value, and it is scary in parts, and the characters are all valid and likable (to some extent). I'd be very surprised if someone didn't like this movie. Very well done."

This movie revolved around some throwbacks from the 1700's who live life in peace and there is a Sasquatch that scares them all. This sasquatch is very different in that it has claws that can tear you apart. In one scene, Bigfoot is running around in the forest and the kids try to test how BRAVE they are by standing on a platform and taunting the yetti. I won't reveal what happened. All I can say is that there were torches lit on fire for a special effect. The yetti turns out to be much more than we expect. To say that there is a twist in this film is a gross understatement. You will never look at Sasquatch again in the same way after seeing this movie. I would kick bigfoot out of the village if he came to my town."

"ryan_kuhn","6","1","1","23 July 2005"," ""Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.""
","M. Night Shyamalan has made some of my favorite movies: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. Now he has written another movie that has what is now known as the ""twist ending,"" something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village. I wouldn't dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie takes, but I will say, it disappoints to a degree. It is not a ridiculous ending, but what could have been if Shyamalan had trusted his original premise of a 1890s Pennsylvania countryside village terrorized by creatures who patrol the surrounding woods. We get the usual eerie mood that Shyamalan has given us before. The Village excels in the isolating feeling that we got in Signs. I might be the only person to admit to liking Signs, but I appreciated the humanized battle between one family and invading aliens. Here in The Village, we have one town, cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of creatures who limits their abilities to even treat their sick and injured. The pace of the movie is slow and moody, especially through the orange tint and effective soundtrack. The village is lead by a counsel of elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt) who is father to two daughters, including the blind Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Ivy has a childhood fling with the local mentally challenged man Noah (Adrian Brody) but ends up falling in love with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical supplies. After Noah causes harm to Lucius, Ivy decides she's the one to go out into the woods and find medical help. This is where the movie goes from moody mythical theater to that movie with a ""twist"" ending. I wanted more, dammit. I don't think I'm the only one. I was intrigued by the creatures, and I didn't like how Shymalan dealt with them. Sure, there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie played out, but it could have been more. I didn't hate this movie, but I kind of hated how it ended. Mr. Shyamalan, for your next movie, perhaps the best ""twist"" is no twist at all."

","I think this movie is actually quite over rated, rather than under rated. Not because I'm a horror fan, because I know that hardcore puzzle seekers would also be disappointed. True, the plot itself was rather interesting, and the twist was even better, but it was poorly played out in my opinion. Not giving enough time for the viewers to gather the required fear and suspense to be able to go ""Oh, my goodness!"" once the secret was revealed. It was horrible timing. They picked a really dull part to announce the secret, and there wasn't much ""important"" events beforehand either. In fact, if they waited a little longer, and made a couple changes to the story, it would have been really cool. Most puzzle lovers would be bored, as there isn't much to think about, and no great mysteries except for the main plot. The horror fans will find it distasteful. It leaves a few pointless scenes around as well. Scenes that really don't make sense in the long run. I would post them but I don't want to spoil anything. It just seems that this movie wasn't well thought out in the long run. It seems slapped together and rather dull. Questions unanswered, even though there are no open endings. Maybe I just think too much."

","This was maybe because I have only previously seen 'The Sixth Sense' as another horse out of the same stable, and so I couldn't be crushed by following the supposed downward spiral of the writer director's filmography. Or maybe because I wasn't expecting too much from a film. But, bar the occasional dodgy line to mask a plot hole (about the floor boards in the Quiet Room), I enjoyed 'The Village'. It actually made me jump, the explanation was backed up sufficiently well (I believed the back-filling - in an eccentric storybook style, anyway), and the second revelation was quite spooky (the first was a little pathetic for anyone not living a Brothers Grimm tale). Even the touch of sending the blind girl out was well done. As long as you don't expect movies to deliver the meaning of the universe, and just enjoy them as entertainment - and as long as you close your eyes and ears to the reviews of those who know the twist - this is a great film."

","You'd think it was an ordinary little town but take a step into the surrounding woods and it may be your last. With The Village, Night has proved himself a master of the Hitchcock suspense genre. But be forewarned, although it is superior in some ways, if you head into this movie expecting The Sixth Sense you are in for a disappointment. It's not your classic 'BOO' horror flick, nor is it an Aliens vs. Predator special effects blockbuster, but that's not to say it won't keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Just as eerie takes of Philadelphia's Gothic architecture chilled us in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan's The Village works its magic through the ghostly Pennsylvanian woodlands. It's cold, dark, and unsettling but the people carry on by abiding to the three rules that keep the creatures away. That is until one defiant villager crosses the forbidden line... <br/><br/>Although not a special effects movie, the visuals are quite stunning. Night also recognizes the essential element for creating suspense, music. The film is accompanied by one of the most amazing musical scores in a decade. Furthermore he demonstrates his keen eye for talent. This all star cast fits perfectly into their roles and envelopes the story as though it was written specifically for them. Most note worthy are the outstanding performances by Adrien Brody who plays the mentally handicapped Noah Percy and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Daughter of Director Ron Howard) who makes a stellar debut performance as Ivy Walker, the blind schoolmaster and romantic interest. Having won the part without even auditioning, Bryce brings each scene to life with her mere stage presence. Hopefully we will see more of this talented young actress in the years ahead. <br/><br/>The Village reaches out beyond his past works and captures the audience with a much more powerful emotional attachment to the characters, especially Bryce Howard's Ivy Walker. The result is a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking take on human nature (fear, love, and sorrow) with a few of Shyamalan's trademark twists. Unlike his second and third works, however, they are much more relevant to the story and fit more seamlessly into the mix. Overall, less of a horror flick than a suspense drama Night takes us on a less traditional rout. A path in which he has truly excelled, having both directed and written this, his best work since his original masterpiece. Excellent 10/10"

","While watching this film it started to become very apparent to me that M. Night Shyamalan and his cousins he teamed up with to the write this film. They decided to make a film with a great premise of a story line, and take that base idea and subsequently create a series of ideas that changed the first thing they made you believe true; one thing at a time. Just barely enough to make you accept the change and make you want to continue to believe in the original storyline. The only problem with doing it this way was, the writers decided to justify each change after the first with an even more rediculous far fetched Fairy Tale make believe concept than the last.<br/><br/>The Village went from A-Z(A being the original great premise and Z being the Stupidest concept of all), and in between it made D, dumber than C, which was more ass-nine and more make believe than B and so on. This film did this from B-Y. Putting twists and changing what the audience is made to believe while watching a film, is something that M. Night Shyamalan has recognizably done before.( The Sixth Sense , Signs ) Which till this film was made moderately acceptable and did not make the film suck monkey balls. When done in excess it made me and all the people I went along with want to walk out multiple times during the film. The Village could easily compare to a bad episode of days of our lives. The only accomplishment in this film was it's absurd ability to make people believe in such a rediculous made up bull-sh*t story. Even more than the biggest one of all.

And despite comments to the contrary, Night does not waste any moments in weaving his web. As a matter of fact, anyone who says they got the full measure of this movie in one sitting: a)is far above the mental processing curve, b)took in way too much pre-flick information or c) is deluded.<br/><br/>
I will not give away any details other than to say that they thought they could escape it, but it found them and their children. Now their survival hangs in the balance. Well written, well acted, well done. I rate this 8 of 10."

","The reviews I have seen here and other places are way too scathing. I don't know if people were just expecting too much and were disappointed when they didn't get it or what. But this movie had tons of twists, and there was subplot, there were multiple main plots, it was diverse and complicated but at the same time entertaining and easy to understand. It kept you guessing and on the edge of suspense and fright without actually showing you anything blatantly scary for the most part. <br/><br/>I'm usually really good at guessing the surprises of movies, and when my friends and I saw the movie we guessed some of it, but were really thrown off by other parts. No one really saw Lucius being stabbed, half of us guessed it was set in modern times, and maybe half of us guessed that the creatures werent real, but most of us were thrown off by the creature (Noah) in the forest that showed up when Ivy was walking. I think people that say ""I guessed the whole thing, it was bad and it wasn't as scary as i expected"" were just hyping themselves up too much, or they are full of crap. Stop being so critical and ENJOY a movie for once!"

","I saw the screening last night for the Village at work. I work at the movie theaters, showcase cinemas. I saw it with a house of about 40 people, mostly teenagers from work (like myself). I even watched Unbreakable today with my film-making partner to prepare myself for the newest M. Night Shyamalan masterpiece. And unlike EVERYONE I saw it with, I loved the movie. The premise was intriguing. Adrien Brody's performance made the movie for me. And I loved the creatures. I loved the story. I loved the twist. But don't get confused, the twist isn't the ending. The ending is a reintroduction to the main points of the film, and after viewing the twist, and the subsequent ending, I'm still in awe, and still trying to fathom some sort of understanding of it. I'll need to see it again, probably a couple more times. But it's definitely a movie worth seeing at least once, even if you don't like Shyamalan's work."

","A friend of mine, who belongs to the Brandywine Conservancy, invited me along to enjoy the private screening of The Village. Free food and drinks were thrown in - so how could I refuse. As for the movie, I honestly expected M. Night to provide a surprise (just as he does with all of his films) - but in reality - he delivered a number of surprises, especially after the first act gets underway. Joaquin Phoenix is on his way to becoming an intense presence on screen  not quite like his role in Gladiator  but in a more silent, deep-seated, moody aura  which worked well with the films rather tranquil, but unnerving environment. In all, the movie takes you on a well-woven plot that actually twists at some very unexpected places, which made me take a step back and attempt to stop assuming what the ending may be like, and simply enjoy the story for what it was  a 'story'. There was a strong tapestry of characters and scenes that held each and every moment together, tightly, so there was really no room for error. All of the acting was top notch, and was delivered with impeccable performance. There was not one person in that cast who did not offer a hint or two, just to keep the story surprising and worthwhile. In fact  I can't wait for the DVD to show up on Amazon - so that I can freeze certain frames just to catch some of the hints and tips that were offered throughout the movie. If you liked The Sixth Sense, then you will like (better yet, enjoy) The Village."

","I must admit that I kinda waited and wanted to see this film. The concept and settings sounded scary and I thought that there would be great potential. Luckily enough, I never saw this pile of crap in the cinemas and instead saw it on TV a long while later. I would have been utterly furious if I ever saw this trash in a real cinema as it would have wasted an entire evening.<br/><br/>First of all, the really terribly titled ""Those we don't speak"" of - I really want to slap the genius who came up with that terrible voldemort-ripoff lame name, don't even exist. Its just a costume that the villagers wear to scare their own from escaping the village. Oops. Did I give away the MNS twist? No, there must be another right? The creatures must really exist and they show up in the end right? NO. The entire twist was what was already described. The movie thus ends halfway through and the rest of it is an absolute waste of time.<br/><br/>This in no way, qualifies as a horror flick. Firstly, how can creatures that at best, remove the fur from small, dead animals, be considered such a huge threat? Even with one not realising that the creatures are a farce, their supposed crimes are almost always trivial and get over-reactions from the dumbass villagers. You'd think that all these bare faced flaws would be made up by the great twist at the end, but no such twist exists. The crap mentioned before doesn't qualify as the twist.<br/><br/>If thats not enough, Shyamalan has the balls to throw the most annoying and irritating cast of characters ever seen in cinema history, at the audience. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always but the rest act plain weird and their acting skills are'nt good enough to make it look like realistic weirdness. Ivy should go down in cinema history as the most annoying, 1-dimensional character ever conceived. You'd think that she'd get eaten by the monsters but they don't exist, remember? <br/><br/>There was only one memorable scene in this movie which has sadistic comic value. The two sequence of scenes where Joaquin Phoenix's character gets proposed to by Ivy's sister were hilarious. If there were more such scenes, actually utilizing the weirdness of the annoying characters, perhaps the movie may have even been watchable. All in all, this movie is a shallow character study of retards and should be avoided."

I really appreciate the focus on the villagers. The film focused more on building relations with the characters within the village rather than focusing solely on the creatures. A lot of symbolism and literary terms within the film which I appreciate. The Village seeks your attention and your mind rather than just your wits and reaction. Its about understanding the people and understanding the story. I thought it was very well done. This movie was an almost perfectly made thriller.

","2004's THE VILLAGE marks the beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace as director, following the double-whammy of THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. SIGNS was okay, but THE VILLAGE displays the kind of self-indulgence and sense of make-believe that scuppered the likes of the progressively worse LADY IN THE WATER and THE HAPPENING.<br/><br/>Despite the novelty of the storyline (in which an Amish-style community are terrorised by monsters in the woods, but nothing is what it seems), THE VILLAGE falls flat purely because of its sense of artificiality. The performances are all mannered and stilted despite the considerable talents and experience of principle cast members (including Weaver, Hurt and Brody) and the storyline seems gradually more and more silly as it unravels.<br/><br/>Come the end, instead of being wowed by the umpteenth twist (although I'd already guessed some of the major ones), you're left thinking: is that it?

"JamesHitchcock","7","3","6","21 January 2008"," A haunting parable of modern life
","The twist- a sudden, unexpected development- is a common plot device in the modern cinema, especially in thrillers. Unfortunately for scriptwriters, most of the classic twists have been so over-used that they no longer come as a surprise to the audience. It no longer seems original to reveal that, for example, the hero's girl or best friend is really in league with the villains, or that a police officer investigating a crime is in fact responsible for committing it, or that a character believed to be dead is still very much alive.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that a particular twist is so hackneyed as to have become a cliché does not prevent film-makers from continuing to rely upon it- ""Reindeer Games"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" are two examples of modern thrillers likely to leave audiences with a ""seen it all before"" feeling. The challenge to the really inventive scriptwriter is now to come up with as novel a twist as possible. ""The Village"" is a good example.<br/><br/>The film is set in a rural village in Pennsylvania, situated in a valley surrounded by dense forests. At first we are led to believe that the date is 1897. It soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary village. It has the air of a religious commune, although the precise nature of the villagers' beliefs is not made clear. The community is governed by Elders, who lay down strict rules. The villagers are forbidden to set foot outside the valley. The neighbouring towns are regarded as places of sin and corruption, while the surrounding woods are the haunt of mysterious beings referred to only as ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". For a long time we do not see these beings, and it is left unclear as to whether they are humans, or animals, or some form of supernatural entities. The colour red is forbidden because it is associated with these creatures; the favoured colour is yellow, referred to as the ""safe colour"".<br/><br/>The plot seems a fairly simple one- as another reviewer has pointed out it resembles something from Thomas Hardy. A young man, Lucius, and a blind girl, Ivy, are in love, but their love arouses the jealousy of Noah, the village simpleton, who is in love with Ivy himself. Noah stabs Lucius in a jealous rage, seriously injuring him. The wound becomes infected, and Ivy begs the Elders to be allowed to travel into the nearest town to obtain the medicines which might save his life. They agree, reasoning that as Ivy is blind she will not be able to see the temptations of urban life and is therefore less likely to be corrupted by them.<br/><br/>Then comes the twist. For the first time we realise that the film is set not in the 1890s but in the twenty-first century. The community has been set up by the Elders as a refuge from what they see as a crime-ridden society. (Several of them have themselves been victims of violent crime). Ivy's wealthy father Edward was the leading light in this scheme, and the man responsible for financing it. They have retreated into an imagined past, denying the members of the community the benefits not only of twentieth and twenty-first century technology, but also of many inventions (such as cars and telephones) which actually existed in 1897, the year in which the villagers believe they are living. ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" are imaginary beings, invented by the Elders to deter the younger members of the community from setting foot in the woods which separate the village from the nearest town.<br/><br/>In this context of the film, the twist comes as an unexpected one, but, on reflection, the situation is perhaps not as bizarre or outlandish as it might appear at first sight. There are parallels between the village and real-life religious communities such as the Amish or Mennonites which forbid their members to use modern technology. The difference, of course, is that the village Elders take the principle one stage further by attempting to deceive their members about the true nature of the modern world they are rejecting, something that the real-life communities would not do. There may also be parallels with the modern phenomenon of the ""gated community"", another attempt by the select few to shut themselves away from the perceived violence of modern society. Some have even seem parallels with American foreign policy.<br/><br/>None of the acting performances are particularly noteworthy, except possibly that from Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron) as the blind Ivy. What is, however, noteworthy is the way in which director M. Night Shyamalan is able to conjure up an atmosphere of dread and foreboding. The look of the film is based upon the works of the artist Andrew Wyeth, although Shyamalan's palette, dominated by warm yellow and orange tones, is rather richer than Wyeth's. (Much of the film was shot near the artist's home town of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania). Despite the warm colours and the beauty of the rural landscapes, however, the village always has an eerie, haunted air about it.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is sometimes described as a horror film or as a thriller, but neither description really seems adequate, as it is a difficult film to fit neatly into any one genre. Perhaps the best description would be as a haunting parable about modern life and the dangers of nostalgia. The irony of the film is that Lucius falls victim to the violence which the Elders are trying to escape; the only difference made by their retreat into the past is that he is denied the modern medicines which might have saved his life. 7/10"

Not to digress into Signs which still baffles me as to one of the worst endings in a big-budget movie ever, The Village REAKS of a quick fix ending as bad as a 'it was just a dream' wake up revolution/solution.<br/><br/>It's like a very short story dragged out in character over development to fill time. It could of been filled with some sort of believable explanation for the children in the beginning as to HOW they got in the situation, and sustained their lifestyle for any period of time. Nothing was done to give a sense of history of the village itself, leaving a huge gap to be filled in trying to make a viewer believe any of this. Have so many people lost their common sense to be able to enjoy this film in any way? Without giving history and making the town completely trapped by the 'people of which we do not speak' we have to believe: That somehow all of their clothes, glass, metals, paint, leather, candles, and lumber mysteriously materialize and come with a never ending supply with no help from the outside world. It is IMPOSSIBLE to sustain life as they do without resources far and beyond what we are shown in the movie. There are so many holes in this alone it is inexcusable. How stupid does he think we are?? There are no vast farms, or cotton, or iron ore mines or foundries, or glass blowers(or sand), or sheep, or, well, never mind, its numbing just thinking about it. Sharpening one blade does not give any history or atmosphere to this movie to make it even 1% believable. There are not nearly enough people in town to have any free time not producing the necessities of life. With some of the children being over 20 years old they would of MAYBE asked where the hell all this stuff came from, don't you think? Apparently the only LOGICAL way this town could ever come into being is that the town was entirely built, and endless food, clothing, candle, and metal supply stored somewhere, and then a handful of adults and a gaggle of infants dropped in and raised over a couple generations, with NO history. Who the hell built the boundary markers?(let alone not bright enough to add a FENCE). And where did the wood they gratuitously use come from if not the FOREST. The first time I saw this movie this was coming to light within the first hour, the second viewing makes it painfully obvious. Stupid.<br/><br/>Not to mention books, and if we are venturing to attempt to believe this possibly makes any sense, language. How did English speaking settlers get here? A 1 minute 'history' is attempted near the end of the movie, but it equates to a populous 'air drop' implied above. He also gives her a mission after telling his daughter it's a lie, yet we are supposed to be scared of the 'monsters', oh, and send the blind girl.... Why would she be afraid of now 'fake' monsters anyway? Come on.<br/><br/>And the ending??? whatever. Signs was stupid, this is beyond it if its possible. Take your brain out of your head and put it on the coffee table and watch the film, its the only way you can watch it more then once. If the movie had an 18th century 'end' it might of had a chance. The movie should of been named ""Holes"" or ""stupid kids"".

I would of given it 5 stars if it were just bad directing and editing, but only 2 because some semblance of 'intelligence' is attempting to be implied.<br/><br/>View it once its like wtf was I really THAT robbed of a conclusion?

","I'd hate to be any director who hits a grand slam on his first try. I have to give Shyamalan credit for his effort on this one. ""Signs"" fell short, and seemed contrived and a little preachy. This one, whether you guess the secret or not is at its heart a very pleasant love story. First J Phoenix's presence is so intense and strong that you almost whither when he speaks. B D Howard is precious. I fell in love with her in this movie. The ending is abrupt, and I guess that's my greatest criticism, but by then I was so caught up in the depth of love she feels for Phoenix that I didn't care. When he announces, after several scenes during which he says little or nothing, almost angrily that he will dance with Howard at their wedding, and her sightless face is pointed towards his, there is no gushing emotion, or even a smile from either actor, but Howard's head moves after having been motionless for his whole diatribe, and moves in such a subtle and loving, pleased, emotional manner that you want to reach out and kiss her. She is a gem. I'll watch anything with Phoenix in it, and I guess my only general complaint about the movie is the same one that any movie portraying a sightless character with a sighted actor is that when you are blind, even if not from birth, your eyes lose their ability to move in tandem, the lids don't function as normal. No actor could pull this off, of course, but sometime I'd like to see a sightless role played by a sightless actor, not just someone trying really hard not to focus on anything. I watched the movie twice, and I rarely do, but the second time through, once the scary stuff was out of the way, I saw the love story underneath."

","This is certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The reasons are numerous but the biggest reason is that the ""twist"" was no surprise at all! It was terribly obvious (Iam going to tell you if you read on). And seeing how the ""twist"" was the main engine driving the movie, this really destroyed the entire plot. Even if the surprise real was a surprise it was still a STUPID surprise -PEOPLE IN PORCUPINE COSTUMES... COME THE F_CK ON!!!! The movie probably has some redeeming qualities such as decent acting, nice sets, etc., but the whole foundation and story of the movie was terrible so it is nearly impossible to enjoy anything about it. What makes this movie worse than other terrible movies is that you expect it to be good, to be scary because it was high budget, highly rated and from a (previously)respected director. I want my damn money back. Please don't waste any brain cells on this movie."

","I actually saw this movie on a plane and was amazed that it didn't come with a warning that it was unsuitable for sighted, hearing people. Besides all the internal discontinuities and truly silly plot twist, how the director got all these quite excellent actors to actually speak these empty bombastic lines is quite beyond me. Probably that's where all the budget went. It certainly wasn't the special effects that were limited to creature costumes that looked like they were created by 'goth' teenagers on Quaalude.<br/><br/>While the photography was pretty, much of the time the actors were squared up to the screen, acting like crazy right into in camera with the best sincere off-Broadway serious tones that signal that ""Hey, pay attention. What I'm saying has important meaning here.""<br/><br/>This movie will appeal to those who like their symbolism obvious and who enjoy Renaissance fairs. I got this movie for free and still wanted to ask for my money back."
"A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor","1","3","6","16 March 2005"," Undoubtedly, Shyamalan's magic touch has worn off (SPOILERS)
","*WARNING: This review contains spoilers that reveal the movie's ""big"" twist*<br/><br/>Was the twist for 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"" that much of a shocker that people would ignore the other problems with the film? Admittedly, ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" were a lot better in comparison, but still weren't anywhere near classics. Then Shyamalan goes and makes ""The Village"", a movie so pointless and dull it makes me wonder if Ed Wood was really all that bad. At least his films are entertaining.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Shyamalan is an overrated hack whose reputation far exceeds his actual talents as a director. Sure, he clearly loves movies and has a knack of making his films appear more frightening than they really are through marketing, but he fails in creating an actual atmosphere for his individual projects. Even the standard ""boo!"" moments associated with horror films aren't effective; the set-up is there, but the pacing is off. Viewed a second time, these scenes come off worst because the audience can think about the plot holes. Two such scenes are when the monsters attack the village for the first time and the scene where the protagonist, Ivy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) has a confrontation with a monster.<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie actually does have a decent premise: the citizens of a mysterious, late nineteenth-century village supposedly have a truce with demonic beings that live in the woods surrounding the town. As long as the townspeople stay away from the woods, the creatures would leave them alone. Unfortunately, some children venture into the forest, thereby breaking the truce and angering the monsters. Soon after the creatures attack the village as punishment, one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), is critically injured and Ivy has to go out in search of medicine that can save him. Her quest is impeded with the fact that she is blind and because of her attraction to Lucius.<br/><br/>All this unfolds at a ridiculously slow pace as Shyamalan sets up the characters and their situation. After developing this narrative for an hour and a half, Shyamalan, as expected, comes up with a twist: it's revealed that not only are there no monsters at all, but the villagers are in fact living in a present day park preserve. By this point, it is terribly obvious that Shyamalan is willing to do just about anything to catch the audience off guard, but this laughably absurd resolution is just too much. Why not just tell a straightforward drama about a few seniors fooling their offspring into living an Amish-like existence instead of trying to pawn the film off as a horror movie? <br/><br/>The answer to that question is actually quite simple: Shyamalan has the reputation of being a ""thriller movie"" director and he has to maintain this illusion; thus the pretext of ""The Village"" looking like a horror movie for most of the running length and it being marketed as such. Of course, this misguided approach destroys any chance of there being a rewatchability factor: why bother to see the movie again if we know that Noah (of all people), played by Adrien Brody, is the one who dresses up as a monster to keep the townspeople away from the woods? What is really the point of structuring an entire movie on one single plot twist?<br/><br/>Shyamalan also tries to build up tension in certain scenes, but he's no Hitchcock. His previous movies all had at least a couple of good scary moments, but everything here is just so dull it is hard for a viewer to get invested in the characters and their plight. Are we really supposed to care about some paper-thin villagers being chased down by anonymous monsters, especially when we know there are no monsters at all? The director simply cannot create enough suspense for the movie to work even the first time around. Shyamalan's best effort, ""Unbreakable"", doesn't try to fool the audience into thinking it's a horror movie; it works on it's own and not by playing on the audiences' expectations.<br/><br/>Of course, among the mess of a narrative, there are nonetheless a few bright spots. James Newton Howard delivers a haunting score that adjusts to whatever the movie is pretending to be at that moment. Roger Deakins' cinematography is wonderful and it at least gives us something to look at while we're being bored out of our skulls. Finally, while Shyamalan's reputation seems only to get worse with every proceeding film he makes, he still manages to attract a rather good cast, which includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson. All of these actors manage to rise above the material, but they cannot save the movie.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is no doubt one of the most uneven and lifeless films of recent times. It was painfully clear in 2004 that Shyamalan was way past his ""best by"" date, yet he has gone on to make two more atrocities: 2006's ""Lady in the Water"" and 2008's ""The Happening"". These three films, taken together, confirm one thing: that M. Night Shyamalan has no business making movies and should seriously consider pursuing other ventures; anything to spare movie audiences from having to bear another one of his catastrophes. 1/10"
"douglie007-1","1","3","6","12 March 2005"," predictable
","The acting and cinematography were good in this movie. Unfortunately, they could do nothing to redeem the film. The dialog was terrible, the costumes were mediocre, and any actual surprises were few and far between. Anyone who has picked up a work of science fiction from any point in the last 100 years will know nearly every turn of the trite plot line from the time they meet the main characters and be hoping against hope for it to turn some other way, only to be disappointed entirely. There are only a few details that I hadn't pinned down precisely after fifteen minutes, and even those I had narrowed down to just a few possibilities. This movie is really not worth the time and money. Better luck next time."
"EvLauster","6","3","6","1 March 2005"," No more plot twists
","The Village is set in the 18th century and revolves around the people that live in the town. Surrounding the town is acres of woods. In the woods are scary monsters not aliens like in signs not apparitions like in the Sixth Sense but scary. After Noah Percy (Adrien Brody soon to be in the Jacket) a retarded man ventures in the woods and gives berries of the bad color (red) to Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)is assured that if he is not a threat to them they will let him pass through to other towns. As the movie goes into more depth on what they hell is wrong with the town. Ivy and Lucius become close friends. Noah (Brody) is jealous and stabs him twice. Ivy must now venture in the woods alone to the towns and get medicine for Lucius. Will she make it in time. Believe me it didn't look that way it took for ever to get there.<br/><br/>The village is a poor attempt with too many plot changes. So it is my judgment to say that M. Night Shaymalan has run out of plot twist and is now done. My score for the village very low but 2/10."
"sp_dave","1","3","6","26 February 2005"," Like driving to Fargo at 5 mph
","An attempt at horror (I guess) with an amazingly predictable ""twist"". If a horror/suspense movie is neither scary nor remotely suspenseful perhaps it is character driven, perhaps, but not in this case. There is not one remotely enjoyable person in this film.<br/><br/>The plot is so poor, the ending so predictable, the tools to get there so contrived (we'll send the blind girl alone through the forest to find the hidden road, you know, the one no one ever uses that is still magically maintained), it is, as Garrison Keiler said: ""like driving to Fargo at 5mph. You see the ending a long way off and you are not sure you want to get there""."
"rustlefustled","10","3","6","9 February 2005"," Menace and caring
","I really enjoyed watching this film. From the performances to the haunting score everything was working for me.<br/><br/>I can see why some people might struggle with The Village because the pacing is something you either embrace or fight against. If you're looking for big orange explosions et al you're going to be disappointed. The key is here is menace. The creeping kind. And this is a milieu that M.Knight Shymalan is rapidly making his own.<br/><br/>I liked the antiquated dialogue. It added to the Salem-like atmosphere and it ratcheted up the atmosphere of a community haunted by what might be lurking in the dark. In fact just enjoy the film for the acting alone. It's a great ensemble cast with more than few ""stars"" content to shine in supporting roles. And shine they do. Breendan Gleeson take a bow. I always got the sense in his performance that this was a man that had more to say (check the DVD). But then that's the beauty of a tormented character and a great bit of acting.<br/><br/>In Shyamalan's films, he spends a lot of time on his characters. You really get to find out what makes them tick. Rarely is anything taken for granted. And whilst this may, in some people's eyes, slow the plot down it really makes you care about what's happening.<br/><br/>The score's a cracker and the atmospheric sound effects are from the top drawer. It's really great to watch a film that is haunting from the word go. This is a definite slow-burn experience and all the better for it.<br/><br/>Menace and caring. A satisfying combination."

It said something about 3 rules like don't go int to the woods and don't wear red and don't make any noise or they will come.something like that and i thought man with Joaquin phoenix!It got to be good! And then when i was on my way home from Finland on the Ferry they showed it in the Cinema so i went to see.!CONTAINS SPOILERS!(THIS MOVIE WILL SPOIL EVERYTHING FOR YOU ANYWAY) Okay it starts and the camera films it all in kind a weird old looking way and have some similarities with The Blair Witch Project!! There's that blind girl who can't see but she runs as fast as a boy and runs the fastest...The movie is about 2 hours long and for 1 hour about nothing happen. The monsters comes to the village one time and i have to admit that it almost scared me more then The Turtles. Anyway after this it's kind of boring but then a psycho attacks Joaquin and Ivy(the blind girl) goes through the dangerous woods to town to get medicine.The Village is like a place surrounded på forest and nothing else. After gotten the medicine she is being attacked by a ""monster"" but she is blind so she lures it into a trap!!Now when we see and she does not we notice that the psycho guy is the monster and there were no monsters there in the first place.The movie ends. One guy is sleeping behind me and about the rest is just like can we go now?when i got out of the cinema one guy asks me: am i the only one to think that this was one of the baddest movies i have ever seen? So for Christ sake see something else!Honestly this is the most bad movie i have ever seen and with that 60 million dollar budget(the most expensive looking in the film is a hole in the ground) i think they could at least get a better camera! 0/10 Worthless as best!//Micke Finland Åland"

When MNS understands that it might be a good idea to adapt a great story or maybe have an idea and then get a great screenwriter to mold it then he may achieve what he is capable of.

","I've been a fan of the reviews on IMDb for many years BUT only now do I feel the urge to put my own views down. After going to see 'The Village' at the weekend, I feel the need to warn others not to waste their hard-earned cash on a load of utter self-indulgent rubbish... So naturally <br/><br/>**** SPOILER ALERT ****<br/><br/>Why the hard line? Well director M. Night Shyamalan has, as other reviewers have noted, a lot to live up to because of his earlier films, such as Signs and The Sixth Sense, which were are all very good. His direction, casting choices and good scripts has turned old genres into real winners, both in style and ticket receipts. But those films, or what made them enjoyable for me, was the unexpected but plausible twists (within the context of the story). Sadly though, Shyamalan has now got his formula and The Village just tries too hard to follow in the others footsteps. Despite strong performances from the leads Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenixm it does little to improve the general crapiness of it all.<br/><br/>Forget the good cinematography, a few bits of impressive screen dialogue, the on-screen chemistry between the two leads, the sharp editing, you're there to see an M. Night Shyamalan film because it won't fit the usual bill. But that's where it all falls down as the film is a turkey because the twist is Shyamalan's attempt to preach a message about unwarranted fear and the need for hope and a quest to fulfill one self. The Village, you see is kept held together (and insular) through fear of the 'monsters in the wood'. This has been going on for years but like Friedrich Nietzsche warned, those who battle 'with monsters had better see that it does not turn him into a monster'. And this is basically the whole premise of the film which results in the killing of the animals and the stabbing.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Shyamalan started the script at the end and then worked his way back to the beginning. Viz - finale and answer to whole film, but to do this you must create reason why people must leave village, but to do this you need to build tension because monsters threaten village as there are monsters in the wood. But the process insults the intelligence of the audience (well it did for me) because you get incredulous plot holes. For example, its 19th century America and there are 'monsters in the woods' - so where are the guns? Right to bare arms etc ? (Sic Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow). I mean if settlers shot millions of buffalo into extinction surely these pioneers could deal with a couple of slow-moving, red-cape wearing wart hogs? Next was it a budgetry thing, (couldn't they afford a wooden one) but what the hell was an aluminium green house doing in the 1890s.? It was only 10 years after the Bayer process was developed in Austria, what an anachronism..!! Planes...although a reason is given at the end of the film. What about microlights, private pleasure craft, hot air balloons etc. I'm sorry there is no where on this planet that is not free from aerial snooping. E.g. Area 51 is not meant to exist but I bet there are more images on the internet of this site than the White House..!! Same goes for people just climbing the fence. Hey maybe that's the sequel The Village: The Donner Experience...yep really cold winter, kids in a car lose control crash through the fence and stumble on them hungry locals... <br/><br/>It might be more entertaining.<br/><br/>So after 100 minutes you get to the end of the day the film, and you learn that the premise - that as long as fear is used to control there can be no hope, no matter how liberal a lifestyle.<br/><br/>I am therefore sorry M. Night Shyamalan you have lost the plot this time.<br/><br/>I am therefore sorry that after so many good films this one is so bad.<br/><br/>I am also sorry that I can't have my £6 back after being told the bl**ding obvious and in a really dumb way.<br/><br/>M.

Despite this the movie didn't live up to them.<br/><br/>The story was very weak and the tempo was more or less non-existent with boring and flat characters.

","The degradation of M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>'M's' first big hit, The Sixth Sense, is brilliance in movie making. It's spellbinding twists and turns, keep our visual senses captivated. Yet, the follow-ups to his focused genre have neither captivated our attention nor brought us back for a second viewing.<br/><br/>Unbreakable's premise is interesting. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's performances were outstanding, yet the entire movie was ""muddy"". We had to wade through darkened scenes and murky views to feel a sense of the character's burdens rather than allowing the seasoned actors to show us. So much for the follow-up to The Sixth Sense. It left us yearning for something better.<br/><br/>Enter 'Signs'. Again, Shyamalan decided to capture the flavor of the genre by cloaked darkness, smoky light and acute camera angles. Many directors before him were successful with this, yet they maximized the talents of their leading actors. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job, for without them the movie would be another dust collector.<br/><br/>2004 witnessed 'The Village'. The premise of a village surrounded by mystery and foreboding danger is not a new one. A small cluster of clapboard houses populated by 'turn of the century' folk is the setting for The Village. This film noir takes us slowly through its script development culminating in a less than successful entertaining experience. The moving picture eroded from gasps to laughter in short order.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is a 'not-at-all believable' blind woman. She moved headlong into open doorways, bolted up stairs, ran across fields without stumbling, all the while portraying someone blind. She did a poor job. Shyamalan allowed this, fueling his directorial demise and cementing this career limiting work.<br/><br/>The audience laughed hysterically when Ron Howard's daughter ""formed the cross"" with out-stretched arms. Humor was not the intent of that scene. In fact, the latter half of the film was peppered with audience laughter when Shyamalan did not wish it. Boredom overtook the viewers due to poor directing and poor acting.<br/><br/>At one point, a cell phone rang in the theater, a woman answered and proceeded to talk to her caller. No one in the audience berated her, as she was more interesting than the movie.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody did a superb job of his portrayal. In the beginning of the film, he allowed us to believe that he was cast as 'filler'. Yet, his character development strengthened, forming the only good performance in The Village.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie if it weren't for bad directing, bad writing and bad acting. <br/><br/>We, as an audience, are disappointed with M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Village. We will think twice about seeing his next attempt."

","There are certain facts that cannot be overlooked when critiquing this film. One is that the director is known for surprise endings. His last two films were great to the very end, and had a payoff that wrapped up the whole movie in a nice little package.<br/><br/>Another is that the director has set himself up by his previous films as a neo-Hitchcock with his plot twists and turns-- misdirections used as a great magician making a card appear from thin air. There is no doubt that this is what he is trying to accomplish, as he even has cameos in his films in true Hitchcock fashion.<br/><br/>But one thing Hitchcock never did was lie to the audience. If you were ever wrapped up in the main character, as is common in good movies, and began to see things through the eyes of the characters, that was your own doing. This film goes beyond that unwritten law of misdirection and sets up scenes and images that are there for no other reason than to support a supposed premise to the point where you must believe. It is no longer the character in the movie who is misled, but you in the audience. There is no slight of hand... just lies.(One such example, without giving the movie away, is an aerial shot of a blind girl standing in a field of berries of ""the bad color."" She is blind and gets nothing from this. It is purely to lie to the audience.)<br/><br/>But this is to be expected.

I went under the impression I would go see a good hair raising chilling movie and what I got was a big pile of crap! HEY here's an IDEA next time why don't you actually make a movie that follows the premise of what you had in mind! Save the ""TWIST"" for Chubby Checker! This is FALSE ADVERTISING at it's WORST! But a simple lesson to all movie goers like me who wanted a good scary movie......TRULY SCARY MOVIES ARE NEVER RATED PG-13!!

"ddtoth","1","3","6","4 August 2004"," I fear that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to hard to replace Alfred Hitchcock
","Being a rather huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock, seeing all of his movies as such, I must say, I would have thought that I would be intrigued by M. Night Shyamalan, however I did not realize at the time he would try to replace Hitchcock instead of trying to reach further levels in the film-making industry. I must admit this is a vast disappointment. You see, first you must understand nobody can ever replace Hitchcock, so M. Night Shyamalan trying to be like Hitchcock (i.e. making nonchalant appearances in the movies, wondering where and when he will pop up) will simply never work. Rather one would hope in this day and age, that Shyamalan would try to go beyond what Hitchcock envisioned, what Hitchcock was able to bring to the screen. There are always twists, upon twists, upon twists in these movies, that is a given, however when I first saw The Sixth Sense, it was obvious Bruce Willis was not among the living, Signs, really the same, you rather already know what would happen and with this latest project, you would have expected far greater things from Shyamalan, and to which to say I was disappointed is rather a vast understatement. Do not misunderstand, I enjoy the twists, upon twists and so forth, the ending, that is something I did not want to admit I expected, but when it was played out before my eyes, I didn't want to think Shyamalan was about to be just as obvious as in all of his other movies. One word of advice, Shyamalan has a brilliant head upon his shoulders, do not try to flatter Hitchcock by using the same techniques, compliment Hitchcock by rather taking his vision and bringing it to levels far above and beyond what Hitchcock himself ever dreamed possible. You would not want to be labeled as someone who copies Hitchcock, you would want to be known as someone all of your own, which Shyamalan rightfully deserves.<br/><br/>I truly wish Shyamalan all the best this world has to offer, I can only hope he takes some of it~"

"john_murdoch2002","1","3","6","6 August 2004"," Wow, where to begin
","It's a known fact that M. Night Shyamalan can make some truly scary movies. The Sixth Sense echoed Alfred Hitchcock, a comparison that is not tossed around lightly. Signs was an exercise of letting one's imagination fill in the horrific gaps of what the audience cannot see. But Shyamalan's latest outing dives into a new type of scary: That a filmmaker with such an accomplished resume, two Oscar nominations, and a very profitable background could create a film so bad that the audience would be more likely to find amusement hitting their heads against the seats in front of them in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is sketchy at best, but ""The Village"" is about a village of people in an indeterminate setting have become threatened by mythical creatures in the woods who are beginning to invade the town. Meanwhile, Joaquin Pheonix says that he wants to venture into the woods to find some medicine from the outside towns. Pheonix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard share moments of fleeting love that is never truly defined. For that matter, neither is any of the characters' motivations. We are essentially watching people go through the actions, but the audience is left in the dark.<br/><br/>So essentially, Shyamalan is trying to show the dangers of hiding from one's past, but the story is so disjointed and poorly told that his message and story get lost in the chaos. A few more drafts or at least a ghost writer or two could have saved this story from incoherence, but it seems that Shyamalan saw this as his baby and wanted complete control over it. Since the film is now his own, he becomes the one who is to blame. Shyamalan should have known better.<br/><br/>This movie brought to mind an interesting riddle, what's a bigger crime: wasting a talented ensemble cast or framing a movie in a way that disconnects the audience from all attachment to the characters? We have Joaquin Pheonix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and the promise of a newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard, yet this movie proves that no matter how much talent you may have, if there's no motivation to work with, no clear goals of the characters, and lines so out of place and distractingly bad, talented actors becomes no more than a mannequins for the director to manipulate. Shyamalan should have known better.<br/><br/>Obviously, there is a typical twist at the end of an M. Night Shyamalan has become expected, whether it be ""I see dead people"", ""They call me Mr. Glass"", or ""Swing away,"" relying on such twists can be a treat for an audience, but ""The Village proves that relying on twists too much can make the audience realize they are on shaky ground and make them watch every step the movie takes. By Shyamalan's fourth film, the audience already begins to expect such an ending and instead begin looking at clues instead of the film itself, which in the case of ""The Village"" may actually be a good thing, but in this case, the payoff is so juvenile that one expects it from a sixth grade creative writing paper rather than from the man who made us ""keep the secret"" of ""The Sixth Sense."" (You can find the twist in the paragraphs of this review) Shyamalan should have known better.<br/><br/>Directors carry most of the blame if the movie they make isn't clear or interesting to an audience and here, Shyamalan is the man to blame. He stages his shots so that we never see any reaction on the characters faces during critical moments in the film. And the staging of each of the actors is so dehumanized and impersonal that it does more to draw an audience away from a film than draw them in. If the atmosphere looks great, one can credit the greatest living director of photography: Roger Deacons and the always talented costume designer Ann Roth. But their efforts seems wasted as the photography or the costumes are never given the chance to breath on their own. Shyamalan should have known better.<br/><br/>Although, we could make the argument that Shyamalan needed a more accomplished film editor. People like Andrew Mondshein (The Sixth Sense), Dylan Tichnor (Unbreakable), and Barbara Tulliver (Signs) all knew how to handle Shyamalan's disjointed storylines and add a depth, using the cutaways to reactions. Here, Christopher Tellefsen is satisfied allowing the camera to hold on shots where the characters' backs are talking to the audience, never cutting away to show us reaction shots or giving the film a satisfying pace outside of sterile. If he had stuck with any of the other editors he'd worked with, the film might have worked better, but he chose not to. Shyamalan should have known better.<br/><br/>You'd be hard pressed to find an enjoyable moment in this whole film. Watching this movie, one gets the feeling that Shyamalan should have written a few more drafts, made the film more clear, made the characters relatable or at least allow the audience in on their thoughts. For a director who has already displayed his own sixth sense for showing a depth of character (all together now): Shyamalan should have known better."

","I consider myself a true fan of M. Night Shyamalan. I was extremely upset that he used the horror genre to draw in millions into the theater and it falling way short of that notion. Not to mention the hard-core fans such as myself who saw the 12:01 am showing on July 30th only to be disappointed. Might I add that I was not the only fan who BOOOED at the end of the movie. I understand that Mr. Shyamalan may get a kick for confusing or distorting the story line in order for him to accomplish what he did in 'Sixth Sense', but enough is enough. It seems predictable and unoriginal at this point.<br/><br/>Bottom line it was a waste of money. A word of advise from one disappointed fan."

","M. Night Shyamalan, writer/director of ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and ""Unbreakable"" has come up with an idea in 2004 called ""The Village"". I felt I really wanted to see this movie when I first saw the coming attractions for it, but personally, as more and more bad reviews about this movie showed up on IMDb, I was a little unsure about this motion picture. I expected this movie to be about an endangered village located in Pennsylvania, and when I entered the theater for it, I expected a chilling, spine-tingling frightening movie. But what I got was a bag of green slop. I expected there to be a meaning in this movie, as all the others of Shyamalan's movies are. But I must say, I was a little impressed with the story, but the special effects were absolutely despicable. The monster looked like he was made out of plastic; I've had dry hands that looked scarier than that. I have to admit that a few parts made me jump, but during others, I was laying in the seat, ready to fall asleep. Normally, in all Shyamalan's movies, there is a surprise ending that shakes your spine, but in this movie, there was a quote from one of the characters, and then ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film"" showed up on the screen. I haven't seen so much disappointment in a movie in my whole entire life. Please take my advice, don't waste your time or money on this crap. 0/10*"

","This is one of the biggest Hollywood crimes in a long time. The marketing department sold a product it did not deliver on.

There is a minute amount of suspense in the beginning but halfway through it we find out there's no need to fear ... whatever (don't want to spoil it for anyone though that wouldn't be a crime). The ending is just ridiculous and laughable. Night should change his name to M. Night Shameful until he redeems himself from this! He ripped us off! In the previews we hear the ""creatures"" breaking through the outside of the house in one scene in the trailers, but in the movie ... nothing! Just breathing. Further, the marketing told us that this was about these creatures but they are such a minor part in this film that you find yourself forgetting about them from time to time. Someone called this story disjointed, and that's a good explanation. Shame on Night and Touchstone's marketing team ... this should be prosecutable and somehow I think it should be: they call it false advertising.

"MovieAddict2016","8","5","13","17 February 2005"," Pleasantly surprised - enjoyable if predictable
","It's a shame so many people are criticizing this film based on its ""twist."" I think Shyamalan is a good storyteller in the classic sense that he's able to just make a good atmospheric thriller that holds one's interest. Some are saying he's a rip-off of Hitchcock, but Hitchcock's films were usually a bit more realistic and almost never supernatural (perhaps ""The Birds"" is the farthest he ventured into truly fictional horror, even ""Psycho"" was realistic - if not then, certainly now).<br/><br/>""The Village"" is a good film. I thought the performances were fine, the direction was tight and suspenseful, and the twist - although I guessed it before the film even started - was still delivered well.<br/><br/>Another painful thing about this film is that so many people were expecting a shock-twist, when in fact the twist in ""The Village"" isn't as gimmicky as one might expect. In fact it's not much of a ""shock"" or ""twist,"" it's more of a standard minor revelation in the film, and easily predictable.<br/><br/>It's a testament to the story itself that it is able to be entertaining in spite of this. At least I thought so.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Shyamalan, I didn't buy into the ""Sixth Sense"" hype at first and thought it was a fairly basic supernatural thriller with a one-time twist that was easily predictable. I liked it on repeat viewings, but at first I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I saw ""Unbreakable"" and enjoyed it, but found it fairly dull at the same time.<br/><br/>Then I saw ""Signs"" and absolutely loved it, which is ironic because a vast number of people seem to hate the film based on the single fact that its twist is unrealistic.<br/><br/>I don't think that's always the case. Just like with ""Signs,"" Shyamalan builds his twist into something else - it's a metaphor for a larger picture. The final message I gathered from ""The Village"" is that you can't escape tragedy and heartbreak, it follows you everywhere, and it's an element of humanity that can't be broken away from.<br/><br/>Not a great film but a fun one-time viewing with a satisfying conclusion."
"joachimokeefe","2","3","7","10 July 2008"," An episode of 'Outer Limits' stretched to two hours...
","And I mean stretched. The pace - well, there is no pace. The whole movie is at a standstill. How many slow tracking shots of people doing mundane things are there in 'The Village'? Because if you are forced to sit through it because, say, your fiancée loves it, or you are trapped in M. Night Shyamalan's house, it might help you through this turgid melodrama to try counting. That's the worst problem. The second problem is that Bryce Howard can't act. Well, she can act, but only at the same level - no light or shade. You never believe she is blind for a minute, only that she's stepped out of an amateur production of 'Hamlet' by mistake. The third problem is that there's not enough story. That's why after fifteen minutes you start to get restless and pick holes in the thing. Guessing the twist? It's not hard to guess WHAT it is, only the 'why' is different. The fact that ********SPOILER************ the village is a wildlife (p)reserve for the wealthy families of the victims of urban crime is all the story there is. In the longeurs at the beginning, you start to wonder how they live, where all the oil comes from and why the 'elders' of the village are all under fifty. Shyamalan is too busy trying to create atmosphere to bother creating authenticity, which The Village completely lacks. In Witness they took the trouble to explain the commercial life of the Amish, for example, and that gave it a reality within the movie. This community never gets remotely believable. If The Village had been an episode of 'The Outer Limits' or 'X-Files' even, it would probably have been a classic. But it's ninety minutes too long. Oh, and I thought Lucius's colour must have been red. Blood, you see. The fact that they left his fate open is an acknowledgment that the twist isn't strong enough to close the story."

Really, this film was one big train wreck.

","""The Village"" will satisfy no one, while infuriating everyone with expectations for it. If you are looking for a love story, the film fails to create any sparks, and quite frankly, Joaquin Phoenix grunts most of his lines so even understanding him is a challenge. As a horror movie it creates some atmosphere, and then leaves the audience hanging cruelly waiting, and waiting for the dreaded creatures to appear. The acting leaves a lot to be desired as most lines are delivered in a very emotionless way.

The film sets around a colonial village surrounded by a massive forest. This forest is supposedly inhabited by creatures who have a truce with the villagers not to interfere with the borders that separate them. When a fearless villager named Lucius decides to cross the boundaries in search of 'other towns', the village's safety is put at stake. The most gripping part of this film is the haunting, secretive, mysterious allure that surrounds it. The film's eerie cinematography and a chilling score pieced together by James Newton Howard ( Nominated for an Academy Award) is the core of the movie. The acting in this film considering the brilliant cast of Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt was not the best. So in terms of acting performances, this is not one of the film's strong points.

","A Utopian (?) village and community beset by a beastly condition, as captioned in preview, should capture just about anyone's interest. And in watching this by M. Night Shyamalan had me predisposed to think that this was just another run-of-the-mill monster movie, but it was not. It was a movie, and tale about just about any person or people, and experiences, and about going to the extreme in finding a solution to a problem(s) that holds in sway, if not grips everyday life. <br/><br/>From the locked box, to the shed; the so called ""quiet-room,"" to the designated colors; from the commandments, and even to the prominent family surname the movie was woven into a tale that had communities from the Amish (since it was in PA), to the extreme of cults, or even the Branch Davidians of Waco leaping initially to mind. However, what kept the interest piqued were the 'creatures,' or the beasts that held this isolated community voluntarily captive, if not united, until the unexpected happened which had the community, and its elders and leaders considering to break a long held pact.<br/><br/>The manner in which it was performed was mediocre, however how the story unfolded, and plot thickened (so to speak) was exceptional - IMHO. From bad came good; from good came bad, and ultimately, salvation or even continuity of life itself?

The incredible cast (Bryce Dallas Howard is powerfully moving and a very talented beautiful actress), the perfect visual direction, classic but so perfectionist in the choice of what to film or not (the moving scene of the first kiss between Lucius and Ivy and that image of an empty chair to leave the characters in their privacy...), the powerful and heady score by James Newton Howard, the gorgeous photography by roger deakins and finally the great script. <br/><br/>What is the most powerful thing for a studio picture, made for large audiences, is the fact that The Village is a parable. A lot of people didn't get that fact when the movie came out. <br/><br/>It's a melancholic drama about fear and how good people, hurt by the violence of our modern societies, became awful people, controlling others with fear, in order to find again an innocence in the past that never existed. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. <br/><br/>And the irony the elders understood at the end of the picture is that violence or cruelty is everywhere in every one of us and a simple minded supposed to be innocent without violence in his bones will be the first to break their illusions. <br/><br/>A great parable about our troubled world at that time (Irak's War, 9/11...). Signs was the previous movie of Shyamalan who started filming after the 9/11 and it devastated the crew when filming. We can see in this previous movie the shadow of that period (the isolation, the brutality against aliens) so his next movie would be more explicit about those troubled times. Here come the village. What is admirable too is the fact that Shyamalan never judged his characters. Everyone has a motivation and human flaws. <br/><br/>All the powerful lines, moments... Ahhh The Village... I never understood why so much people hated it when it first came out. Even though many people didn't like it the movie had great success at the box office. I didn't expect people to hate Lady in the water too !<br/><br/>10/10"

","In 2004 I found myself in a theater waiting on a film that was sure to be entertaining. The trailers had enticed me for months and I was giddy about seeing this intriguing piece of art. Since that day I have tried to block out the utter disappointment that followed the theaters dimming lights. Up until, The Village, I truly enjoyed many M. Night Shyamalan films. Like most, The Sixth Sense was a delightful experience in the puzzle-thriller genre and I never looked at a farm house the same after Signs. With Night's track record I was not expecting disappointment. The Village did not just fall short of my expectations; it tumbled from the summit of Mount Everest. <br/><br/>The Village is not just flawed in one area, but is a nest egg for disaster. This film at first glance has a great cast however, that does not guarantee great acting. William Hurt for the majority of the film seems as if he is reading directly from a script, while Joaquin Phoenix comes off as dry and emotionless as ever. All cannot be blamed on lack luster acting; the characters being portrayed are extremely unrepeatable to ANY audience member- unless the audience is packed full of disturbing cult leaders. While the characters are completely forgettable and come with no audience attachment, the concept of this film is by far the most inadequate area of The Village. I have never seen a more ridicules storyline. Somehow Shyamalan thought it made sense to have parents traumatize there kids for the sake of keeping them secure in a phony plastic bubble set in the late 1800's. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan really dropped the ball on The Village. I have never walked out of a theater so disappointed (and I have seen Twilight). The Village ruined M. Night's films for me. I now see his name attached to a project and run the other way. After this atrocity, it is almost a shame to call M. Night Shyamalan an auteur director."

"Lizanne227","8","2","4","24 January 2012"," Think about it...
","For both a video-editing class Im taking and English Literature I had to choose a movie. For English I had to watch a film and write a critique and also use the themes/morals/motifs/symbols to make a connection to a specific novel. For video editing I had to recreate my own trailer for any film. I chose The Village for both, and Im glad I did!<br/><br/>The Village, contrary to other reviews, is perfectly logical. This is NOT a movie you can watch and assume the obvious. No, use the literary analysis skills learned in school to decipher the codes (and there are plenty). Consider the themes of isolationism, and how 9/11 effected us as a society (did we become more accepting of each other, or fear 'those we can not speak of'). The Village is an allegorical masterpiece! As I read some reviews of others claiming it was illogical, I was really disappointed that people could not take it for what it was;That is, a fictional thriller chuck-full of symbolism. Examples: 1.The color (anger, passion,and danger), 2. The color yellow (happiness,security), 3.Towns/villages (that sense of security we feel within them), 4.Lock&Key(again,more security) I could continue, but I wont.<br/><br/>Despite the literary symbolism, there are even more clues to the overall meaning based on historical information and back-round information on when it was filmed. 1.The Cuban Missle Crisis- Cuba could of benefited by bribing that pilot to not fly over them, and so could the US considering the outcome. Thuse, the reasoning behind planes not flying over the village is FINE. 2. Pennsylvania- Yah, home of the Quakers way back when and very large Amish community today. 3. Blindness, okay, throughout time blind characters have been ""seers"". This may be some sort of irony, but seriously a blind character being able to see beyond the physical is nothing new-nor is it to be confused with fantasy. This is because in all themes of movies and books this has existed.<br/><br/>I will admit a blind girl running through the forest is crazy, but seriously right before she left her father gave us clues that perhaps she was not born blind. The dialogue is clear of contractions so use that.<br/><br/>The Village IS a good movie that was probably made longer than it should of been. This is a movie good for sociology, English, and basically anything. It does require you to dive deeper than what is directly observed/assumed. Do NOT let that influence you're perception of it, nor do you have to agree with the message of the movie. But thats just it- There's A MESSAGE. Nothing can be assumed. And if it doesn't all make perfect logical sense you have to look at it from a characters point of view. ACTING:Good SETTING:Superb SCRIPT: Perfect PLOT: Requires analysis"
"MovieGuy109","1","2","4","28 October 2011"," Utter trash
","The Village-*-Worthless- Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan. Written by: M. Night Shyamalan, Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, John Christopher Jones, Celia Watson, Judy Greer, Jayne Atkinson, Fran Kranz, Michael Pitt, Jesse Eisenberg, Frank Collison.<br/><br/>Director M. Night Shyamalan's downward spiral begins with this horrendous film that is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous in every sense of the word. The film details a village that somehow is alienated from society with people kept within the borders because of outsiders that lurk in the surrounding forest. The elders of the village refuse to let anyone outside of the borders even at Phoenix's demands.<br/><br/>This is not only a silly plot but it is relentlessly downbeat with no factor of entertainment whatsoever. Shyamalan takes all the energy out of the film to meet his own demands to emphasize the villager's loneliness. I did not feel any loneliness from his direction and actually felt more entitled to leave this film than anything. The actors seem just as bored as the audience in reality. No one seems to be enjoying any of their roles.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is intent upon making the same success that The Sixth Sense brought in for him. The elements that Shyamalan used in The Sixth Sense can be found though they are not even scarcely close to the sheer power his first spooky fest had over us. The end plot twist here only demeans the experience, rather than enhancing it. Shyamalan really should have identified that his talent as a director were virtually limited to one film. He is just making spin-offs now."
"tburke85","4","2","4","5 June 2009"," The Village A Period Drama Disguised As A Horror/Thriller
","The Village is a period drama disguised as a horror/thriller from writer/director M Night Shyamalan whose other films haven't been nearly as good as his first one The Sixth Sense. M. Night shows talent and skill with the Village but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The Village really isn't that bad but it could've been much better. The trailer to the film makes it seem like a thriller but I found The Vilage to be more of a period drama with some thriller elements. The movie does have some secrets that were surprising others weren't so much but surprises like spectacle alone doesn't make an entertaining film. The cast for the most part are believable in their roles of a small community of people who live in fear of the ""creatures"" that live in the woods surrounding their village. Joaquin Phoenix is admirable as Lucius the soft spoken man whose curious about the world outside of their village community. Phoenix however isn't in it that much considering his role gets cut rather short and for the remainder of the movie it focuses mainly on a female character played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard the daughter of famous director/actor Ron Howard. Bryce is quite good as Ivy a beautiful and determined blind young woman. She brings some life into the movie and without her I would've given it a lower rating that I did. Well done. Adrien Brody does an okay job as Noah the village idiot whose role like Phoenix is limited but he is convincing in the small part he plays in the film. The rest of the talented cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and Michael Pitt are very good in their roles but they (like Phoenix and Brody) also lack screen time. The few scares in the movie if you want to call them that are well executed but those scenes lack suspense and didn't frighten me at all. The creatures looked cool but like some of the characters in the film they aren't in it that much and don't pose as a real threat to the village people. The music by James Newton Howard is fitting for the tone of the film and the location they chose for the village was excellent. The ending was all right but it didn't make up for what already happened before in the movie. If M Night had improved on the scares making them more suspenseful and more frequent than The Village would've been a pretty good thriller. Overall the film is a flawed attempt at a thriller the lacked suspense but if you've enjoyed M. Night's other movies than you might like this as well."
"bakedmind","9","2","4","14 June 2008"," Very Under-appreciated Film
","M. Night is one of the few Writer/Directors out there, that is always pushing for original material. His story lines always engage me, keep me on the edge of my seat, and then totally catch me off guard. This film is all that with a fantastic cast. I loved every minute of the film and believe that it was victim to bad advertising. Most people going in to Theatres thought it was going to be a non stop horror film. Instead we got a very entertaining Suspense/Thriller Drama. Love Night and hope he doesn't change for the people who don't get him. The casting was spot on, the visuals were totally compelling, and the story was crafted so originally.. that it screamed M. Night. Actors love to be in his films for a reason and it's not just a pay day. When was the last film that exploded in the Box Office? A shame, yet Actors and Actresses know a master story teller when they see one. Thank god for the faithful followers of his that do exist."

","Such a shame. This was advertised as a horror movie, right? I am probably one of the easiest people on this earth to frighten, but I didn't get scared once throughout this whole film.<br/><br/>Here's a short breakdown:<br/><br/>Story: 4/10 Once again, such a huge, huge shame and waste. The story sounds very promising- an 1800s village surrounded by a forest containing monsters that will kill on sight. Thus they can not leave the village. Not as good as it sounds. <br/><br/>Writing: 2/10 Godawful writing. The story is translated to screen terribly. I feel it would've done much better as a novel. The twist- if that's what you can call it- it revealed WAY too early int he movie and the rest that follows is just boring almost nothingness.<br/><br/>Acting: 3/10 Not good either. Bryce Dallas Howard was just awful as Ivy. It may be just me (though I doubt it) but was she supposed to be playing a blind person? I didn't even notice that she was blind until one of the elders said 'BUT SHE'S BLIND!'<br/><br/>Visuals: 7/10 One of the very few good things about this movie. The scenery and picturesque forest is easy on the eye, and I actually quite liked the brief scene with the contrast of the red flower and the yellowy ground. <br/><br/>No, The Village is entirely awful, but it is stupid, boring, poorly acted and written and I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again any time soon.<br/><br/>4/10"
"MartianOctocretr5","5","2","4","17 November 2006"," Twilight Zone type story, but slow in telling it
","The underlying premise of this story has been addressed before, as long ago as Twilight Zone, and would have been better off in a shorter format like the Zone. The movie has some merit, but because of the feature length duration of the film to get across its single idea, the movie drags quite a bit.<br/><br/>There's a lot of stylish smoke and mirrors, promising but rarely delivering a cache of meat and potatoes substance behind them. One example is the focus on devising unique camera angles and movements, and they are innovative, but what you see is not really telling a story. For example, the frantic turns from left to right reminded me of a Driver's Ed instruction video more than a movie. In one case, the character making these looks to the left and right was supposed to be blind, making these movements even more distracting as glaring plot holes. Another problem was how the film prolonged certain things unnecessarily, such as how the townspeople banter over who will go on a mission to obtain something. They argue over this issue seemingly forever, until I could almost hear Rod Serling turn over in his grave and yell for the film to get on with it.<br/><br/>The acting really isn't bad, but hardly anybody is given much to do, except Bryce Howard, and her frightened, winsome, innocent character is played well. The period linguistic styles were useful, but the lines seemed strained at times. Also, the speeches add to making the already obvious ""secret twist"" even more predictable. The mysterious and rarely seen forest creatures are utilized well for their function in the story.<br/><br/>The movie endeavors to make a point, and to some extent, it succeeds. It just labors to get there. If you're expecting horror or suspense from this movie, you will be disappointed. If you like Twilight Zone/X Files type material, you may find some value in it."
"romasanta14-04","10","2","4","1 August 2006"," Misunderstood masterpiece
","I first saw this film during summer vacation, in Montreal. It opened there months before it did in Spain, so I ran to the theater (I'm very big fan of Shyamalan's work) In the end I was very disappointed. I was expecting to see a terrifying movie, after all those scary trailers and promotional stuff. What I saw, instead, was a tale, a modern tale with a dept and a meaning I failed to get in this first viewing. So, back in Spain, I went to the movies to give it a second chance, and then I understood everything. I knew what I was going to see, so I enjoyed it like very few films before. On the other hand, people left the theater disappointes, just like I was on my firt viewing. It is clear, Shyamalan shoul fire the guy who made promotion of this film. It has many things making the ticket (or DVD now) worthy. The beautiful score by Newton Howard, cinematography, production design... Everything matched perfectly the tone of the movie, its poetry and legend. And what about the actors. William Hurt deserved an academy award for his emotional character, and Bryce Dallas Howard lightened the screen with her only presence. I was a bit disappointed with Joaquin Phoenix's character, I expected for him more screen time and more importance in the story. And Adrien Brody enjoys his part and makes it believable. The story is great. That isolated village, the forest (you really feel scared when the characters are inside, though the creatures haven't been shown at all), the message about control through fear (Bush) and the beautiful ending make a great movie, for me, the best one that came from Shyamalan's genius. And, though many say there's no twist at the end, there is one. And it is so great that it makes the film better, more human, more poetic. Don't expect horror. Expect beauty."

","Just because a writer can produce something as good as the Sixth Sense, doesn't mean that everything he writes is going to work. The Village is OK, but I think a bunch of Grade School kids could have done a better job. Talk about predictable! No spoilers here, but you don't need them. You can figure out the twist in the first 15 minuets of the show. This movie drags from one scene to the next. The ""twist"" is pathetic. M. Night Shyamalan, can, and has done so much better. It reminds me of Stephen King. He has very good books, and some out and out lame books. Same deal here. Now Mr. Shyamalan has come out with Lady in the Water, or something. Another dog from what I've heard, I'm going to wait until I can rent the DVD. So, bottom line, like I said before, it's OK, but if you want acting, a story, and an excellent twist, watch The Sixth Sense."

","I'm utterly lost for words about how crap this movie was. I put off seeing this because of the rubbish this director has made before, and really wish I had put it off a lot longer(as in forever). I find it a great shame that some great directors don't get much work and people like M. night and the likes of the much over rated Eli Roth continue to make films. Oh, has Mr Shyamalan heard of planes or satellites? All in all, another extremely dull, pointless movie from M, with no genuine suspense, even at the 'suprise twist' ending that he seems to believe makes his movies so clever. Not even rescuable by the top notch cast, who fail to make M's useless dialogue sound believable. I could have written better whilst I was at school, frankly."

","My opinion of Night has gone down quit a bit since watching this movie.<br/><br/>When I saw the preview I was expecting it to be some isolated village in central Europe that was plagued by these awesome looking creatures in red cloaks. However, when the secret is revealed, it's guys dressed in costumes scaring the villagers into saying in the village and it's modern day, and they're living in the middle of a wildlife preservation. And also the acting of the characters. I have to hand it to whoever played the mentally challenged guy, though. He was the best actor of the bunch. Most of them sound like they were reading off a cue card. <br/><br/>I guess I can always find solace in Signs and hope that his upcoming movie, Lady of the Water, is better than this POS."
"hafsah_k_pal","2","2","4","26 February 2006"," The Village (IMO)
","Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard), Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) and Noah (Adrian Brody) all live in a stable 19th century community. However, their entrapped by an anonymous being lurking in the uncharted woods. The constant threat that haunts over the self-sufficient society keeps them from retrieving much needed medicines from ""The Towns"". Shyamalan uses controversial yet original plot twists throughout The Village; inspirational for some, but more likely, irritable for most. Yes, it has elements of an engaging horror flick, and is even advertised as a ""hide-behind-pillow"" movie, but nearer the end, it cascades into a gaping hole which was disappointment; almost as disappointing as the fact there are no kids who see dead people or aliens with water issues. It's evidently not to the standard one would expect to perceive from Shyamalan work. It compares to his earlier pieces like a box of luxury Belgium chocolates (his earlier efforts) to an assortment of feet flavoured fruit drops (The Village). The acting from Joaquin Phoenix cannot be touched. Stepping out of his villainous image that I'm sure we all remember from the highly successful Gladiator (2000), Phoenix glides on a more heroic role. He portrays his archetypal character flawlessly; which is precisely what can be expected from an actor of his league. This is more than what can be said for Bryce Dallas Howard, who suddenly finds she's become the protagonist, which in my opinion was far too big a position for her. Seeing past all the confusion in maladvertised genre, The Village comes across as grave drama and Roger Deakins' impressive cinematography should not be discredited in the least, as it is one of very few factors that the film is worth seeing for, that and the twists and turns over-shadowing what is a basis for a love story. An all-round atmospheric thriller that tends to shallow out occasionally. The storyline's not easy on the brain, but if you can be bothered to stay aware long enough, you should encounter some pleasant jumps. See this film if you enjoy jumpy puzzle-movies, if you're a horror fan-who takes to disappointment well-or if you need somewhere to sleep for an hour or two."
"openeyes","Null","2","4","19 February 2006"," An Insult to my Intelligence
","The inhabitants of a small rural community maintain an uneasy truce with a menace in the neighboring woods and a greater terror beyond them in the new thriller by M. Night Shyamalan. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The trailer and commercials were sufficiently creepy. If only the film lived up to half the promise, but it didn't. The film had potential, personified in the performance by Bryce Dallas Howard, who seems to be a legitimate talent. Unfortunately, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan failed to deliver the goods because he tried too hard to deliver the goods. I think the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" doomed him. Now he feels it necessary to outdo the shocking ending of that film. Therein lies the problem with ""The Village. When you know, as everyone does, that it is a film with a ""shocking"" twist, you become distracted from the ""drama"" by the hunt for clues to the ending. At least I do. This time, however, one didn't need to hunt too much. Considering the film's setting, I thought the ""twist"" had to be one of two things: It was either set in the present, or the village's inhabitants were prisoners in some sort of alien menagerie. (Both concepts were, I believe, exhausted by The Twilight Zone decades ago.) At the first glimpse of the monster, I correctly suspected the first option. As I considered the implications of that scenario, I grew increasingly angry. The scenario simply wasn't workable. I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Their society simply couldn't exist without contact with the outside world. For example, Phoenix worked as a blacksmith. That's nice, but where does he get the iron to create things? Do they mine it themselves? I didn't see any mines. Also, what about their clothes? They could certainly make it themselves if they had cloth, but where were the cotton fields? It'd be one thing if they were all wearing all wool clothing. The list goes on and on into absurdity. Also, all the elders keep a locked trunk with their ""modern"" items. Don't you think one of the children, out of natural curiosity, would have broke open one of the boxes and looked inside? Think about it. When you were growing up, didn't you look inside everyone old box in your home? A lock would only make you want to look into even more! No kid could resist! And what's up with all the phony ""King James""-style talk? Why would the elders start talking like that? The youngsters who grew up in the community wouldn't know the difference between old fashioned and modern speech. That was a stupid and totally unnecessary. Ugh! This film was an insult to my intelligence. While I enjoyed some of his earlier films, I think it might be time to jump off the M. Night Shamalamading-dong bandwagon."

","I love Shyamalan's films. His ability to take extraordinary events and place them in a very ordinary context, with true Everymen as the protagonists is a challenge indeed and he, usually, pulls it off marvelously. The dark, gritty, unpolished look of his films adds a sense of realism to otherwise impossibly bizarre tales of ghosts, aliens, gods and superheroes. The Village, however poorly advertised, does not amount to anything more than one massive anticlimax.<br/><br/>The film is pitched as a supernatural thriller (no doubt to play on the spectacular success of films like The Sixth Sense and Signs). Fair enough. And ""twist"" endings are fun, in general, God knows Shyamalan is a master in the field. However, that said, when your ""twist"" ending is to undo the magic, the intrigue, the mystery of the film without replacing it with something of equal or greater value, you're left with a remarkably, painfully disappointed viewer. Everything that could have possibly worked in favor of this film came to a mind- numbing, insipid halt as the ""twist"" ending revealed the truth to the characters locale and historical context, deflating any and all hope of the supernatural and leaving us with yet another tale of misguiding good intentions and the decisions of a few old patriarchs and matriarchs that derail their children from reality. <br/><br/>Blah, blah, blah. It was a boring film made all the worse by Shyamalan's taking a knife and stabbing his plot squarely in the eye, bleeding this film dry of the only thing that made it interesting; his realistic take on yet another interesting supernatural event. These decisions are inherent in the film itself and the blame cannot be placed squarely on the shoulders of a marketing/trailer campaign that pitched the film as something it was not. <br/><br/>A few good moments, some talented actors (mostly wasted talent), cannot overcome what is quite simply a very, very boring film with an overdone moral and absolutely nothing new and fresh to offer."

I felt so bad about the fact they lied, that I didn't pay attention to the film. Not until the second viewing. Than it became clear.<br/><br/>This is essentially a love story. A story about hope and actually trying to make the world a better place. Shyamalan's script is intelligent and he loves his characters. He gives them the best dialogue I've heard in film for a long time. Yes, he does pull my leg (just like the marketing machine) but the funny thing is that the film is really honest. Especially in the final act. There will still be people who'll hate this. But that can only be because they still want a Sixth Sense kinda film.

We also discovered that we were already on the other side of that boy's nightmare. <br/><br/>Pretty interesting stuff here, Shyamalan, I will sally forth and buy more tickets to witness your subsequent filmsderivative, yet spooky spectacles that, I presume, will spark my jaded senses for all spectacles celluloid.<br/><br/>And, yes, a few more of these spectacles followed.<br/><br/>For me ""Unbreakable"" (while still chipped and forgettable) nevertheless kept that spark going.<br/><br/>""Signs"" contains a few creepy goosing moments, combining 1980s United Kingdom crop circle-hoax phenomena with 1970s Erich Von Däniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"" crop circle-hoax phenomena I for one 'ate both plates' anyway, as did many other film fans of the outré sect. <br/><br/>""Signs"" also had one final scene in which the respective adult and child had to save themselves from the harmful, outside forces that be (in this case, the traditional sci-fi bug-eyed extraterrestrial creatures that somehow further managed to whet our Shyamalan-film appetites).<br/><br/>A few years later, ""The Village"" arrived on billboards and later in theaters... and my curiosity, however diminished, was still intact. This time, however, something gave me a hunch that I should stay home and wait for friends and film critics to empty their pockets before I did.<br/><br/>I was right. This one reeked worse than a steaming compost heap.<br/><br/>Not long after its DVD release, I paid this rural town a visit and found nobody was home. <br/><br/>Sure, this film is filled with the usual oddball denizens seen in other similarly designed fictional burgs: the widow, the widower, the village idiot, the blind girl/vestal virgin with extrasensory sight, and the usual band of foreign-born yahoos (Gaelic, Welsh, Scottish, Australianit matters not which country these actor imports are from...they're stored somewhere in Hollywood or Broadway, kept in suspended animation, thawed and then served to us to further entice our presumed desire for watching classically trained actors fall flat on their faces).<br/><br/>But I digress. ""The Village"" tries its best to entice us with that same sense of wonder that had theatergoers clamoring for movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" and, to a lesser degree, the director's subsequent films.<br/><br/>I expected more sizzle from 'Village.' Actors Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are just here as authoritarian figureheads to spark nonexistent yearnings for each other (breadcrumbs to lure the unsuspecting Shyamalan-film fan, no doubt...these actors have seen better days); Adrian Brody will never become Jodie Foster or Sally Field in the way of acting (or even Leonardo de Caprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""), no matter how many Oscars Aidan wins; and I advise Joaquin Phoenix to start looking for another landlord director.<br/><br/>Lastly, 'Village' is just one big talcum powder-keg precision-timed to blow up in our faces. See it if you believe all the hype regarding its thoughtful message and all that... I say this 2004 movie was all just a waste of time and DVD-rental money."

Forget the trailers that you've seen, those trailers are VERY misleading. See the movie with an open mind, don't wait for the 'twist' ending, and you'll like it as I did. And despite what I said previously, this movie also has a couple of scares which work very well.<br/><br/>I won't talk about the storyline to not spoil anything for you. Shymalan's directing is excellent as always. The movie doesn't suffer from the pacing problems that Shyamalan's earlier movies had ( especially Signs ). The music is awesome, I still don't believe that it lost the best music Oscar to Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, with Bryce Dallas Howard stealing every scene she's in.

What was clever and even unsettling in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" became just silly, if still a little scary in ""Signs"", and here is spun out interminably until boredom overtakes any sense of dread. This is a kid's fairy-tale scare picture without the scares, a morality tale with no moral.<br/><br/>A stellar cast (and that includes the Best Actor Oscar winner of two years ago, Adrien Brody) manage to keep straight faces and act with a high seriousness bordering on insanity.

"riverspipe","3","2","4","8 March 2005"," Do I have to be the one that says it?
","Let us just get it out of the way- M Night Shyamalan sucks. He is a horrible director. He glosses over poorly written dialogue and shallow, plodding scripts with sumptuous cinematography and good tunes. He is so inept that he cannot even get good performances out of William Hurt and Joaquin Phoenix, and the probable reason many people complain of boredom is because M Night. is no Kubrick- he does not know how to construct hypnotic sequences of dialogue between interlocutors, or even how to shoot dialogue effectively (first poor scene I remember- the daughter asking William Hurt for his permission to court Lucius). Nearly everything Noah (that’s the retarded guy) does is to advance this poorly written script, which makes it obvious that he is included only to advance it, and hence, more inferior writing becomes apparent (if the rest of the one dimensional cast did not make it so already).<br/><br/>If the film wanted to make its allegedly ""brilliant"" statement, it was not necessary to have the film set in modern times- that was supposed to be some sort of ""whoa, I got you"" climax to make up for the preceding tedium, which, by the way, was not that difficult to figure out since M. Night prides himself on ""twists."" The revelation of the monster rouse is discovered in the least cinematic way possible. Instead, someone should have started to notice that the monsters may be a farce, and finally confronted the elders. More incidents involving the monsters should have unfolded (including all the rituals the people performed to keep them safe)- unless of course you enjoyed the redundancy of the interminable middle hour.<br/><br/>The entire thread about living outside of modern times should have been discarded, since the film gives it short philosophical elaboration anyway, and it is not a brilliant rumination, unless you're the same person who just read Brave New World or 1984 etc. and thinks they have some sort of philosophical depth now absorbed into their soul. The plot line about the monsters would have been sufficient- it would have tackled the actions of the elders, could have taken place in the 19th century, and brought all the same philosophical qualms, which are not even tackled by the film, just raised. Unfortunately, even that plot line is shoddy and unsuccessful."

","After seeing both ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", I was really looking forward to M. Night Shamalyns ""The Village"". But much to my disappointment, I found The Village to be nothing like his other films, and definitely of worse quality The first thing I felt watching this film was absolute confusion. The main characters weren't introduced until about midway through, giving very little time to develop them. In fact, they were so undeveloped, I didn't even care when things happened to them. I began rooting for the ""creatures"" that lived in the village to please end this miserable film.<br/><br/>And that's just my problem with the characters.<br/><br/>The plot was flimsy, unclear, and definitely not the horror plot of the year. It seemed as if the direction had jotted some notes on paper and then the rest of the crew somewhat tried to follow them. With a weak plot and character development, I was not happy.<br/><br/>But I'm not finished.<br/><br/>I didn't find one aspect of this movie frightening in the slightest. There were some parts where my friends and I got ready to scream, only to burst into laughter at the ridiculous attempts to scare us.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3/10, just because I'm still a ""Night"" fan.

"foxx_1","2","2","4","25 February 2005"," Slow, pretentious, disappointing...
","The opening sequences were quite promising: sombre musical score coupled with slow moving shots of misty tree branches... OK, not very original but convincing. The opening scene adds up more expectations: a funeral of a 7 year old boy, the tombstone telling us exactly the year being 1897. Was he killed by the creatures, the viewer might wonder as during the wake following the funeral distant howling is heard coming from the woods, causing everyone present - except an obviously insane person - to adopt a serious and worried look on their faces. And then... We are confronted right away with Shyamalan's obvious obsession with the color red: while focusing subtly on it in ""The 6th sense"" was intriguing, reusing it in this film with a vengeance means that there is simply a lack of imagination on his side. So we are treated duly with close ups of a red flower, red berries etc. while being told through the movie's protagonists that this is the ""bad"" color (for those who don't get it otherwise...) For no apparent reason, we witness a lengthy scene where a minor female character professes her love for Lucius Hunt (one of the major male characters, simply discarded in the second half of the movie) - only to be followed by another lengthy scene of a lullaby for the brokenhearted. This simply cannot be considered as a buildup of any kind but just as a filler - unfortunately, the same can be said about dozens and dozens of scenes that follow, containing pointless small talk in strange English which for sure was not used around 1897 (just look up some contemporary literature or newspaper article from that period). So we see them (i.e. the villagers) talk in a green house, talk in a hall, talk at a wedding, talk outside, talk inside, talk, talk, talk... Of course, after a while I couldn't help looking at the DVD display to see how much of the movie is left. And it even gets worse: through this constant chit-chat we learn that the creatures (called for no apparent reason ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" - still better than ""Those Who Are Hiding In The Woods And We Speak Of But Never Admit To"") made an agreement with the village folks not to step over the imaginary border - which would keep everyone wondering how this deal was struck. And on top of that, these creatures seem to be quite good fellas actually - they seem to recognize the fact that the mentally challenged character (played by Adrian Brody) has a pure and innocent heart so they don't harm him at all even if he does enter into their territory - or that's what we are told at least. At the same time, the local children are afraid to death to even stand near the border (as it is shown in one sequence) - which implies that their hearts are neither innocent nor pure so they will be justly killed by the creatures with unique and keen understanding of the human soul. Anyhow, at one point the wood inhabitants seem to be pretty upset by the behavior of the villagers although the latter have not done anything so unusual to provoke them - and that's when the going gets tough: the village gets invaded by one (yes, I am not kidding) creature which is enough to make everyone hide in their basements (!?!). The normal question that will pop up in everyone's mind is: are the villagers actually a hybrid between chicken and human or what? Back then people in villages like that usually kept rifles in their houses - and if they did not have rifles for whatever reason, then what about axes, scythes, pitchforks etc.? But it turns out that the creatures are just out for fun and into some kind of Helloween rituals: they just walk around the village and don't break anything nor do they harm anyone. I guess they should have at least thrown around some toilet paper in return for not getting any candy. After this raid, being so scary and devastating, the villagers seem to be scared stupid - so when Lucius is stabbed by the aforementioned mentally handicapped one, no one dares to even think of crossing the woods to go to ""the towns"" to get medicine. And of course, why - what if a creature jumps in front of you and goes ""booh""? So why not send a blind girl to go through the forest she has never entered before so that she can go to a town she has never been to so that she can get some medicine she has never heard of? It's a piece of cake, right?? To make things simpler, the blind girl is not given any money either - I guess, the ""village"" despises it as source of all evil... surely there will be a kind soul out there having pity on a blind girl in a muddy dress asking for some life saving medicine! <br/><br/>By the time the ""secret"" of the scary creatures gets lifted, I was bored enough not to bother who the h*ck they are. Same applies to the second ""twist"" - I admit I did not expect it since the year was clearly shown in the beginning but so much the worse if Shyamalan is using tricks like that to poke the viewer with a ""gotcha"" grin on his face - I would just call this cheap cheating.<br/><br/>I am sure though that if Shyamalan had delivered the suspense and chills the audience expected, they would have forgiven him for being fooled like that. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen either: the creatures turn out to be a ""farce"" as William Hurt's character poignantly admits - too bad this revelation applies to the whole movie as well."

You folks can't see the connections?!<br/><br/>I completely agree with Shyamalan, but he is going too easy on the religious folk. He's likely after the big bucks and doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds him. I am intolerant of religious beliefs, as I am with most nonsense and childish thinking. Religion doesn't or shouldn't automatically get a pass that we would never provide other sets of beliefs (e.g., fascism, Sharia law, chiropractic, osteopathy, Santa Claus, and the Tooth fairy).

"MurdukRambo","3","2","4","17 January 2005"," About as bad as the Village People... **/5
","Mr. Shyamalan is quite the director. In some ways, he has reached legendary status among movie goers. The Sixth Sense, while I didn't care for it as much, is regarded as one of the best and scariest movies of our time. His style of directing is almost of a post-modern Hitchcock style.<br/><br/>I find movies lately that I watch are usually made or broken with the last 30 minutes. It sounds very shallow and it is. Now, thats not to say I don't appreciate the majority of the movie but the ending is what really leaves you with your final opinion of the movie. Take Unbreakable. Mr. Shyamalan wrote and directed a movie; a movie that was so slow and seemed to be going no where... Until you reached the end. In those last two minutes, you understood why you'd watched the movie. You watched the ending and wow, it sat with you.<br/><br/>In fact, to clear things up so you don't totally discount my review, the end of a movie justifies the rest of it. And it is with this lengthy introduction that I begin my review of the Village.<br/><br/>Now, as far as the Village, basically I think the Village wasn't really a BAD movie per-say. I didn't hate it. Truth be told, as I was watching it, I found myself kinda interested. Who knows? Maybe it was another Unbreakable... Until the end. The end did not justify the means, nor the means the end. And I hope to tell you why.<br/><br/>-Sample Stuff One: The Village was disappointing.<br/><br/>I was watching the preview again last night, and though I saw it twice, I almost wanted to see it again, until I remembered that the majority of the movie was a romantic film. Yes, it's true. The previews make this film look scary and suspenseful. Now, I won't discount that there were a few scenes that, on first view, make you feel kinda scared. But by the end, you won't have any trouble flicking off the light at night.<br/><br/>Now, if this movie had been advertised as the romantic-drama it was, sure, i wouldn't have gone to see it but I could respect it for what it was. But, when you false advertise a movie like this and make it seem like the scare of the century, you draw blood.<br/><br/>-Smaple Stuff 2: The twist had nothing on his other films.<br/><br/>Now, I know some would beg to differ but I concur that the twists in The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs were phenomenal. To say this doesn't have a twist would be a lie. It has a twist... it's just not very good.<br/><br/>The problem with the twist is it doesn't follow the same pattern as the other films.<br/><br/>-SPOILERS- In the Sixth Sense, MNS told us a tale about Dead People and proved they were real.<br/><br/>In Unbreakable, MNS told us a tale about Superheroes and proved they were real.<br/><br/>In Signs, MNS told us a tale about Aliens and proved they were real.<br/><br/>I won't tell you the twist of the Village but basically, it doesn't follow this formula that made these three films so great (in my opinion).<br/><br/>-END SPOILERS- Sample Stuff 3: The acting was pretty good.<br/><br/>My one praise for this film. The acting was nothing short of great. I wouldn't expect anything else with a star-studded cast like this but certainly, this film was well acted.<br/><br/>If the film had any chance at the academy, I could see Bryce Dallas Howard being nominated for best actress. It's hard work portraying a blind girl (Ivy) and man, she hit it right on the dot.<br/><br/>Before we go any farther, I should tell you a little bit about the story and like, I said, the concept was brilliant.<br/><br/>Our story takes place in a 19th century Village where folks live in a community. No, we have no idea why they are there but they seem to be living well.<br/><br/>Until we find out about those who live in the woods bordering the Village. It seems that there are monsters in the woods and if one crosses over into the woods, it means certain death for the person who violated the boundary, as well as sufferage for the whole town.<br/><br/>The monsters also love the color red and to combat them, they paint the trees near the boarder yellow (where they got that, I don't know). And, the story is about Lucius, the town adventurer who is quiet as a mouse and Ivy, the out-going blind girl hooking up. Did that last part throw the movie out the door for you? I hope so because the twist isn't worth the drama you have to go through.<br/><br/>If you know the film is a drama and are still game for it, heck, do what you want! In fact, I encourage you check it out. But don't expect to be scared.<br/><br/>If you think you'd like to see this film but it sounds to scary, I assure you, it isn't. My mom thought it sounded evil and later, she saw it and loved it (she's more of a drama person. :-)).<br/><br/>Also, on the note of the twist, I still won't tell you what it is but it is hard to predict in that it is the first thing that would come to your mind.<br/><br/>So, all in all, I didn't care for this movie. It was certainly one of Mr. Shyamalan's worst films (Wide Awake was pretty bad too but, we don't speak of that). By no means was this a horrible movie, but, you'd be better off with the Young Men at the Y.M.C.A. ;-)"

This film was simply a scam, and the ending simply showed that once again what you were led to believe was not the truth. At that was the whole of it. I did not see that the ""Truth"" had anything much to do with the blind girl or her lover. Did he even live? I enjoyed the atmosphere and some parts, but I have to feel a bit like some of those who saw ""Mark of the Vampire"" for the first time.

"esin2000","5","2","4","20 December 2004"," do you have answers to these questions?
","Hi everybody. Maybe i was just too bored in the movie so i missed some points. But until DVD is released,i won't be able to see it again so can someone answer my questions? I don't want to call the movie a disaster before i get the answers. (it there are any)<br/><br/>1. Let me see if i got the whole thing right;some people decided to create this ""village"" to protect their loved ones after they all suffered of violence in today's world and met at a support group. They somehow had great financial and political power that the area was isolated from any kind of flights (private,amateur flights,military jets,any sort of...),media,visitors and everything. Before they entered the village,they had some professional monster costumes made,wooden houses and furniture built,land prepared for planting and all the other equipments to start a new isolated life. Wow,that's a huge project! Who on earth can have such a power?<br/><br/>2. What is the thing with the forbidden color? What's the sense in getting rid of everything in RED color? I honestly couldn't understand it.<br/><br/>3. ""Blind girl loves the adventurous boy. He gets stabbed. She has to go to find antibiotics"" So this is the only time that this community ever needed something form the outside world in 20 years?! No woman needed medication while giving birth to a baby! No one ever had a major house accident,a very deep cut or infection! No child fell from a high tree and had a seriously broken bone that needed surgery!<br/><br/>4. Did the guards outside the woods knew anything about the inside? If not,how could the guard who found Ivy be very understanding and helpful to her? What if he didn't pass from that point until the other day? <br/><br/>5. Aren't there any lawyers or so outside,taking care of the property's lasting? Wouldn't it make sense if Ivy's father (who is the founder of the project) went out and got in touch with them from time to time? Why send Ivy for the medicine?<br/><br/>6. If the boys hadn't left Ivy alone,what would happen? The boys would see everything that Ivy couldn't see behind the walls,a strange man wearing strange clothes,using a talking machine,riding a strange vehicle... Was the village lucky that the boys left her alone,so that she went & came back without noticing the outside world? Now the village can go on?<br/><br/>7. At a scene William Hurt said ""we knew it would end someday"" to Sigourney Weaver. What did the elder people think would happen when it ended? How would the young generations (born & raised in the village) get over the shock? They will all have great psychological problems. Is it worth it? To build a world of lies to protect them from crime? How sick-minded can they be?<br/><br/>8. Am i taking the movie too serious? Should i just call it fiction and stop trying to think that it must make sense? Maybe the answers were in the movie and i missed them. Generally I am not a lousy watcher,really."
"Danny_G13","2","2","4","14 December 2004"," The most stupid and absurd film ever made?
","Can I start by conveying my absolute disbelief that this film scored as highly as 6.5 on IMDb?<br/><br/>The Village is the latest offering from M Night Shyamalan, and I began viewing with tredipation such is the downward spiral of his career. Sixth Sense was magnificent, Unbreakable was quirky and passable, Signs was brilliantly directed but ultimately its ending ruined it, and now this.<br/><br/>The Village is set around the 18th century and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius, a young and reserved man living in a small town. The town has a chequered past, in that there is a serious and dangerous rivalry between it and another village which mirrors it on the opposite side of a large forest which separates both. There is a tense 'ceasefire' between the villages so peace seems to be present. Indeed, in the forest itself there are dangers so the villagers *never* go in. There is also a colour code too - red represents the danger of the forest, and is forbidden in the village. <br/><br/>However, when it seems that the truce between the 2 villages has been broken, the walls of civilization apparently begin to crack, and chaos starts to dominate life in the village.<br/><br/>To say any more could spoil the story, so the summation will halt there. <br/><br/>There is a good cast here; Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody make up a very strong group of actors. You are given at least decent performances by them all, but Weaver and Brody are both criminally underused and woefully miscast. Brody was the pianist for goodness sake and he's been reduced to a minor Forrest Gump-style character in this. Why on earth did he accept such a poor role? Weaver also deserves better. Little more than a peripheral character, Lucius' mother, she's truly Hollywood royalty and such a small part to play is a complete waste of her time.<br/><br/>Phoenix is the main character along with the relatively unheard of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy, daughter of William Hurt's Walker, and all 3 of the above are given fairly meaty roles, particularly Hurt who's by far the best thing about the Village. Howard is slightly melodramatic and sentimental, and Phoenix isn't sympathetic enough, though reasonable, as the almost autistic Lucius.<br/><br/>Outside of the basic flaws which I'll get to later, The Village suffers pretty feeble direction. Signs was far better, and almost an exercise in how to direct a thriller. The Village, on the other hand, seems to bore with its direction, and completely lacks interest. <br/><br/>However, the main gripe is simply the ridiculousness of it all. This is an unbelievably contrived film, which simply defies sensibilities and makes up its own rules. Being different can be good, but doing it for the sake of is really not. This film at times feels like a 15 year old is just making it up on the spot.<br/><br/>The ending is simply vacuous and not clever at all. There is no way I can bring myself to say 'ah, so *that's* why it's been ridiculous, oh, well that's really smart then'. Believe me, I've tried.<br/><br/>Overall this is a silly and futile film which is partially saved by Hurt, but its stupidities cost it dearly.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","Oh for Christ's sake... Okay, forget the 'predictable' ending! What the bloody hell are you people complaining so tiresomely about?! You just do NOT get this film at all, do you?

"h1tm4n_","5","2","4","8 October 2004"," Again NOT what I have expected
","Well I admit that I am a fan of horror movies and thrillers and that I really like scary movies that are intelligent. As I saw the trailer to THE VILLAGE I thought that this is going to be a horror movie. The only reason why I do not say that this movie is bad, is the acting of Bryce Dallas Howard - she is awesome.<br/><br/>After I watched THE VILLAGE, I just felt like after watching SIGNS. I got this CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK (OR AT LEAST SOME OF THE MONEY) BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO SEE? feeling. I felt like WHY?<br/><br/>THE VILLAGE is undoubtedly an excellent peace of work about sociology. Is shows how people want to protect their child from what they think is not good for them and what they are willing to do to reach for love. But it is NOT a GOOD movie. It is TOO LIMP!<br/><br/>But what should Night do? He can't tell you in the trailer, that the monsters do not exist. How many people would have watched it than? I guess less than they did now?<br/><br/>I don't know how to describe it, but this movie felt like NOTHING and I do not want to see it another time, even if you would pay for it.<br/><br/>Night you will have to write a better story and script to impress me!! And for all you who think that a story needs a U turn to be impressive, it does not. Earlier movies did not have such things and future movies will later drop it too. This is just a habit of our generation as writers seem to enjoy this and always try to build such stories and fail to focus on the more important things.<br/><br/>And now to the actors and actresses. I already told you that Bryce Dallas Howard was great. But Joaquin Phoenix failed to attract my attention. This was not one of his best performances. Sigourney Weaver had so little screen time that she did not even have the chance to impress me. I felt sorry for her. She is a great actress I think.<br/><br/>MY RATING for THE VILLAGE is: 5.8 / 10"
"davideo-2","Null","2","4","1 September 2004"," A load of rubbish
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>A group of village dwellers in the late 1800s live across the field from 'those things of which we don't speak.'However,some of the dwellers feel mysteriously compelled to summon these things,and it is from here that the hard reality of their lives begins to eerily creep through.<br/><br/>Following on from the excellent Signs and The Sixth Sense and the perfectly watchable Unbreakable,writer/director M Night Shyamalan has now added a new film to his CV which doesn't even match the quality of the latter film and most certainly doesn't patch up to the first two.<br/><br/>Considering big name stars like Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson head-billed his last two films,this is a comparatively no name affair,featuring stars that either may have reached the peak but not quite the pinnacle of their careers (Joaquin Phoenix,Adrien Brody) or those who have been out the limelight for far too long for their star power to retain any value (Sigourney Weaver,William Hurt).I actually thought it looked more like a new TV series the first time I saw it and even then it would just be something Shyamalan would just sort of lend his name to.And the damn thing is,despite the fact that they're all moreorless perfectly fine actors (Weaver won an Oscar,for God's sake!) they all seem to turn in really terrible performances here.Even the more experienced cast members feel wooden,unconvincing and terribly,terribly forced.It wouldn't really be fair to single a single one of them out,because they're all the same,but it would be fair to mention that Brody is the only one who really stands out,turning in a fairly good performance as a mentally challenged young man.As previous efforts have shown,this is a guy with seriously good talent as a dramatic actor and,if he keeps picking the right roles,or,even if he turns in good performances in bad films,has a seriously good future ahead of him in Hollywood and if he keeps turning in good performances,how can he go wrong?...<br/><br/>Mind you,maybe it's the source material that's weighing them down (hey,anyone see Dennis Quaid around here?)With a story that emerges as unengaging and not particularly interesting,maybe they're having as much fun trawling the script out as we are sitting watching it.<br/><br/>As for the film managing to be scary,it's very weird,because although I could see the scary scenes coming from about a mile away,they still managed to make me jump for some reason.But maybe I'm just a sensitive sort of guy.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's standard twist comes at the end,although it's truly baffling.I certainly couldn't make any sense of it.But then,maybe I couldn't pay close enough attention to it to be able to.As with all Shyamalan's films up to this point,this is certainly a case of intriguing concept.It's just one that really fails to pay off.*"
"fabibi","1","2","4","19 August 2004"," What a shame !
","This movie is simply awful. I just don't get it : how could such a great director do such a lame movie ? I had guessed the whole plot and the so called shocking ending just two minutes after the movie had begun. Plus, this is absolutely not scary at all. I know Shyamalan says everywhere that he didn't plan to make a scary movie but a love story, but the thing is, when your whole marketing campaign is based on the ""horror of the unseen"", that's a pretty lame argument and an awful way to fool the audience. And I'm sorry to say, the love story, as it is, is a sad bore. We've been told this kind of love story a thousand times, and most of the time it was better than this. Now, the acting : Adrien Brody is not going to prove he deserved his best actor Oscar with THAT. He's completely ridiculous in a role that's, sadly, completely pointless and was probably written to fill all the holes in the screenplay. Poor Joaquin Phoenix has not much to do and he disappears in the middle of the movie (maybe he begged the director for that ? ""Please, write me off this movie !!!""). Sigourney Weaver is non existent. The only good thing of ""The Village"" is the luminous Bryce Dallas Howard. You can say she's going to have a great career just for being able to go through this whole movie with dignity and grace. Now, Shyamalan, enough with so called twisty endings and pseudo thrillers that scare no one. Even Steven Spielberg knew that the miracle that ""Jaws"" was could not be made twice. So stop doing ""The Sixth Sense"" all over again and try something new !"
"TerminalMadness","10","2","4","17 August 2004"," Don't go into the woods... (Breaking this down)
","After lots of cryptic movie posters all over the walls in theaters, posters that showed two hands holding a letter, posters that wouldn't tell a thing to the casual movie-goer, after cryptic television teasers, commercials that gave nothing away but still kept audiences shocked with its atmosphere induced images, and after a really cheesy really bad mock-documentary exploring the ""Secrets of M. Night Shyamalan"" which ended up being nothing than a promotional program , director M. Night Shyamalan has again kept audiences wondering, has kept the media guessing, and has kept critics talking.<br/><br/>I, being a big fan of recent Shyamalan outings, my favorite being ""Signs"", I sat in anticipation awaiting Shyamalan's next brainteaser, and I wasn't disappointed. The new film from the director who brought us some truly groundbreaking brainteasers, this time centers around a small village of people in the 1800's, they're a small Utopian society with families and law givers, a committee of elders who watch over the town of Covington and decide for them, and they have their gatherings and drama like every other town, however, they cannot walk outside of the borders of their town.<br/><br/>At night they watch the woods with torches up at every point of the border into the woods and if they breach it they risk disturbing the mysterious force within the trees, a force that watches them. The elders include a group of older people including William Hurt who plays the dignified Edward Walker who watches over his people and gives speeches in nearly every scene, and then there's the younger generation including the very funny, always likable Judy Greer who plays Kitty Walker the sister desperate to be married, Greer is very good in the film, his love interest Alice Hunt who rules alongside him, then there's the mentally disabled Noah Percy who's friends with Ivy Walker, the beautiful younger sister of Kitty, Ivy played by Bryce Dallas Howard in her feature film debut.<br/><br/>Daughter of Ron Howard, Howard is just incredible, stealing the show, but we'll get back to her in a minute. Finally, there's Lucius Hunt, the silent but sometimes heroic man of the village who doesn't say much and isn't good with words but nonetheless follows orders and serves as one of the night watchmen who nervously look on in the trees. But when the force of the forest begins to break the truce created decades ago, the villagers begin to look for a way to stop them and live in peace once again.<br/><br/>Within the characters, there are love triangles. Kitty is in love with Lucius, who is in love with Ivy, but is afraid to admit it, and Ivy is friends with Noah who is also in love with Ivy. And with the spirit of ""Wuthering Heights"" the romances take their place, courtesy of Judy Greer who plays the all too forward Kitty who has a really funny scene in the beginning setting up Ivy's entrance. Ivy is blind but within her disability lies some sort of precognitive ability to see people, or as she says ""their color"".<br/><br/>While her disability is a bit inconsistent throughout the film, Howard is just breathtaking. Any person who is a fan of Shyamalan, or has seen much of his films will definitely be looking for points in the film that will lead to a surprise ending or major plot twist and they will be looking for objects that bear a sign to what would lead to an ending, which Shyamalan has conditioned his audience to do, but while, as usual, in every Shyamalan film there are surprises, but what I won't reveal if there is a surprise ending or not.<br/><br/>True, I do tend to give away a lot in my reviews, but not this time. I want you to go into this film with a clueless attitude, and you will be clueless. Here are my clues to the story: No, they are not ghosts from the past, they are not aliens or any other unearthly being, and they are definitely not superheroes, but the story is quite tragic with a sense of Romeo and Juliet mixed with ""Wuthering Heights"". This is indeed a romance film with dread, a romance with a sense of urgency that Shyamalan masters from beginning to end, a romance with many dimensions. The heavy feeling of dread with Shyamalans direction make the woods seem simply horrifying and just beautiful all at the same time, there are shots in the film that are stunning and Shyamalan creates a sort of dream-like land with the woods becoming its own character amidst the cast.<br/><br/>Every tree takes on a life of its own, every shadow, every branch, and every scene seems meticulously filmed to make the story complete. There are scenes in the film that demonstrate Shyamalans talent for color as he makes the land of Covington so colorful, so magical while he makes the woods shown in the finale seem so pale, placid, and at night utterly horrifying. Shyamalan takes childhood fears: the woods, darkness, sounds, and brings it back to us in droves with some truly scary imagery particularly the scenes with the watchtower as the woods loom below in the darkness.<br/><br/>Once again, there's a heavy significance of color use in Shyamalan's films. For The Sixth Sense there was red, for ""Unbreakable"" there was green, for ""Signs"" there was blue, and for this there's a heavy use of the colors of red and yellow, two colors which can be seen throughout the film a lot. As with ""The Sixth Sense"" red is a dreadful color meant to symbolize death, and in this film it is quite a dangerous sign, but I won't reveal for what. Many of the usual Shyamalan signs are here. The significance of water, the over the shoulder camera views where we hear a character's voice but never see their face, and of course, Shyamalan's teasing of sound, his best attribute when directing a film. Shyamalan's best attributes during his films are color and sound. He has a gift with making sound seem so threatening, the slightest sound in the film makes all the difference and for this, sound is a horrifying notion. All activity stops when there's sound in the woods, many of the scenes are silent with only music, and many of the key scenes in the film have no soundtrack. The woods become a character and presence, because of Shyamalan's focus of sound within the confines of the trees. Every twig snap, every creak, every moan is amplified and frightening.<br/><br/>Amidst ""The Village"" there are some excellent performances including William Hurt who is finally put to use in a film as the town elder, Judy Greer who is entertaining and funny to watch, Joaquin Phoenix, an always likable aspect in every film he's in is excellent as the silent and noble Lucius who has a lot of bottled emotions but little ways to show them because of his lack of skill in speaking, Adrien Brody off his Oscar winning stint in ""The Pianist"" is excellent as Noah the mentally handicapped innocent who has a thing for Ivy though he never really knows how to show it. The two have a special bond and their relationship is something to watch for here.<br/><br/>I am never expecting a great performance from the child of a famous actor or director in Hollywood because either they barely make it out of the park ala Alyson Eastwood, or they're just never heard from again after a movie or two. There's Sofia Coppola who gave a horrible debut in her first and only acting role in ""Godfather 3"", but then there's Michael Douglas, son of Kirk Douglas who managed to individuate from his fathers legend with his own skill for acting.<br/><br/>Which category does Bryce Dallas Howard fall into? Douglas' category. Howard, who replaced Kirsten Dunst (who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts), is incredible in the lead role as Ivy, the blind and sometimes mystical girl in the village. Howard gives a breathtaking performance in the film and she will definitely make a name for herself setting herself apart from the tag of ""Ron Howard's daughter "". I have faith that she will become a landmark in acting for the new generation of actors. She will break from her fathers shadow with her vulnerability and grace echoing Audrey Hepburn, her powerful on-screen presence and range echoing Meryl Streep along with unique beauty that seems to radiate on-screen. Simply, she steals the show and Shyamalan makes a great casting choice here.<br/><br/>All the while, Shyamalan has another very sophisticated story to tell, an intricate, meticulous, and very pleasant film to watch with beautiful direction and a very sad and tragic story beneath its facade of horror. Movie critics are so quick to pick apart and dissect everything M. Night Shyamalan does maybe because he's so brilliant, his character depth and stories so linear and meticulous, or maybe our modern culture has grown to the point where we don't want a story anymore, we just want a quick fix along with explosions and gore. Perhaps they're threatened by him, or maybe I'm being dramatic, but you're going to be looking for a plot twist, but look at the acting, look at the beautiful direction, and look at the touching story of humanity and the all too relevant message Shyamalan puts across of how human nature is that, human nature, and part of our nature is violence regardless of how you try to break it down. Shyamalan brings about a truly modern message told within a fantastic tale and I urge you to pay attention to everything else and stop trying to look for the twist, and for the critics, Shyamalan is an excellent storyteller and his themes are universal, so why simply pull his films apart? Shyamalan challenges our imaginations, scares us all the while bringing us his message of violence, government, politics, love, and social commentary within the concept. And again, my wait for Shyamalan's next film begins."
"Chris-624","2","2","4","11 August 2004"," Shyamalan is 1 for 4!
","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>With the disappointment of ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" my expectations for ""The Village"" we understandably low. Surprisingly, it still managed to fall way short. The premise of the film, as outlined in the trailers, would have proved much more thrilling (and in some ways more believable) than the story that unfolds. <br/><br/>The main problems with the film are these: 1) the ""twist"" can be spotted a mile away and when you realize what it is, you hope you're wrong because it's not only obvious, but uninteresting. 2) the film proves so unrealistic and to be almost laughably bad. <br/><br/>Shyamalan is still riding the coat tails of ""The Sixth Sense"" (an amazing film in every respect), but the public is starting to realize that it looks like he only has one good film in him. One should wonder why with a $60 million budget and the full support of the studio, why he couldn't get another giant name (Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis, and Mel Gibson in the past).<br/><br/>Could it be that the big names passed on the project? With any 2nd-tier director, this film would probably have gone straight to video.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Let's look at the primary issues with the film that make it such a disappointment.<br/><br/>When it's revealed to the audience that the village is actually present day and isolated in a nature preserve (although they certainly knew this long before the film reveals it) and the creatures in the woods are simply village elders in costume, this opens up a whole can of problems in and of itself:<br/><br/>1) The handful of village elders must take endless turns running around the woods in costumes (day and night) to keep up the charade, yet no one has ever seen them going in or coming out...even though they're routinely caring an eight foot tall creature costume?<br/><br/>2) Walker (Hurt) won't break his vow to go to the modern day town for medicine, but sends his blind daughter instead? And what kind of mother is Alice Hunt (Weaver) in that she's unwilling to break her vow and go to town herself? Her son is on the brink of death and she does nothing? Not believable.<br/><br/>3) When Walker decides to reveal the truth to his daughter, he takes her to the cabin where one of the creature costumes is hidden. He tells her not to scream, but lets her discover the costume with her hands, to her horror and surprise. What kind of sadistic creep is this guy? Why not tell her what's going on instead of trying to scare the hell out of her? The simple (albeit weak) answer is that the director was simply trying to build suspense where he couldn't make it fit logically.<br/><br/>4) We won't dwell too much on the blind woman outrunning Noah in full daylight. I don't care how heavy the costume might be, it just doesn't wash. This conflict should have been resolved better.<br/><br/>5) Then there's the brief explanation by the director (in his cameo) about why planes never fly over the reserve. Whatever. Fine. We can let that one go along withe the fact that everything about the reserve is so mysterious, there must be all kinds of kids sneaking in, but I guess they never found the village.<br/><br/>6) Perhaps the most awkward element that is never addressed is why these modern day Americans, living as early settlers, decide to speak antiquated English instead of the more common tongue they all spoke naturally? The obvious answer is again the director needing to manipulate the setting no matter how unrealistic. In truth, there is absolutely no reason for these villagers to not speak modern English (except, perhaps, with the exclusion of profanity to help promote their idealized world).<br/><br/>There are other issues with the film, but I've probably wasted too much time on this weak piece of film-making. We all had such high hopes for Shyamalan after ""The Sixth Sense"". Perhaps it would be impossible to live up to them, but it's not too much to expect decent film-making from a man who, at one time, had the golden touch."
"keith96778","2","2","4","14 August 2004"," Contrived boring drek (*spoilers*)
","This film is some of the most contrived boring drek to hit the screen in years. It is unbelievably simple minded. The mood is set by hushed voices who constantly speak of ""those of whom we do not speak."" The premise is that some dodo brains with lots of money establish a village in a remote reserve to escape the horrors of modern life (all of the elders lost loved ones to violence). So what's the plan: Let's pretend we live in the 19th century by scaring the holy shit out of our children by telling them there are monsters in the woods, keeping them barefoot and ignorant about the world and depriving them of basic necessities like medicine so they die before we have an overpopulation problem on our hands.<br/><br/>Of course, somehow the elders who isolate everyone have somehow allowed it to leak out that there is a town on the other side of the woods where there is medicine. Why their hostages ever need to know that, I don't know. <br/><br/>As the years pass, none of dimwitted kids ever figure out that the ""monsters"" are really pig bones in red jump suits. In the end, it is disclosed that the only person in the whole village who is not in on the scam, but figures it out is the homicidal raving lunatic who impulsively stabs the fiancé of the girl he seems to want for himself. We are supposed to believe that this guy who stabs the fiancé something like 4314214432 times (but doesn't quit kill him), then wanders around soaked in blood until he gets ""confined"" to a room with a window (from which he of course later escapes to make more trouble) is capable of keeping the monsters secret and pretending to be one without giving himself away in the process. THIS IS JUST STUPID!! The bad news is that this isn't the most stupid part. It's just the part I'm still laughing at so I thought I would mention it.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely to be avoided. <br/><br/>It is not scary. <br/><br/>It is not intellectual. <br/><br/>It is contrived, boring drek. <br/><br/>I gave it 2 out of 10, but only because I accidentally missed the 1 when I poked at it."

In fact, I had to keep my giggles muffled in the theatre for fear i would insult some of my neighbors who actually seemed to be into it. The dialogue was terribly flat, the plot impossible, and the twist--well, my girlfriend and I jokingly guessed the twist amongst ourselves in a sort of ""what if it turned out like this? wouldn't that be ridiculous"" and were appalled to find it actually moving in that direction.<br/><br/>don't waste your time with this movie unless you want a lesson in poor writing and film-making and a glimpse into the yes-man world of Hollywood: Friends don't let friends make embarrassingly terrible movies."

","M. had said in an Entertainment Weekly interview that this was primarily a love story. He is right. The distributor of this film is guilty for trying to sell it as a creepy thriller. It is very dull, and not scary. For pluses, the twist is cute and Howard and Hurt give great performances. But this film was VERY dull. I said it before with SIGNS. He needs oversight. The lapses in logic, the plot holes, and the bad dialogue need to be fixed and until studios are willing to pressure M. into working with others, we will see more great story ideas being ruined by shoddy storytelling.

Sorry kids...there were no humans maned at all...nothing to give you nightmares( unless retards scare you), or make you afraid of the woods and or camping. By movies end i was hoping that all the ""amish"" were killed once Ivy returned to the village...just because i hated them. I hated the acting more though...i really did. If you're gonna make a sucky movie at least get some talent. Brody was okay and ron howards kid did nicely too...but everyone else...make like rocky horror and go get acting lessons."

It was like Night couldn't decide which direction he wanted to go with the story line. after all. What was up with the blind girl saying she could see peoples colors? I am assuming she was talking about auras or however you spell it, but what did that have to do with anything and what was his color anyway? Why didn't that go anywhere? I mean don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Nights work but this movie was a big let down considering the type of work he usually does. I think the documentary was scarier than this movie.

Village only gets 3. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a smart and superb ending, forget this movie, watch the Other or tale of two sister. I really regret waiting almost 90 minutes, hoping Shyamalan would thrill me again with ending brilliance a-la 6th sense, only to discover he should switch career to TV! Village's conclusion is the worst element, anticlimax-ly disappointing. <br/><br/>I might still give this movie a 6 if the ending is smart. The only reason I gave this movie 3 instead of 1 was the only one exciting scene when the villagers sheltering for the attack of 'the not suppose to be mentioned creature"". Other than that, zzzzz.

You've just been had... this is movie is worse than Taking Lives (a similar movie in that it gives away the ending 20 mins in) but at least there are some interesting things happening later on. The Village has nothing. No interesting side plots. No interesting characters other than Ivy... She does a good job, but her character doesn't have enough depth to carry a movie. She is the ONLY part of this movie worth seeing. How can you have a 2-hour so called thriller, but give away the only 2 ""thrilling"" points of the movie 25 mins in. M.Night had a gem in Sixth Sense. People keep wondering why he brought that out 1st, & then the rest of this crap, i.e. Signs, Unbreakable, & the Village, afterwards... the reason is simple. If we had all seen any of those movies 1st, we would never have paid to see any more... much less paying to see Sixth Sense. So instead, he brings out the best 1st. Forcing us all to go see is later films in the hope one of them will be as good as the 1st. Well... they aren't... Not even Close. We have been had by a con artist on a mass scale...

Night fan and I've seen all of his movies and (possibly with this one) I had high hopes of it being a suspense thriller. But, much to my disappointment, it was more of a drama. The story had no main plot and things just kind of happened without ever any meaning. Night sure casted a lot of great actors, but he didn't give them much to work with. And poor Joaquin Phoenix Got SUCH a small role! I wouldn't be surprised if the National Park ranger guy at the end of the movie had more lines!

I think his treatment of this genre is suspect. M. views giving me a movie paced on a snail's back, intermittently interspersed with a flash of movement, to be the driving force of fear. Well, he should not confuse reaction with action. I feel that, his attempt to hide and move in the corners of our eyes to be a tired cliché at this point. M...I get it, slow then flash ...oooooh, I'm so scared. I feel his talent is over rated. As a crafter of suspense, I perceive him to be elevated by a public in search of the next Hitchok...this ain't him.

I thought it was going to be scary and I love scary movies. Boy was I misguided. I don't know which was worse, Adrien Brody's acting, or the dialogue.<br/><br/>How did Adrien Brody get an Oscar? His depiction of a disabled person was incredibly offensive. Could he not have at least observed a disable person before he tried to depict one? I know many disabled people and none of them act like that. It was just incredibly awful. Horrible.<br/><br/>The dialogue was awful. It was so boring, I couldn't stand it. Why must thou be so boring!<br/><br/>In addition to those two things, I thought the world Night created was horrible. Night has done an exceptional job in the past of creating a world that we, the audience, believe in. This world was not believable. The first time I saw a ""monster"", I had to keep myself from laughing hysterically. The dialogue and acting certainly did not help in giving his world any credibility.<br/><br/>Joaquin and Bryce both did an excellent job.

","The worst movie I have seen of the summer. THE WORST! And don't send me some e-mail saying I'm hateful to M. Night Shyamalan, because I'm not. I LOVE his movies(except this one) and was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I'm also one of the ones who knew about the leaked script and read it. I was also disappointed by this script.<br/><br/>The Village is about a small village in Pennsylvania, around the late 1800s. The villagers with in live in the knowledge of strange creatures that are just outside their border. Lucius Hunt(Phoenix) wishes to leave the village and journey into the woods. Edward Walker(Hurt) and the other elders(Weaver, Gleeson, etc...) are not so enthusiastic about this idea. A love story follows between Lucius and Ivy Walker(Howard).<br/><br/>One thing that ruins this film: BORING! This film was completely false advertised as a thriller and scary. If you want to see all the scary parts, watch the trailers again, because that's all of 'em. Scary, eh?<br/><br/>And the twist. (Groan) Oooooooohhhhh, the twist. I ain't going to say anything, but when I read the script, I could have guessed it a mile away. And seeing this movie, it was like reading the script all over again. Lemme tell ya, if you've read the script, don't bother. I mean, yeah, there are so major changes, but basically it's the same. You will still be disappointed. No, I take it back, it's not the boringness that ruins this film, it's the twist. This film is so caught up in its twist, that it fails to answer its own question and kinda leaves you there hanging. Well, Night, that may have worked in Total Recall, but you obviously couldn't pull it off here, because it left me feeling totally cheated, and wondering ""What did I just see? Did that have a point to it, or was Night just stringing me along to go BOOM! here's a twist. Answer the questions yourself."" I'm sorry, Night, but I don't wanna guess at stuff and guess what just happened. I wanna know. FOR SURE. Not leave 500000000000 open questions that leave you so confused you just say, ""Forget it. Not wasting my time pondering about a stupid movie.""<br/><br/>As Jordann Pundik sang in 2's and 3's:<br/><br/>""Stupid games are for stupid people and they end just like a song A song with no beginning A song that has no meaning""<br/><br/>Night was definitely playing a stupid game, and I'm not sure if it really had a meaning worth looking for."

The only thing scary about this dreck was it was almost 2 hours long. The theater was packed but the audience left disappointed; there were moments during the film when we all laughed...but I don't believe the director was trying to be funny. It has plot holes big enough to drive a truck through and the explanation of the supernatural ""goings on"" is not only moronic, but implausible (if not impossible).

Signs was not at all what I expected it to be, but I really enjoyed it and rather liked that it turned out to be a character study (with some laughs and a few scares) rather than a monster movie.<br/><br/>On to ""The Village"" which feels, actually, like a C-grade adaptation of a Shirley Jackson story. The acting is wooden, the ""twist"" is easily discernible within the first 30 minutes, and the film has utilized editing (and not well) in order to fill in substantial gaps in the story.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, I might have liked this movie had Touchstone obviously not turned its PR department on full-force to get people into the theaters by building it up to be something it obviously was not and if the movie, when all was said an done, was satisfying in any way. It is very obvious that the execs at Disney saw this film and went ""how the heck are we gonna sell this? It's slow, nothing happens, and the story is really derivative?"" They concocted their marketing plan (including the whole documentary on M. Night, I'm sure) based on M. Night's ""thrill factor"" and implemented it, but the movie they were tricking everyone into seeing is not in any way strong enough to counter the anger of movie goers who, like myself, felt cheated. And let me be clear: I didn't feel cheated because the movie wasn't a scary, monster movie. I felt cheated because this didn't even turn out to be an interesting character study or a pleasant diversion from the work week.

By the time the plot twist is revealed, the relatively little suspense I did feel just faded away. At the end of it all, (SPOILER) I just felt that William Hurt was just playing a rich guy that had too much money and a desire to run from his problems.

In fact, I have now finally seen a movie that was worse than last years ""28 Days Later"", in fact after seeing this one I feel bad about being as hard on that movie as I was.  I give this movie a three only because at least it has good performances...still those performances cannot make up for the fact the plot was awful, it was dreadfully boring, and the ending was very predictable...I think I got it five minutes in when I saw their community resembled an amish village, and I was 100% sure once the origin of the creatures is revealed. The movie is totally devoid of humor, it takes itself seriously to a fault, and quite frankly it would not scare a child of three or four years old. The only reason it is so highly ranked here at imdb is that M. Night directed it so people feel they have to like it, but he isn't a god and so I say this movie is just a mistake by him.  Why he can not make a movie without the twist ending is beyond me.  Next time he should just make a straight horror movie with no twists at the end and that would probably surprise people more than this one did.  I mean if you did not see this one coming you probably have problems concentrating, but then who could blame you?  This movie is very tedious and if you can manage to keep awake through the whole thing you will say ""so that is it?""  You would have been better off sleeping.  There are also more holes left unfilled than can be found in a piece of swiss cheese.  It also irked me that Phoenix is basically not even in the second half of this film.

","Okay, the first 3/4 of this film were semi-tolerable, then it seems like Shyamalan lost interest and wrote a cop-out ending due to the fact that he never seems to be able to end anything as well as he started. Of course he wrote himself in for a less-than-memorable cameo, maybe that's the reason he ended it so poorly. The film's advertising WAS misleading, and it wasn't a horror film in the slightest. It wasn't even a psychological thriller, drama, or anything even remotely interesting - it was a story without an ending, and not even a good one at that. There was an extreme waste of talent in this film as well. The painful script was brought to life by some of the best actors of our time: Sigourney Weaver, William Hunt and Michael Pitt (yes, he's a good actor - watch Hedwig and the Angry Inch). These people should fire their agents! It takes a 'Village' to make something THIS BAD! 1/2 out of 4 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"duckmang","1","2","4","31 July 2004"," Extremely bad
","When I was eight years old, my family went to see ""The Hunt for the Red October"" together, and it was one of the most agonizingly boring experiences of my life; being a restless child watching a movie full of subtlety and intrigue. Now, 15 years later, I have an experience to top that, and I can't use a short attention span as the excuse this time. <br/><br/>When ""The Village"" started out, I could already tell it would be horrible because of the dialogue. The movie supposedly takes place in the late 19th century, but all the characters talk like a bunch of volunteers at a second rate Renaissance Faire. <br/><br/>Then, as usual, there is the ""twist"" ending that makes Mr. Shyamalan's movies his own. I must give the filmmaker credit. It only took me 2 minutes to figure out the secret ending of ""The Sixth Sense."" It took me a whole half-hour to decipher this one. However, the minute I though I had figured it out, I spend the rest of the movie hoping against all hope that I was wrong, because it was such an insanely contrived idea. I've never been so dismayed to be right. <br/><br/>Despite its flaws, there was one funny part of the movie that came at the end, and that was the retelling of the story of the woman whose husband had been killed, stripped naked, and thrown into the ""Dirty River"". I laughed out loud when I realized what she meant.<br/><br/>Pitiful Movie: 1/10"
"dfranzen70","2","2","4","31 July 2004"," The Village Idiot
","I am now officially off the M. Night Shyamalan bandwagon. Nope, that's it, I'm through giving him the benefit of the doubt. See, I really loved The Sixth Sense. Thought it was fantastic. Creepy, too. I liked Unbreakable, too. Sure, it was flawed, and I could see how some people might not like it, but I appreciated with Shyamalan was doing, and I liked the two lead performances. But then Signs came. And I thought Signs was hideously dreadful, lacking a sense of humor when it was needed and being way too flippant when the situation called for levity. I felt Signs was merely a product of an overactive ego and an inactive imagination. But I figured that since even the best filmmakers have their vanity movies, I'd forgive Shyamalan his Signs and looked forward to his next movie. Well, The Village isn't much better than Signs, and that's a real shame.<br/><br/>The setting is 1897 in a remote village in the Pennsylvania woods. It's a very quiet, unpreposessing village, complete with village elders, politeness among folk, and a one-room school house. (These folks look and act Amish, although that's not specified.)<br/><br/>But this idyllic, placid hamlet has a secret. See, it's bordered on all sides by the forest, and within the forest are these unspeakable creatures, Those Who Shall Not Be Named. Oddly enough, you would think such an appellation would prevent people from openly discussing said creatures, but I lost count how many times they were mentioned. Anyway, the creatures, we're told, have a deal with the villagers - no villager will cross the perimeter into the forest, and no creature will enter the village. The villagers have yellow flags around their perimeter and a giant tower with a bell at the top, so if and when a creature comes a-calling, the bell can be rung and people can get to safety. The village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt, sincere as always), forbid anyone from crossing the perimeter; the villagers are also informed that the creatures hate the color red (""the bad color,"" as it's called in hushed whispers!).<br/><br/>Weird things have been afoot, though. Small animals have been killed in the village, skinned and left to be discovered by open-mouthed villagers. And when a creature is indeed spotted entering the perimeter, the next morning there are slashes of red paint on the doors of people's homes. What could this mean? Who hath breached the perimeter?<br/><br/>One man, Lucius Hunt (played with open-mouth ennui by Joaquin Phoenix), asks the elders for permission to go to a neighboring village to get medicine. You see, the village is hampered by a distinct lack of medical supplies, and when its citizens are quite ill, they have no choice but to watch them die. They'd prefer this, apparently, to getting medical supplies.<br/><br/>Now, any time the phrase ""only one man"" pops up in a synopsis of a movie, you know you need to relax your curiosity and just let things happen. ""Oh, here we go,"" you think. ""Good IL' Commodus is going to be the One Man who can save the villagers from the creatures - and themselves!""<br/><br/>There are a few twists to the movie, so I'll halt the synopsis here. The trouble is the twists are likely to affect you in one of two ways: Either you'll say, ""I saw THAT coming,"" or you'll merely shrug your shoulders and wonder if the exit door to the theater will open to a part of the parking lot that's a real hike to your car. Personally, I was affected in both ways.<br/><br/>The movie's simply not well written. There's suspense, but often it's clouded by contrivances in the plot. Shyamalan wants us to fear the creatures as much as the villagers do, but he doesn't succeed. We're supposed to feel empathy for the villagers, but all I could feel was pity and scorn.<br/><br/>The pacing is pretty tight, which is nice, since it's essential that a suspense movie be well paced. But the camera angles often looked amateurish and/or auteurish; either Shyamalan didn't know how to shoot a particular scene or he decided to be cute and make it seem as if the scene had some sort of Deep Meaning. Now, it's true there's a moral to the story here (something about You Stay on Your Side, I'll Stay on Mine), but the tone achieved by the direction didn't really convey that. A huge debit, too, is the soundtrack - does Shyamalan not know how to use one effectively? In most scenes, the soundtrack was blaring at such a high volume that the actors could barely be heard. What's the point of that, exactly?<br/><br/>Finally, the acting. No one is spectacularly miscast (although I wonder if Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for goodness sake, is kicking himself for agreeing to play the village idiot), but no one really shines, either. How could they, with a plot so thin you could read fine print through it? Most of the actors are... well, useless. They don't do much with what little they have to work with and are essentially wasted, especially Sigourney Weaver. Hurt is quietly effective, but it's a role he can play in his sleep by this point. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is moderately annoying, which ain't good when you have a very prominent role.<br/><br/>The Village is trite and cloying, a mishmash of ""twists"" that alternately make no sense and make too much sense and can be foretold well in advance. M. Night Shyamalan has taken a pretty solid, intriguing premise and riddled it with illogic and disdain."

","After watching Signs, I knew I should have been more careful. But my friends got the better of me, and we went to see The Village. This movie mainly sucked because it had the potential to be so much better. The ending to Signs and The Village were just bad. He should have given explanations and as a result, the plot lines of his movies do not give you closure with the film. If anything, you have more questions than the beginning. Maybe he got lucky or something with The Sixth Sense, because the movies he made after that are just terrible. There was maybe one scene that made you jump, but there no truly horrific or suspenseful scenes in the movie. I don't understand how it can be called a horror movie, because the scary parts just made me laugh because they were so stupid.

","As is generally the case with movies by M. Night Shyamalan, there is little one can say in a review without spoiling the film entirely.  What I can say without doing that is that this film contains some of the worst acting, most ridiculous dialogue, dreadfully boring camera work (from the otherwise venerable Roger Deakins, no less!), and idiotic plot twists I have ever seen in a nationally released theatrical motion picture - truly worthy of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  William Hurt...well, he's always been that way...but Weaver, Phoenix, and Gleeson (who has 3 whole scenes) are totally wasted on this movie, and Adrian Brody really should fire his agent over this steaming pile.  It's that awful.<br/><br/>Other than being just plain boring, I will give this much away, hopefully without ruining this turkey for anyone willing to take the risk I did -- SPOLIER AHEAD, FOLKS!<br/><br/>If you are hoping to check out a monster movie, don't get your hopes up.

The audience is tricked into believing it is a simpler time - period clothing, cumbersome speech, large outdoor Pilgrim-like feasts, and worst of all, a tombstone placing the date as 1897. The last was cheap - why when no one else in The Village except those prolific procreating Elders know what the actual date is anyway? Red hair, red lipstick - when red is verboten. The blind woman who sees in colors - don't ask me what color you are. The security guy lifting meds, the newspaper with all the murder and bad news, open, juxtaposed, M.

Aside from the fact that it's dull, and dragged on endlessly, most of the audience was laughing at every absurd moment (of which there are dozens). The ""twist"" is hardly shocking and the ten-year-old in front of me had it figured out in the first few minutes. If you want to see a smart, suspenseful, scary movie, this is definitely not it. <br/><br/>Maybe M.

There is no twist ending because 1/3 of the way through the movie everything is revealed minus a few details which are not necessary to understand what is going on. I rather enjoyed M. Night Shamaylan's work up until this point. I was extremely disappointed with this movie as it was billed as a horror movie. If you've seen 13th warrior there is no need to see this movie, as it has a very similar plot.

"ho11iday","1","2","4","30 July 2004"," Exceeded Expectations
","Let me clarify, it exceeded my low expectations. Meaning it was lower than I possibly could have imagined.<br/><br/>After having the previews of this movie crammed down my throat everywhere I turned I half expected them to show a preview for this movie at the movie's showing. Even IMDb is littered with banners and annoying flash advertisements. Hype this big always leads to some amount of let down.<br/><br/>But I was not prepared for laughably bad movie I was about to see. Now I am not a fan of M Night much. I didn't care for many of his films and I think they received a bit too much praise just for their 'clever' twists. I use clever lightly because the twist in The Village is just trash.<br/><br/>The movie was ruined before anyone even sits down to see it. The previews make this movie seem like a horror movie, period. The 'atmosphere' of horror is barely present. The whole 'horror' aspects of the movie is just a big clichÃ© with no real wit or 'cleverness' about it. Instead the atmosphere is broken up into extremely horrid and forced dialogue between characters that you can't help but laugh at. <br/><br/>Before you jump on me about 'its not a horror film' I know, I half expected it not to be since M night is so 'crafty'. <br/><br/>***spoilers**** About 1/2 way through the film M Night throws away any surprise in the ending by revealing that the monsters are in-fact, the elders of the village just scaring people to keep them inside the village (big surprise there). He also makes the mistake of actually showing one of the monsters early on and you can tell its a sort of biped animal in a red robe insanely similar to their yellow ones. Anyone can at least come up with the suspicion that it just might be the villagers. Hell things like that are English 101 material.<br/><br/>So, if you have the slightest chance to have your thoughts wander during the movie (which you will, trust me) you can ask yourself the simple question: ""Why would they want to keep them in the village?"" Then adding in M Night's 'twist' love its easy to guess the ending.<br/><br/>I figured most people weren't surprised at all about either of the 'twists'.<br/><br/>An avid movie goer could even spot it far before they tell you. The elder's speak of Guns and Alleys and Dumpsters. All of these things would not be in the vocabulary of the children. This village had no alleyways or dumpsters yet the old lady says to Ivy ""My daughter was killed by 3 men in an alley"". Yet Ivy doesn't bother to ask 'whats an alley?' Rifles were the firearm of that 'era' so the term 'guns' wouldn't be used and dumpster follows suit.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers ***<br/><br/>Overall I feel robbed. M Night has somehow managed to 'typecast' himself as a director. The only thing that would surprise anyone from him is if he made a movie without some lame twist at the end."
"LavianoTS386","1","2","4","31 July 2004"," WARNING SPOILERS
","I put a spoiler warning...but seeing this film is perhaps the worst spoiler. The film reminded allot of Ayn Rand's book, ""Anthem"" if you took out some pages and spit on it. In fact I'd say Ayn Rand was better at characterization than M. Night.<br/><br/>I agree with others that it was a good idea, but sadly poorly executed.<br/><br/>We spend what seems like an eternity fallowing this man, Luscious. He is actually likable and has extreme potential...and then the film's resident fruitloop, Noah, stabs him. Noah has no motivation...he's just a literal basket case. This happens in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>There are a lot of plot threads that do not mesh, like how the girl's sister wanted to marry Luscious, but was denied.<br/><br/>The film gives it's self away by showing that the monster is only a suit, before she goes into the forest. It happens too soon, thus turning what was a really scary creature early on into a scare less tact.<br/><br/>It's devoid of any urgency or mystery once Luscious is injured. These people supposedly have no medicines yet Luscious is alive when he really should be dead.<br/><br/>Other senseless disasters from this film include, Noah dieing in the woods still within the suit, yet when the two boys come to tell the members of the counsel that they found him, the kids apparently didn't notice that Noah was inside the ""creature"" suit, when he died w/o the head piece on.<br/><br/>All other the ""elders"" where graduates from a help center, if the help center where any good they shouldn't have become anti-social and create this ""Village"" in the first place.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it have been easier to join the Amish? And is this kind of 'Village' really lacking that much security? If I climbed that fence what would the APF do, shoot and risk a bullet going into the village?<br/><br/>Don't see this film unless you enjoy disappointments and like watching characters that are unlikable."

The acting is horrible, the script laughable, and the big twists only make you feel like Mr. Shyamalan needs to be stopped at any cost.

The trailers were a riddle, and you want to go to the movie to see the answer. Now really, is that any way to market a good movie? No. Its a trick to get you to shell out money to find out the ending to a tantalizing clip in a trailer. A cheap trick. It won't work again.<br/><br/>Summary of the movie? Old-fashioned people live in an old-fashioned isolated town. No power, no cars, no nothing, just as it was in, say, 1897.<br/><br/>Nobody leaves the town because nobody goes in the woods where scary things live. Scary things have agreed to leave people alone, as long as people stay out of the woods and leave scary things alone. By the way, throughout the movie they call these scary things ""those we do not speak of"". But they speak of them (and little else) throughout the whole movie, so that seems ridiculous. Eventually someone gets hurt, and there is a reason to cross the woods to get to a town, because in towns there is medicine.<br/><br/>If I could keep you from going to this movie by giving away a spoiler, I would.

But it has nothing surprising or shocking. No, there is no twist.<br/><br/>Oh, OK, MAYBE you could call some part of it a twist. But you've already figured it out. Trust me. Try this.

It isn't that complicated. Release your mind. Still don't have it? OK OK, try this, pretend you are 12 years old. NOW, what would the simplest most obvious ending be? There you go, you got it.

It's got a one-note, unbelievable premise that would barely hold up a half-hour episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" (Actually, episodes of ""The Twilight Zone were far more clever than this movie.) It's got a horrid script featuring no lines spoken with prepositions, plot twists that could be guessed from a million miles away. <br/><br/>To top it all off, the movie's not even scary. Not at all.

","Amazing. 9/10<br/><br/>A unique horror thriller by M Night Shyamalan that takes you through an unexpected journey. With a strong plot, interesting characters, the movie leaves you with important questions worth pondering upon.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead
What seems to be a horror thriller, suddenly turns into a drama exploring hope and nature of humanity.<br/><br/>We start the movie in an isolated village that faces a threat from creatures living in nearby woods. For some reason, there is a pact between villagers and creatures that forbits anyone from entering the woods. Lucius asks permission from ""elders"" ,or heads of the village including Mr. Walker, seemingly patriarch of the village to cross the woods and fetch medicine to save the village from prevailing infection.Meanwhile, the creatures raid the village, remove the skin of lifestock and display signs to warn the village.<br/><br/>We see a romatic affair developing between Walker's blind daughter Iva and Lucius and they plan to marry. Out of jealousy, Ava's close friend, mentally ill Noah stabs Lucius multiple times, seemingly of jealousy.<br/><br/>When Ava, asks her father to fetch medicines from nearby town, we learn that the story of creatures is a hoax created by elders, based on a real rumour. The elders dressed up as creatures to scare the other villagers. The elders were victims of violent crime and they decided to start the village as a experiment project to be isolated from society.<br/><br/>Walker faces a moral dilemma and allows his daughter to go through the woods, as the entire exercise is pointless if future generation including Lucius don't get to live. Overcoming various hurdles, including unknowingly killing Noah dressed as creature, Ava succeeds in her mission. Ava based on her encounter believes the existence of creatures to keep the story going for future generations.<br/><br/>M Night Shyamalan leads us to question humanity and whether or not we have engineered a decent society.<br/><br/>Are we the humans, the real creatures about who we must not speak of?
Is living in ""The village"" better than urban lifestyle?
Is crime and greed too much of a problem in current society that we should consider stepping back to older civilisations?
Is it acceptable to lie to an entire society in pursuit of greater good?
Is happiness and purpose more important than truth?<br/><br/>These are questions worth exploring.<br/><br/>A very strong plot. Interesting twists. Compelling story line to keep you hooked in the movie. Good screenplay. 9/10."

","There is a strong pact between the residents of a small isolated village and the creatures that roam in the surrounding woodland. The villagers do not go into the woods and in return the creatures do not enter the village. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) a quiet caring man, wishes to seek the elders approval to venture to the borders to seek medical supplies. As this knowledge becomes more widespread, strange occurrences begin to happen around the village leading the elders to fear for the safety of their home and the pact. With a star-studded cast from William Hurt to Sigourney Weaver to Judy Greer, everyone brings their all to the table and elevates it to a powerhouse piece! The heart and soul of the film though is absolutely Bryce Dallas Howard in her first starring role; it's her best performance to date and she is so captivating as Ivy Walker. Her character is the entrance point for the audience emotionally and as she goes on her journey into the woods in the final act, it's a psychologically tense experience. Howard loved the role and indeed the film as she stated in the lovely DVD bonus feature 'Bryce's Diary'. Adrien Brody is also brilliant as Noah; a great portrayal of someone with learning difficulties struggling with a rivalry and his feelings for Ivy. Every character is fully rounded and developed and this is what makes the impending horror in the film all the more effective"

"MaximumMadness","6","0","0","6 July 2017"," ""The Village""- The beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's fall. Fascinating ideas and genuinely eerie set-pieces brought down by a meandering pace and contrived eccentricity.
","The career of M. Night Shyamalan has been a fascinating and harrowing thing to follow over the past twenty years. His explosive success with 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"" was something of a revelation, and it rocketed him to super-stardom in the annals of film history. After following it up with two films I feel are equal in every way to that iconic and indisputable classic in the form of contemplative superhero drama ""Unbreakable"" and the mind-warping alien-invasion thriller ""Signs"", Shyamalan could do no wrong as far as many were concerned. Little did we know what the near future would hold, and just how far he would fall before finding rebuilding himself back up. In some ways, it could be argued that 2002's ""Signs"" was the last truly great Shyamalan thriller we'd get until 2017's remarkable and brilliantly entertaining ""Split.""<br/><br/>And for many people, it was his fourth major release, the period- piece supernatural thriller ""The Village"", that signaled the start of his downfall. While by no means a terrible film and benefiting from sharp direction and strong performances, ""The Village"" is where the confident idea that Shyamalan always knew exactly what he was doing began to crack. On one hand... yeah, it had a lot of the things that we ate up in his previous efforts. The quirky characters, the bone-chilling horror... and yet, it was starting to feel a bit stale. Often feeling like someone else trying to imitate Shyamalan's style than an actual Shyamalan feature. His previously careful, deliberate pacing and focus was starting to feel aimless and meandering. His idiosyncratic humor and peculiar characters began to feel contrived and shoehorned. And his oft- shocking twists and turns became shallow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong... ""The Village"" does have a lot to offer thanks to the elements that do work and on the whole I think the film is enjoyable. But it's still a massive step in the wrong direction. <br/><br/>In the 19th century, in the village of Covington reside a small and tightly knit community of families, who all live in fear of the treacherous creatures who stalk the woods around them at night- ""Those we don't speak of."" In order to maintain balance, a set of rules has been crafted to keep everyone safe. Two young villagers- Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) admit their attraction to one-another and intend on marrying. However, their happy news comes at a cost, when their close friend, the mentally-challenged Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) cannot accept their love and attempts to murder Lucius in a fit of jealous rage. After pleading with village elders, Ivy is given a chance to help her love- she is permitted to enter the Covington woods and try to navigate past the devious monsters that populate it, so that she can obtain medicine from the next town over to try and save Lucius. However, her journey will bring about revelations regarding Covington and the men and women who populate it... revelations that may threaten to destroy the once- strong community.<br/><br/>The greatest strengths of the film lie in its exquisite beauty from a production standpoint, in addition to the generally stellar performances of our three main leads. This is one very good-looking and sounding movie, with some of the sharpest camera-work and jaw- droppingly gorgeous music of any Shyamalan feature. The visual guidance is top-notch from start to finish, and Shyamalan is able to paint a dark and troubled portrait of a town haunted with his stunning storytelling. James Newton Howard's score rightfully earned an Oscar nod, and it's some of his best- complimented by the expert violinist Hilary Hahn, who performs a great deal of work on the score. Our three leads in Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrian Brody are all absolutely incredible in their respective roles and will immediately earn great admiration from the viewer. Particularly Howard, who gives one of the best performances of her career in this film. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is mixed, with some of the actors including William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver feeling woefully underutilized and out of place.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, as I mentioned above, this is the film where Shyamalan begins to go a bit too far with his material, at times making the film feel like a borderline self-satire. I almost get the feeling that the film was rushed into production without a second draft having been written, because it all feels a bit sloppy. Shyamalan's quirky characters are there... but they're a bit more stale and a bit less defined. The focus and pacing is methodical and deliberate... and yet all too often the film begins to feel tedious and overwrought. Rules are established and ideas introduced... and yet the film does little with the concepts presented, lacking payoff. And without spoiling anything, anyone who is aware of Shyamalan's penchant for introducing game-changing twists into his finales will be able to see what's coming from a mile away. In a lot of ways, the movie feels like its slaving to try and be the next great Shyamalan film by trying to repeat what he does well. But it's not organic. It's a bit too cold and clinical. Even robotic. It's like a computer wrote the film based on a Shyamalan algorithm. The ideas are there... but the humanity is lacking.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is a troubled film. And it is the movie that signals the start of the dark age for the promising filmmaker behind it. And yet, the stellar performances, sharp visual storytelling and absolutely gorgeous musical score are able to salvage and indeed save the film from imploding. It's not a great film... it's probably not even a good film. But it's solid enough that I'd recommend it to open-minded viewers. It might not be the classic that ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" became. But it's adequate. I give it an ever-so-slightly above average 6 out of 10."

Lucius is one of the bravest in the village and his will to be different is amazingly shown throughout movie. Accident that has affected Lucius now forces some doubts and questions so Ivy is the one to act. Learning horrifying things, considering she is blind, she doesn't give up on anything and it gives a nice storyline after in the movie. There isn't much that can be said to unravel secrets that movie hides but definitely when they start to get out there are massive consequences. Ending was something that was pretty unexpected but in the other hand somehow good and gave some power to the story.

","Shyamalan's Village is a story about lies, beauty and ugliness. It is, most of all, a dazzling display of man's capacity for resolution. Of particular interest are some of the several themes that require especial attention.<br/><br/>First, The Village posits a number of contradictions. For example, the child Daniel Nicholson inevitably obliges us to challenge the notion of ""innocence"" cocooned in a coffin lowered six foot in the ground. Later, his father August Nicholson preaches to the elders that it is pointless to run away from ""heartache"". This is ironic when all the members of The Village are doing just that, most of whom without even knowing it. And in the classroom, the little girl at the front explains how she inspected it very carefully. ""It had its head twisted back and much of its fur removed,"" she responds methodically to her teacher's inquiry. It is well established that indoctrination is deceitful and never serves as an alternative to a sound education. But Mr. Walker thinks otherwise. He is prepared to risk ""everything"", even the truth.<br/><br/>Second, The Village is plagued with complexity. The hardest puzzle is the confrontation in the woods. All the essential details are provided a priori to those who wish to solve the riddle. The crucial questions, however, are these. How did Noah work out that Ivy Walker was in the woods? On her part, how did Ivy Walker work out who her pursuer was? We do not need to know the precise answers. The two knew each other well since childhood. They could read each other's mind accurately when it came to scheming although imperfectly when it came to love. The battle-line between them had been drawn in the quiet room. Only through fortuity Ivy Walker finds a possible remedy to her predicament and against her indestructible opponent. Owing to its intricacy, every detail in the story is relevant and nothing is superfluous. For example, the significance of the wind-tunneling effect that carries us inexorably towards the grave in the opening scene is manifested much later and is not easy to detect; at least not until we discover the acute scarcity of medicine and the sheer preponderance of the ""oath"".<br/><br/>Finally, The Village offers a dark and an eerie experience, and this unfortunately may not be to everyone's taste. Not all is gloom, however. Check, for example, how the Latino security guard pompously straightens his work jacket before he sets out to confront the hapless Ivy Walker. This buffoon earns full marks and a payment for his bluff, but more importantly for the sensible way he deals with a most unexpected and tricky situation. It is also extremely instructive to watch Kitty lecturing Lucius on practical astronomy. This considering that the lass was offering her services on a voluntary basis and with passion. If noted carefully, therefore, The Village does have its comedic moments in spite of all the ""creatures"" and their doleful sounds. It even comes with some extra tutorials. There is, for example, a crash course on how to keep things under lock and key almost to the point of exaggeration. And Lucius' inquisitive mind schools us about men who behave badly when they avoid organic contact with women in order to mask their thoughts.<br/><br/>The Village is well acted by all the players in a beautifully constructed set, with exquisite costumes, furniture and crockery. Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce D. Howard and Adrien Brody are constantly shoulder to shoulder and miles ahead of the rest in their craft. The music blends well with the drama, and the violin is always perfectly timed and with the right tempo. Water and its reflections are used with good effect; and I dare you to spot the fussing black spider in the woods following the rain-wash."

The creature needs explanation, and is a pivotal piece of the plot. This is more of a mystery, rather than a thriller. A good mystery summarizes. A writer, knows that many modern people will not look for the answers. A film is no different. Had the answers not been delivered there would be no purpose to this work. It reminds me of having very child-like story aspects, magical aspects, that I appreciate.

Still, the film is watchable and impressively staged, with a fine cast, including Dallas Bryce Howard, whose (good IMO) performance seems to have divided opinion, lend the film an air of quality that it doesn't really deserve. <br/><br/>It touches on, but never really explores, a number of issues, such as how much the world is what we are taught it to be, superstition and the ""Wildwood"" that still lurks in the back of European imaginations, (I don't know if that extends to other cultures, it probably does) the role of the ""Other"" in defining a society, and especially in its use in social control. The village elders maintain their undemocratic utopia by creating a sense of constant outside threat that the villagers have to put much effort into combating, the safe and unsafe colours, painting the boundaries, taking shifts in the watch tower etc. and prevents them from questioning the status quo and venturing beyond the narrow boundaries and discovering the truth. <br/><br/>Much could be made of how the film leaves the viewer to decide how they feel about the morality of Walker and his society, and how it compares with societies that use the same tactic, such as Nazi Germany with the Jews and Bolsheviks, and arguably our own with terrorism. I imagine the films fans use this to argue that the film has more to say than I believe it does.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film isn't that deep, and the entire hole filled plot just one giant Macguffin to hang the twist and the admittedly strong atmosphere on."

","I wonder if there isn't a lot of in-breeding going on in this village? Well when a bunch of people decide to cut themselves off from the rest of the world to form their own little community.....<br/><br/>well, you do the math.<br/><br/>At the risk of appearing to contradict myself, The Village is both boring and interesting at the same time. By this I mean it's boring in it's delivery but has an interesting overall idea. I would describe it as a slow-paced (talkative), mystery-thriller. There was 1 or 2 tense moments during the course of the film but it really doesn't get moving until the very end. This means there is ample time for you to take a few naps or go to the bathroom and stare at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself the meaning of life.<br/><br/>So in closing, If you don't mind talk padding your mystery-thriller, then by all means check The Village out. For the rest of you, seeing this movie will probably leave you with ""mixed feelings""; an interesting idea but could have been delivered better, i.e., less talk and more creepy sh*t happening. Love, Boloxxxi."

","********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING!!! ********* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* This movie is completely based on the idea that ""In olden days, everything used to be better"". Today, there is a cultural undertow, which holds that we should 'go back', and its most present manifestation is in the IKEA way of designing things. IKEA wants you to give you a feeling of solid un-modernity, oldfashionedness, that's why all their most successful designs are those woody wood-wood chests and cupboards and tables.<br/><br/>The people who have founded the village, also have this notion of fleeing modern life. And that that is somehow better. But, as one character notes, there is sorrow there as well as in the 'towns'. And the sacrifice of living unmodern is made clear at the beginning of the movie, when a boy dies of some treatable disease, age seven.<br/><br/>All this is not to say, that I don't think this isn't a beautiful movie. It is, as all movies by Shymalan I have seen (Signs, Unbreakable and in a way the Sixth Sense) a film of devastating minimalistic beauty. The movie is in no small way helped by the crystal beauty of Howard, whose acting skills are remarkable.<br/><br/>Also, the music of superstar violinist Hahn is completely in line with the films intentions and meaning. Well worth watching.<br/><br/>===== Remember, you're unique. Just like everyone else. ========"

","It's difficult enough possessing a hard-to-pronounce name in Hollywood. But when you've also got a name that virtually needs no introduction, then you're in real trouble. Such is the plight of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-bred South Indian director who was catapulted to stardom overnight with the release of his masterful ghost story 'The Sixth Sense'. So indelible was his impression on the movie-going public that half a decade later, his name alone single-handedly propelled the opening weekend of 'The Village' to a stratospheric $50 million. But just like any wunderkind who's achieved success on his first go, Shyamalan was quickly dubbed a one-trick pony who had lost his touch. His film was ripped apart in its second weekend, crumbling a hemorrhagic 67%.. enough for it to be labeled a commercial disappointment. It's truly a shame, considering 'The Village' might just be Shyamalan's most poignant and deeply moving film to date. Starring the luminous Bryce Dallas Howard in what could best be described as a revelatory performance, 'The Village' tells the plodding story of a small 19th century community isolated from the outside world by an encircling forest populated by threatening hooded creatures. While the film's premise (and particularly its preposterous climax) might wither away in the light of logical reasoning, its best pleasures are found in its small moments. The hushed midnight conversation between Howard and Joaquin Phoenix on the front porch. The strained violin soundtrack as they cross the screen in beautiful slow motion to escape the intruders. The tracking camera movement as it follows the blind Howard around the village in haunting deliberation. In the end, these images sear themselves into your mind far more intensely than the whole movie does. Call Shyamalan what you may.. a one-hit wonder, a formula-milking charlatan, or a self-deluded narcissist (see Lady in the Water), he sure knows how to direct a scene."

","My Take: Some will be let down by how Shymalan plays with audience's expectations, but it's sometimes a poignant and interesting film.<br/><br/>I have long since been a defender of M. Night Shymalan's THE VILLAGE. Sure, I too didn't get it the first time, yet it grew into me several viewings later. Ever since, it has been an intriguing if imperfect excursion. But the fact that it doesn't really appeal to everyone makes THE VILLAGE all the more open to debate, and more inviting to revisit. So I looked back on this excursion and realized how interesting, if still flawed, film it is. Whether or not the film is a misunderstood masterpiece or a terribly misguided ""personal"" effort, it never fails to be worth of scrutiny. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan remains one of Hollywood's most misunderstood directors in Hollywood, famous for many modern horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". In this, one of his later works, is set in a small 19th century village, secluded by a dark forest which are forbidden to them, due to some strange beast rumored to live there. If there is one thing I'd blame for the downfall of THE VILLAGE is the advertising. Advertising it as a horror movie rather than what it really is is a shallow cway to put it. Sure, the twist ending is the kind that will divide the audience into two; not everyone's gonna march with Shymalan's parade. Well not everyone is going to like THE VILLAGE, yet but that only proves he's one of the more misunderstood film minds in Hollywood today. Shymalan may have gotten some bad feedback after this, but I'm here to defend him on his behalf.<br/><br/>The film may not be that scary, but M. Night Shyamalan manages to make the human characters interesting and the film atmospheric. It may not be his best film, but perhaps, it's his most intriguing and often profound. It's either you love it, or just leave it alone. <br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."
"charchuk","8","0","0","14 March 2007"," Slightly flawed masterpiece
","Criminally underrated thriller. Sure, the story has its flaws. Sure, it's not really a horror. Sure, the twists are gimmicky. But this is an expertly crafted, emotionally satisfying, and incredibly thematic film. As one can expect from a Shyamalan film, the direction is near-flawless, and this is particularly evident in the true horror scenes in the film, the attack sequences. Without using cheap 'jump' scares, Shyamalan makes a scene scary and suspenseful through some terrific shot placements and effective cinematography. The music contributes quite a bit, too, as James Newton Howard adds another great score to his resume. Though the story is flawed, it's still very well-written, faltering only in certain plot mechanics; though the dialogue may turn off some, I really dug its stylized nature. The romance feels natural and works very well as the central plot device, and the main twist, though quite a leap of logic, brings up some important themes. The acting is very good, with no weak links, but a clear strong link in Bryce Dallas Howard - she's a revelation. Add in to that some great costume and production design, and you've got an absolutely fantastic film."

","I have just finished watching the Village for a second time and I found it to be a great experience. It is amazing what a good director can do with great actors: ""This is all I can give you....."" "" I accept."" When that brings tears to one's eyes something right is going on. <br/><br/>I still have some minor reservations with the first few minutes of the film. I had to let myself into this other world of religion/tradition/community. It is perhaps the costumes, etc. I must admit these are things I do not warm up to readily. <br/><br/>The performances, scenery, metaphors, imagery, development is all top notch. (Afrter the first 10-15 minutes of adjustment, like Shakespeare perhaps)<br/><br/>All in all I find this to be on par or above Sixth Sense and certainly equal to Unbreakable( Mel's politics ruined Signs for me)."

","By this point M. Night Shayamalan has become one of the most commercially accessible thriller directors, with movies often rated PG-13 allowing a broader spectrum of viewers to witness his own unique take on the genre by combining (or sometimes creating false illusions of)supernatural elements with a very Hitchockian directing technique. Thus providing us with a truly memorable and suspenseful cinematic experience.<br/><br/>So what happened in ""The Village""? All the characteristics from his previous films are here : the direction , the interesting story concept and some fairly good performances from the cast. All in all the movie feels similar to what we have seen so far from him. And that in a way is the problem. People have become somewhat attuned to his films, they know what to expect.A specific example is his use of the ""plot-twist"" device, its quite easy once you've seen lets say the ""Sixth Sense"" (which by itself was a fine movie with a truly shocking final twist) to expect the one in the ""The Village"" , you might not guess it completely but you'll know its coming thus somewhat eliminating its effect .<br/><br/>Still Shayamalan is able to create a pleasant atmosphere for a thriller with the idea of a town surrounded by something which might not really be human . There are several very tense moments that could make the viewer jump. Treading the line between realism and fantasy.<br/><br/>Overral though once you've seen the movie, there won't be anything more to get back to. In the end the plot becomes entirely clear leaving nothing for the viewer to self-interpret-ate or think about that could require a need for a second viewing.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is not a bad movie and even though it feels way too similar to Shayamalan's previous work it still delivers if only partially what it promises. I recommend it to any die-hard fan of the genre or to anybody not familiar with Shayamalan's previous movies."

","Alright, i'll start by saying that I don't see this as a horror movie. At the time, when I watched, it had been billed as ""horror"" and was left with a weird feeling when I had seen it through. I saw it with a friend of mine and we both reached the same agreement. To put in a good way, i'll say that we agreed that The Village wasn't the best horror movie we've seen.<br/><br/>But after I read a comment regarding this movie, it made me think otherwise. It is very character-driven and that is probably why I oversaw the movie in the first place; also because I saw it with a ""horror-movie"" attitude. Which I shouldn't had done. I haven't other of Shamaylan's (Is that how you spell it?) films, but I certainly will try to do so. But back to this comment; it made me think in a different way about this film. It has some weird twists and turns, but in the end it actually came out as a solid film. It is not though, the best film i've seen. Far from it. But i've seen much worse. A solid movie, but not a must-see."

Adrian Brody wasn't that good .. and he was over-reacting in my opinion.

I think it is a cheesy way to attract the viewer attention .. anyway, what do you expect from a commercial horror movie?<br/><br/>In the end, I found myself lost .. the ending is open to many possibilities and maybe Shyamlan was thinking of making a sequel to it."
"doctorx2","8","0","0","7 November 2006"," More than meets the eye
","As previously noted by another viewer, this film was poorly marketed (as a ""horror movie""), which in point of fact it is not. It is indeed a multi-layered film.<br/><br/>The film's opening lines (beautifully spoken by Brendan Gleeson) immediately establish the period and setting. The early-American dialog is intentionally stilted, but achieves a rhythm and beauty in its delivery by the members of the cast. The exception that proves the rule is William Hurt, whose off-center style and laissez-faire manner of speech make his lines feel forced and uncomfortable. He seems in general an improbable choice for the role of the patriarch of the Luddite community, unless this inconsistency of speech and style was intended as a clue to the viewer as to the real nature of the Village. Conversely, Bryce Dallas Howard is powerful and moving in the role of the blind girl, Ivy. Her pacing and diction feel natural and convincing. She persuades the audience that through innocence and love impossible things can be achieved. Joaquin Phoenix's restrained portrayal of Lucius is similarly effective, and the viewer believes in his conviction and honesty. Adrien Brody makes wonderful use of his dramatic features to create a vivid and disturbing man-child. Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances.<br/><br/>The Village is a story about the futility of social engineering, a scary bed-time story, and after all, a love story. It can also been seen as an allegory for the upper middle-class retreat from urban post-modernism. Legions of Baby Boomers have spent fortunes in pursuit of the unhurried, simple but elegant life style characterized by Pottery Barn furniture and Martha Stewart's Country Living magazine. The return to traditional furnishings and even menus reflects a yearning for a simpler, more comprehensible, and safer way of life. Some might argue that this represents an exercise in denial, while defenders of this life style might insist that they are attempting to preserve worthwhile values, and/or create a haven of safety, be it ever so limited to the four walls of their homes, or the confines of their neighborhoods. Both of these arguments surface in The Village, and stir some consciousness about the the real world issue. It might even be suggested that The Village represents the United States of America, and that the wild and dangerous Covenington Woods is the rest of the world, as portrayed by Americans to Americans: a safe haven for our culture, surrounded by a dangerous world inhabited by bogeymen.<br/><br/>In any event, a good film is one that invites contemplation, and there is ample food for thought in The Village."

","M. Night Shylayman breaks a very important rule in the realm of storytelling: never film-flam your audience. This is not to say that a director should not invite twists in the plot; but, the way he attempted to make you believe the setting was back in the 1800's, when it was really present day, but he didn't tell you this til the end was wrong. I felt insulted and cheated and let down. It was a cheap and dirty trick in the name of retaining audience attention and awe. Instead of thrilling us, all he managed to do was scam a good paying audience.<br/><br/>Other than the end, the film is actually decent, the premise is scary and disturbing, and the acting is very good. In fact, Bryce Dallas Howard, is the movie's one bright spot.<br/><br/>This movie has gotten mixed reviews, so the best thing to do is to watch the movie yourself."

","I just gave this movie a chance because of his director. I had seen The Sixth Sense like other people and wanted to see more by him.<br/><br/>The Village was boring to me. It wants to be suspenseful at times but it did not thrill me at all. The ""twist"" or however you want to call what M. Night Shyamalan usually makes in his movies, is VERY predictable this time, so I think the movie loses a lot of energy for that reason. Have you ever think to leave a film without a twist once in a while?<br/><br/>The good part of this movie is Adrien Brody which labor was EXCELLENT and also the farm scenery/wardrobe is superb! The music was unique. I loved it! That violin at the end is so beautiful that made me go in tears! So my points are not really for the film, but for Adrien Brody, the clothes, the scenery and the music.<br/><br/>What I need to object again is that M. Night Shyamalan's whim of appearing as an actor. Man, you are not Martin Scorsese! It seems you are always thinking ""Where can I put my face?"" By the way, Bryce Dallas Howard is OK but not to portray a blind girl. She moves her eyes in many moments during the film. In fact, it took me some time to realize she was blind because she didn't seem so!"
"windypoplar","5","0","0","3 November 2006"," weird and involving, but what was the point?
","First off let me state that I thought this was a very unfairly criticized film. It's actually quite good. The pacing, acting (more on that shortly), and atmosphere were excellent. As social commentary, the film is fine, ranking with the best films of this short decade.<br/><br/>It is rife with problems though. Firt off Bryce Dallas Howard is simply awful in every scene. Has anyone ever seen a worse portrayal of a blind person? Justine Bateman was ten times more believable in a TV-movie! She simply doesn't register at all with me. Sort of like Particia Arquette, who is much better on television. <br/><br/>The look of the film is great. It invades you with dread and misgivings. William Hurt is so into his part here it hard to understand him at times. Much like I would think a 19th century person would be to us. Sigourney Weaver is good, but underused. Adrien Brody reminds you why he won an Oscar, and will win more. Joaquin Phoenix is great, as always, but why does he play three different roles here? Did I miss something? <br/><br/>The ""twist"" in the village, I wont reveal it all but... Is good, just a bit unrealistic. Sort of like the old Twilight Zone where Roddy McDowall ends up in the zoo. Okay, but not exactly true to life. The reason for the village is good, but lets face it, utopias don't work. Endowing this one with its own myths was a good idea though and works very well with Brody's character. <br/><br/>Overall I thought the film was OK, just not as good as it should have been, with such a talented cast. It haunts you, but leaves too many holes to be really satisfying."

","The plot here is far from being new. There is nothing bad about that in the end, since the idea of a self/isolated community governed by some taboos was always very challenging. What I didn't like about the movie is that, first of all, everything was too predictable for a movie that has mystery and thriller as key words. Secondly, I found it sometimes boring; for me there were some scenes (like those with the elders' council) that were too long and it seemed to me that the producer wanted to gain some more minutes. So, shorter would have been better. The acting was very good, especially Bryce Howard, who was really great, very natural and really Ivy Walker... What I really loved about the movie, and really stroke me from the first minutes it's the image. It is not about the location for shooting the movie, (since the forest is in no way different than others) but is about the way it was filmed, one could sense the movement of the nature (I could hardly find a more appropriate term).

It seems cruel to let Ivy go. It also makes no sense whatsoever to let her go.

","Despite what the marketing men might have you believe, this is NOT a horror film. Like Shyamalan's other movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Sixth Sense', this is a story with a deep vein of melancholy. Some scenes are done with very little (if any) dialogue and just a couple of actors speaking whole stories with nothing but looks and tiny gestures, and the effect (as in the breakfast scene in Unbreakable) can be shattering. Reviewers here who have said things like ""this story of a village being scared of monsters outside is so childish/crude/predictable...' must have stopped watching after the first half hour or have no idea of subtlety. The story itself cleverly moves from a fairly standard scary tale to an unsettling story of despair and hope, and the uplifting ending is enough to put a further twist on our already stretched emotions. Shyamalan is very adept at getting small but extremely moving performances out of his actors, and once again it is this subtlety that (for me) is so effective.SPOILER FOLLOWS: A beautiful film - even the 'monsters' (which of course turn out to be anything but...) have a beauty about them, with their bright red cloaks and the spines. It's a love story, not a horror film."

","Art is a relevant critique of life. Through the use of images and metaphors, storytellers reflect on contemporary issues through a neutral medium to the subconscious. M. Night Shyamalan has always done a good job retelling important lessons through the medium of feature films. One of his most anticipated films was The Village in 2004, but it failed to meet the high expectations of the critics and fans.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has a way of taking a situation and putting an odd spin to it. Your subconscious recognizes the setting, but also notices something is out of place. In The Village you see a puritanical style colony, but it's got taints of the modern-day to it. Clothing, language, and other elements hint at an anachronistic community.<br/><br/>The cast is made up of very talented individuals (this is before most of them were really known in Hollywood), and the cinematography was pleasant. However, through the elements of suspense, romance and tragedy, the audience is really set aloof from the whole thing. I was sort of detached from everything that transpired throughout the film.<br/><br/>While I appreciated the stylings Shyamalan brings to this film, it altogether did not achieve its potential. It left me wanting more."

What starts off looking like a thriller--even somewhat of a horror flick--ends up being more of psychological/sociological view into grief and fear.<br/><br/>The cast is very good, with impressive performances from Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brody, though Joaquin Phoenix isn't too bad either. The setting is gorgeous, costuming authentic, and beautifully haunting music. Also make sure to watch the credits, as you will see very nice photos of the area and the actors.<br/><br/>Now, the film itself is not perfect.

","I have never been a fan of M. Night Shyamanlan. His movies are earnest and well-made but have always been too slow-moving and far out for my tastes. But I thought The Village was his best movie to date. <br/><br/>The mood is like a Gothic fairy tale, but the monsters - or ""those we don't speak of"" - seem to symbolize the monsters we can create out of traumatic circumstances, as well as the lengths we will go to try to protect loved ones from fear and suffering. Shyamlan addresses this dilemma with a sensitivity that, while certainly not new, is never naive.<br/><br/>While some might say the talents of an all-star cast was unnecessary, I think it was such talent that drove home the theme of this film and kept it interesting. That heavyweights like William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix managed to be so effective in such understated roles was very refreshing and says a lot about their talent.<br/><br/>Also, those who have become used to shock fests and outright horror will be disappointed because, although there are some genuinely creepy moments and one scene that's truly shocking, the creepiness is only a backdrop to a much bigger issue.<br/><br/>Although I figured out the trademark Shyamalan plot twist before it was revealed, the final decision of whether or not to keep the Village secret was still a satisfying idea to ponder.<br/><br/>In spite of some extremely cheesy creatures and some comparatively weak moments near the end, Shyamalan put great care into this work and definitely earned my respect as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>I recently watched The Village again and enjoyed it more the second time around."

Also the score is gorgeous.<br/><br/>The bad? Well the exposition and set-ups of the plot were just a little too clumsy for me. The plot could have been built on much more solid foundations in my opinion. Also Adrian Brody's character could have done with a bit more depth to explain what he does.

The dialogue worked sometimes but not others, perhaps it should have cracked a bit in the elders? <br/><br/>Overall though this is very worthwhile movie. The note it finishes on for its theme of innocence, I found quite striking. DO NOT expect any real horror movie conventions though, you've got the wrong film for that. Oh and that score in DTS is worth the rental even if you have doubts. Watch. Make your own mind up."

","Well, I'm happy that I didn't pay any cent for this one because I had the occasion to watch it by friends on DVD. I am disappointed that I waited more than 30 minutes until something happens but even then I was asking myself if I should continue to watch or stop it. Sometimes I had the impression to see THE SIGNS with the same sceneries. I have to admit that the director and the same writer had a good idea sending a clear message to the audience. I am surprised how his movies continues to top the 100 Mio. US$ at the US Box Office. In this case I prefer therefore THE PASSION OF THE Christ that contains more emotional elements with a more beautiful scenery. After the disappointing UNBREAKABLE, THE SIGNS and THE VILLAGE the director should finally create better movies such as his best one called THE SIXTH SENSE. His last works seemed to be tired and he should now stop to write and in the same time to produce his own projects. For all these reasons I give 5/10. Definitely not a must see."

","First to say, I am not a big M. Night S. fan. Watched ""6th Sense"", ""Invincible"" and now this one, I find his technique too ""stylish"" (in a low meaning), his decisions - naive and his feeling of drama just kiddish.<br/><br/>That is why I am posting this comment in April of 2006 - passed on this in cinema and now regretting of 3 hours of sleep spended to catch this on TV.<br/><br/>Frankly, the only one reason for me to watch ""The Village"" was Sigourney Weaver, who's talent i deeply admire. She did her piece of work well, as always, but without any noticeable peaks. IMHO, Mrs. Weaver fans can put ""The Village"" deep down the watching queue - but thats just my 2 cents.<br/><br/>95% of the reviews on this movie pointed at ""unguessable ending, unbelievable twists"" et cetera, but... i got it from the first dialogue touching the theme - that was 20 minutes from the start. Too bad for unbelievable.<br/><br/>I can name many problems of the movie: slow timing, weak characterization, abusing of clichés, some factual incosistencies, but they all have one root - bad script. The main idea which i will not tell, is not bad, but neither new or enlightening. The story is too simple and bad developed. the characters.. okay you ve heard what i said..<br/><br/>Visuals and music were decent for the budget - not more, not less. So only 4/10."

","This film had the recipes of what makes a good horror film. I am a big fan of M. Night Shayamalan's films, and I was really looking forward to this film. Shayamalan's tale boasts an impressive range of actors, an incredible build-up of tension and suspense, but it's key failure was its twist ending, which both shocks and disappoints.<br/><br/>The tale is about an old village (17th/18th Century) and the people who live in it, all of them living in perpetual fear of a strange being that lives in the woods that surrounds them. They are apparently attracted by the colour Red, they seem to have some sort of truce with the town elders, and now, they are intent on breaking their truce because 'they are coming'.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), a shy yet confident man who shows resilience to the mysterious creatures that live in the woods, and his relationship with a blind woman called Ivy (Howard) who admires this courage. Ivy is also a friend of a bewildered and possibly mentally ill man called Noah (Brody) who has some sort of obsession with Ivy. As the film goes on, Lucius starts to break more and more of the bounds that separate the creatures from the humans, and now, the creatures suddenly seem more active, and it seems that Lucius is to blame. Soon, the fate of the Village is anybody's guess.<br/><br/>This film boasts some superb acting. Joaquin is fantastic as the reclusive and gentlemanly Lucius, whilst Adrien Brody is spot on as the psychotic and unpredictable Noah. Meanwhile, Sigourney Weaver, who plays one of the town's elders, gives one of her best acting turns since 'The Ice Storm'. They are all unfortunately hampered by the bad twist, but you could forgive it for the way it builds up the suspense. It is not a bad film, it is perfectly enjoyable to watch once or twice, but it isn't one of those films you'd want to get up and watch obsessively."

","Although this movie contains a great cast, the story itself is lacking. The concept was good, but the writer seems to have run out of steam early. There is a potential for a really good movie to have been created, too bad it fell alseep.<br/><br/>It almost seemed to have been forced, as if he was under pressure to produce a new script when he was dry of ideas. His other movies had a good flow to them that was obviously not present in this movie.<br/><br/>Although I enjoy seeing M. Night doing his cameo's, much like Alfred Hichcock use to do, this time there could have been slightly more interaction, in my humble opinion. He honestly gave the impression that this was just for a paycheck, rather than an impression of his own enjoyment of his work.<br/><br/>This movie was not advertised as a ""Horror"", but more as a ""Thriller"". If you rent this assuming to be a horror you will be disappointed. I knew before I watched it how it was going to end, and was quite happy to rent it anyway. <br/><br/>I'll admit I was expecting more from this movie, and was disappointed the fist time I watched it. The characters will grow on you though, and the acting was flawless.<br/><br/>Being part of an historical re-creation group, I was impressed with how well the mental immagery flowed. I do admit though, to having expected uch more from this film.<br/><br/>If you rent this, keep in mind that it is more along the lines of Unbreakable for keeping you watching to the end, and very much different from Sixth Sense or Signs.<br/><br/>The new one, ""Lady In The Water"" looks to be more along the same lines. Playing on your need to escape reality to a point. To loose yourself in the mental immagery of one person's fantasy based life."

","The Village is the newest creation of M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs). It's about an isolated community, living in a small village, late 19th century, complete with long skirts, Shakespearian language and small ordinary houses and grazing cattle in the surrounding fields.<br/><br/>At first sight a very peaceful town, but a dark secret is hidden behind this misleading surface. The inhabitants constantly live in fear of 'those we don't speak of'. The tiniest tip of the color red, scares the villagers to death. They do not dare to take one step into the woods, and not one of them would, or should take even one step over the well marked borders of The Village.<br/><br/>The new movie of M. Night Shyamalan has all the well known ingredients: surprising turns, an atmosphere that gives you goosebumps and moments where you jump up from your seat. In my opinion, it's a very disturbing story. But there's one thing that I miss: a great climax. This movie never seems to get this highlight. Shyamalan's latest is in the style of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but in these pictures the ending gets you by surprise, they leave you with your eyes and mouth wide open. The story gets to you piece by piece, sometimes surprising, scaring or horrifying. But it doesn't last. The ending of Shyamalan's other movies left you with some of the surprise, horror, or fear. The Village's ending does none of this.<br/><br/>Still, it's a nice movie, as long as it lasts. You're curiosity gets tickled and you only get one piece of the puzzle at a time. If I tell you more, it will ruin the plot of the movie. All I can tell is that it contains a love story, a tale of dubious and clashing moralities. The well known ingredients of Shyamalan's movies I mentioned above, are still an experience. If this is your sort of thing, then this still is a very enjoyable movie."

Exactly what forces of darkness are out there in the forrest that make the villagers avoid the color red and use a beigish-tan as a protected color.<br/><br/>The movie spirals into the nature of the threat and the secret past identity of the elders, the adult villagers.<br/><br/>The film is well recommended for its occasional cinematical brilliance in moments of tension, fear and surprise, but I think errs on one point, very perilously close to its central premise: If one transported 21st century people back to the tranquility of an era of good feeling prior to the civil war, wouldn't they be 21st century people in costume transplanted anti-modernists rather than 19th century people?

","The Village is where M. Night Shyamalan was bound to go like other great directors have gone before - to a so-so film. This is definitely not one of Shyamalan's best and it mostly has to do with the fact that the script was very predictable and though it's as slow as his previous films, because the script suffers, so does the pacing. The only real plus to this average thriller is newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of actor turned director Ron Howard) whose superior acting as blind Ivy Walker shows that M. Night Shyamalan still has what it takes when it comes to directing actors. I look forward to his next film, Lady in the Water. However, this time, only a 6 out of 10."

Unfortunately, I found it a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>This film is an attempt to capture... what? It mainly deals with life in an isolated village in the 19th century. But then Shyamalan throws in elements of Gothic horror with the knowledge that there is something nasty in the woods. There are two major twists, both of which are fairly predictable.<br/><br/>In fact, one could say that this film looks like someone else trying to emulate M. Night Shyamalan. So on top of the predictable twists, there are lots of... slow... sequences... and pauses... to add atmosphere... which become... frustrating... after a while. Add in the ""I like the language in The Crucible"" style of period dialogue, and the whole thing starts to look pretentious and smug.<br/><br/>Better than 'Signs', but still far from M.

Not every movie has to have a twist, you say, and I agree. This movie fails in other ways. Many scenes are photographed with the actors a long distance from the camera which removes any intimacy from the scene and give the movie an odd feeling of detachment. Many scenes are filmed from behind the actors or over their shoulders. The relationships between the characters are poorly written. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in this film.

","And once again M. Night Shayamalan delivers a ""tale with a twist"". And once again the ""twist"" is not exactly a twist but a violation or even contradiction of the before told story. No matter how fictitious a story may be, it has to have its own set of rules and its own logic that must not be discarded lest the story get's inconsequential - which is exactly what happens to ""The Village"". Speaking of plot holes would seem unfair to other bad scripts that at least struggle to build a plot around the holes. ""The Village"" leaves you with the holes only. Ironically, many audiences seem too believe that if they didn't spot the ""twist"" it must have been very clever - as opposed to being plain stupid.<br/><br/>This said, the acting, apart from maybe the most unrealistic depiction of a blind person ever witnessed, ranges from mediocre to solid performances. The cinematography is atmospheric and befits the scenery. The beautiful images that always suggest something hidden below the quiet surface are what mostly carries the movie.<br/><br/>After all the movie is okay to watch if you allow for the lame excuse for a story and drop your expectations. 5/10"

But you are really waiting for ""something"" to happen, and you have to keep waiting and waiting....<br/><br/>Nevertheless I decided to watch the DVD for a second time, now together with my wife. I expected her to be just as surprised as I was with the ending, which I considered was worth while the waiting. Well, I misjudged completely.... The second time the movie seemed even more slow. When the surprise at the end was there, my wife was not surprised at all. I wondered why she wasn't surprised at all. She said it was just because these people gave her the impression that they were living in a kind of Amish community..... I have to admit that if you look at the movie like that the movie is not exciting at all.<br/><br/>But I have another objection, which is about the originality of the idea for the movie. A few years ago I bought DVD copy of a French movie called ""Le Pacte des loups""(aka ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf""). This movie oozes much more suspense than ""the Village"", has a very good actress too (Monica Belluci) and moreover seems to be the blueprint for the idea used in ""The Village"".

Excellent mood and tension is built up throughout,regardless of how you felt about the show.<br/><br/>In rural Western Pennsylvania,some time during the 19th century,a small village lives a quiet,peaceful but somewhat tenuous existence as it speaks in hushed tones of the ""creature or creatures"" in the neighboring woods. When one of the younger members of the community(Juaquin Phoenix,very well-placed here)decides to go out into said woods,this sets the fearful community into a stir as the elders(led by William Hurt,perfect for this film!)try to decide whether to sanction this or not. This sets into motion a series of events that FORCES the village to send somebody into the forest and confront the danger.<br/><br/>An excellent breakthrough performance by Bryce Dallas HOward,as the blind daughter of Hurt's elder,heads this cast,which also features Judy Greer,Adrien Brody,Sigourney Weaver and Celia Weston(among others). Careful hints are dropped during this movie to clue the viewer,which,depending on your tolerance for ""twist"" endings,may or may not color your whole opinion of the film.

One main reason was its ""twist"". As we know, M. Night has been known for his twist endings. Unfortunately, this film almost became a gimmick for the twist. It actually was sort of in the middle, if you count the revelation, which kind of makes the rest of the film play out less intense than it should have.<br/><br/>Overall, this film should have been advertised as more of a drama than a thriller.

","M. Night Shyamalan is one of our most creative and singular directors, recalling the styles of many of the European film auteurs. In ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" there were fascinating locales within the urban confines of Philadelphia. In ""The Sign"" and ""The Village,"" the uniquely sinister mood is evoked in rural Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>In ""The Village,"" Shyamalan develops a story around the daily life of a strict communevirtually a cultliving in a small community in rural Pennsylvania in the nineteenth century. It is a hothouse environment with people held together with a bond of fear due to the mysterious appearances of supernatural creatures. The casting of the film was outstanding with Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver as major figures within the community. Above all, it is the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers the emotional impact of the drama as a young blind woman named Ivy, who is forced to make an arduous journey for essential medicines for her fiancé. The mysteries and indeed the secrets of the community unfold along with Ivy's odyssey.<br/><br/>In the undercurrent of violence which ran through the film, ""The Village"" recalls the famous and disturbing 1955 novel of William Golding, ""The Lord of the Flies."" In Golding's story, a group of boys isolated on an island discover the hidden, violent impulses lurking from within when forced to function on their own in a community. In the rural Pennsylvania of ""The Village,"" the story of commune is nearly identical to the world of ""The Lord of the Flies."" The so-called elders of the community seek to promote a peaceful existence. But like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the violence will emerge and potentially tear the village asunder."

I liked the twists in the movies sixth sense and unbreakable, but this was neither interesting nor surprising. So I guess, the twist is that you keep waiting for something surprising in the end and there is none. Anyway, many people pointed out the flaws and wrote many lines of comments on these. I'll just raise some questions here: *) So these are people who are fed up with the corruption and crimes of the 20'th century. Why the hell did they choose to dress like Amish when they went to seclusion? *) Obviously, they have lost other people and kids due to illnesses and diseases before. They came to this place because they all lost loved ones in the modern world, yet they seem to be okay for a long time when they lost people to curable diseases. Does not make sense. *) What is the deal between Sigourney Weaver's character and William Hurt's character? They seemed to have some suppressed feelings for each other, but we do not know what that is? I guess adultery was frowned upon in the village although platonic love is okay! *) What is the deal with Adrian Brody's character? Such a poor performance of the village idiot! *) I would be happier if the creatures turned out to be non-humanoid aliens using the village as a petri dish and the village people finally figured this out and decided to rise up and fight them.

","This was a messed up piece of work by the director. It could have been the best statement about Church control that has been made. Yet, it fades into pap. Not the actors fault, but the directors for not having the balls. The control by fiction of demons over the mass of ignorant people is a serious problem. The reason a blind woman was sent out was because she could not see the lie perpetrated by the 'wise' when she got out and report back. This is what governments do about the horrors of war, never report back the reality, only hero's and lies about glory. Thus, they are in control of ordinary men and women. Shame on the director for not following through his intent. I have guessed the endings to all his films. He is apparent. He has the importunity, but not the talent. Yet, he does try to have a go at moral subjects which is more than can be said of many directors who aim for cheap thrills. If only he had kept to a vision that - no, he had a half way vision then went blind. This man is not honest with himself, but he may have the courage later."

On one level the film speaks of the inability of trying to create a man-made paradise. The Village represents mankind. The Elders represent controlling thought or governance that an individual is able to save himself from evil without the presence of a Saviour. When a character decides to save another from an impending danger, their individual attempt is unsuccessful because they are blind to the truth. The film ends with the question will an individual attempt at providing salvation for one's self be successful without divine help? The answer is provided in the last few scenes.

","""The Village"" comes from a long line of critically acclaimed M. Night Shyamalan films, so naturally the expectations are high for this latest offering. I'd like to say it measured up, but the only word I can honestly use to describe this film is ""disappointment"". The movie may be a victim of Shyamalan's own success, causing audiences to draw comparisons between ""The Village"" and his other films (like ""The Sixth Sense""). More troublesome though, I think, is the misleading advertising which may have led some of us to believe ""The Village"" is a horror/suspense film  it's not.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is set in the late 1800s in a small village called Covington. Covington is isolated from the rest of civilization, as it is completely surrounded by woods. These woods are home to things so terrible, so horrifying, that the villagers of Covington can only refer to them as ""those we do not speak of"". And it is these ""creatures"" that keep the villagers in Covington after all these years, their fears amplified by the stories the village elders tell them.<br/><br/>While that may sound like a set-up for a great horror movie, or even an intense suspense thriller, it's really neither. Instead, in the first two thirds of the movie we are presented with a bizarre love triangle, which may be interesting on some level, if that is what we had come for. There are a few small thrills in between the slow, plodding atmospheric sequences with little-to-no interesting development among the characters and plot. It's almost as if while writing the script, Shyamalan completed the ending first, and worked backward, trying desperately to fill time until the movie could reach its rather anti-climatic end. The few twists the movie presents along the way could only surprise a very unperceptive viewer  perhaps one who made several trips to the bathroom during the film.<br/><br/>I suppose in its own right, ""The Village"" is a vaguely entertaining film, and I can certainly appreciate it for its foreshadowing (although it's hardly needed considering how obvious the ending is by the halfway point). I always love a mystery that gives you the clues along the way so you can solve the mystery yourself if you are perceptive enough. The Village got that right, now if only the mystery was stronger."

","In a socially uniform village in the middle of the woods, terrifying creatures dwell inches from its borders. When the story begins you are met with a series of secrets that you are unable to decode. Mixed with some effectively frightening scenes and the general feeling of mystery, the film is enjoyably suspenseful.<br/><br/>However, as most of Shyamalan's movies are, the story's first half is well done, but worsens as it progresses. Part of the Village's secret is revealed quite prematurely, allowing the viewer to expect the coming events, no matter how much they seem to contradict. Some things that still allowed the film to be enjoyable was the atmospheric music and the vividly natural forest setting.<br/><br/>What prevented the story from coming to a dull halt was the suspense of what will become of Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind young woman who is given permission to venture through the woods to get medicine for Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), her boyfriend. He had been stabbed by Noah Percy (Adrian Brody), an insane man, who was also in love with Ivy. Some of the questions that need to be asked are ""Why does Noah break out in laughter whenever the roars of the creatures are heard in the woods?"" and ""Why is Ivy allowed to venture through the woods, but nobody else?"" <br/><br/>Besides being moderately thrilling and somewhat enchanting, the story also lays heavy on the aspects of unusual human behavior. Even with all of the movie's flaws, you may leave the theater thinking... ""Would I have done the same thing?"""

","I was very impressed with ""The Village"" . I expected more of a slasher-like film, and was pleased that wasn't what it was. M. Night Shyamalan (Director of Sixth Sense and Signs) has a tendency to make movies that make you wonder, make you think, make you surprised at the unexpected outcome of his films. This movie does just that. When the final outcome of the movie is revealed (which is basically the last 10 minutes of the film) you think ""Oh my gosh, I never would have guessed!"" And you most likely would have not. All the actors in this movie played great roles and the characters were very realistic and believable. The plot of this movie is that the small, secluded village surrounded by woods is believed to be being threatened by the inhabitants of the other town. The creatures that haunt them occasionally are mysterious and has been proved violent. The people of the small village are forced to stay, seeing they know the creatures in the next town will not be pleased if they came to visit. This movie will leave you thinking, pleased with the outcome, yet a little questionable..... I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good startle every once in a while and loves a mystery. 7 out of 10 stars"
"schmimic","8","0","0","23 April 2005"," Another movie from Shyamalan. It's not bad, but not on par with the rest.
","Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrian Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver This is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth movie now. I loved his first three movies to pieces, and I walked into this one with high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the late 1800s in a small village that is cut off from the rest of the world. The inhabitants are not to venture off into the woods or ever go near the woods, because that is where ""Those we do not speak of"" live. Those we do not speak of are creatures that the people of the village have a truce with. They leave each other alone and exist apart from each other without disturbing each other. In the village, they hide the colour red for they believe that this colour will upset or anger those they do not speak of.<br/><br/>But then strange things start happening. Those they do not speak of enter the village one night and leave red marks on everybody's doors. A few days later, many animals are slaughtered and skinned and the bodies are left all over the village grounds. Many people believe that they should leave the village, but the elders decide that they can still salvage the situation and hopefully patch things up with their ""friends."" But then a tragedy occurs in the village. One of the young men, Lucius, (Phoenix) who makes his intentions to marry one of the young women (Howard) known is stabbed by a jealous individual (Brody). The only way that Lucius can be saved is if somebody leaves the village, goes back to the towns, and gets proper medication. Otherwise, he will die in a matter of days.<br/><br/>The girl he was planning on marrying, Ivy, who is blind, volunteers to go to the town to get the medicine for her fiancé in hopes of saving him. The elders object to this course of action, or at least they would if her father didn't let her go without telling the rest of the elders. He lets her in on a few secrets but doesn't let her know too much. Just enough to help her get to the town, get the supplies, and get back.<br/><br/>As in all of Shyamalan's movies, there's a twist. But this one is a little more predictable than the other ones. I saw it coming a ways off, and I found this movie to actually be pretty boring. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Overall, it had a pretty mediocre feeling to me.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)"
"MatBrewster","7","0","0","21 April 2005"," Only Watch It Once
","The problem with most thrillers is that once you've watched them one time, there is nothing left. Too many of these films spend all of their creative energy trying to give the audience a scare. The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare. While M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent craftsman, he tends to be unable to elevate his films into the realms of true cinema. The Village is no exception.<br/><br/>The story centers around a small village that seems to be set in the later part of the 1800's. The Villagers have worked out a complicated deal with strange creatures (""Those We Do Not Speak Of"") lurking in the near woods. Problems arise and the long held pact begins to break down. This causes there to be a need for one of the villagers to venture through the woods into the larger towns.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the Village and the last several of Shyamalan's films is his surprise endings. I read somewhere several years ago that he didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing the same supernatural type stories with twist ending. I wish he had kept to his word. Instead everyone goes into the theatre expecting, waiting on the surprise at the end. This is a distraction taken away from the whole of the film; it is a gimmick that has run thin. A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.<br/><br/>Where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense. He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see. It is a long time in the Village before we see ""The Things We Don't Speak Of"" and even then we only catch a glimpse. For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect. There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end. These were tense, beautifully paced moments.<br/><br/>The film also creates a masterful sense of mood. The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch. They give the film a true sense of paranoia and suspense. The acting, for the most part, is quite good. Which is not surprising considering the cast is made up of the likes of William Hurt, Sigorney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrian Brody amongst others. There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving. Yet it is the supernatural aspect that shines brightest, and ultimately, falls flat upon subsequent viewings. Watching the film a second time, knowing the surprises, I felt a tinge of boredom. The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time. Knowing the truth, there were too many plot points, and character actions that seemed false, or self serving.<br/><br/>It is a film worth a first viewing. Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film. In a sense the Village is really two stories. One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I believe the fault lies with the merging of the two. The suspense doesn't hold up under subsequent viewings. It does not serve the other aspect of its story. Likewise, the more human story is broken apart too much by the mystical aspects.<br/><br/>Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more."

It doesn't compare to anything else out there. The soundtrack is beautiful as well as the location that they filmed in and the use of colors. Acting is strong from recognizable talent (the director's cameo) and though pacing can seem slow, the movie is always going in a forward direction. Going into the film with no expectations does help.

","I'm really tired of twist endings. Today, they are used as a marketing device and are heavily promoted; used as a way to keep the viewer watching whether the movie is good or not. What the ""geniuses"" promoting these endings don't realize is that even if the movie is good, the viewer is unable to get involved because they are trying to guess what is going to happen. It makes it impossible to wrap yourself in the world unfolding on the screen before you. On the other hand, if the movie is bad, you feel cheated; in these cases, the twist is usually not supported by what happened before it. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, as I joke I turned to my wife and said what I thought the twist was. It turned out I was right.<br/><br/>This movie actually contains three twists, none of which I will reveal. The movie is better if you don't know what happens and can make your own unprejudiced decisions upon viewing it for the first time. My wife loved it; I was disappointed. The first half hour was thrilling and terrifying. M. Night Shyamalan sets up his 19th century village and the evil lurking in the woods surrounding it wonderfully. When at first all we get are spooky noises emanating from the forest, I got the creeps. When one of the creatures made its way into the village, I was on the edge of my seat. Then came the first twist and I was honestly shocked. Shyamalan was not playing with my emotions, but had made a spellbinding tale that was deserving of them. Then, he started explaining everything and the movie was downhill from there. The second twist is of the variety I can't stand in movies and I was extremely let-down. By the time he reached the much-hyped third twist (the one I figured out before hand), I was unimpressed. The beginning of the movie deserved better.<br/><br/>Twists and chills aside, I was impressed with the performance from the cast. The younger actors were actually better than the veterans; Bryce Dallas Howard is a pleasant discovery I can't wait to see in more movies. Joaquin Phoenix is continuing to mold himself into an ever better actor; his early performances left something to be desired, but he improves with each movie. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, as two of the elders of the village, were a bit disappointing. They are better actors than they seemed here and have proved it in better (and worse) movies than this. My opinion changed, however, after the final twist was revealed; I felt it explained the inferior acting among these cast members."
"ptarmigan","8","0","0","26 March 2005"," And the moral of the story is....
","The first point I wish to make is if you have not seen this movie, avoid spoilers like the plague.<br/><br/>This being the 100th anniversary of Einstein's theory of relativity, I hope he won't mind if I apply it to the evaluation of motion pictures.<br/><br/>Having sat through, more or less, such drivel as Anchorman and Eurotrip, I find it difficult to understand why some ingrates would bash a competent, intelligent movie. Or perhaps they find Anchorman intellectually stimulating? I suspect the real problem is deciding what category to put this movie in. It doesn't really fit in any. There is even, dare I say it, ambiguity in the movie.<br/><br/>But once you figure out what the point of the movie is, or put another way, what the moral of the story is, it starts to fall into place.<br/><br/>So here is the spoiler.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is that the problem is not society. It is people.<br/><br/>In other words, society doesn't kill people. People kill people.<br/><br/>And you get nut cases in small towns as well as big cities; in modern society as well as in olden days. The 20th century didn't invent murder, after all.<br/><br/>Trying to escape from the evil cities to a simpler time doesn't solve all your problems.<br/><br/>I remember the time a computer programmer who moved to the small, isolated (no road access)town of McCarthy, went on a rampage, killing half the town before he was finally stopped. There are plenty of small villages in Alaska that have had to deal with psychopathic bullies.<br/><br/>The extras with the movie are interesting. The director went to great lengths to immerse the cast in the historical character of the era, which is ironic given the reality of the story. I wish more directors would do this with historical pieces.<br/><br/>And finally, any movie with Sigourney Weaver in it can't be all bad. Not that this one is.<br/><br/>All of the cast does a first-rate job.<br/><br/>The bottom line: I enjoyed the movie. And the movie sticks with you for a while, giving you something to think about. This is more than I can say about most movies these days."

I will say that there were a few small things that made me wonder. The acting was almost all very low-key, with the exceptions of Adrien Brody, playing the village idiot, and Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind vixen. Miss Howard was pretty good in some parts, but was (to me) totally unbelievable as a blind woman. Needs some work, but hey, she's young.

","I must say Shyamalan is a great movie maker. He, no doubt, brings the best out of the actors, actresses, the camera and the atmosphere. But, what makes this movie a sub-standard outcome is the fact that Shaymalan is trying too hard to give that 'Shyamalan' touch. It seems like he had the touch planned out in advance, but couldn't find a suitable story and he finally settled on this lame story to deliver that touch. I think Shyamalan should try and grow out of the 'Sixth Sense' shadow. He should not waste any more of his movie-making talents on the 'Shyamalan' puzzle which found success through 'Sixth Sense'. His later movies make me wonder if Bruce Willis should have actually gotten the full credit for Sixth Sense. It is very clear that with every movie that he tries to deliver that touch through, he is losing even more. The audience is fast losing interest in his tricks too.<br/><br/>Like Steven Spielberg did, may be Shyamalan should try out diverse ideas to better utilize his talents. That will probably keep the audience interested too."

The story lacks the serious cohesion though to make it anything special: the fundamental narrative concept is good enough to be thought-provoking over a pint, but not enough to build a feature-length movie. It tries to shore itself up with the love story, but as the big narrative secrets come out they're not surprising enough, and left me unfulfilled.<br/><br/>I also felt the handling of Noah's character was a little irresponsible.

The 19th century rural utopia would be a tonic for many today who are feeling simply swept forward into a world that they have little or no control of.<br/><br/>The growth the ""Elders"" is nicely portrayed without the total destruction of their Eden as most other story tellers would have treated this subject.

The collision of the two realities at the end of the movie was done with great restraint and composure.<br/><br/>Of course the staff that guarded the preserve would be hand-picked for their pathos or innocence. Why else would there be fully stocked medical facilities every 10 miles along the perimeter of the preserve? Can you imagine being the Trust Executor protecting this Eden from publicity? For those who didn't catch it the first time, Mr. Shyamalan played the guard captain reading the newspaper.

","I have seen all of Night's films, and agree with another commenter that the endings tend to be weak.....especially Signs, and The Village...not so much with the Sixth Sense. He has an interesting approach to the supernatural, which is great, but why do they fall apart at the end....? The Village is a great film about a Utopian Society, and in watching the ""making of"" and the deleted scenes, I understood it a lot more....unfortunately, the deletion of the pipes in the woods, which made the eerie sounds of the ""monsters"", would have helped the audience understand the farce. I was angry that the park ranger who stole medical supplies for Ivy was not seen assisting her back to the woods, we did not see her return to the Village which is when they could have shown the pipes. I did not see this as a true horror film, since the monsters were farce, it was an interesting portrayal of a group denouncing modern society and its violence, returning to a simpler life.....however, not sure they needed to avoid medicine? Also, when Ivy returned, why the film ended abruptly there, I don't agree with....no transition, the healing of Lucius, nothing....it's like I was mesmerized by the whole film, and then said, ""that's it?"" at the end???????? bad. So I loved the film, but not the ending. Much like Signs...when I saw the alien it was all over. The mystery was better than knowing. The Sixth sense made more SENSE, and was good.

However, I can appreciate that Unbreakable would not necessarily be a commercial hit.<br/><br/>Signs, I loved the idea of ad then it just didn't click in the same way that his other two had and once we got to The Village I was a victim of the mediocre reviews and wasn't even anticipating the DVD release.

Night may be a victim of his own success in as much as people are always going to go in looking for possible twists and anticipating what will happen.

","Having just watched The Village on DVD I found it to be a good movie beautifully shot and scored. On the surface the plot is extremely simple, a tight knit community living in a village surrounded by woods containing evil creatures. Underneath the plot is about how far people will go to prevent themselves and others from experiencing painful moments in life. Rather than risk repeating what others have already written, I thought I'd just add the following.<br/><br/>Two points made by the director in the bonus material on the DVD stood out for me. <br/><br/>Firstly, when making the movie there was a point when it was really scary, but a decision was made two thirds through the scoring process to go for emotion and make it a romance. Although the movie does have a number of jump points that are fairly scary, it is essentially a love story. People expecting a horror flick are likely to be disappointed. <br/><br/>Secondly, when the original creatures were scaled up in size from being models, they just didn't move in a realistic fashion or have the desired affect. Consequently the design was changed which to me resulted in creatures that were too similar in proportion to the villagers. This made me wonder why two or three of the more able villagers couldn't just see the creatures off with shovels or any other implements readily available.<br/><br/>The odd niggle aside though, I found it to be an enjoyable and enchanting film containing the director's trademark plot twists. I'd give it 8/10."

","How goes the saying: ""it was so much better in the good old days""? Or was it worse? The quest for a more natural - therefore ""safer"" - way of life is threatened by the absence of medicine, and someone may die. Therefore, the quest itself becomes threatened less its fantasy is revealed. Escapism is then proved futile. But the movie doesn't tell us that, it implies it only. We may ponder what future awaits the Village. What is depicted, is an Amish or Quaker-like society that is artificially re-created. But like the boys in Lord Of The Flies, a return to ""original"" values has warts, lots of them, in the woods, monsters to whom sacrifices are due and whom we are to fear. And that's not the only fear in this movie: we learn also to despise disarray and mistrust; we cannot live with fear, we must deal with honesty. Photography is very good, if as plain as the required costumes. The script lacks the twists we expect after The Sixth Sense, too much is hinted before revealed, therefore predictable. The assumption of a restricted airspace is incredible, unless one never spent sometime in the remote woods of Pennsylvania, or any other Northeastern State. Don't expect stunning effects, unbearable moral drama or shock of sudden gore: this film is  and somehow to its credit, and to the credit of its actors - plain, as plain as the Society its participants aim for. It's not the kind of movie you need to own and watch again to discover hidden tricks of the trade; it's worth renting, watching it once, and return it to its vault. Or is it woods?"

As a suspenseful drama I think it was a little lacking. Joaquin Phoenix is a phenomenal actor. But I think his talents were a little underused. The plot was a little far fetched to me even before I knew how it ended. Anyone who knows their history is going to have a hard time sitting through this film without asking themselves a thousand questions. Suspending disbelief is hard when you are presented with a period film that seems to be riddled with incongruence's. The ending is watch you would expect from Shymalan, which was a problem for me actually. Expecting a twist is really not as fun as being surprised by it. I think he actually wrapped it up a little too tightly. We should have been left with the final scene of the girl standing in the middle of the road as the troopers jeep arrives. I think everything after that was just trying to explain too much. But I did enjoy the film. Nad it was a very novel idea. Too bad that it couldn't work, cause I would do it in a heartbeat!!!"

At first I thought the death of Noah at Ivy's hand was some kind of justice, but I eventually saw that it was in fact the death of an innocent, not at the hand of particular criminal, but as a consequence of the corruption innate in the premise of the Village. William Hurt's character's fundamental deviousness and duplicity is demonstrated in his choice to send the blind girl out to see the real world--she was the only who got leave and return without being immediately transformed. I wish this movie had a part two and three, because I have no doubt that a slow revelation of the truth is at hand.

","The ""Village"" is a highly interesting and thought-provoking film. Well-directed by M.N. Shyamalan, the story unfolds in what seems a common 19th century small village in the middle of a forest. This village however is different: As we learn early in the film, it is surrounded by mysterious creatures (having the apt moniker ""Those We Don't Speak Of""), who terrorize the villagers; the latter have come up with some sort of a pact with ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", so that neither crosses each other's borders. In effect, the villagers are hence incarcerated, and we watch their strange life as they are cut out from the outer world.<br/><br/>The movie studies mainly three main characters: Luscious Hunt, played well by Phoenix, a boy who talks little but is gentle and noble in his acts. Ivy Walker, a role which Bryce Howard does a great job in portraying, is a blind girl who is in love with Luscious, and displays a great deal of courage despite her disability. Finally, Noah Percy is a mentally retarded boy, who plays a key role in the sequence of events; Brody performs a very good act here.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>What raises the heat in the film, is the following: When Noah attacks and seriously injures Luscious due to his jealousy for Ivy's heart, the shattered girl asks for permission to go to the nearest town to get medicines and save her lover's life. Although her request should normally be denied, as it will violate the pact with the creatures, her father gives in, and without informing the other ruling ""Elders"", he tells her the Village's great secret: Namely, that in fact everything (the Village, the creatures, and the whole setting) have simply been fabricated by him and his fellow ""Elders"", as a way to escape the 21st century civilization.<br/><br/>The reason is that all of them have suffered from crime and violence in the normal world, and so they created this habitat in the middle of a wildlife preservation (owned or sponsored by Ivy's father), so as to create a totally new society. They then invented the scary story about ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", so that their children would be permanently banned from being inoculated with the ""ills"" of the outer world. Ivy finally goes outside, although she is both blind and totally unprepared for the environment of 21st century life; she is simply lucky to find a guard who sympathizes with her, offers her the medicines, and helps her to get back. In her heroic journey, she gets attacked by Noah dressed in a creature suit, but manages to kill him. The film ends with Ivy giving the medicines to her lover, while the ""Elders"" consider Noah's death (whom everyone bar them believes it was a wild creature), as the fact that will now make their story fully bullet-proof, and therefore their ""Village"" will be able to incarcerate its villagers indefinitely.<br/><br/>I have found the movie incredibly thought-provoking. It is interesting how these people decided to fight society's ills (from which all have suffered, by losing friends and relatives from crime), by creating an even bigger one: They took the fatal decision of creating this isolated Village-Prison, in which they watched their children suffer and die from illnesses and disabilities, while they were unwilling to provide them any professional help or treatment from the outer world just because they wanted to preserve their fabrication. Moreover, they preferred to have everyone live in a big lie, rather than go to the real world (no matter how difficult that would be) and face it. They stuck to this until the very end, determined to pursue the wicked goal at any cost.<br/><br/>A story that makes you pause and think. 9/10."

","There were things that I liked about this film, such as the portrayal of an 1800's lifestyle, the forthrightness of the characters and the care that members of the Village had for each other. Bryce Howard as Ivy is a definite role model for young women to see. I think that the positive message of her strength of character outweighs the concerns about scary parts of the movie for teenage (actually preteen) girls. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The cast of more experienced actors was excellent. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, Celia Weston, Cherry Jones all played their parts with a believability and dignity that made the film shine. The musical score added to the enjoyment and contributed to the sense of time and place. Although the movie doesn't have quite the same suspense as one of Shamaylan's previous movies - ""The Sixth Sense"", it is intriguing enough to get you wondering where it will ultimately go."
"johnhuf","8","0","0","11 February 2005"," thought provoking
","There are many who praise and many who abhor this movie. My take is well above neutral considering some logical flaws. Like other MNS directed movies, he weaves in suspense, visual experience and most notably intellectual conjecture. I would agree that he appears very Hitchcock influenced. I don't typically look at the DVD extras so this may be a confessed trait, but the techniques of cinematography, suspense and of course the perfunctory cameo smell vividly of sir Alfred. I would wager that MNS is in development and the shortcomings can be accepted as he moves toward the Hitchcock level. Imagine the early years of Hitchcock when you can see the creative brilliance but are bothered by the technical flaws. Know that he learned over his career and it is likely that MNS will as well. If we micro-analyze these developing films and lose the realization that we may be witnessing a new master filmmaker, we are losing the big picture. Films that excel will test our minds and emotions and will inundate us with a masterful blend of excitement, suspense, thought, visual intensity and emotion. I think MNS is well on his way to accomplishing this. With so many over-hyped, over budgeted crappy films to name, it's refreshing to find one that hits hard on all meaningful fronts and for the most part, succeeds. TO all who hate this film, consider that you are taking a narrow view and that a tastier palette of future offerings is very likely. I give this film an 8.0 and would go higher if a bit more tuning up had been done. THe story is very intriguing, the acting very good, the imagery is excellent. There are flaws in continuity, logic and credibility but they can be accepted in the larger view of the message of the piece."

The villagers aren't allowed to walk into the forest because ""those who we don't speak of"" live there. Some mysterious and aggressive creatures that's made a peace deal with the village people... but as soon as the rebellious and seeking Lucius Hunt breaks the deal, with entering the woods... the whole thing is suddenly turned upside down.<br/><br/>THE VILLAGE is beautiful, dramatic, fascinating and exciting. With very well working concept, romance, dialog and acting the movie works completely on most levels, although it misses sadly enough on probably it's biggest target; the horror. The movie isn't very much of a fright actually, it's entertaining and fascinating, not scary. And this may be a big let-down for people who expect being scared out of the chair, cause in my position I really never got to that point. But; it's exciting at times and the movie never looses focus and you always have to have your eyes on the screen. Joaquin Phoenix does a great performance (as good as in Signs) and so with William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody, AND the blind girl worth remembering!

I was pretty shocked when they revealed the true nature pf the Village.<br/><br/>Another great aspect I felt was the performance of Bryce Howard, daughter of acclaimed director Ron. She seemed to be very comfortable with her role and seemed to fly through her role as a blind woman. I especially liked her performance towards the end of the film.

Not only did her character and charisma dominate this film but she almost single-handedly saved it....ALMOST. Don't get me wrong, Shyamalan's premise is as always fascinating - and this is perhaps his finest - with his signature twist ending truly flooring BUT to get us there he struggled tremendously. The whole rickety, precarious structure of the film began to fall over a couple of times and Night had to toss the audience a bone each time in order to try to keep us on his wave-length I think. In other words this film much more than his previous ones was very obviously ""written backwards"" from the twist and then filled in frantically in order to make a story. As a whole cohesive story it just falls short. It was really close here but I don't think as a whole the film survives.

","This is a subtle thriller turned romance with ingenious aspects carried throughout the film. The location is a village and the era is timeless because time is not relevant. This village is surrounded by a forest which is where those they do not speak of live. The way of life exhibited in the film is innocent and that is exactly what the elders are trying to protect. Although to some it may seem somewhat bizarre, I happen to think M. Night Shyamalan's vision is very admirable. There's an incognito message with this movie that some just do not get. We live in a world which is full of many foolish deaths with incredible pain and this village symbolizes a certain divine purity that should never be forgotten. It's definitely beautiful in ways I wish I could behold more throughly. Not only does M. Night Shyamalan idolize Alfred Hitchcock his style is much like him too. I'd highly recommend this movie along with Shyamalan's other work. 7/10."

A big-name cast was not given the free rein to develop their respective characters, in my opinion.

","I have become a great fan of M Knight over the years. Of his four films since the Sixth Sense and including it he has stunned me with his imagery and his ability to make a film ultimately look and feel real. His staple plot twists are what has made him a box office success, but ultimately you cannot watch a Knight film without feeling like you have been somewhere. The Village (to me his best film to date) is not exception.<br/><br/>While one of the two major plot twists in this film can be seen from miles away, this does not take anything away from the film. In fact all the while why you think you have figured out the twist you are ignoring the other hints that lead to the final twist. I think Knight knew this all along and sacrificed one for the protection of the other, to me that is genius. However, I think it is ignorant if not just plain ridiculous to critique any film on it's plot twist and whether or not you can figure it out before the film maker reveals it. The Usual Suspects is still a great film almost a decade after finding out who Keyser Soze really was. The Sixth Sense was a great film and I figured out Bruce Willis' secret before it was ever revealed in the film. Let's not forget that Hollywood is the reason why we look for plot twists in every film. Knight did not overkill the ""plot twist"", nor did Brian Singer, and nor did O'Henry. The fact that in the last seven or so years at least thirty percent of the films released had plot twists from Basic to Taking Lives to Fight Club to Secret Window to In The Cut, it has been one plot twist after another. Don't blame Knight, blame Hollywood.<br/><br/>The Village looks wonderful, and has a very fairy tale esquire feel that even Tim Burton couldn't pull off with double the budget. The is superb all around, and there is a feeling of freedom and innocence throughout the film, something few films do these days. There isn't any sex, language, and the violence is extremely mild. Knight creates his atmosphere with great set designs, amazing sounds, and superb acting. As a film in full this is a wonderful film not to be forgotten. Knight to me is the Steven Spielberg of this generation a man with a unlimited imagination, who reads people with the camera, and who is not afraid to tell a tale without gimmicks like nudity, sex, language, and violence. In this day and age where movies like Fast and The Furious dominate the box office with sex, sleaze, stupid unbelievable stunts, ridiculous Tarrentino challenges language, dumb plots, and horrible acting Knight should be a breath of fresh air to both critics and to movie fans.<br/><br/>I for one can't wait for the next one from M Knight.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten crows fed as an offering to Those We Don't Speak Of."

Still, there was some anticipation surrounding this movie, with it's superb cast and an interesting plot.<br/><br/>It involves a small town hidden in the woods, where the people have some sort of truce with the creatures from those woods: they won't come in the village if the people don't go into their territory. This way, the small village has no bonds with the outside world.<br/><br/>Problems arise when a young man called Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is stabbed and desperately needs medication from the outside world. His blind girlfriend Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) sets out to seek help, through the woods, into the wide world.<br/><br/>In the first hour of the film, it's perfectly balanced between the scares of the creatures and the relationships unfolded, but once Ivy sets out into the woods the movie loses it's momentum. Although I filled the box 'spoilers included' I won't go too far with that: an observant viewer might know enough by remembering who the director of this movie is...<br/><br/>As said, the ending is rather disappointing. It feels strange to see 'the real world' as we know it. There's a rather useless scene with a patrolman stealing some medication for Ivy... it just didn't really fit in to the movie.<br/><br/>What still stands though are the excellent performances by the whole of the cast, with some exceptional acting in particular by the relatively unknown Bryce Dallas Howard and William Hurt as her father.<br/><br/>On the whole one would perhaps expect more after it's first hour, but 'The Village' still is a movie to watch, as it's truly scary at times and has some of the best performances of the year.<br/><br/>Edit: after watching the movie for the second time I feel I have to upgrade it to a 7/10.

I think that's why people were so disappointed. I do have to say I didn't like Sigourney Weaver in this. She's an excellent actress, but she just didn't fit the character. Phoenix was great as always.<br/><br/>If you love ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", you'll love this.

After reading several dismal reviews about this film, I thought it would be good to level the playing field. First, Mr. Shyamalan has been referenced in several statements with the noted film maker Alfred Hitchcock. Although both film makers have the ability to project fear with both script and visuals (and I don't mean graphic visuals), each has their own style of film making. With each new film, Mr. Shyamalan grows as a film maker, a true story teller, which is a rare thing in current film. Second, the story itself is one of simplicity, yet grounded in realism. Simple in the fact of showing us the lives of the characters and the events that surround them. Realistic in the enlightening, not jaw dropping, revelation near the end of the film. Right now I am beginning a career in film writing. I can only hope to write something this good. Third, the fine performances of all, notably, Ms. Howard. There are no scene stealer's and Mr. Shyamalan has the ability to evoke low key, yet indelible characters that remain with you after watching the film. Finally, Mr. Shyamalan himself. One only needs to go back and review ""Praying with Anger"" to know that a great artist was in the making. Mr. Shyamalan does not just make movies; he tells us stories. When so much junk is green lighted and put to film, that comes and goes without so much as a twinkle, ""The Village"", as with his previous films, add to the genre not of thriller or horror or mystery, but to the genre of storytelling. A great ability indeed."

","I have several significant questions that, while probably can't be answered, would like to see discussed.<br/><br/>1) Ivy is sent into the towns because she is stronger than most others in the town and is lead by love -- why is it not brought up that she's most likely sent BECAUSE she is blind, not in spite of it? What I mean is anyone else going to the towns would see the elements of the modern life and would tell others of the cars, lights, people; Ivy, being blind, would not see these things, wouldn't be able to tell others about them, and would keep the ideal of their community in tact.<br/><br/>2) There are too many older people in the town. The elders invented the community, yet many of the townspeople are their peers, so why do they have a fear of the monsters? Therefore, aren't the children the only ones who would truly be scared of the woods? And if that is the case then wouldn't the community be considered a failure since it did not even last one entire generation? <br/><br/>3) Should Shyamalan constantly be compared to his own earlier successes or simply to the other films of the year, as all other directors are? I fear a Michael Jackson ""Thriller"" type downward spiral for Night if this continues.<br/><br/>If you're still reading, thank you. Just wanted to make a comment that of the two love stories in the movie, one is incredibly unique but very believable. Edward Walker never touches Alice Hunt because he knows she loves him and doesn't want hurt her. That's incredibly insightful view into the human condition isn't it? I would like to see what Night could do with a straightforward love story. Also his understanding of familial love has been present in all of his movies, does anyone else enjoy this aspect of his work?"

Amusing, but nonetheless harsh criticism that does little to enlighten, much less critique.<br/><br/>Although I agree that the execution of the film is somewhat problematic, I believe many reviewers have been, if not blinded, then swayed by M. Night's own proclamation of having a winning ""formula."" They have perhaps paid more attention to structure than to content.<br/><br/>The film speaks a great deal to the times in which we live. In a world where we have become so afraid of what lies beyond our own ""villages,"" Shyamalan has woven a tale that forces us to address our own irrational fears of the ""other."" The horrors of the world ""out there"" must be increasingly played out on a grander scale by a media that is in an inevitable position of always having to up the ante. In THE VILLAGE, it is the elders that take on this role, betraying their cove of innocence, as we so often do, with good intentions and well-meaning hearts. But the effect is the same.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is Adrien Brody's character as the ""village idiot."" It is not so much in the performance; the impact would have been more profound if the character was of clear mind, acting consciously. We are left thinking, ""Well, he doesn't know any better.""<br/><br/>This film is not a horror flick. That may have been part of the problem. A matter of expectations, really. It is difficult to walk into an M. Night Shyamalan film without them.

They were expecting a Sixth Sense or Signs type of film but what they get, in fact, is something very different.<br/><br/>As I watched the special features on the DVD I realized that Mr. Shyamalan may have started writing a spooky horror yarn but then got sucked in by the characters he was creating and took more of an interest in them than the goblins.<br/><br/>Basically, if this film were marketed with a bit more honesty more people may have enjoyed it. I would say this is not a film for fans of Night's past work but more a film for a broader audience.<br/><br/>To me, what I think Night does in this film is explore a little deeper parts of the Rev. Graham Hess character from Signs. As a progression for the filmmaker I think this makes perfect sense. In this film it's more about the characters than the supernatural. Love is this films central theme and in case you miss that point the characters are given several lines to drive this point home.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is the real twist of this film, that it's a film made by M. Night Shyamalan that's not like the other films he's made. He's made a love story this time and seemed to put a great deal of care into creating it.<br/><br/>The actors all do a fine job and it is quite a cast. Hurt, Gleeson, and Weaver are fantastic, as are the often mentioned Howard and Phoenix. Brody also does well with his role. Just the cast alone was enough to get me interested in seeing this and I'm not a fan of Mr. Shyamalan's work.<br/><br/>Overall I found the film to be interesting and well made. It's not a great film, having sort of tried to be two things at once and failing at both, but it is a good entertainment. The secrets of the film are not kept well hidden and I believe most people will sort out what's going on early on but I think that is what the director intends. He is a director of big popular entertainments, in the same way that guy who made ET and Jaws is. So, the films message will always be hammered home and made quite obvious. He does succeed in entertaining I think.<br/><br/>Watch this film expecting a love story and I think you may enjoy the ride. Watch it expecting a horror film and you may fall asleep halfway through.<br/><br/>If I were ranking it on a star system with no stars being the worst and four stars being the best...I'd give this film 2 stars.<br/><br/>My IMDb vote for this film is a 5."

","As the title says, The Village has unexpected results - it's one of those movies where you either hate it or you love it. I personally love it. The movie brings twists and surprises which make your mind wonder about certain realities... it makes you think. If you are looking for a horror movie, this is not your choice. Although the movie contains scary scenes and situations, the ending is not one of a horror movie. The actors bring the movie to life with their amazing performances. At the end of the story, we discover the creatures are not real - they are a means of keeping the community away from worldy things. The village is actually living in a hostile forest, in present time. When it's discovered that the murders and occurrences the elders first talk about in the beginning of the movie are actually everyday things that happen in the world (rape, suicide, murder), we become comfortable realizing creatures had nothing to do with the fatalities - but how can we become comfortable with those things? They aren't right, any way you look at them. In a way, WE are the creatures. We take life at others' expense without a second thought. The movie holds a strong theme - if you get too comfortable with things that are wrong, things that are wrong will become right, and there will be no fine line between right and wrong. This may sound confusing, but it's just my take on the movie.<br/><br/>If you get a chance, at least listen the the soundtrack - it holds the same theme as the movie. All in all? 4.5/5 stars."

Unlike many of my peers the twist in 6th Sense caught me totally off guard and turned it into one of my favourite movies which I've been happy to watch numerous times with each viewing adding a little to a deep character interaction ... not so with The Village! Shyamalan started so well with 6th Sense and Unbreakable but failed to hit the mark this time. That said I had little to say about ""Signs"" either.<br/><br/>I give this 6/10 only because it was bearable but left me with an empty feeling.

","Once again Shyamalan uses cheap thrills and flimsy plot twists to thrill audiences. This time however he goes that extra mile to rip the audience off. <br/><br/>I found this movie to be disappointing on so many levels I will never see another Shyamalan film again. The backbone of the movie is pure hype. The movie itself is dry and emotionless. Shyamalan has this aspect to his films where he thinks if the actors all whisper their lines it will entice and please the audiences. He thinks wrong. I'm tired of the actors in his films whispering, I wanted to scream by the end of this film. <br/><br/>The films big plot twist (which is supposed to make the audience gasp), made me laugh. The ending was absurd and served to destroy the essence of the rest of the film, which was tolerable at best. It's fine to be pleasantly deceived in a film, I.E the plot twist in The Sixth Sense, but this film is like eating a great sandwich only to find a huge hair in the center, makes you want to puke up the rest of the sandwich. Same goes for this film, by the end you'll wish you never saw the rest of it. You'll see what I mean if you are brainless enough to rent this film. <br/><br/>As for the rest of you who swear by Shyamalan's directing, I'd love to see the shrines you have in your homes paying homage to a talentless director."

","With all the hype from the months before hand and all there short previews on the television i was getting geared up for what should have been M. Night Shyamalan's greatest film. I was disappointed in what i paid 7.10 for. While it had the Shyamalan style that we've all seen before in Signs, and Unbreakable, it lacked the new elements, that spark of creativity. Shyamalan went from making moveis to following a formula to success. Same plot different setting. Nothing is what it seems and we all learn a valuable life lesson in the end. The cinematography for the Village was still amazing as ever. Shyamalan has a way with the cameras that just make a good film. The pans, angles, fades and cuts all mesh together to make a frightful yet emotional story. If only the plot could follow. Hopefully for his next movie Shyamalan will return to the reason for why he became famous in the first place. Ingenuity. Forget all this hype crap and smoke and mirrors, make a good, creative movie and the audiences will come."

Amish people wear clothes like that and thats fine.. and especially for us, we needed that typical shyamalan twist at the end! we needed to think it all happened long ago for the shock at the end and its all just so clever and calculated! the ""blind girl"" (ivy) needed to be blind so that she wouldn't see the real world to tell the rest of the village. and its totally possible for ivy to go into the woods, she wasn't supposed to be alone in the first place (until the road anyway). blind people are totally capable and I'm sorry that you don't even know that. the retard is a retard so all his actions are justified.. the elders have been in the woods before, hence the coming out of the woods to the village, so for them to go in and find noah is acceptable. they can say they just found him at the border. it all actually makes sense if you think about it carefully and logically.<br/><br/>only one thing i don't get, when luscious breetches the border just that one time and when ivy is in there, where do those ""monster"" sounds come from? my buddy says it was probably a tape recorder is that right?? please email me and let me know!!<br/><br/>i still think that it was great and i cant wait to watch it again.. so, don't expect too much, forget that its a m night shyamalan movie and you'll really enjoy it. especially if you like not too much suspense and an old fashioned romantic ("",)"

"antoniotierno","Null","0","0","7 November 2004"," not a masterpiece but a movie likely to satisfy the audience
","The young and talented M. Night Shyamalan delivered an original picture, that is surely worth the money you're going to spend seeing it. It stars an over the average cast (William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver,Joaquin Phoenix along with the surprising Bryce Dallas Howard) that helps to make the film enjoyable in both acting and storyline. Tension is high all the movie long though the work is a bit lacking and low on action and scares (apart from a couple of jump-in-your-seat scenes). The plot moves slowly creating a very odd but convincing atmosphere, with voices and noises haunting in your mind. Describing ordinary living, love affairs and family relations, Night uses the creatures living in woods as evident metaphors for the fear of change and progress. The final surprise is not as SURPRISING as the one of ""The sixth sense,'cause, though not revealed, it could have been understood before but it's nevertheless an intriguing and bright idea."

"morpheus84","10","0","0","2 November 2004"," A thriller with a dash of drama
","I do not understand how anybody cannot commend Shyamalan on his latest venture. The film was vintage Shyamalan, with slow camera work and lingering moments of silence foreboding an atmosphere of doom.I wasn't bored even for a moment as many others have commented because the story gripped me and kept me interested with subliminal moments of dialogue or scenery which we have come to recognise as the trademark of this film-maker.<br/><br/>The character of Bryce Dallas Howard(Ivy), the blind, innocent country lass was scripted perfectly albeit a bit too honest... Joaquin Phoenix(Lucius) delivers a flawless performance and we can identify ourselves or at least somebody we know with his unabashed courage or is it curiosity....??? Sigourney Weaver(Alice) as Lucius' mother plays a subdued role and is not the fiery mother we expect her to be.. The dialogue and situations in this film are expertly handled and is a treat for moviegoers, though i have found many who are not impressed with the movie.Perhaps they are satisfied with only fast-paced action flicks and raunchy bedroom scenes...and when an actual story is unfolded brilliantly on the screen, they fail to recognise it.. <br/><br/>SPOILER UP AHEAD.............<br/><br/>About the twist..Well,i would say that there are basically two twists in this film...the first one is fairly recognisable early on in the film..that there are no ""creatures of the woods"" as such..but the reason for the creation of this myth, to scare the villagers into submission and staying within the boundaries of the village is revealed with the panache and poise of a master craftsman towards the end of the movie... the village is actually created by a group of individuals..""the elders"" to stay away from the evils and violence in modern day society i.e the 21st century.. which has led to tragic losses for the elders when they were a part of mainstream society.<br/><br/>For hardcore Shyamalan fans like me, it was a bit of a letdown because of the high emotional content and lesser shock value, but again i was impressed by the cinematography, the editing and the well written script which managed to hold the film together.<br/><br/>Hollywood is increasingly turning out formula films at an alarming rate and it is heartening to occasionally see a film that's different and also keeps the viewer coming back for more.<br/><br/>Kudos to Shyamalan..We need more scripts from him in the near future to keep us thrilled and shifting in our seats and not just eye-popping graphics in high budget films turning us into mindless zombies."

It was money wasted. 5/10..and that's being generous. I gave it a 5 only because the actual story wasn't bad, just the execution of it and portrayal of it. It was actually a good idea, but way too far fetched to be believable about 1/4 of the way through. I've seen this director's other movies; Signs, The Sixth sense, Stuart Little, and they're pretty good, but this one's a flop. You'll find yourself asking yourself throughout the movie..""would they do this""?, ""that doesn't seem right""! Too many holes..and not nearly as frightening as the trailers allow you to believe.

Night's Films (I haven't seen ""Wide Awake"" but I even liked ""Unbreakable,"" which had an unfortunate backlash!) I can honestly say though, that if this movie had been done by anyone else other than M. Night Shyamalan, it never would have progressed past pre-production. What the script lacked was something that he put so much emphasis on in his earlier films. He likes to steer you in one direction then pull a quick one over you and present something that is completely plausible but at the same time apparent. He had all the ingredients to make an amazing thriller. I was with him until the scene in the woods when Bryce Howard is chased by the creature who turns out to be Adrien Brody. If he had only turned it around and actually made the creatures real he could of scared the s**t out of everyone in the audience. BUT NO!!!! He has to tell us halfway through the film the most obvious twist anyone could think of and then try and trick you by having a crappy voice-over come in ""But the things-we-do- not-speak-of are based on an old myth"" and then squash it again with ""Yep, nothing has changed. The creatures aren't real."" <br/><br/>After that the suspense is gone. You really are not afraid iff she makes it out of the woods alive. YEAH, WHY WOULD THEY EVER SEND A BLIND GIRL INTO THE WOODS ALONE. That's right, so his plot can work!!! And if they care so much about the children why not just bring medicine in and save them. Ohh that''s right...because then M. Night wouldn't have a film AND HIS PLOT WOULDN'T WORK! He was so focused on creating this ""twist"" he forgot to create a propelling story past the second act!!! M. Night copped out of making a real film and just decided to give us a twist. Please leave the twists next time to the alcohol you obviously sloshed yourself in when you were writing this script!!

","The Village is actually a much cleverer film than many people give it credit for. I thought that using the wood from the forest surrounding 'the village' to whittle a cast of actors was ingenious. This technique, however, must be fraught with difficulties? Surely Adrien Brody's lawyers will have carefully noted the extreme likeness between their Oscar winning client and the carving who represented the mentally handicapped 'character'?<br/><br/>The ambitious director, producer and writer burden that Shyamalan has handed himself appears to be a negative influence on his career. I would like to think that he might rise from the ashes of this horror (that's descriptive, not genre) and focus on one aspect of film-making and excel in it. The writing bit is probably the first area that he could strike off.<br/><br/>Some of the lines in The Village were so clumsy that they appeared as though they had been formed with the same chisel used to fashion the blind girl. <br/><br/>""Don't stray too near to the forest we are forbidden to pass into by ancient rites and laws because of the bad things that live there, Noah!""<br/><br/>""Oh!

","Yes it look great, yes it is an amazing idea and a bold statement about America and how we do isolate ourselves in fear. However, for M.

It was a story about religion, family, and supernatural fear. But then it got itself mixed up with Sci-Fi corn. The payoff should have been in the characters' decisions alone, not seeing the alien with the rubber suit on.<br/><br/>So with ""The Village"" M. Night wants to be preachy. But he cant admit it. He hides true ideas with the suspense of a monster movie. As it played out, it was a film that was not enjoyable and too conscious of itself. This dampens performance and emotion and even an innovative surprise ending does not make up for the pain most common audiences felt during ""The Village"" Good try Mr Night but when its all said and done it sounds like Shama-lama-dingdong."

"gm-stratford","8","0","0","29 September 2004"," Beautiful complexity.
","I am a self confessed Shyamalan fan. His story telling and directing are by far the best we've seen from a director in the past decade. The Village follows his magnificent 2002 film SIGNS, and like SIGNS, The Village is a 'Love it' or 'Hate it' film. As far as I'm concerned, everyone is entitled to their opinion and I'm obviously willing to accept that some people don't like it, but the people who dismiss it as complete rubbish are Simply not intelligent enough to cope with its beautiful complexity.<br/><br/>It is the late 1800's and deep, in the countryside, a group of settlers have set-up home in a makeshift village to get away from the hectic life of 'the towns'. The Village is surrounded on all sides by Forest. The community 'council' so to speak, named 'The Elders' are in charge of The Village and have discovered that the surrounding woods are filled with Mystical red-hooded creatures. Those who enter, do not return. Entering the forest is strictly forbidden to all residents of the village, but when it seems that the truce between the creatures and the villagers is ending, one man chooses to challenge the beliefs and enter the woods.<br/><br/>Joaquin Pheonix is that said man. He is one of my favourite actors and his skill at portraying his characters does not wain in this film. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a blind villager whom Joaquins character Lucius is in love with. He takes it upon himself to protect her at all costs.<br/><br/>Unlike SIGNS, THE VILLAGE is a lot more slowly paced as its story, as i have said, is rather complex and demands a lot of attention and therefore 'screentime'. When the horror does pop its head up, its horror of the greatest magnitude. The glimpses of 'the creatures' are really chilling and leaves the viewer very very nervous, like when your just waiting for a loud crash to break the silence and some sort of attack! I wont spoil it for non viewers but the creature design is brilliant and later in the film when we are treated to a full frontal of the creature with its head hidden in the darkness of its hood, i was genuinely frightened! Its as close as Psychological horror has got to making the viewer close his/her eyes and turn away in the same way as violent horror makes squirmish people do.<br/><br/>As for the 'TWIST', well that would be telling wouldn't it! Its the biggest best Shyamalan twist since The Sixth Sense and it really will leave you gobsmacked.....followed by huge discussions about its consequences with friends. I found myself feeling deeply sorrow for a particular character at the end, but you'll have to see it to understand what i mean.<br/><br/>The Village is classic Shyamalan but with the emphasis on the story. Its how 'Horror' should be done and its another reason for me to follow his future works. Maybe you'll love it, and maybe you'll hate it, but you HAVE to see it!"

","Again, Shyamalan shows his rare gift as a visually vocational (striking use of colours!)and extraordinary creator of melancholy moods and atmospheres. The story here is a deeply felt idea about the desire to create a new society at any cost- and the incident that is about to break the whole community, is action caused by nothing but pure love and jealousy. <br/><br/>But the overall vague depiction of the village people (many characters ring too hollow) isn't enough to hit this as a full home-run. But it certainly gave me and my fellow movie goer a lot to discuss... And the climax sequences with the luminous Howard are unforgettable and very moving. <br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"sarastro7","6","0","0","29 September 2004"," I know what I like, but I don't know if it's art...
","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>The Village is one weird movie. It has loads and loads of subtext and symbolism. The ""dangerous"" color, red, which has to be buried, signifies some form of passion. The ""safe"", ""protective"" color, yellow, signifies cowardice.<br/><br/>While the movie's message isn't striking while you watch it, in retrospect it does seem to be about a society (the U.S.) of fear, conservatism and manipulation - but apparently that status quo is just maintained at the end.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has ""art"" written all over it, but it doesn't come through on it. It could have gone in lots and lots of brilliant directions, but it doesn't. On the face of it, it gives the impression of ending up vindicating Christian conservatism and nature romanticism; justifying cowardly people's flight from the real world. Very strange. That cannot be the final message, surely!<br/><br/>Consequently one must conclude that Shyamalan has plenty of artistic intentions and ambitions, but he keeps so tight a lid on them that they end up having hardly any effect - it was really the same with Signs. In other words, he is too careful. He wants to say something progressive and radical, but can't solidify the message well enough to produce a well-rounded piece of meaningful movie-making. That's sad.<br/><br/>Of course, I might be wrong. Maybe there'll be an extended version later which makes a lot more sense. This theatrical version I can only rate 6 out of 10, because despite other virtues it just does not make sense on a symbolical level (the level on which the movie is obviously meant to be primarily understood). But, maybe it's one of those movies that one has to think about for a long time and watch several times before one ""gets it"".<br/><br/>I'd like to mention the acting as well. Much of the movie was delightful to watch because many performances are extremely good. It is natural to single out Bryce Dallas Howard, who shines through as an intelligent, mature and sensitive actress who will certainly be among tomorrow's greatest Hollywood talents."

","I never comment here on films but the amount of bad flack this one has received prompted me to throw in my two cents. Although I'm not articulate enough to do it justice, I will just say this movie is brilliant. <br/><br/>Flimsy premise? Yes. Less than one dimensional characters? Maybe. Absurd plot? Definitely--but I can't but help think these were all part of the grand design. It's an amazingly simple yarn about a purposefully simple people. Yeah it requires a sensibility for subtlety and some patience for slow pacing, but that's because of its old school fantastical nature. Sure there a lot of human-style secrets and guises but isn't that what the very best fairy tales are all about? And that's what this is--a really beautifully written fairy tale with some nice bite. <br/><br/>The people and critics who saw this film and hated it were simply expecting more of the obvious gore fest, with more horror, something more like the ""Sixth Sense"". In a way, I owe them thanks for spreading such bad press around, I went into the film forcing myself to have an open mind, and was therefore really able to suspend my disbelief in the way Shyamalan intended.<br/><br/>I'm just sorry M.

From start to finish you are kept at your toes thinking about these creatures. What are they and what can they do. Talking about a truce makes it more intriguing because it gives these ""creatures"" a shape of thought and reasoning. I myself was wondering if these creatures were deformed men or were some sort of ""Morlocks"" like in The Time Machine.<br/><br/>Then the story turns when Edward Walker (William Hurt) confesses to his daughter that there are no creatures and that it was all the work of the elders. Again there is a hole left in the story were he tells her that he's based his creature story on rumors about these woods. These rumors were proved by the appearance of the creature in the woods that attacked Ivy. Then after that we were introduced to the truth after a thrilling confusion of whether there are creatures or not!!<br/><br/>Slow paced story that keeps you on your guard through out.

","Let's get this straight right away: 'The Village' is, by far, Night's best film. Simply because he has definitely and ultimately turned into a master story-teller that introduces characters in a genius way, using them for a very pertinent social commentary to the times we live in.<br/><br/>'The Village' has been critically destroyed by the unreasonable way it manipulates the spectator, by the shameless intentions of surprising just for the shock element. I saw, however, another film. I saw pure mastery in Lucius stab, a beautiful and unsettling story, a symbolic allegory for the U.S., filmed in such a subtle and classic way. I heard a soundtrack with a genuine soul. It seems to me a perfect film, one that raises immortal questions about religion, fear and ignorance  something unheard of in quite a while from Hollywood (apparently we still can believe in the dream factory).<br/><br/>It's hard to talk about a film that deserves a respectful silence, but also a discrete recommendation to our friends.<br/><br/>See to believe and understand."

","Leaving aside the pro-atheist side issues the film raises such as the nature of religion, and the control of the masses through fear, I found it to be another quality piece of story telling from Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard's powerhouse performance really stood out, which was just as well, since the film hangs upon her performance.<br/><br/>There's a few loose ends in the film, which struck me as a bit strange given what a craftsmanlike writer Shyamalan is. As a writer you always tie up your loose ends. Nothing should ever be placed in the narrative unless it serves a purpose. It's the golden rule. For instance Sigourney Weaver's character who keeps getting rejected in the film whenever she looks with puppy dog eyes to the object of her affection. Where's the pay off? How does the tension resolve? It doesn't. So, why put it in, in the 1st place? Was it just to flesh out her character? Maybe this is all part of the enigma that is Shyamalan. <br/><br/>I especially liked the porch scene. The dialogue is very powerful. The only time in the film where Pheonix out talks Howard. Up to that point she gets all the best lines.<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>There are flaws certainly in the film. Noah's final act. (I deliberately remain ambiguous for those who haven't seen it) Could Noah really have pulled off such an accomplished Houdini act, and then dressed himself given his level of inadequacy? Or kept silent throughout the duration of the pursuit, given that he spends all of the 1st part of the film laughing manically to himself every few seconds? One laugh and the game would have been over. It's just a small observation. I don't mean to detract from the film because I really enjoyed it, but still something I found difficult to overlook.<br/><br/>8/10"
"SHaZzMinDeR","Null","0","0","24 September 2004"," Confusing
","The Village, are two words that did nothing but conjure up bad press. So i decided to check it out for myself to see what was so 'bad' about it. So, with two mates i got myself down to a cinema screen and sat back ready to view the film with an open mind. No really, i did.<br/><br/>My verdict- it isn't THAT bad. It has its fair share of flaws but the film itself isn't worth the negativity it's getting. The character IVY, was excellent. She was the main reason why i was compelled to watch the whole film. Along with the 'simple' guy. Phoenix was nothing special. Sigourney- lets not go there. (what was she doing?). <br/><br/>*SPOILERS SPOILERS and then some more SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The first emotion this film managed to evoke from me was.. laughter. When Ivys sister blurts out her undying love for Lucius, from which she gets a response she doesn't want to hear, the scene cuts to her hysterically crying in her mum/relatives arms. Everybody in the theatre was laughing. I couldn't help thinking- was that supposed to make us laugh? Because if it wasn't, then Night mate, what you doing?<br/><br/>Lines i couldn't bear to hear- ""those we do not speak of"" ""the bad colour"" ""the good colour"" WHAT?! Just as the film was gaining some kind of credibility, in my eyes, someone uttered those infantile words and that ounce of credibility was sent crashing down. To me, them lines are just a big massive NO. NO NO NO. Maybe it's just me, but that was a fatal error in the script.<br/><br/>The actual 'monsters' lurking in the woods- now aren't they something to talk about! <br/><br/>The first glimpse we catch of the 'scary' monster, is when Lucius is hiding from it, and it's walking up to the door of a house. IT wears a hooded robe of the 'bad colour' *oOooO scaaary*, and has the basic stature of an over-sized man. The fact that the monsters shape is similar to that of a human, immediately takes off scare-factor points for me. M.Night, son- NO. IT also has porcupine/hedgehog-like spikes protruding from the hunch of its back. WHAT?! is that meant to be some kind of weapon? Does it 360 at the speed of light and gauge your eyes out with them? does it use them as a support to lie on? Or maybe IT uses them to carry its child with??!! All they do is make it resemble a certain character out of an old series called Dinsoaurs, in which a rubber dinosaur family enact a Simpson-like life, and that ain't horror, i can tell you. Anyone agree with me on that one? I really struggle to understand the point of them. If they were put there for 'scare-factor points', then once again- M.Night, son- NO NO.<br/><br/>Further on, Night blindly insists on showing us the face and all, of 'those we do not speak of'. When Ivy's father invites Ivy to go into 'the shed we must not go into' *give me strength!*, we get a full view of IT, and at that point, i felt kind of empty. Why?- because that was the last straw i was ever so faithfully clutching onto, for Night. I gave Night a chance, and then some, to prove them haters wrong but he'd pushed it too far with that little stunt. ITs face was pig/dog/bear-like. WHAT??!! so now we have a pig/dog/bear faced thing, with hedgehog/porcupine-like spikes sticking out its back, and long fingers with fungus filled claws on it? The mind boggles on how anyone with an I.Q above that of half a hollowed out peanut, would find THAT scary. <br/><br/>Here's a suggestion Night- Don't SHOW US it. I strongly believe, that if we hadn't been given us a full frontal of the monster, or any kind of glimpse, in fact, The Village would have been much much better. And i've got quite a few people that agree with me on that one. The imagination is a powerful thing Night. Yet, you insisted on ignoring that fact and persisted on ruining, what could have been, a half decent film. Tu tut.<br/><br/>Despite my passionate deep-rooted hate towards the mutated monsters, there were parts where i did feel my heart beat. When Ivy's blindly going it alone in the woods (excuse the pun), and IT charges at her- as much as my cynical side was screaming at the top its worn-out lungs that it wasn't scary in the slightest, that scene did reignite the Night spark, however temporary it may have been. Ivys clever thinking of standing stock-still on the rim of the ditch she once fell in, ready to move out the way once IT was in close proximity from charging at her, was genius (although, how that open hole- from Ivys fall- managed to re-seal itself for the demise of 'simple' guy A.K.A IT, remains a mystery). <br/><br/>There were quite a few scenes that made you jump. I actually kind of bruised my arm on the armrest of my chair, as a result of one of my 'jumps'. Can't help but laugh. Those 'jumps' were just that though- jumps, without substance, serving no purpose but in the end-result, and failing to add to the film in any kind of way. <br/><br/>The central theme- of Ivy and Lucius's love for one another, i found to be potentially brilliant. The actress playing Ivy was excellent. The 'love' between the two itself wasn't all that, but it's how it was expressed that made it compelling. Ivy reaching out for him (literally) in times of need, was touching. In the scene where Ivys standing on the front porch refusing to hide in the cellar, along with the rest of her family, because she's adamant that Lucius will grab her hand and take safety with her, is one that stayed in my mind. This was probably down to the way it was filmed- the uplifting music, the sense of danger: Lucius takes her hand a split second before the monster does, the dash to safety holding hands, the confirmation of Lucius's feelings towards her.<br/><br/>Another: when Ivy finds out about Lucius's condition through the mouth of an extra, and in disbelief, marches through an open field with her hand reaching out, in the hope that Lucius would take hold- brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall, The Village gets a 6.5/10 from me. Great idea Night, but think a lot harder before you put ideas to screen."

It serves to tell another story where there are monsters indeed, but they don't hide in the woods. Shyamalan is not another Spielberg. More another Dreyer. The cast is good and Newton Howard's score a big asset. I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for it, because without it the film were only half as memorable as it is.

Hey,when its a MNS flick we get a movie thats radically different -one that has a classy touch, and at the same time not losing its mainstream hype. The performance by Ivy played by Bryce Howard, and Adrien Brody as Noah were powerful. Weaver and Hurt could have shown more heart though, and seemed pretty flat. Those who have read Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand may see a parallel, in the way the village has isolated itself from the world and is trying to lead an innocent lifestyle. Point:Script might not be perfect,but the camera work and suspense make it worth investing a night to watch it.

","What a surprise!.<br/><br/>After watching the awful Signs movie I told myself I would never go to watch any other Shyamalan movies. It was a pity because I thought Shyamalan was very talented but movies went more and more bad since The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>So, when The Village started in USA I read the bad critics from everyone and I supposed it was really a bad movie... just what I was thinking.... no surprises.<br/><br/>BUT!, the story sounded so good I couldn't resist. This Friday the movie started in Spain (amazing translation for the movie title...., ""El Bosque"" (which means ""The Forest"")) and two days later, there I was.... prepared for a really poor movie...<br/><br/>...but this is the best crafted movie by Shyamalan. From the technical perspective, camera use, photography, music, everything is absolutely perfect. The slow motion of the movie is something I really appreciate in this times of mindless-fast-pace-stupid-movies... so for the first 15 minutes I was just amazed with the photography, music, and the almost fairytale mood of the movie.<br/><br/>Then it goes better and better, as everyone realizes the truth behind the village. I think the important part is not the typical signature final surprise of the movie (every Shyamalan movie has a final trick). In this case the real chilling comes much sooner the end of the movie.<br/><br/>To get the real beauty of this film you have to dig deep in the story. Lots of similar things are happening just in your world today so it's amazing how MNS ""translated"" the essence of contemporary problems (specially in the USA and their current politicians) to a fairy tale kind of story.<br/><br/>I also like the almost independent European style of the film... the way every scene has been shot.<br/><br/>The bad point is the advertising campaign in Spain.... in the trailer it seems you're going to see a really scary terror movie. Of course this was not the intention of the director, but the only rule of distributors is to earn more and more money, and everything is valid for them. That means lots of disappointed people at the end of the movie...<br/><br/>Happily (for me), the movie was not what I was expecting, it's much more beautiful!!!!!!!.<br/><br/>Well done Mr. Shyamalan.

","It's hard to know what genre ""The Village"" would fall into. The previews I've seen are incredibly misleading giving the impression of a psychological horror rather than a blood and gore slasher movie. As it turns out, ""The Village"" is neither. I like M.Night Shyamalan's films usually. ""The sixth sense"" was a classic and ""Signs"" was pretty good (wasn't keen on ""Unbreakable"" though) but for me, ""The Village"" had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The dialogue seemed sparse and William Hurt's character in particular spoke so slowly at times that I wanted to shake him. Whilst the cinematography was good and the music score was affective in creating an atmosphere this was not enough to save this film for me. I jumped just once during the entire movie and that was only because the music suddenly came on so loud that it almost blew me out of my seat! I really disliked this film and felt no bond or empathy towards any of the characters. I find it hard to understand the people who say that the film worked for them just because the music score was good or the camera shots were interesting. surely the fundamental reason for going to the cinema is to be entertained? Unfortunately, ""The Village"" left me feeling the complete opposite."

","Well firstly I'd like to comment on all the posting thus far: everyone seems to be downing The Village - rating it as the worst. That it was boring, to long to unfold - not scary enough. BLAH! All this from so called 'film students'. You think they would have picked up by now that this is Shayamalan's directing style, and was also the success behind Hitcock's long drawn out movies. If you are not drawn to that type of film, don't see a Shayamalan film because, surly, you know what to expect from him by now!<br/><br/>However, my friend and I were guessing his next one will be about Vampires in the cinema lobby..it does seem he has a particular 'genre' he is drawn to. But with name like his? Why wouldn't you capatalise on it!<br/><br/>However, despite that said, The Village put my faith back in MNS. I was heart broken with Unbreakable and Signs didn't impress me. But The Village, for me, says 'his back'. I thought the acting was outstanding and the twists super! :P. It was just the right pace too and revealed enough to keep you guessing but always in the dark. Something new was around every corner!<br/><br/>I really admire the MNS respects his audience's intelligence. Basil was hardly anywhere to be seen (for those of you who don't understand, Basil is short for Basil Exposition [from Austin powers] it means, a segment is put into the film to 'explain' everything). MNS believes audience's are smart enough to work the story out themselves but another aspect is by not giving away all the answers you can go back a second time and discover more!<br/><br/>The dialog was very moving, especially from the Porch scene. MNS has really crafted a beautiful film - I defiantly recommend it. I walked in dreading but came out floating. I think people who criticise so harshly, as others on here have done, should wait till they have done a FEATURE FILM themselves - I can't wait, they're sure to be perfect.<br/><br/>Anthony"

Don't get me wrong, I think that this is a great film and worth watching, but I think that Shyamalan can do better. The twist was the best part of the whole movie. The plot was good but the movie was kind of slow. Not as much as suspense as other of his films. Also, not as much Joaquin Phoenix as I thought there would be.

I had watched this movie in the USA prior to it's early release before the UK and I then watched again in the UK a few weeks afterwards. The movie was appreciated by the American audience and so it reached number 1 for 2-3 weeks. In the UK the audience was more concerned with small things in the movie leaving the viewers bedazzled with the plot of the movie asking questions such as what, why, who and when!

","So you're not familiar with Shyamalan's work and you want to see a straightforward fright-a-minute horror movie, as the trailer and advertisements would have you believe. Or, on the other hand, you are a fan who has watched all his previous movies to death and are so familiar with potential twists that you've hatched your own plot ideas before actually watching The Village. In both of these cases, I would not be surprised if you walk out unimpressed. Even disappointed.<br/><br/>I, however, wasn't. We've come to expect so much of Shyamalan over the past few years that we expect him to wow us at every turn. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs... what a trend, and a fantastic one at that. Many people are now using the word ""predictable"", and it may be so. I figured out the first twist of the hoax creatures from just the ads. The fact is: would we have guessed it if The Village was released first? Before Haley Joel Osment saw dead people, before Bruce Willis had super-human powers and before yet another Culkin kid graced our screens as a pre-pubescent whose intelligence exceeds Mel Gibson's?<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is dedicated to introducing characters. Ivy (Howard) and Lucius (Phoenix) make a sweet couple, but I feel that the latter wasn't used to his full potential; perhaps it's just the Joaquin fangirl in me shining through again. Adrien Brody's performance is absolutely superb -- he is truly the star of this show -- and Noah kept me guessing (did he know about the fakes? etc) throughout. Sigourney Weaver could also have been used a little more, and William Hurt a little less. I am plainly and simply not a fan of the man's voice. He should be doing children's storybook tapes.<br/><br/>The latter half revolves around Ivy's trek and, of course, many unexpected revelations. I am not going to dwell on these too much. It's obvious I adored every minute. And the ending? No closure at all, and that's what I love about it. I spent most of the drive home wondering what would become of Lucius, Ivy and their neighbors. What I loved about this movie is that it's possible, plausible and a breeding ground for oh so much paranoia. But, most of all, it cemented my belief that M. Night Shyamalan is the most talented writer and director of his -- and our -- generation."

Like his others, I thought the best part of this movie was how well the plot changed, keeping it fairly unpredictable. Just when you think you've got it figured out, he throws in a curve, right up to the very end. And like Signs, you'll see a few brief shots of the monsters (""the things of which we don't speak""), but mostly there's just a lot of really good suspense and what I thought were well done characters.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say good casting, unpredictable, and an interesting setting."

","The residents of a village refuse from crossing the woods in to other towns because of the fear of the ones 'that are not to be spoken of'. The story takes us from a young resident defying the orders of the village head, to the absorbing climax where Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) a blind girl from the village has to cross the woods on her own!<br/><br/>Night Shyamalan demonstrates what a fantastic script can do, even without a well-known star-cast. The great direction and some very good performances are overshadowed by the brilliant story line.<br/><br/>Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) gives a good performance while the others are reasonably good. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius Hunt) didn't quite look a lad in the 20's and is the only miscast.<br/><br/>The use of camera angles become more important in a thriller/suspense and the movie does justice to the script. The intelligent use of the camera angles give you the 'jerks' where you pull yourself back in your seat or hold you neighbors hand, though personally I would have liked more of these moments.<br/><br/>The background score goes along the script but at no time does it play a 'hero' during the movie. I have felt Shyamalan's earlier movies a little slow (Signs was a big disappointment because of it's pace and too little for the script to offer  offered again a little too late) but this one keeps you intrigued right through.<br/><br/>And this is a slight departure from his earlier movies because the twist in this tale not only deceives you to believe something else but also sets you thinking.. (Thinking what?

","The fact that Sigourney Weaver had nightmares for two weeks after she read the script of this movie shocked me because it simply wasn't that kind of movie. It wasn't made to leave you having nightmares or lying in bed awake for the next two weeks. The bits that were meant two be scary were there just to give you an instant shock. What this movie was obviously trying to achieve was leaving you thinking about that little parts and whether or not they added up to the storyline. The storyline itself was stunning and original. M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent, brilliant and original writer and director and the fact that he has cameos in all his movies is another original thing that he does which I think is very clever. He's not at all a bad actor either. The best part about him being in the movie is that he can do it exactly how he wants which no actor could do. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was perfect and the trivia that the role was written for him was something I could believe. Sigourney Weaver nothing special from her, didn't stand out. Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent in her blind woman's role although it was quite hard to catch on to the fact she was blind at the start. William Hurt was without a doubt the second best performance in this film by a mile but the stand out for me was Adrien Brody playing the retard.

","The main reason I didn't like this movie was that the director had so much potential for a truly unique masterpiece of horror...a secluded village, scary creatures, characters with secrets (we already know the one thing Night is gifted at--building suspense), and he didn't utilize any of it. Instead, he tries half-heartedly to make the movie into a self-thought piece on building a utopia. And if a story about a group of people trying to build an equal society by controlling information and inducing fear sounds familiar, it is because it is. Read a history book on the USSR or the transcendentalist communities in the US. <br/><br/>I didn't like the movie because I feel Night has so much talent, and as much as I don't want to label him as a 'one-hit-wonder'...I feel like this guy only had one good story up his sleeve. <br/><br/>Also, who cares about the time surprise? You want to know what a good surprise ending is...thinking a character is alive the whole movie and you find out he is dead. The time surprise did absolutely nothing for the movie, and wasn't even necessary. Night needs to just use his talents to create something original again. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I will probably be seeing his next movie again in hopes that he will change. I got hope for the man."
"fabiogaucho","Null","0","0","18 September 2004"," This film is about something, but you can't notice it
","* MAJOR SPOILERS * <br/><br/>Death is a part of life, of course, and you can't go on living without accepting it. But dying violently, or even suffering violence from another human being without dying, can be beyond frustration to many people. It may lead you to thinking that the whole universe is wrong. Many stories deal with people who suffer that and live life seeking justice or vengeance.<br/><br/>This film is the story of a group of people who had a very peculiar answer to what can be the ultimate frustration  death being inflicted upon a beloved one not by a virus, cancer cells or lightening, but by people. What do they do? They create a small world where violence never enters because they carefully select what human inventions can go in  family, marriage, work, love, ethics, God  and which cannot enter  such as money and competition. The world they create is a 19th century (change very little and you can actually place it in the 17th century) 'village' not only technologically very primitive, but also a very simple society (certainly more simple than the real 19th century America). They know where they are, but their descendants don't. The village is a compassionate, loving world, because they decided to become such people when they created it, while their descendants don't know another way to be.<br/><br/>Throughout the film what strikes you is the absolute absence of aggressive instincts in people's minds and how people are extremely united and undivided by shutting themselves from the outside world. One day, however, violence enters their lives by a murder attempt committed by the 'village idiot'. That incident makes them rethink the whole enterprise and even put it all in jeopardy in an attempt to save the victim of the attack, who is dying (in order to be true to their project, they must stand that risk). Victim saved, they decide the plan is still worth it. More than ever, actually.<br/><br/>That is basically the 'theme' of the film. In itself, it is incredibly promising, and very relevant. Some friends of mine who saw it thought of the sociological problem of solidarity, while I thought of the discussion about 'evil in man's heart' from William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. The movie, however, does not seek to become something to think about, and the premise is not very exploited. Why? Because everything is played like a thriller with a twisted ending. The fact that you only learn what is going on in the last ten minutes makes everything shallow. Someone here said that the movie is made like a twilight zone episode. That is VERY precise,specially if you have the first series in mind (think of the pilot episode, and you get something very close). Did you notice how practically NONE of the reviewers of this film commented on the theme? That is because the way the script is made just takes your entire attention away from it.It is a very rich idea that was transformed in easy scares and silly mysteries. I have a feeling this movie will be forgotten very soon. <br/><br/>The director probably think he discovered something brilliant when he did 'The Sixth Sense', an idea that can make a lot of money and also get people's respect. So he just decided to do it again and again. But this movie has nothing like Haley Joel Osmond's landmark performance to make it work like a very good drama mixed with suspense. The main character's are just so-so. But nothing nearly as bad as 'Signs', don't worry.<br/><br/>Since I always try to say something good, let me note that Hurt is excellent, as is Bryce Dallas Howard. The photography also stands out."

","SPOILER ALERT!!! TWIST REVEALING!!!<br/><br/>I think this movie was well put together despite the claims of others. The acting was sound if not perfect but Bryce Dallas Howard was brilliant. Brody was not The Pianist but still knew his role, Phoenix underacted slightly but I can't help feeling this was original intention. Plain, simple, open man plain, simple, open acting.<br/><br/>The direction was perceptive and steady, the cinematography inspiring. MNS knew his mood and his characters: knowledge that con only come from being writer and director. He did however have the subtlety of a gay parade. Once again this seemed intentional as his other films eg. Unbreakable and Signs have retained subtlety. Basic living, basic angles.<br/><br/>Those who criticize the script need to get a life! MNS equals far fetched: deal with it! Sure there are plot holes but some people on the message boards criticize too readily without thinking it through. MNS covered most of his bases. The scene when Ivy hobbled around hand outstretched searching for the unconscious Lucius was brilliant. The twist was clever and two fold. MNS let you see the first half before the climax but kept the second half nestled way for the very end. CLEVER We all felt we had him beat we could all see that it was a hoax but the whole modern thing was concealed yet slowly, steadily revealed. DOUBLE CLEVER! It had us all kicking ourselves for not noticing! TRIPE CLEVER! The concept was fantastic and all possible clichés avoided. The last line left the Village's future open.

Even Sigourney Weaver seemed to be laying it on a bit too thick. The so-called twists were unbelievable and contrived. How could this whole village of throw-backs be so dense as to imagine a whole tribe of creatures really existed? How could the village not have been already discovered by the Enquirer? Are there no satellite pictures? No private planes flying about? Members of the audience I watched with snickered when blind Ivy blundered her way into the 21st century. The hushed dialog was painful to understand, the music irritating. I'm amazed that so many people are duped into thinking this is a good movie. It's as bad as Signs, even more tedious. M.

","With a great story idea (MONSTERS IN THE WOODS, VILLAGERS DARE NOT GO IN!), a promising central character, (SHE'S BLIND!), and actors such as Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver, it would take a special kind of director to screw it up. Step forward M Night Shyamalan, who amazingly enough, has made a film that has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and put his audience to sleep into the bargain. But how can this be? Admittedly, it still seems hard to believe. Shyamalan is a competent director, who, after the success of The Sixth Sense, had Hollywood, if not at his feet, certainly in that general area . His follow up 'Unbreakable' was a good effort. But his next film 'Signs' was distinctly average and now with 'The Village' his golden touch has certainly worn off. So what is The Village about? The story goes like this, in 'the village', a collection of people all live together with a simple rule, this being to never go into the woods that surround them. For in the woods are 'those we do not speak of', monsters who are attracted by the colour red, hence that colour being covered up in the village whenever it may appear. However one man, Lucius, wants to walk through the woods to get medical supplies. However when he is injured, it is up to his blind fiancé to step into the unknown and risk the wrath of the monsters. Where The Village fails is its cardinal sin that it commits. That is being boring to the viewer. The pace of the film crawls at an unbearably slow count, with no end in sight. This would be acceptable if there was a twist in its plot to compensate for your two hours of seat twitching, but its mild conclusion leaves you with one word on your lips, and it isn't 'classic', it's REFUND! Joaquin Phoenix, an excellent actor, is wasted in the role of Lucius, a man of mercifully few words. Sigourney Weaver is virtually ignored in her role as Alice, and Adrian Brody, as the simple minded Noah, plays perhaps the singly most annoying character EVER! It is left to Bryce Dallas Howard, as the brave blind girl Ivy, to turn in a performance of distinction. But Shyamalan, as director, fails to deliver any real suspense, with his monstrous woods being, well, a walk in the park to the bored viewer. The Village could have been a wonderful film, but it wasn't, and maybe all the critics who thought it was couldn't see this particular wood, for the trees"

","Sitting at home, watching a trailer for the ""Village"" - i saw what seemed to be a cool horror film. I sensed atmosphere, i sensed suspense, i sensed fear, i sensed horror....I SENSED WRONG! You must question though from the same guy that bought you the fantastic ""The 6th Sense""- and seeing the trailer you'd really expect it to be on par with it- but the 6th sense does RINGS around ""The Village"".<br/><br/>There's been a deep absence of horror in cinema recently, after the whole slasher moment (1995-2000)- i noticed a calm in all forms of horror...Oh and was i hungry for more horror. I decided to go check out the village and i cant say too much besides what a GREAT disappointment. The trailer is the most misleading thing you will lay your eyes upon. The story consists of a village in the woods that is surrounded by the myth of creatures that lurk in the woods- its simple...Don't cross their neck of the woods- and they wont cross yours. It sounds like it has premise to be something scary.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is FAMOUS for his plot twists and turns, but oh boy was someone trying a little TOO hard here. There's trying and trying too hard! He did that right here. Although ""The Village"" had a decent cast and some very good acting, you will find yourself falling asleep in no time. If you love horror and suspense- this is NOT your film. The film is more or less a soppy love story between the villages hero and a blind girl. It was so funny how about half way through the film people were getting really impatient with the film.<br/><br/>I wont say ""The Village"" was a BAD film because it wasn't. It just wasn't what it was made out to be and it WILL disappoint many people. The cinematography is truly beautiful, the acting is fine, actors are good- but it loses points for being boring, slow paced and when it came to ""revealing"" the monsters that was by far hilarious. All in all ""The Village"" is a film that lies to its audience- read more below.<br/><br/>ACTORS: The actors are good. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is a GREAT actress, Joaquin Phoenix played his part well. There were a few other famous faces- including Sigourney Weaver who in my opinion didn't match her role. The acting was fine in general and that wasn't the problem with the film.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Pretty poor. This film tries to rely on a ""twist"" to be its saving grace, but its terrible how it just goes from one ""twist"" to another, they go way too far with all these twists and turns, in the end it feels like a rushed confused film. You can see the whole quality of the film really dies down in the last 30 minutes. More mystery, more suspense would have been great, less talk and pointless nonsense such as the ""bad color"" etc.<br/><br/>CINEMA: Cinematography was in general great. The whole village looked fantastic, people were dressed in period clothing. Long sweeping grass, scary woods- i cant deny the good job on the cinematography, its an attractive film thats for sure.<br/><br/>HORROR: A REAL lack luster here ladies and gentlemen. As i said this is more like a romantic film than a horror film. There is ONE scene which will give you a little bit of a jump and thats about it, for the other 90 minutes expect to be twitching while getting impatient and drifting off to sleep when you finally have had enough.<br/><br/>MUSIC: The music in the film was pretty good. Atmospheric in parts, well timed. I cant really complain about the music.<br/><br/>OVERALL: ""The Village"" is something you REALLY can not judge from its cover. Although everything about it spells out ""HORROR FILM""- it could never be so wrong. I find the Village to make a great Romance film, a deep drama maybe- but in no way shape or form is this a horror film, it is not scary at all- horror fans will be totally disappointed. A misleading trailer will really rake in some good dough- but expect it to rake in some bad reviews and a loss of respect to M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>** / ***** (2 out of 5 stars)"

I would have to agree, although his latest project, ""The Village"" somehow doesn't quite live up to the expectations of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1800's, it tells the story of a secluded village surrounded by dense forest. It is what lives within these boarders which the villagers fear, and what ultimately brings the two main characters of Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Luscious (Joanquin Pheonix) together.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, there are the expected jumps and screams, and the acting is beautifully constructed, in particular Bryce Dallas Howard, who I feel rightly deserves an Oscar nomination. However it is the ultimate twist which I feel is a let down!

Were we even made to care for these characters? I certainly didn't. Although the performances were all decent enough, I cannot name a single character that held any sort of charisma what so ever.

","The big problem of M. Night Shyamalan movies is that he created this twist ending trademark. If by all means any movie that spots ""surprise ending"" will end up spoiling it since everyone in the audience is going to be expecting something, the game enters an endless and stupid fight of egos. The director trying to show how smart he is pulling up surprises, and the audience anticipating anyhow. Thus most movie reviews of THE VILLAGE speak about the not so surprising ending, the disappointing surprise, etc. Well if the movie was JUST the surprise, it would, certainly, be a waste with a better place as a Twilight Show chapter. But THE VILLAGE is much more than a twist ending. If you enter the theater understanding you are probably not going to be surprised and let the burden of surprise out of the movie, then you have a very good suspenseful, and enjoyable, drama with a few minor scares. One played wonderfully by the cast (except maybe Brody, going over the top), and with a very subtly direction by Shyamalan. If there is a future for this director, he should forget the success of the SIXTH SENSE and try to focus into storytelling, something he does better than four fifths of today's directors."

Yes, I can obviously see the similar Hitchcock styling, but I believe Shyamalan is the only one to pull it off. Because of the great success of ""The Sixth Sense,"" this director has been pigeon-holed and no one wants to see him make anything else because they all expect the same type of movie. I am excited that a director in today's market can venture from his/her safe comfort zone. If for nothing more, see this film for the thought provoking characters, the excellent acting, and the haunting cinematography."

","""The Village"", while boasting an interesting, if frivolous, premise, is quite simply a paramount misfire in entertainment, film-making, and horror. If you're going into this film looking for signature ""Sixth Sense"" Shyamalan: a simple, creepy, inspirational work of horror and suspense, or if you're going into this film for any entertainment whatsoever, you will be tremendously disappointed with this film. ""The Village"", even with its interesting plot of ""creatures in the woods"" somehow manages to bore its audience substantially more than scare, to yawn with apathy more than shriek with intensity, and I found myself frequently dosing off into another dimension, growing increasingly dissatisfied and disconnected to everything that was happening with this story. The fact is, there's not too much here to follow or even care about. Village people; Boundaries from the outside world; Creatures frightening village; Blind girl getting medicine... a complete bore. Admittedly, the music, while practically never correlating with the film's situations, is effective and perhaps enchanting. Everything else in the film, however, fails to attract any interest after awhile. Wooden acting with cardboard dialogue (""We have always had a gentle understanding with the creatures that live in the woods""). Most of the time, instead of getting frightened by the creatures we are bored to tears by the tedium of the screenplay, which is dull and lifeless. We frequently wait for something important, something exciting to occur, and by the time we are treated with ""the surprise ending"", our interest has already diminished, and we can only sigh and say, ""Who cares?"" A ""surprise"" simply does not work when the interest of the audience has completely faded. Bottom line, ""The Village"" is a tedious, disappointing misfire which contained a promising premise, yet failed to deliver any note of exhilaration or anxiety in its theme of horror. Anxiety? I was only anxious for the ending to arrive. *1/2 out of ****"

","**Since I'm telling you not to see it, I'm trusting you'll listen to me, so it doesn't matter that I'm gonna give away some of the movie.**<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>This, by far, was the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. I don't know how all these people can like the movie! <br/><br/>I am not kidding when I say this movie was the worst one ever. There have certainly been movies I have gone to and not liked, but now is the first time I have EVER declared that a movie is the worst of all time. I just couldn't believe the genius who brought us ""The Sixth Sense"" gave us this piece of trash. There's so many problems with this movie, I've decided to just make a nice list for time's sake.<br/><br/>1-No one talks! This was almost as bad as Space Oddyssey. There were so many scenes in which there was either 2 people talking for 5 minutes or no one talking at all. I need something to keep me awake at the theatre! I can close my eyes, but not my ears.<br/><br/>2-The previews scared me more than the movie. When I saw the previews, I thought, ""Man, this looks like one of those movies that just plain freaks you out!"" It wasn't. The only times I ever got scared was during one of the numerous surprise shots, were all of a sudden something appears on screen, or something moves, etc. The rest of the movie was too stupid to be scary.<br/><br/>3-I couldn't stop laughing! There's one scene where the village idiot puts on the porcupine costume and wanders into the woods. The girl, thinking it's a monster, kills it. Word spreads to the village, and a boy rushes into a room. ""She found a monster and killed it."" The boy's parents, knowing he took the costume, start bawling. I was laughing so hard!<br/><br/>4-The blind girl should have gotten written out of the script: She can run faster than any boy in town! She can dodge her way between buildings, and notice when walls are in front of her! She's.......BLIND! 'Nuff said about that. Also, I kept forgetting who was blind. I'd think, ""the village idiot can't see that-he's blind!"" But no! Only she was blind. So confusing! And, the blind girl manages to find her way through dense woods to a city and back. By herself. Who thinks of this nonsense?<br/><br/>5-The guy lives! A man gets stabbed repeatedly in the chest and stomach with a butcher knife, stays stable for well over 3 days, and then survives with medicine. WTF is that? You can't live for 3 days with no medicine after being stabbed in the stomach and chest over and over!<br/><br/>6-There's ""Those we shall not speak of"", ""The woods we shall not speak of"", and ""The color we shall not speak of"". Then, the blind girl's dad leads her to a shed. ""Do you know where we are?"" he asks. I almost threw my popcorn at the screen when she replied, ""The shed we shall not speak of."" Are these people crazy? At least there wasn't like ""The chandelier we shall not speak of"", or ""The branch on the tree in the front we shall not speak of"".<br/><br/>Now for the good parts of the movie:<br/><br/>1-Judy Greer was in it, and for some reason, she played a character of the same name she does in ""Arrested Development"".<br/><br/>2-I'll come back to this one."

","As a long-time fan of the director, I had planned on seeing this movie all along, but after a month of pre-premiere trailers, I was not very excited about it. Frankly, I'm not the kind of person who cares what was in the woods. I liked Sixth Sense, in fact that's where I first became a fan, but it was not because of the twist at the end. It wasn't even because of the creepy storyline. It was the writer/director/producer's ability to make a layered film with vibrant characters. I didn't like the kid because he could see dead people. I liked the kid because he made understand the frustration and isolation of someone in an intense situation. I was hit in the solar plexis by the excellent writing, and thrilled by the visual complexity of the film overall. The kid could have been a garbage collector for all I cared, but if Night was writing the garbage collector's story, I would be watching.<br/><br/>As his next two films came out, I began to see a problem developing. People were wasting two hours of their lives, barely watching the depth of his stories, in wild anticipation of figuring out the last 5 minutes. Sort of ""The Forrest Gump Guide to Film Watching"". Friends with whom I would later discuss the films only wanted to explain whether or not they had guessed the ending, and often couldn't recall details, or even large plot situations, from the rest of the film. Night's mystique was surpassing his story-telling.<br/><br/>So, this summer I went to the Village lacking my usual Night-fever, because the trailers led me to believe (as it apparently did millions of others) that it would be his most supernatural film yet. Wow. I was wrong. This film is one of the best films I think I have seen in years. I loved it. In my opinion, it is his best film yet. The trailers are very misleading, which is why I think many viewers and film critics were disappointed. They did not get the movie that they were led to believe they would see. Instead of monsters, they got mythology. Instead of horror, they got a love story. Instead of CGI, they got realism. Human nature, with all of our desires and dreams, terrors and disappointments. Choices that lead to happiness and sorrow. Finding out that we are the deadliest beast. Fantastic. You feel, in the end, that the Village is a real community, and Night does this...creates these layered human beings...with, at times, little more than 10-20 lines for the Villagers. But at the end of the film, I felt I knew every single person who lived there. I understood them. I loved them. I grieved for them, and celebrated with them. Come on, Night, you must have a map somewhere. Share with someone who understood what you were saying.<br/><br/>Fan or not, see the film. Go with no expectations. Pay attention for the whole two hours, and not just the last 5 minutes. And understand you will be seeing something that is rarely out there anymore. Originality."

","I'm only the third person posting so far to point out that the boom mic was prominent in this movie. It was in well over half the scenes. There were two bobbing around in one shot, and in the forest (whoops, spoiler) the entire boom including the handle were in shot. I expected to see the operator at any time.<br/><br/>I saw the film in the little cinema in Keswick, and I supposed that there's a bad print going around. Now that I've got home and checked the web a bit, I see that there are not that many around. But shouldn't the public be warned. It certainly ruined the film for me. Who's responsible?<br/><br/>The film itself, beneath the mic... Well, it wasn't surprising, it wasn't well written - it was stilted. It had no passion, and the silliness of the plot was only matched by the laughably unscary others who shall not be named who wear cloaks in that colour that shall not be seen in this film that I wouldn't bother watching."
"Tbone42","6","0","0","13 September 2004"," What a waste of quite an interesting idea
","Sorry to say so, but this is - in my opinion - really a waste of an idea. And quite astonishingly so, with the director and writer being M. Night Shyamalan. Maybe his debut with ""The Sixth Sense"" spoiled my expectations. But that debut was just amazingly great, and the follow-ups can't seem to keep up with that initial excitement.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler ahead!<br/><br/>The idea to the story at first sounds quite promising. Monsters surrounding a probably 19th century village, forcing its population to stay where it is - the village in a clearance in the woods. However, the way it is performed is - quite frankly - a bit boring and silly. Showing one of the monsters (although blurry) really really spoiled an almost breath-taking moment. Mr. Shyamalan is known for that special final surprise at the end of the movie, which no one expects. But this movie is far to obvious. The two ""truths"" to be found are much to easy to detect before they are solved by the director. Knowing about the monsters and having a little bit of Hollywood-type imagination almost inevitably leads to correctly guessing at the final outcome. Trying to imitate Mr. Stephen King by having a guest appearance doesn't help the cause.<br/><br/>End of possible spoiler<br/><br/>This could have been much more enjoyable, I think. Too bad it wasn't."

","I wasn't too hopeful when I went in to see this film, having seen all of the critics pan it, and lots of people say that it was dull, boring, etc. Which is why it was an especially pleasant surprise for me that not only was this movie not dull, it was actually rather good.<br/><br/>Set in 19th century Pennsylvania, it's not a ""thrill-a-minute"" horror ride, but if you were expecting that... then you deserve what you get, since this film never claimed to be that. Instead you get a much more subtle horror film, which is scary because it builds and builds and builds. Like most other films by Shyamalan, there's more twists in here than a mountain road, and while some of them are rather predictable, the ones that aren't still manage to throw the story in unexpected directions.<br/><br/>For those that are critical of this film for being ""dull"", might I suggest that a movie like ""Catwoman"" might be more to your taste? For the rest of us though, who crave intelligently crafted films like this that don't treat the audience like imbeciles, ""The Village"" is a winner."

","True to form M Night Shyamalan has made another film with a great twist at the end. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and got satisfaction out of the suspense throughout. The plot moved along quite quickly and there were enough sub plots to keep viewers guessing. Bryce Dallas Howard was terrific as Ivy. She is a very talented actor and I was extremely impressed with her ability to capture the innocence and passion of a young woman 'of the period'. Adrien Brody was a scene stealer as always and Joaquin Phoenix plays the quiet, unassuming but very earnest young Lucius with commendability. The older generation of actors gave the story enough credibility that the ending, although a surprise, was believable. I would definitely recommend this movie especially if you liked the producers other efforts such as 'Sixth Sense' or 'Signs'."

","I really loved The 6th Sense. I can't remember anything about Unbreakable, so that one didn't make much of an impression I guess. I fell asleep when the aliens in Signs appeared to be, well, just that. So I can't say I'm a fan of Mr. Shyamalans general work, only of his first film. But the trailer of The Village looked really good! I love period films and I'm easily scared by unseen horrors that lurk in forests, so this one would surely entertain me! Think again...<br/><br/>***Major spoilers!***<br/><br/>The beginning was alright. Eerie howling coming from the woods scared the sh*t out of me and really seemed to set the tone for the rest of the film. But quite early in the film, when the monsters started to skin pets (and Sigourney Weaver tried to make everyone believe it was done by a coyote... sure, they pull the skin off neatly and leave the rest of the meat??), I became suspicious. Then I started to get annoyed by the villagers. They spoke in a silly, overly theatrical way, like they were acting in some Shakespearian wannabe play. Not convincing at all. And then there was the ""all people from the outside world are evil, don't go to the Towns"" thing. At this point, the villagers rapidly began to resemble a weird kind of sect, who obviously had something to hide and who tried to keep the outside world at a distance.<br/><br/>O, never mind those villagers, the monsters are still out there! What are they? What do they want? what do they look like? Tension builds and when the alarm bells rang and panic broke out when they came to the village, I was at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>At this point Mr. Shyamalan in his endless wisdom decides to take all the tension away by showing you the ""monster"": a monster walking like a man, covered with silly porcupine quills and wearing red CLOTHING??<br/><br/>Wait a minute... If I add this information to those suspicious acting, extremely conservative village elders who hate the outside world....<br/><br/>Damn, I guessed the TWIST already! <br/><br/>Never mind, Mr.Shyamalan must have thought, we'll just keep the ""plot"" going and sent the poor blind girl into the scary woods to get help. Blind girl stumbles along and encounters.... a porcupine MONSTER! O no! Hey, wait a minute. That's not scary. They're FAKE, remember!<br/><br/>Cue plot TWIST #2: girl gets rescued by a guy in a modern CAR.... OK, I must admit I didn't see that one coming, but I also just couldn't care anymore since I was laughing uncontrollably since the ""blind-girl-in-not-so-scary-wood-since-there-are-no monsters-and-she-knows-that"" part.<br/><br/>Let's wrap it up, said Mr.Shyamalan. Obviously deranged girl is left by side of road (??), guy goes away to ""sneak"" some medicine from a cupboard (was the other ranger BLIND or something?), goes back with a ladder and helps the weird girl in the outdated dress back into the wildlife reserve. No questions asked. End credits.<br/><br/>O, and the other ranger helpfully mentions the fact that no aircrafts are allowed to fly across the wildlife reserve. So THAT'S why this group of weirdo's haven't been detected for the past 40 years or so... But what about foresters? And how did they get all the materials to build their lovely little village inside that wildlife reserve in the first place?<br/><br/>Never mind gaping plot holes, at least this film has some of my trademark TWISTS. Right, Mr. Shyamalan?<br/><br/>To sum it up: film delivers until the first ""monster"" is shown, after which most people will be able to figure out TWIST #1 quite easily. And as for TWIST #2. Could we care less by that time?? <br/><br/>Boring, predictable and laughable after the first 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/>** out of *****"
"flip_the_cat","Null","0","0","13 September 2004"," A series of great films (spoilers)
","I think the reason why this movie is getting such harsh reviews is that the audience keeps comparing it to the twist and success of 'The Sixth Sense'. 'The Village', in my opinion, is the fourth great movie to be directed by a suspense/thriller mastermind.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense- Although lacking in depth, the topic about Cole and him coping with his gift is sturdy basework for a great plot. The word 'freak' being used symbolizes those who are different (and maybe more superior) to everyone else. Symbolism and is strong especially with the method in which the story is told. The twist is clever and gives a view of the parallels between the lives of the two characters, and doesn't contradict the movie itself.<br/><br/>Unbreakable- An excellent film, a step up from 'Sense'. A man who gives up his power and ability in an accident to be with the one he loves, and the man who believes that there is a paradox to life, that there is someone opposite to him. The main character at first seems weak and unaware but gains confidence and determination concerning the circumstances to come. The ending, honestly, got me by surprise. It gave Elijah Price the motive and logic for his search while summing up his character in one scene.<br/><br/>Signs- My favorite of them all, this movie has superior acting and drama while incorporating comedy, a smart blend. The movie centers around one family, and one purpose along with subplot of lost faith. The 'signs' referred to in this movie have twofold meaning, the crop circles warning the things to come, and the signs of the divine. The twist, and yes there is one is the fact that all things happen for a reason. Why do you think that the conversation between Graham and Merill about the 'coincidence' people and the 'reason' people reoccurs, right in the middle of the resolution?<br/><br/>The Village- Tricky to begin with, because something about the beginning screams 'out of place'. Slow dialogue and symbolism (the rocking chair representing a problem overcome) lead up to the creatures menace. The movie itself plays to the ideals and aspirations of human nature: love-determination, truth-hate, unfortunate circumstance-sanctuary. The twist fits exactly with the mood and the theme of the movie showing that people are people and their sins are the same, and the truth will always be known."

","A panoply of eccentric characters. A nexus of befuddling events. A 19 th Century hamlet living on borrowed time, encased in fragile borders courting disaster at every turn. A perfect vehicle for the infamous Shyamalan bandwagon to re-roll itself back into the limelight, with the fabled writer-producer-director's possibly best-accomplished project yet.<br/><br/>The Village takes place in a cordoned-off community deep in the woods somewhere, and defies spoilage-free critique. Its residents face a seldom spoken-of enemy fielding indefinable properties, and emanating from the bleak foliage all around them. While within the fortified village a lively decorum takes precedence over inevitable desperation, brewing sentiments hint at a boiling point just as compellingly unavoidable as the horrors lurking all around.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of The Blair Witch, Sleepy Hollow and The 13th Warrior in a few important, albeit not critical ways, The Village dishes out superb suspense with a colossal twist in its prickly tail. Devoid of redundancies such as computer graphics, Shyamalan's latest relies on red herrings and subtle innuendo rather than cleverer-than-thou hints and foreshadows, allowing its ample cast freedom of performance within certain limits. A few, like Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson, do ably enough but leave little to write about. Others thrive on the story, like excellent Joaquin Phoenix as suspecting introvert Lucius Hunt, William Hurt as Village elder and mentor Edward Walker, and Adrien Brody as the bumbling local idiot.<br/><br/>Stemming from its sadly short runtime, The Village hardly ever lingers, pausing briefly to touch upon loving exchanges between Lucius and intelligent observer Ivy Walker, done by Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter. Instead of spreading itself too thin, the movie brilliantly stays close to its core attraction, all the time teasing audiences with near-revelations and stretching everything till the very last minute, when the oddball conclusion become unavoidable.<br/><br/>There may be those decrying The Village's dearth of bombastic screen writing idealization and low-end production values (where they managed to bury $60 million remains to be found), but as a spooky creepy crawler big on brains it operates smoothly and with no major glitches at all. Make no mistake, while not strictly horror, The Village delivers tensions stressful enough to register with viewers like a spindly, electric headache coming out of nowhere, and its uniquely bewildering intimidation guarantees it an honorary perch among recent cinematic mind-benders.<br/><br/>Rating: * * * *"

","I saw this movie yesterday, and I was a littlebit afraid it would be as bad as written in most of the reviews on IMDb. (It isn't scary at all! The ending is very lame)... Now I know that people are very critical when reviewing a movie. But I think that the movie isn't that bad at all. Alltough, I can imaging why people give this movie a bad review: when the movies has come to an end, all secrets of the movie have been revealed. It leaves the audience with nothing to ponder about. The suggestion of this movie to be very scary is only counting as long as the viewer does not know what's going on. And as long as you don't know, I think this movie excels in convincing the viewer of the scary atmosphere. As I was saying, the movie leaves not very much to ponder about, but actually it gives you a short walk home, because of the fuddle you are in, thinking off the things you've seen. So, actually you think of the known things you've just seen... Thinking of the global beauty of this movie together with the splendid sound and music which make this movie to be an rather intense experience. I'll give it 3 to 4 stars."

","M. Night Shyamalan was allegedly less than pleased with how ""Stuart Little"" (which he co-wrote) turned out. After ""The Village"" I know which one I'd happily see again (clue: not the one which doesn't have talking animals).<br/><br/>The man must have been influenced by ""The Twilight Zone"" growing up; fondness for twist endings aside (though I still think ""The Sixth Sense"" was better when it was called ""Jacob's Ladder""), ""Signs"" isn't far removed from ""The Invaders,"" and ""The Village"" is similarly not a thousand miles removed from ""A Hundred Yards Over The Rim"" - but whereas ""Signs"" was an improvement over its predecessor, this one would have Rod Serling rolling in his grave. For those who haven't seen that episode, it's set in the 19th century and involves Cliff Robertson leaving a wagon train to seek medication for his ill son... it wouldn't be fair to go further, but what happens to him isn't completely dissimilar to what happens to the main character in the movie. Apart, of course, from it being short, well written, well acted, and not being pretentious drivel. <br/><br/>""The Village"" is hopelessly convinced it's more meaningful than it really is - Roger Deakins' striking(ish) photography doesn't make up for pacing that aims for ""thoughtful"" and ""careful"" but hits ""boring"" and ""up itself"" instead, and actionably-bad acting from just about everyone except Bryce Dallas Howard (the movie's real star) and Joaquin Phoenix, who presumably agreed to do his second MNS movie in a row after seeing that he wouldn't be subjected to much of the flatter-than-Gwen-Stefani's-chest dialogue. As is often the case, the score from Shyamalan regular James Newton Howard also gives a lot more than it gets (apparently you need to be called Howard to come out positively in this movie); it pleased me that the credits gave the solo violinist Hilary Hahn prominent placing. <br/><br/>The movie has one or two jolting moments to try and keep the viewers awake, but the moment of revelation only opens up plot holes bigger than the giant pit that comes into play at one point, and the abrupt ending caused some audience members to wonder if they'd missed something (they'd come in after the movie started, but only about five minutes after) - I did actually find myself going ""That was IT?!?"" when ""AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM"" came up suddenly. (He always has to put himself above everyone else - whereas all the other opening credits here move towards the camera, his credit moves back. And that habit of giving himself pompous cameos has got to go; even the most fervent Steven Spielberg-hater must admit his ego isn't that big.)<br/><br/>I liked ""Signs,"" I didn't really hate what I saw of ""Unbreakable,"" and Shyamalan's certainly got a good eye, but he could stand to stop thinking he's a genius if he can't deliver. Or let someone else either write or direct for a change."

The storyline is just brilliant and suttle, as most of his other films are eg: The Sixth Sense, and Signs, Though Unbreakable didn't quite make it. As much as I loved this film and all the actors in it, it doesn't quite reach his first films power ( The Sixth Sense ). His first film was quite unreachable, it is so well done that I really don't think a film will reach its standards ever. I believe M. Night will do it again he definitely has the talent in him. Anyway back to 'The Village' Remember how The sixth Sense had a breakthrough actor 'HALEY JOEL OSMENT' his latest film has BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD who is the daughter of the director RON HOWARD. Miss Howard is brilliant and totally convincing as a blind girl 'Ivy Walker'. What we have all grown to know is that every one of Nights films has a large twist and this one is going to shock every nerve in your body.

The Village starts this way and although you get the idea of the ending not to far down the line I was still really interested to see how he plays it out. The cinematography is really good in this film and I really enjoyed all the tree/nature shots. I got the feeling of the Villagers limitations, their fears, what the woods mean to their everyday life's. Ivy Walker is a great character. Very strong, up lifting. Bryce Dallas Howard has down a really good job, not bad for her first film. I can see how people would not like this film. Unfortunately The Sixth Sense has put M. Knight in a group where people only want the ""Oh my god"" factor and assume that's what they'll get. If you see this film go in with an open mind.

I thought it was very cleverly done, having Ivy as a blind person, and see what us humans will to just to preserve our way of life. Its also remarkable to talk to others and hear the underlying story of this great film be mirrored in so many area's of our lives. I initially linked it with Australian & International polatics.

","Idiotic plot and brilliant technical execution--that sums it up right there.<br/><br/>I've admired Shyamalan's films in the past for their subtle, yet effective, narrative that usually features a twist at the end. I've admired how Shyamalan plays by the rules his films set down and never pulls a fast one on his audience. And now, after all that admiration, I get slapped in the face.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the village is the ungodly amount of emphasis on 'those we do not speak of' and the amount of time given to the legends of the land. Every city, every town, and every village has its own sets of myths/urban legends/whatever you want to call them--that's a given. Every culture has a set of ghost stories that kids tell one another by firelight--that is a given. Everyone has been there, everyone has done that, so why Shyamalan decides to spend so much time here baffles me.<br/><br/>Our familiarity with this turf would have been a beautiful opportunity for Shyamalan to gracefully exercise the power of suggestion and the effectiveness of letting the audience's imagination play off of minimalistic stimulation. Instead we get something we already know on a broken record, we have the 'unknown' spelled out to us and shown to us over and over again in countless scenes so that the ending is revealed over an hour before it arrives, and we still have to sit through overly obvious narrative made more painful by its repetitive nature.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this is a Shyamalan film, and I still admire his mastery of the technical end of film-making. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful virtuoso score by the great James Newton Howard, incredibly artistic direction. When it comes to painting atmosphere, with weaving a tapestry of visual elements and music, with expression balanced with craft, M. Night Shyamalan stands with the best. My only regret in leaving the theatre was that the writing was so undeserving."
"gazineo-1","6","0","0","10 September 2004"," A Sociological Tale
","'Village,The' is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who gave to us the blockbuster 'Sixth Sense' maybe one of the most famous movies with a supernatural theme of all times. Shyamalan is a director with a style, maybe a project: to develop movies about ordinary peoples (like the character played by Mel Gibson in 'Signals')involved in uncanny and weird situations. In fact, it's a interesting aspect in his career, because it's very rare to find a filmmaker with a definite style and a personal way of telling stories and artistically worked upon the reality. But Shyamalan was not completely successful in this challenge. Some of his films - especially the uninspired and silly 'Signals' - resulted in a great deception and frustration. His new movie - 'Village,The' - although not a great movie, give to him a new chance to find a good way to carry on. But 'Village,The' is a chance of mood. In the bottom line, it's not a supernatural tale, even with the touches of evil creatures, fear, and fragility of human being in front of the unknown. The movie is, in fact, a sociological comment about human nature, an interesting - although a little far fetched and not original - methapora about political force and the means used by society to estabilish control over mankind, here included fear, violence and general ignorance. The movie hits some of it's goals with competence and Shyamalan, at least, shows to the audience that the uncanny is not just made of ghosts, ET's and heroes of comic books. We, men and women, are so weird and frightful as the strange creatures of his previous movies."

"Jose Guilherme","8","0","0","5 September 2004"," The ideas behind the story make this movie great...
","** Spoilers in some places **<br/><br/>After reading dozens of post complaining that it wasn't scary, wasn't a horror movie as the trailer, wasn't hard to figure out the ending I feel I have to add another comment.<br/><br/>I saw only half the trailer and I was half way to figuring out it was some kind of social control twist in the end. I do agree that Night didn't do a great job either hiding the main plot idea or giving enough tension at moments. The end twist wasn't that innovative or surprising. The actors were above average and the direction quite good in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now to those ideas ""behind"" the movie plot. I really enjoyed the movie due to the mental and intellectual implications: These are nice and likable people scaring their kids into submission and compliance by faking monsters. That is more ""horror"" than werewolves in the woods. That they let people die without ""medicines"" in order to keep the farce is strong. Their dismay at the thought of it all ending too. Is our modern society so dangerous and scary ?<br/><br/>In order for society to work and to be united fear must be ever present. Raise the ""red alert"" when Lucius gets a bit too curious. The ""terrorism"" as a distraction and means of control. Elders plotting secretly for the ""good"" of all. How fear kills curiosity, dissent or even questioning of the status quo. Even if one disregards the 9/11 parallels. In order to be innocent the children have to be kept scared of the outsiders. Remember the ""bogeyman"" and other childish stories ? Isolationism as a means of ""purity"" and a new start. The puritan way of life that brought the English pilgrims to the new world. The ideas about society vs the individual are endless.<br/><br/>Like another comment mentioned, red first appears in a beautiful flower. Its promptly plucked and buried. Red is passion, violence, blood, nature and our animal side. The villagers have little passion and live serenely. Ivy's sister is over romantic but in a hollow and fairytale way, no real passion. To be innocent must we give up our passions, greed, curiosity and liberty ?<br/><br/>Finally we must remember that for much of history people actually lived like those villagers. In awe and fear of the supernatural that lived just after the torches and fire. The woods dark and forbidding. People disappearing and not coming back. Wolves prowling the night. The sounds of the forest haunting our primitive ancestors into building frail societies for self protection. Thank god our modern lives aren't based on fear... or not ?<br/><br/>I recommend this film... I like the way Night builds up suspense and avoids cheap frights. Naturally some might not enjoy it as much. 8/10"

I think I won't spoil anything if I say that there's an oh-so-surprising twist at the end, but this can't save the movie, it actually makes it worse: for one you can see it coming quite early and then it's simply stupid.<br/><br/>The cast features some great names and some of the characters have the potential to be interesting, but ultimately all are bland and forgettable.

"Tom Lee","Null","0","0","8 September 2004"," Fairy tale or origin story?
","I kept thinking while watching ""The Village"" that M. Night Shyamalan had obviously been reading ""Little Red Riding Hood"" late one night and decided to look for a way to make it scary again. One of the theories about fairy tales like Red Riding Hood is that they were once used as a means of social control -- ""go into the forest and the Wolf will get you."" I went into this wondering whether this was a werewolf movie, but the Big Bad Wolf was something quite different here.<br/><br/>In truth the whole movie exists to support the final act: Red Riding Hood's journey into the forest. The rules of this village are so hard and fast, and the elders support them so adamantly, that a truly exceptional situation has to occur before anyone will be allowed to bend them; the tension has to build to unheard-of proportions before anybody cracks. And the final act is worth it: Ivy (Howard) is deserted by her frightened erstwhile comrades, leaving her to face her fear alone in a long, tense, dialogueless sequence. Howard's acting talent is really showcased here.<br/><br/>Shyamalan seems to have a penchant for writing superhero origin stories; ""The Sixth Sense"" clearly sets the boy up for future adventures as a psychic ghost investigator, and although I have not seen ""Unbreakable"" I understand it is also basically the origin of a superhero. It is likely that Ivy too will be revered as a superhero in her village after things settle down again, and although she knows the truth, it is not clear that she will tell anyone else about it, at least until she becomes an elder herself and is put in charge of maintaining the social order.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed by this movie in general. It was a tale well told in a small world well put together. But there were two small disappointments for me: first, it was not entirely clear at first that this was Ivy's story.<br/><br/>Lucius (Phoenix) is strongly featured from the start, but once we are into the final stretch, well, to avoid spoiling it, Phoenix has no further lines, and Ivy is suddenly thrust to the fore to make her journey. Also, after all the anticipation that there is something supernatural happening here, there is nothing. Nothing beyond the natural. Then there were those sudden gratuitous shots upward toward the treetops during the chase sequences in the last act, as if Shyamalan thought viewers might feel deprived of commercial breaks, or was perhaps worried about the plot resolving too quickly. The score seemed not to quite fill the sonic gaps during the wordless chase sequences late in the movie; I found myself thinking of things the composer could have done to make the music more emotionally effective.<br/><br/>The characters were clearly drawn: even minor characters had their recognizable personality traits to make them memorable. Romance between Alice (Weaver) and Edward (Hurt) seems to be slowly developing, but their story is not what we're focusing on in this film. We're given the impression that something could develop later, and that's fine, because the film isn't really about them. And then there's Christoph Crane, always worried about his shirt getting wrinkled.<br/><br/>""The Village,"" like ""Signs"" before it, has a claustrophobic intensity; the characters are thrown into a small crucible, and pressure is applied to them to see what they will do, reminiscent of ""Lifeboat."" The difference is that some of the characters have lived inside this crucible all their lives, and don't know what it's like to live outside it -- indeed, to them the outside seems more frightening than the crucible itself. I would also compare this movie to ""The Navigator"" (1988), where a group of medieval villagers seeking a cure to the plague find themselves in the modern world, which to them is as alien as another planet would be to us.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is about characters and tension, stories and their power, boundaries and whether they really keep us safe. Do not see it for the Shyamalan surprise plot twists. See it if you like to see modern adaptations of fairy tales, especially developed in the direction of suspense and horror. This is a werewolf movie without any werewolves."

ANGEL HEART and THE USUAL SUSPECTS worked because the story leading to the twist can stand on it's on feet regardless of the end so did THE SIXTH SENSE whose replay value went through the roof if only to check some loose ends. So now we are going deep into THE VILLAGE, the first ten minutes bring back a strong anxiety feeling very close to the panic attack wondering if TWISTA can possibly bores us to death yet again, then as the story unfolds fear turns into interest and then into fear again but because of the good reasons. A village surrounded by woods, something lurks in the dark but they won't bother us if we don't bother them, looks simple? believe me it is not. So we have the story, what else do we need? Actors, come in la creme de la creme WILLIAM HURT and ADRIEN BRODIE and top that with and almost silent performance from PHOENIX can we ask for more?... the cherry of the cake is newcomer HOWARD playing the blind girl that at some point will not only be leading the movie but also the audience into the darkness and finally the real deal of the movie, the village itself. We will soon discover that apart from the vastness of the ocean in OPEN WATER, walking the woods at night is the most scary thing to do, I know is irrational after all who is gonna be hiding there monsters? guess what, there are.

It can be sort of a letdown for some viewers. The thing about Shyamalan films that he should realize- they don't require a second viewing. Now, that may or may not be the director's intent. Perhaps his ideology is that ""great films should only be viewed once"" or something. That's an incorrect assumption. Great films make you want to see them again and again... At any rate, the film has some good qualitites. The cinematography is splendid. The period costumes as well as the dialogue are great. The choice of actors is superb.

","I won't elaborate much on the plot of 'The Village' due to fact that Director M. Night Shyamalan loves to tell stories where secrets and big revelations are the key to hold the movie together. What I will tell you is that the film doesn't hold together very well.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is without doubts a very talented director with great skills in creating intriguing atmospheres. He knows how to give a special sense of tension to a particular scene. The problem with Shyamalan is that he thinks he's a good writer, and in the case of The Village this is far from the truth.<br/><br/>The Village is wonderful to look at. The cinematography is great and there are several moments of hypnotic beauty, but these aspects are not enough to prevent the film from falling down. The way the story is unfolded is awful. The climax of the movie is anticlimactic (big contradiction here). The scares are so sporadic that the tension they generate soon evaporates in scenes of silliness and bad dialog. <br/><br/>The acting is uneven. Bryce Dallas Howard starts very strong as Ivy (a brave young blind woman moved by love) but her screen presence looses intensity by the end of the picture. Joaquin Phoenix is adequate without shinning. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are both criminally underused. The two standouts are William Hurt as the Village's leader and Adrien Brody as a mentally challenged young man. These two performances deserve a much better movie.<br/><br/>This is a film that holds up for about one hour and then stumbles and falls.

All I can say is that the people who made the trailer were exceptionally good, to make most viewers assured that this was going to be a horror film and a ""must see"".<br/><br/>Of course, just like all of his previous films, none of them can have an atypical ending and MUST have some twist at the end. Unlike Hitchcock, even M.

I can't criticize the acting and the characters themselves were OK, but the movie could've stepped up the pace a bit without compromising the storyline. <br/><br/>Unlike 'The Sixth Sense', which had more suspense, this movie was weighted down too much with trying to get ""the message"" or point across. OK, so society has become too materialistic, self-involved and violent, but their 'perfect' society turned out to NOT be so perfect after all (it's called HUMAN NATURE). It's also a tragedy that basically everyone, minus the elders, were living a lie, so how moralistic is that?

But after seeing it, I must confess that the movie is really great! <br/><br/>Although it isn't a real horror movie, he is at some moments, thanks to the sound and music, really scary. The sound in this movie is brilliant, loud but brilliant, it makes it look and feel so real. Also about the cast, I can say nothing but good. Bryce Dallas Howard who plays the role of the blind Ivy Walker is my favorite actress. She plays here role so good and with so much feeling so that it looks very realistic. And also Phoenix and Brody play there roles with much dedication. I find the other characters a bit flat, we know things about them, but just not enough to really feel with them. <br/><br/>About the storyline then, I find it really great, in the end, all pieces match together, but you have to be very attentive from the beginning not to miss any important details. <br/><br/>My conclusion is that everyone should have seen this movie at least once. I've seen him two days ago and I can't seem to get it out of my mind. I find M. Night Shyamalan a real creative genius, in these times of reality TV and big crappy blockbusters, he dares to make a movie that is so different from all others , that stands against ""the values"" of the modern film industry , that dares to criticize this society, and in the end is so similar to all of those."

","Ah the Village, Ah M.Night Shyamaln, and Ah another film which finishes with you not really known what you have just seen. I first heard about the film on a internet website about future films, and thought this was a good idea, like the other 3 Shyamaln films. But what stuck in my mind was that all of Shyamalans films have been good ideas but all bar the sixth sense have been no more than average. Joaquin Pheonix was recalled after a convincing role in Signs, and Alien slayer Sigourney Weaver also has a rare appearance. The ever reliable william Hurt also stars. The film fails to deliver in the suspense department, as every piece of the jigsaw falls into place too quickly, meaning that when the inevitable Shyamalan twist hits home, it is rather predictable. The need for a twist is the let down in this film. why not let there really be creatures in the wood, and have a 18th century community go into the woods and f**k the things up. This could have been a really stylish and scary movie, instead it is a beautifully filmed piece of rubbish. Watch out for a scene featuring Joaquin Pheonix and the Mentally handicapped character(1 of the films highlights) which is so well done it makes it even more frustrating that this film was ultimately the biggest let down of the year (I haven't seen Alien VS Preadator yet) And also watch out for the shyamalan cameo. 4/10"

","Who hasn't seen the ads for this new horror movie getting flashed around the TV? The ads looked pretty good; the trailer was cool and the movie...<br/><br/>I: Let the bad colour not be seen. It attracts them.<br/><br/>II: Never enter the woods. That is where they wait.<br/><br/>III: Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.<br/><br/>Well it was completely in the wrong category; here we have a love story that just happens to have a few scary moments, very few in fact. Although if they had advertised it as a love story I'm seriously doubting many would have wasted money to see it. The plot falls in a hole sometime around the start, finds some traction later on but fails to ever really fire.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor but the script is well below his abilities and does him no credit at all â' Why can't I take my eyes of those funky pants he has!? Bryce Dallas Howard manages the worst performance of a blind person I have seen since my, then nine year old, brother pretended he was blind. Sigourney Weaver failed to do anything but add credence to the fact that she has had her time and the mantle needs to be passed, someone put her out to pasture please.<br/><br/>The only stand out actor in it all was Adrien Body, who I can only recall from The Thin Red Line, although he has an extensive list of acting credits to his name â' His performance was great and while watching this drivel, he was the only believable character in the entire film.<br/><br/>Save your money and catch it on television in a couple of years, you won't regret it."

","First the good. Even if it's far from perfect, this movie have something to offer to a lot of fans. And not only horror and sci-fi ones. First, there no doubt you will find some really good tension scenes during the 105 min of the flick length. And I mean really good and well filmed ! Watch for the one when they enter the caves to protect from the 'creatures'. You'll also find a couple of strong performances from solid actors and also a new actress revelation in Brice Howard. And, thirdly, let's also say that there's an really intriguing and mysterious plot that will keep you up awake for a big part of the movie. A story who revealed to be Shyamalan's metaphoric vision on the September 11th and the USA way of life. And he ain't so far from reality with his flick !<br/><br/>The bad about this film is that it's too long and badly rhymed. Some choices made at the pre or post-production have probably ruined the success of a good but 'light' story about an interesting theme. And that, despite some good masterized scenes like i said earlier who made shyamalan technics shines. I personally think that a short film could have been a small 'chef d'oeuvre' while this big Hollywood production will still, in the end , not being considered to deliver for a lot of watchers. The idea you'll get after walking the cinema doors is that something should have been done in the wrong way... not a great dose of fear nor a good amount of fascination for an epic flick !"

","I went to this movie without expecting a copy of The Sixth Sense, which was good because it wasn't.<br/><br/>OK, it does bear some similarities - it isn't till the very end that the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the build up of suspense is very slow but steady, and the fairly straightforward story is cleverly narrated.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie, is that it didn't focus on the obvious thrills of Hollywood blockbusters. Yes, I immediately knew there had to be a logical explanation for the creatures in the woods, and still I found myself intrigued by the feelings of fear, the behaviour arising from fear, the way fear had crept into the lives of these people. The existence of the creatures had so effectively scared the s**t out of these people, just the mere story about and odd occurrence of these monsters was enough!<br/><br/>In the end, we find out why the creatures are there. Afterwards, I found myself wondering if I would go that far for some peace and quiet, if it is humane to instill fear in others for your own selfish reasons, if it is OK to deprive your offspring of certain aspects of the world. There is a resemblance to religion: people who raise their children with strict religious beliefs, always set out (stern) barriers, thus restricting their view on the world. Is that a good thing? I wonder."

For me this film wasn't about the monsters, it was about the love, and emotion one person can have for another person. i can not go into to much detail about this film as i would not want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. yet what i will say is, go see it, even if you don't think you will like it give it the chance. its a fantastic film with a awesome cast. i only had a few complaints about the movie, many things were left unexplained, for example the beginning we are not told what happened. also a lot of things are left without a conclusion to them, this could be seen as either a good or bad thing. we are left to use our imaginations and decide for ourselves what comes of The Village.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","I think that most mainstream films move so quickly and have so much noise and rapid-fire dialogue that ""The Village"" takes some getting used to. I liked the slow pace and found the film interesting & romantic but not scary. I think there is a real marketing problem here; film trailers reveal so much of films these days and can raise certain expectations so that the film itself can be a letdown. It is a shame, I try to ignore film marketing, having learnt my sore lesson with ""the Phantom Menace"". (Didn't we all?)<br/><br/>I thought the actors in ""The Village"" did very well with the formal dialogue and the cinematography was beautiful. My favorite scene was with Ivy and Lucius on the porch at night with the mist over the grass- lovely.<br/><br/>I think Shyamalan has made a very romantic film. But I also have to ask; what sort of megalomaniacs control a town like the elders do in ""The Village""? I know they have great sorrows but it's the most outrageous fraud I've seen perpetrated in film. Their delusions of a perfect society are the most disturbing thing in this movie."

","I believe that this movie was poorly advertised, since many hoped to see a thriller like ""The 6th Sense"". It has one or two scary scenes, but that is not what the movie is about (Need to get scared? Watch the news on TV!) In reality, it was one of the best studies on fear and manipulation I have ever seen lately. I don't want to disclose too much here in case someone out there is still intending to see it, but I'd advise you to pay attention to the tombstone and the dates on it that appear right in the beginning of the story. And what is that Little Yellow Riding Hood parody? It was great! I believe that many who have vehemently criticized the film have done so because they may have not understood it. A must see."

","I loved Night Shymalan's first film Sixth Sense, didn't like the two following ones which were totally senseless and was hoping for better this time ! This film was better than the other two but not as good and surprising as Sixth Sense ! Anyone can see that.<br/><br/>The film is very reminiscent of what you may have seen years ago in one of the John Steed / Emma Peel Avengers episodes ( by this I mean the idea of a world within a world ), or even one of the episodes from a peculiar English series ""Tales from The Unexpected"". On that subject, there is even one of the (original) Twilight Zone episodes that resembles this.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the fact that the underlying idea had been used before didn't detract from my pleasure ( I was expecting that kind of outcome )but I don't think that this film should be depicted as some great cinematic work of art. On the positive side, the picture quality was good and the acting generally of high standard, also a lot of the scenes in the forest itself ( use of trees swaying in the wind etc ) did provide some spooky atmosphere.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the plot was too thin on the ground and above all there was an impression of s l o w n e s s for the first half of the film. Let's face it, not a great deal happens plot wise ! You can rely on atmosphere and weird music to captivate your audience for some of the time but sooner or later, the plot's bound to be called into question. Basically speaking, the whole thing could have been locked into an hour ( exactly like an episode from Tales of the Unexpected or similar ). Making a full length film is probably stretching it too far.<br/><br/>That said, I'll probably give it a whirl on rental DVD when it is issued on that medium as it may be worth a second viewing !"
"Krotos","Null","0","0","29 August 2004"," Good acting, so-so movie (possible spoilers)
","There seems to be a bi-modal distribution of opinions here about _The Village_: most people either loved it or hated it. I guess I'm one of the smaller group in the middle. I thought it was entertaining and worth the eight dollar ticket, but nothing special.<br/><br/>Like many, most of my criticisms of the movie concern the plausibility of the premise. It's hard to imagine that *no one* among the younger generation has ever doubted the existence of the creatures in the forest or felt the urge to see the outside world. And wouldn't it have made much more sense to send one of the Elders to get the medicine? And what happens the next time someone gets sick? Where do they get the glass to fix broken windows? If they can't enter the forest, where do they get the wood to build their houses? Etcetera. I'm sure explanations can be contrived for any of these things, but that's the point: they'd be contrived. In some ways, the movie -- particularly the way everyone seems to unquestioningly accept supernatural explanations for their world -- would have been a little more appropriate to, say, 897 rather than 1897.<br/><br/>And while the Elders are presented sympathetically, I found their entire project to be distasteful. What right do they have to keep an entire generation of people isolated and ignorant, even to the point of unnecessary death? If this were a better movie, it would be about the consequences of their narcissism and misguided utopianism."

","One must not expect too much from M Night Shyamalan. He made the fatal mistake of producing his best film first, meaning it could only go downhill from there. Unbreakable and Signs (IMHO) were not as bad as everyone made out, they just weren't as good as The Sixth Sense and the same goes for The Village. If this had been the first film by M Night Shyamalan I feel that public opinion would have been higher.<br/><br/>The twist at the end was expected and therefore guessed pretty quickly, but if you look beyond it and see the movie as a whole it is something very beautiful. Shyamalan has used colours so well, they are integral to the story but also he allows them to beautify the screen. The dullness of peoples clothes and the buildings is contrasted by the bright yellows of the cloaks and torches and the reds of the flowers and beasts.<br/><br/>The true winners of this movie however are Joaquin Phoenix (his best performance yet) and a surprisingly good debut by Bryce Dallas Howard. The love story between them and the way M Night Shyamalan allows it to blossom is mesmerising. The Village is an okay horror/mystery film but is a really amazing love story. I still look forward to his next project.<br/><br/>7/10"

","So the movie just premiered here in Sweden and when writing this i saw the movie yesterday.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer and knew that i would probably love it, since i actually enjoyed The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and actually Signs too. Because i am an escapist at heart, and i love fiction and stories from other worlds.<br/><br/>But i knew Shyamalans compulsive usage of astounding twists and plots, and being a fairly intelligent man, i could see that at least something surprising would occur.<br/><br/>So i went to the movies, hoping to get a wonderful story of outerwordly creatures and simple farm folk during the early 20th century. Thats what i was hoping for.<br/><br/>So further and further into the movie i started figuring it out, and by the time Lucius got stabbed i had it all figured out. And i was quite frankly heartbroken. Because the movie IS exceptionally beautiful, has a superb soundtrack and great actors. <br/><br/>But nothing more. In the end, it is false advertising and really a sad, depressing and infuriating twist.<br/><br/>M.

","What great atmosphere - the characters live in fear of the creatures in the forest that surrounds the village - a fear that we, the audience felt too. The young people in this Village know only this life that the elders have created for them - just as each of us is brought up in the world our parents have created. However ultimately we have access to a greater world outside our villages and towns - the people in the Village do not. The fear of what lies beyond the marked village boundaries creates the basis of the film. Boundaries marked by yellow banners, paint and towers. At times the wooden observation towers reminded me of prison sentry boxes. Mr Shyamlayan has created a memorable film building a plot based firmly in our own fairy tales - with elements of deep, dark forests and the unknown creatures who live there. Didn't Little Red Riding Hood wear the 'bad colour'? The tension in the Village builds as it seems creatures from the forest are invading. Finally help is needed from outside the Village. The cast did an excellent job - the elders all knowing and wise, the young people following the rules. Perhaps the Joaquin Phoenix character could have been played by a younger man. The climax when the blind girl Ivy, reaches the outside world is ironic - of all the villagers it was she that stumbles into the outside world but is not aware of the truth that surrounds her."

","OK, I'll admit I see a film during its 1st release once a year. I researched what was at the local Regal and decided this or Napoleon Dynamite. My wife decided which of those. I went expecting a completely predictable thriller, and have no prior experience with watching a full-length Shyamalan film. I was impressed. With the acting and the cinematography and the plot. I thought Ron Howard's daughter did a heroic rendition of a blind lead - yes, it's not easy to act sightless when you are not. The fantastic filming itself was very close-up and personal amidst the village scenery. And twice I was surprised by the plot twist - I'm usually pretty good at guessing what's next. I'll start checking out the previous Shyamalan films and look forward to the next - as well as keep a keen eye on Ms Howard's releases. Not to mention Mr Phoenix whose understated character was sublimely great (Check out the fireman film coming this fall).

","I don't know what to make out of M Night as he really is a director who has with all the fault of his own labeled himself as director that makes films with twists. It's some unfortunate for him as he will not get passed this and is really an overrated director as none of his films are masterpieces in my opinion. <br/><br/>The Sixth Sense was a good film with a great surprising performance from Bruce Willis in a film you wouldn't usually associate with someone like Willis but that's all really. I couldn't give two hoots about Hayley Joel Osmonds performance and storyline in it as I saw it as being average like most films with kids his age. Unbreakable was a film that I did thoroughly enjoy and believe in. Signs I have yet to see but look forward to and now The Village which is more like an episode of The Twilight Zone really. I think it's not his strongest film, Unbreakable stills holds the title for that, but I thought it was his most intriguing and odd films. Because of all the plot twists that M. Night throws in to his films you can't help but notice them even before they have started the unravel. You get this kind of feeling with The Village as I was sitting figuring it all out even before the real story began. It wastes no time in getting right into it and it doesn't spoil or fade away much at all from the story, but what M.Night likes to do best which he has succeeded in doing with the Village, is playing with the audience and throwing you into lots of different ideas about what is what and what The actual Village is all about. <br/><br/>Performances in any of M. Nights films have never been a problem. Bruce Willis amazes everybody with his stunning performances in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable as was Samuel L. Jackson, I'm sure Mel Gibson did a fine performance in Signs but The Village far exceeds getting terrific performances out of his actors. Village has an all star cast with some of the greatest names in films in the last 20 years. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, Adrian Brody, Joaquin Phoenix and the introduction of someone who is going to be up there with the greats Bryce Dallas Howard. <br/><br/>Any of these actors and actresses can take on a film like this but for this to be your first film and have the most important part in the entire film is something else. Bryce Dallas Howard is the daughter of director Ron Howard who I am sure has given his fair share of tips whilst making a movie but he must have given her some damn good advice to let her run away with this really intriguing great film. It's not brilliant but it will certainly keep your attention throughout and keep you wondering and even though when you think you might have it then look again because it will probably end up reviewing the film again.<br/><br/>If you are not a fan of M Night's strange stories then watch this film for the excellent direction and very good camera work. I can see why the village has divided the critics but if you are a lover of movies and enjoy an interesting and thought provoking film then The Village is the one for you, but if you are looking for great entertainment then it's probably best to look else where even though this films does have it's moments in tense moments that keep you on the edge. He still hasn't made a masterpiece but he is well on his way and The Village is living proof of that."

But people these days don't want to 'give' in the cinema to get an additional experience.. it should all be easy viewing and all 'take'<br/><br/>Now in The Village, we are left with a film with constant building tension, numerous twists altering the truth of the movie, wonderful acting but most important of all, asking *you* whether the life you lead is really the 'essence' of how it should be, or whether it was the villagers there that had it just right. People consider the movie a fantasy - but then all of Night's movies have been just that.. movies are about escapism after all.<br/><br/>I wonder if this movie will only be appreciated in years to come on looking back rather than the current 'jump galore' slashfest horror generation that can't seem to grasp the simple beauty of The Village.<br/><br/>I loved it and I think it is Night's best film, surpassing the Sixth Sense in its whole - go in with a thoughtful mind and enjoy a wonderful ride."

Or maybe his stuff just isn't made for me.<br/><br/>""The Village"" certainly wasn't made for me. I'm as big of an Ebert hater as you're gonna find, and when I read his one-star review my interest for the movie grew considerably. Sadly, I agree with him. If there is a word that describes ""The Village"" perfectly, it's ""miscalculation"".<br/><br/>Miscalculation of what, you ask? Of Shyamalan's talent for creating suspenseful moments? Yes. I understand this is kind of a show-off, ""I'm-so-good-I-can-scare-you-shitless-with-a-ridiculous-guy-in-a-red-cloak"" kind of thing. Well, that failed, at least for me. I found those guys laughable, although I admired the gimmick that was done with them in a scene that involves the forest and a blind girl surrounded by the color red.<br/><br/>Miscalculation of the power of the final twist of the movie? Yes, indeed. I know it's his thing. But sometimes when you try to make those ""I-pulled-your-rug"" endings on a great scale, it ends up with a cheated, unsatisfied audience. That would be good if the twist was really clever. Case in point, the most under-appreciated movie ever, ""Femme Fatale"". I was cheated with that movie, but it worked because the surprises made me appreciate what I had seen previously on a different light. This isn't true with ""The Village"". The twist amounts to absolutely nothing and I felt profoundly indifferent towards it.<br/><br/>There is someone out there who will love the crap out of ""The Village"".

","This film begins interestingly, but after a succession of hopelessly contrived revelations becomes laughable. <br/><br/> From the opening scenes, it is clear that there is something strange going on in this idyllic 19th century hamlet surrounded by woodland. The occupants appear so carefree, and yet... A nice sense of unease develops as we are made aware of their weird taboos. There is a ""bad"" colour, there are ""those whe do not speak of"". It becomes clear that there is something in the woods that poses a terrible danger to the inhabitants. The horror that stalks this place can only be seen from the corner of your eye, and can only be described indirectly. This makes for a genuinely unsettling first half.<br/><br/>The film looks fine, and the music is effective in underscoring the sense of gathering menace. Furthermore, the performances are all really quite good, from the fearless Lucius (Pheonix), through the sweet but steely Ivy (Howard) to some of the more potato-faced village elders, who watch over their flock with a convincing mix of the autocratic and the benevolent.<br/><br/>The increase in the unsettling activities of the mysterious creatures is handled well, and is accompanied by engaging human drama when a love-triangle begins to clarify. I was really looking forward to where the film was going to go next. Unfortunately, it gets very silly. Very silly indeed. Yes, we're talking the dreaded twist(s). Whether you see them coming or not, they don't develop the story in an interesting direction. They are lumpen and silly, and seemed utterly contrived. I imagine this was in an attempt to do a Sixth-Sense yet again and get the audience ""ooh!""-ing. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I couldn't stifle a snigger. The final twist that accompanies the opening of the mysterious box may as well have been that the events were all a dream, and is just as inconsequential. That having been said, it is rather amusing, (I guess intentionally so) when Shyamalan pops up to helpfully explain away an obvious gap in the logic at the end. But that isn't anything like adequate compensation for the second half of the film. I felt particularly robbed because I had really started to enjoy it.<br/><br/>I don't mind if he makes another film, because ""The Village"" is clearly the work of a talented man.

","Most of the criticisms I've seen of the film seem to centre on two points: Nobody is eviscerated on screen and the pacing.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the director's previous work should not be surprised by the former and the latter is down to personal taste.<br/><br/>The film is certainly being punted as a thriller/horror piece, whereas in my view its much more of a Gothic tale. The build up is, for me, well paced and highlights the actual nature of horror. It creeps and grows in the shadows. They fear what they can't see but can hear.<br/><br/>The twist is largely irrelevant as its apparent from quite early in the film what the elders are up to. It makes the situation more poignant and certainly stands well as a ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" for our time."

Each shot is crafted for a purpose, each piece of dialogue enhances either character or plot. <br/><br/>The audience is forced to share the genuine terror of the Village's inhabitants each time they are visited by the mysterious creatures living beyond the trees. <br/><br/>But while Shyamalan takes star billing as writer/director, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Howard add depth to the film with impressive performances. <br/><br/>Shyamalan performs his inevitable ""two step shuffle"" at the end to confound even experienced twist spotters.

","The Village is definitely not a film that I would recommend for those who are merely wanting a good scare or gore fest, and it's unfortunate that the film was marketed in that way. In fact, it really is nothing of the sort. Rather, it's a highly atmospheric two hours in which my occasional boredom during the first half was changed into a--yes, I've gotta say it--spiritual type of awe at what was unfolding before my eyes during the latter half. There can be no doubt that the potent combination of the two Howards, James Newton Howard, whose highly affecting score drove the film's level of emotion to unscaled heights at times, and actress Bryce Dallas Howard, makes for some really profound moments. Dallas Howard's appearance on screen is at once arresting and evocative of something past that is unrecapturable: more than once, I found that, looking at her, my mouth had opened unbeknownst to me, but as I noticed other theatergoers experiencing the same loss of self awareness, I didn't feel so foolish. The Village certainly has some flaws ie, some camera shots near the end make the point of the film too obvious (in a film such as this, the more subtle, the better...). But in the final analysis, I left the theater changed. Highly Recommended..."

","I went into Shyamalan's latest offering with a fair number of preconceived notions based on having seen his previous 'big three' of 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable', and 'Signs'. That is, I was expecting to see a twist, to jump in my chair once or twice, and to be treated to some wonderful cinematography. Shyamalan's 'The Village' fits that description exactly, except, unlike 'Signs' or 'The Sixth Sense' I wasn't left muttering 'wow' as the credits rolled. Instead I was shaking my head and wondering 'why?'<br/><br/>
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Shyamalan's abilities as a director are wonderfully displayed in this film. The opening montage, detailing village life to a beautiful violin solo, set the scene better than any ten minute prologue could. In rapid succession we meet the key characters in the film, with the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard's Ivy, who is introduced a little later. We see Joaquin Phoenix being grim and thoughtful, we see William Hurt mourning the death of a friend's seven year old son, and we see Adrien Brody laughing irreverently at the aforementioned funeral. Straight away Shyamalan makes it clear who is who, and saves us the trouble of awkward introductions. For those who like the hard and fast style of 'The Sixth Sense', you're in for disappointment, however. Shyamalan goes back to the 'good old days', with the first third of the film surprisingly devoid of any suspense or fear. Rather, he takes the time to introduce his audience to the world in which the movie will take place- with only subtle allusions to 'those who we do not speak of'. By doing all of this, Shyamalan makes us care when the village is suddenly threatened. Too often directors throw us in at the deep end and expect us to care. Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' springs to mind, here. <br/><br/>This first third is, surprisingly, quite gripping. You care when Sigourney Weaver tells her son, Joaquin about her past. You laugh (somewhat inappropriately) at the actions of a masterfully played mentally deficient character (Adrien Brody again proves his flexibility).<br/><br/>
It is the final portion of the movie that leaves a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. While there are moments that make you cringe or even leap a little, it all seems a little underplayed. Since we've all been there before, we're all waiting for that inevitable twist. Likewise, we're so used to his customary 'scares' that when they come, they feel just a little less scary than they were in his previous films. Maybe we're outgrowing his style, or maybe he's just running out of ways to have music build to a crescendo and then punctuate it with a loud sound. <br/><br/>There are some magical moments in the film, don't get me wrong, but they're few a far between- as Shyamalan tries in vain to keep too many characters, a setting the audience isn't used to (that of the early 19th century), and his own mythology together. When the twist comes, unfortunately, most of us had already got it. When it comes, you're left a little disappointed. It just felt as if Shyamalan was trying too damn hard to come up with something, and as quickly as you see it, he just forgets it ever happens.<br/><br/>
If the film has a redeeming feature, it is the quality of the acting and the marvelous cinematography. Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard are show-stealing. While Brody plays a mentally deficient character with a remarkable blend of sincerity and humour, Howard's debut performance simply melts your heart. Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt, however, deliver substandard performances for actors of their caliber. This is partially the fault of Shyamalan's script, but the entire time I struggled to figure out what emotion the two were trying to express. Sometimes it's obvious, but, and this is especially true in Hurt's case, sometimes it just seems like yelling for yelling's sake. <br/><br/>If you're expecting to be scared senseless, 'The Village' may prove a waste of time for you. Get some cash and rent the original 'Dawn of the Dead' or even 'Signs'. If you want to see some wonderful cinematics and some solid acting, go along, but don't expect to be blown out of your seats. 'The Village' is Shyamalan gradually taming the beast that is his writing, and, sadly, it is nowhere near as fearsome as those that went before. Worth a look, certainly, but in the end, it's not going to satisfy nearly as much as some of his earlier films did."

","The Village, many dislike it, many love it. And that's definitely the kind of movie this is: love it or hate it. I put in my vote in the love it side. But even if you don't like it, you can't deny how well it was done. The music is enchanting and sent chills up my spine while I was sitting in the theater. That's something that very rarely happens to me (which is why I now have the soundtrack). It's just simply beautiful and fitting of the movie. In my own opinion, this is Shyamalan's best work. This tops The Sixth Sense in my map. Yes, I agree, that it is a little predictable (that's why I give it a 9 instead of a 10), and very different from anything he's done before. But that's what is so beautiful about this movie. It's a big risk to do a movie like this in our society. And ultimately, this is not meant to be a thriller, it's meant to be a character drama, and it excels at what Shyamalan meant to make of it. But I would recommend this to all who enjoy Shyamalan's work. The best cinematic experience you will have this year. Hands down."

I now see that for him to go it would have been a mistake as he would have seen the outside world and all that is there. Ivy however, being blind was able to get the help they needed without breaking up the village. The very thing they went there to get away from came back to haunt them and that is why they let her go.

Adrien Brody, although extremely punchable, did play a quite satisfying role. The other actors/actresses played quite average roles. The twists were very good, as we have come to expect from this director but surely something more original for the 2nd twist and other parts of the film were carried out poorly (such as ""The Forbidden Shack""), no-bodys going to go in there are they.

After you see this movie, you cannot deny that Shyamalan really knows how to tell a story and convince you, then suddenly, ""OH MY GOD is that possible?"" . The movie is smart from start till end. It's about love, making the impossible, and psychological thrills. I think this movie has a meaning with more intentions. It symbolizes real life for a country in this a world. Great movie. You will not regret seeing it. BUT it's not better that the Sixth Sense. You shouldn't wait for Shyamalan to make a movie better than 6th Sense.

What I think I actually experienced was brilliantly simple but beautifully acted suspense and intrigue, filmed with realism and complete credibility. Examples of past and present use of fear as an instrument of control and influence are everywhere  at the personal level (basically as portrayed in The Village) - also in national and international politics, religion etc. The metaphors contained in The Village are really endless, and this film should become a benchmark in the teaching of psychology, politics and any subject requiring study of human interaction.

This pattern of supernatural themes sets off a thought into the viewers mind that M. Night will be coming up with more and more stories that have that scared to go to sleep at night feeling.<br/><br/>Now, what happened in The Village was something that could have actually happened(just think about it). So, now that the audience has seen the truth and is no longer scared of some ugly looking creature, they have nothing to worry about when the go to bed, when they're at home alone, or when they even thing of the film. <br/><br/>People were let down by the outcome of the film because it was not what was expected.<br/><br/>I personally loved this movie because, It was different from the ""pattern"", there was an awesome cast, and it was shot very well.

In some of the scenes, ironically some of the most serious of the film there is at the top of the shot the fluffy camera mic poking down. In three or four scenes this occurs, often with several inches of the mic being displayed.In one scene a dark pole appears at the top of the shot, so blatantly visible it is cringe-worthy. How could this happen- did the editors not see? It ruined the film for me as the audience split into peels of laughter, and unable to take the film seriously after, the experience was ruined.

","This is a film which is likely to divide audiences even more strongly than the forth coming US Presidential election. What divides the two camps may not be so much to do with the quality of the film, but of the expectations they bring to the cinema with them. Unfortunately the publicity machine for this movie, over which the director may have limited influence, has decided to promote it as a conventional horror movie. Understandably those who have settled back in their seats and prepared for two hours bloodcurdling mayhem are likely to be somewhat disappointed to find that love is, at least, as important an element as fear in this story. The story concerns a village of American pioneers who live lives of simple purity and moral virtue, where the word of the village elders is respected and where a sense of community is prized above all. However this pastoral idyll is an oasis of civilization surrounded by a ring of dark forest in which lurk a dangerous and sinister threat to their continued existence, 'those who cannot be named'. When the tale begins there appears to be an understanding between the two groups; the settlers will not stray into the woods and the creatures will not venture into the village clearing. However this cosy equilibrium is about to be seriously challenged. The cast is packed to the hand tooled rafters with the great and the good of American cinema and it is genuinely refreshing to see stars of the caliber of Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Adrien Brody taking parts in what is essential an ensemble piece, rather than a traditional star vehicle. Having said that there are two roles which do stand proud of the pack, those of Lucius Hunt and Ivy Walker taken by Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. Joaquin is not one of my favourite actors. Although his 'debut' in To Die For promised so much, for me, very little of that has subsequently been realized. I thought his performances particularly in Gladiator and Quills were heavy handed and unconvincing. Perhaps it was the fact that Lucius is a far more quiet and thoughtful individual, but his performance here came far closer to my initially expectations and he seemed to imbue the character with a profundity often missing from his previous performances. However the run away star of this film is without doubt Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Oscar winning director and carrot-topped Happy Days square, Ron. Her performance as a girl who is at once bright, funny, caring and blind is astonishingly convincing. So often actors called upon to portray a disability get so lost in the technicalities that they ignore the true character of the person, but Bryce gives us the full package with astonishing economy. The plot moves, not so much slowly, as carefully, the pressure and mystery building steadily and delivering in time both a swerve and a twist. The first is beautiful executed and is a moment of cinema which will stay with you long after the novelty of the secondary twist has been picked apart and discarded. If you have not seen The Village I would urge you to go, but leave your preconceptions with your ticket stub at the door. This is a film which defies simple genre definitions, so open your mind as wide as your eyes and prepare to be told an extraordinary story."

Unbreakable was good but not up to the standards of the sixth sense. Then there was the signs, which was a film that just kept building and building the tension...and went absolutely nowhere. I must say that when I saw the trailers for the village, I actually thought that he may have made some kind of an effort......oh i was wrong. It, as M Night seems to master, builds itself up and up and once again has an extremely disappointing climax....(if you can even call it a climax).

I can honestly say I find nothing redeeming about this film (other than some very good acting by certain members of the cast)...but from a writing, directing and producing point of view I think M.

What I got, and I'm with Silverwhistle on this one, is a modern fairy tale with a thought-provoking twist.<br/><br/>The fact that the monster in the woods turns out to be human makes it more frightening. Think about Jeepers Creepers. When the Creeper was revealed to be a demon, rather than a serial killer, the whole film dropped about 50% scary factor. The most chilling films are those that portray something that could happen in real life, even though far-fetched. Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer springs to mind. Monsters are not real - human monsters very much are.<br/><br/>This is a mood piece with a proper story, characters you care about and want to know what happens next. I can't believe critics who raved about The Others, which was much slower in pace, and largely a one-joke-pony, hate this film. For stilted dialogue, read period drama, you shallow young things.<br/><br/>Yes, there are holes - where do they get their clothes from, do they have a never ending supply of yellow paint, how are they going to replace all the sheep, but forget all that. This is a quality film I will certainly be watching again. And as someone who hated Signs, this is a vast improvement. The Village is a good story with a twist, rather than a good twist with a story attached as an afterthought."
"ironman0304manutd","10","0","0","1 September 2004"," I wholeheartedly disagree with Aaron1375
","I write this review in contrast of Aaron1375's comments so that IMDb users will have a chance to compare thoughts regarding ""The Village"". The trailer for The Village prompted me to see it, and without giving anything away, the film was quite different from what I originally expected. But in saying that, was The Village such a disappointment to be considered the worst movie of 2004 as Aaron1375 would suggest? No, far from it. The fact that The Village throws a 'curve-ball' is why I liked it so much, and the story, (the ""true"" story) once it is revealed, provides much to think about in regards to our society and humanity, of what we have become, what we have gained, but also more importantly of what we have lost.<br/><br/>I can't say anymore because I want this review to be understood by those that have seen the film, but more so to warn those that haven't seen The Village, that the film should not be dismissed by the reasons given by Aaron1375. In my eyes, Aaron1375 was someone looking for a particular type of story, only to find something different, and because of that, was disappointed. But what was found, is far better than if the story had gone the way of a typical horror film, to eventually sit beside the many other empty-storied, ""I know what you did last summer"" style of suspense/horror flicks in every video store around the world, to be passed over by genuine movie seekers who want substance in their films. I will say this, the only disappointment The Village gave me was it's ending, yet upon after thought, I'm not disappointed because I see why the director chose to end the film as such, and to keep in mind that actions speak louder than words ... so keep an open mind. I am also shocked that Aaron1375 thought 28 Days Later was awful, yet that is another rebuttal for another time.<br/><br/>In closing, do yourself a favor and see the Village, but unlike Aaron1375 don't look for what you ""think"" the film will be, but rather sit back and let the film take you where it ""needs"" to go ... and if you do this, you will discover so much more than you originally expected."

","As in his prior movies Signs, Unbreakable, Shyamalan continually cheats the audience with ambiguous leads for its great excitement.<br/><br/>According to me, the movie's intend is to make concrete in the audience mind the question raised by the protagonists in the village : could something good result from being cheated ? <br/><br/>Shyamalan succeed in making this concrete by producing awareness in the spectators mind. By example, by making watching a movie in a dark theater and being mystified by sounds and shadows becoming as real than it is for the Ivy character when she's lost in the dark deep forest. Therefore, with several audience experience all along his film, Shyamalan helps the spectator to go further into this implicit question : could something good result from being mystified ?<br/><br/>This movie, appears to be a movie about watching movies. The drama of the Shyamalan script not only comes from characters inner conflicts but also from an inner spectator conflict : I know it's just a movie but I want to believe it, strongly (please read the prior comment under this one to be convinced of this).<br/><br/>I will not discuss about political meanings of the film by drawing parallels between the village and some well known administration. I prefer to focus on a Shyamalan obsession in this film and prior ones : the lost innocence. We can't enjoy listening a fairy tale without remembering brief memories of our past innocence. Maybe enjoying a movie works the same way.<br/><br/>This Shyamalan movie is both an investigation about the innocence disappearance and an attempt to restore it in the spectators mind through multiple angle reflections between this spectator inner conflict mentioned earlier and the Walter main character's evolving point of view : sensible Vs superstitious points with Walter and Lucius, rational Vs passionate points of view with Walter and Ivy, realistic Vs fanatic points of view with Walter and The Old Ones, idealistic Vs realistic points of view with Walter and The Old Ones at the end.<br/><br/>This movie supports me in the belief that cinema is a powerful way to remember its past innocence, even very briefly. I think it's has been an efficient way to reinforce some repressed hopes and dreams I had younger. I wish you the same experience."

But my hopes were for naught. Oh, there was a surprise ending, all right, but definitely not a riveting surprise.

"ODDBear","5","0","0","30 August 2004"," Disappointing
","I assume you've read the storyline elsewhere, so I'll skip it.<br/><br/>I was profoundly disappointed by this movie.  Shyamalan has shown himself to be a unique and utterly capable director (Sixth Sense, Signs) but also not infallible (the utterly boring Unbreakable).  Here he is on Unbreakable territory.  He completely indulges himself in every little thing, assuming the viewer is so captivated in what he has to say here, which in the end is nothing special at all.  Worst of all, he has little flashbacks of dialouge near the end, telling us that ""intelligent viewers"" could have figured out the plot.  <br/><br/>What's most irritating is that I get the feeling he crams these surprise twists just for the sake of surprise twists.  He did it brilliantly with The Sixth Sense, but here, it seems idiotic.  But to say this movie is bad is not a fair assessment.  Shyamalan is very good at creating a moody athmosphere and he can create genuine suspense out of almost nothing.  He makes me jump out of my seat a few times, with well timed shocks (maybe he should make a full blown horror film).  But when the end result is anything but interesting, what preceeds it seems somehow a cheat, a false buildup. The packaging looks good, but there's no substance.<br/><br/>Another plus are the performances.  William Hurt is excellent, it's always nice to see Sigourney Weaver and Phoenix is his usual good, but somehow sterotypical, self.  <br/><br/>5 out of 10."

","This didn't strike me as a movie that was ever going to appeal to the masses. For a start setting it in a Victorian community is going to alienate viewers bought up on a diet of action and adventure. Storytelling just doesn't sell anymore. Witness the poor box office returns for flicks such as Far From Heaven, Thirteen Days, Ratcatcher. Some of the best movies of the last few years. So, onto the movie. Shyamalan's dealt with ghosts, superheroes and aliens. Here, for my money at least, he tells a fairytale. The village of the title refers to a small community living in isolation in the late 1800's. Surrounded by woods, the villagers have made a truce with ""the ones we cannot speak of"", creatures that stalk the surrounding woods. The villagers don't go into the woods, the creatures don't come into the village. That's the way it's been for years. As we all know though, all good things come to an end. To say much more would be criminal, as this is easily Shyamalan's most well paced, thoughtful piece of work yet. People coming out of the screening I saw I felt were generally annoyed that they'd bothered. However, there were a lot of kids, and this is NOT a kids film. It's much better placed alongside a Brothers Grimm tale or Neil Jordan's The Company Of Wolves. While I was watching it, I loved it, but I wasn't at all scared. But in the few days since I saw it, it's genuinely haunted me. <br/><br/>The images in it revoking fears of childhood, and things you never think you'll see.<br/><br/>To sum up, I personally think this could turn out to be my favorite movie of the year.

No other filmmaker would even dare to put in a twist that extreme, but to me it works. Shyamalans stories have always been very human and The Village is no exception. it's not a monster movie (this i believe is why many were disappointed)it's a story about a select few people in a small village. it is very chilling, even the thought of the conclusion is very chilling.<br/><br/>I will admit the film didn't strike me instantly as being brilliant, but Shyamalans cleverness makes the film play on your mind (Like all his films).

","OK so it's not as dreadful as 'Blair Witch Project', a film that 'The Village' vaguely resembles, but it certainly does not stand up to any sort of close scrutiny. For the sake of the plot only the blind girl can leave the village since she would be unable to 'see' the truth on the outside but for heavens sake she actually runs through the wood and has no difficulty scaling a 10 foot wall never mind gauge exactly the moment she will be attacked so she can take evasive action:sorry but this was just too corny for words. Nice atmosphere, moody music but the actors speak their stilted dialogue ('This is the shed that must not be used....The coat that is made of the colour that is safe etc etc..) so earnestly as if they actually believed the rubbish they were saying. The whole thing is so po-faced you just feel like bursting out laughing to lighten up the proceedings. Better than 'Signs' but not as good as 'Unbreakable' and nowhere near the quality of 'Sixth Sense'."

While so many films rely on one-liners, cheap tricks, or formula comedy; Shyamalan is able to create a completely unique world that is like experiencing a parallel universe.  If you are tired of the same old movie experience and want to find something totally new, I highly recommend this film. This is his best film since Sixth Sense. I can't understand why there is so much dislike of this work.  Maybe the steady diet of reality television is causing movie-goers to totally miss a totally fantastic story.

","""They can smell you <br/><br/>You may run from sorrow as we have. <br/><br/>Sorrow will find you. <br/><br/>It can smell you."" <br/><br/>(Below take contains spoilers and readers are advised to skip it before watching the movie)<br/><br/>If I'm to be geeky about it, The Village (which interestingly, has an idiot), is like a Dogville crossed with The Weather Underground. Its also spirited by the poignancy of Since Otar Left and the emotional abandonment of Magnolia. Bursting at the seams with Tarkovsky's aesthetics, the camera throughout assuredly pans and glides. It played on and danced on the wonders of lights. Particularly orgasmic to note, is the placement of people in most interior shots (the last scene comes to mind). Treating the actors like part of the art direction, these `organic props' helped immeasurably in articulating the symbolic gist of any scene with uncanny power.<br/><br/>
In addition, there is a telling similarity between the character Lucius and Mr M Night - both exhibited quiet strength and admirable fearlessness. For under the hawk eyes of fanboys, he dared weave into the movie, a most familiar Hitchcockian device  one that's reminiscent of `Psycho'. No, its not the plot twists in the end. It's the shifting of our focus from one obvious protagonist to another, midway through the film.<br/><br/>
In so doing, M Night not only risked losing his audience, he managed a casting coup. He discovered and ambitiously set loose, a brilliant actress of equal parts translucent beauty and awe-inspiring emotional range. The sheer intensity of her presence burns up the screen. This character, Ivy Elizabeth Walker, exudes such Herzogian hallmarks like tenacity, passion, vulnerability and intuition, she singularly transcended The Village's Matrix-like illogic and its arguable plotting grumbles. Bryce Dallas Howard  watch out for this name. For from forth the loins of her ugly father (Ron), a star is born. I so love her right now. Love her!!!!!!<br/><br/>
I am trying to make sense of the critical carpet bombings so far. And I can only conclude that The Village may have indeed spit `critical' conventions in the face. Hidden beneathe its Hollywood trappings, I do opine that The Village embraced the elemental purity of love, hope and human desires. It also explored such grand issues as the nature of our humanity, the impact of societal conditioning and the shifting definition of evil and/or insanity.<br/><br/>
Depending on the sides we take in the the film taste spectrum, I presume my aforesaid pontifications may have already caused some massive retchings, approving nods, or neither extremes. But if you ask me, it matters not. What's important is for most to understand (and hopefully respect), that our love or hate for The Village (as do all other films) are made with at least some personal basis. <br/><br/>So who am I kidding? Of all that's been said so far, and the many facets of this movie I may wanna touch on in future, I am first and foremost mesmerized by the power of love between Lucius and Ivy. `Sometimes, we don't do things we want to do, so that others won't know we wanna do them.""<br/><br/>
Awww... <br/><br/>To the hopelessly romantic, the Village is a masterpiece. It is the most romantic film I have seen in recent memory. And if others cannot or don't wanna deal with that, its fine by me. <br/><br/>""Baby Sleep, gently sleep <br/><br/>Life is long and love is deep <br/><br/>Time will be sweet for thee <br/><br/>All the world to see <br/><br/>Time to look about and know <br/><br/>All the shadows come and go <br/><br/>How the breeze stirs the trees"""

","I have seen this film and I did enjoy it, I can understand the criticisms from other viewers. This movie was not like his other productions and was wrongly marketed as a thriller. This is another commercial ploy of big production companies, I doubt the director had much power to change their direction.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a twist on Grimm's fairy tales, if anyone is aware of the original Grimm's tales since most have been bastardized by Disney, all of which center around the idea that going into the woods alone would lead to death at the hands of a multitude of ghouls, trolls, criminals or witches. They were used to teach children that strangers were bad and any life outside the village walls was evil. That is exactly what this movie was using as a backdrop for the love story between the two lead characters.<br/><br/>Now, I am aware of the need for today's viewers to be bombarded with quick cut seeings and shock music to feel they got their eight bucks worth, we are all victims of slasher films, hard core action flicks, and worst of all a high sense of cynicism. Fairy tales are just not enough for most us anymore, we're all too jaded from reality to fall for them. So with that in mind I say that the only problems with this movie are the following: A) it was marketed wrong, which I have to say p****d me off a little, and B)the story had to stand on a single premise, which in most cases is not strong enough to support an hour and a half. <br/><br/>Okay, enough of my babble.

Mr Pheonix seems to be convincing enough, but he is confined to a horizontal position for the last half of the movie. Did he 'do' an Oliver Reed or David Hemmings and they couldn't find a double? Sigourney Weaver is good as always but she is hardly in the storyline. Brendan Gleeson plays his usual part. William Hurt, behind a bushy beard, may have insisted on 95% of his shots being side-on, presumably because he couldn't stop laughing at his atrocious dialogue. But the most hilarious performance comes from Adrien Brody. I didn't see 'The Pianist' but I'll bet he's glad he's already won an Oscar, because if he gets another part, it will probably be as a stage warm-up act for Woody Allen. It's almost worth seeing again to really have a good laugh. I think this movie is even worse than 'Unbreakable' and I haven't seen 'Signs' although people exiting the cinema were overheard to compare the two ('Signs' and this rubbish, that is). I still give it 5 out of 10 for some aspects, including the twists, the red herrrings, and the music. But the real reason I dislike this is that it is an obvious attempt at capturing the atmosphere of 'Sleepy Hollow', which it can never do. Sorry Mr S. One good twist does not a movie make."

","I am no film critic, i am just one of the millions of people who enjoy sitting down and being entertained. I have seen a lot of films, some good, some poor. When i saw the preview for ""The Village"" i couldn't wait to see it but after reading all the poor reviews i was starting to have my doubts but i went to see it anyway and i absolutely loved it. Shyamalan is brilliant writer and an amazing director. For me it had everything i enjoy in a movie and i would recommend it any day of the week. This is definitely a must see.!"

","The village was a very good film, but wasn't what I expected it to be. In the advertisements, it looked like it was going to be a good horror movie and when I went to see it at the cinema, its a good movie, but not at all scary, however, it does make you jump a little. I would class this as a film that you would probably find better watching at home on the television, rather than at the cinema. However, I prefer M. Night Shyamalan's Signs and unbreakable and the Sixth sense. I thought that these films had a clearer plot outline and a far more interesting plot. I would like to give this film 6/10, as it was entertaining, but not as good as it could have been."

The problem is that the new breed of ""movie buffs"" raised on Hollywood ""terrors"" such as Scream and I know What You Did Last Summer are getting progressively worse and worse each year at recognizing true cinema and the elements that really make a movie a cinematographic experience and not just some sort of a sporting event where the viewer tries to figure out the plot while ignoring the movie elements themselves. People..PAY ATTENTION TO THE MOVIE AND ITS ELEMENTS. How about atmosphere,camera work,surrounding scenic beauty.Most of the clowns on here who bashed this flick probably talked to their buddy throughout the whole movie ignoring all of these aspects. Ending..(very good one here,by the way) is the icing on the cake and DOES NOT MAKE THE WHOLE MOVIE! Great flick full of powerful acting,fantastic dark atmosphere and twists that are not just there for twists-sake but actually make the story great.I loved it.I thought Sixth Sense was ok and Signs sucked by the way. I was raised on scary movies and have seen more then most people including many non-Hollywood imports. I saw this one at the theater tonight and it rocked me. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."

","I disagree with the poster above. ""The Village"" is a M. Night Shyamalan movie, and of course there is a twist. I doubt that he will ever succeed as directly as in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but ""The Village"" has well-developed characters, and is less implausible than ""Signs,"" in my opinion his worst movie. Further, the first hour or so is intensely suspenseful, and Ron Howard's daughter (I think) Bryce Howard is very compelling in the lead role.<br/><br/>This movie is another of Shyamalan's thrillers- better than some, but not his strongest. That said, I enjoyed it much more than many of the somewhat negative reviews indicated."

"nds25","10","0","0","23 August 2004"," Phoenix rises again in The Village
","First, let me start off by saying that there has never been a movie that I have anticipated more than The Village. Not because M. Night Shyamalan's mother delivered me when I was born, but because I truly believe he is one of the best filmmakers of today. I've read the slew of bad reviews of the movie over the weekend, and I can honestly say that I disagree with the negative reception of this film. <br/><br/>I'll be careful not to reveal too much of the film because there are many plot twists. I actually knew what the ending was before the movie ended, but I still enjoyed it because I wasn't anticipating it, nor did I want to be razzled and dazzled in the end, as with The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable. If you do that with this movie, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>I like Shyamalan's films because he doesn't depend on his ending; it's just an added bonus. One can argue that he depended upon it more this time around, but, all in all, the ending shouldn't be where you get your kicks, so to speak. These twists and turns are not what should be focused on when watching a Shyamalan film. In the end, his movies are all character studies about humanity; they are not some cheap thrill. He is a master at creating layered characters above anything else. Don't get me wrong the thrills are nice, but I really enjoy the spirituality of man that he explores in his work. <br/><br/>The Village, Shyamalan's sixth film, is about people who live in a small, close knit utopian community, which resembles the Amish. They are surrounded by a forest that is inhabited by mysterious creatures. A truce exists between the creatures and the villagers that says that neither one shall enter the other's territory. However, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to go into the woods, and he asks the Elders if he can do so. He is turned down, but mysterious creatures enter the village, leaving red marks on the doors.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Shyamalan and the marketing team at Touchstone use this to get asses in the seats (on a side note he is very good at creating stories with a commercial backdrop - not many filmmakers can write intimate stories that offer commercial appeal at the same time), but that's not really what the movie is about. The Village is really a love story that personifies what love truly is, and not just some superficial word people throw around. A love triangle exists in the film, which is very reminiscent of many of Shakespeare's plays.<br/><br/>One of the best and most touching scenes in the movie takes place between Lucius and the divine Bryce Dallas Howard's (daughter of director Ron Howard, who gives a tour de force debut performance by the way) character, Ivy, in a conversation where Lucius confesses his love for her. Another of Night's strengths is creating a very subtle and resonant mood and dialogue without seeming pretentious or melodramatic. Ultimately, this movie explores how love gives us courage and makes us do things we are otherwise afraid to do. <br/><br/>The cinematography in The Village is mesmerizing. Every shot is so well crafted and executed that I had goose bumps during a scene in which creatures invade the village. I think the reason why Shyamalan films look so good is because he storyboards every single shot. It's almost as if he already has a comic book version of the movie before it is filmed, much like Hitchcock. There is a distinct difference between movies that are storyboarded and ones that aren't. There is a certain resonance and richness that exists with the former. <br/><br/>In retrospect this movie is quite haunting because it examines the power of fear and how it can control us, showing that we are never really safe from anything in this world. <br/><br/>It can be said that the village is a metaphor for the society and world we live in today, which is hinted at on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>A friend of mine even suggested that colors in the film are symbolic of our alert system, which sounds plausible but I'm unsure if that was Night's intention. <br/><br/>All in all, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a great film filled with intelligence, suspense and social insight. <br/><br/>To be truly astonished, I recommend going into this movie without any expectations. <br/><br/>Disregard the absurdity of the world you are entering, embrace the aura of it, and try to extract the true meaning of the film.<br/><br/>If you do this, you will be entertained and moved at the same time."
"mdud","9","0","0","23 August 2004"," But their life is better than yours
","I've sat here for a while and become increasingly annoyed with reviewers who seem to expect the earth from M. Night Shyamalan. Not only does he provide something which, for me, is a very thought provoking piece, matching it's fine acting only with it's exemplary casting, but he also yet again managed to baffle me into not being able to predict his trademark 'twist'. Hell, he even made four of my friends as well as myself laugh out loud near the beginning (you'll know when).<br/><br/>The reason why I think this film hasn't seen such great reviews of late is that everyone's expecting something herculean - give the guy a break! You are only comparing him to his previous triumphs. Had this been any other director then this would have been the stand alone hit that was the Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>However, <sigh> comparisons will forever be made with the Sixth Sense for the rest of his career so let's get on with it:<br/><br/>The pace starts slow (hello, normal village life?!) but also builds slowly, changing your perception of the potential plot lines along the way. It successfully places just enough doubts in your mind about the potential plot lines you foresaw to keep it's edge almost throughout. Even when I had guessed what the twist was going to be, there were MORE twists!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I thought that Sigourney Weaver was underused but couldn't rightly see where she would be better placed or why that character would justify more film time - maybe an extended edition will do her more justice. Williams Hurt gives a dependable performance and Joaquin Phoenix plays the 'quiet type' very well. Bryce Dallas Howard does very well indeed although she can sometimes 'see' where she's running a little too well for my liking.<br/><br/>All in all, I would rate this behind the Sixth Sense in my list of his favourites (not by much - I worked out THAT twist!) but a big step up from Signs."

","This motion picture begins with Mr. Nicholson burying his son, after which the viewer is taken to the ceremonial dinner. As strange sounds come from the woods, only one person, the stupid, gets excited. Then skinned animals being are found. They are firstly said to be killed by coyotes. And that 'those we don't speak of', who keep the villagers from going in the woods surrounding the village, didn't go angry on them. However, some youngsters want to go through the woods to get medicines in towns nearby.<br/><br/>Many, many mysteries live in this remote, 19th century village. Red being the forbidden color and yellow the protective color is one of them. What exactly keeps the villagers from going through the woods is another. As are the skinners, and the colors the blind girl actually can see. And of course, the whole 'why' the village is there. Two young men seem to know things. One of them, the stupid, doesn't really care. The other, Lucius, still has to figure out a lot, but he obviously suspects things. But he gets silenced in an attempt of murder. Piece-by-piece the viewer is fed solutions, but he/she is not always given a clear picture. <br/><br/>----- This thriller/detective is chronological and uses few flash-backs to illustrate some monologues of characters. The director attempts to build up the thrill by various means: well utilized sounds, nice cam-work and editing (e.g. as Ivy stands in the door waiting for Lucius, or, as Ivy runs into the barrier), and slow and slightly static but splendidly teasing plot.<br/><br/>As in a good thriller/detective the viewer is offered fake solutions, e.g. at some moment it is said 'those we don't speak of' are not real, but in a later scene we actually see one of them in the woods.<br/><br/>The theme is the distancy of the village. The viewer must find out why. The motives are: fear (of the outside world), supernaturalness (the view of blind Ivy), knowledge (who are 'those we don't speak of'), red (bad color), yellow (good color), innocence (of the villagers), secrets ( 'sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them'), 'Lucius' (Lat., 'lux', light; as in he sees what others don't), 'Noah' (Hebr. 'rest' / wanderer, as in he wanders where others don't, he's locked up at some point ""Lord shut him in"" (Gen.7:16). This name is a bit fague, but as is the character), the innocent 19th century (one can read '1840' on a gravestone in the opening scene)<br/><br/>Main characters: Lucius, seems a distant man at first but turns out to be close to Ivy; Ivy, blind but she can see aura's, she's afraid but she withstands her fear and eventually outsmarts her fear; Noah, he's retarded but that wouldn't justify his stunning actions; Mr. Walker, father of Ivy, head of village, he knows it all, at first he's not willing to sacrifice his secrets but when he does, it turns out not to harm them. The characters are round, they have true emotions and they develop them as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>------ Concluding, this tribute to innocence in combination with deep mystery and although having a slightly simple plot it's a worthy thriller. However I would agree with ""cozzymo2"". The movie would've been even better when the big revelation was postponed. The viewer should not know the truth until it's almost too late. Personal grade: 7/10"

","I love this time of year - late summer, when the blockbusters start to die out, and we get back to proper movies that are not released just to sell lunch boxes. The Village made me remember why I love movies so much. I was gripped. <br/><br/>After a summer of such boring, seen-it-before-rubbish, like ""I, Robot"", ""Van Hesling"", and ""Spider Man 2"" (or ""Spider Man Again"" as I like to call it) this was intelligent filmaking, perfectly paced, suspense fuelled, and wonderfully acted. The scene in which William Hurt has like a passionate, forceful monologue was riveting - all one take - it breathed life into my love for cinema. <br/><br/>Shyamalan has borrowed from the right places - The Wicker Man, Don't Look Now, Dark Water, Blair Witch etc, but he is a truly gifted and individualistic filmmaker, who always takes the narrative of his films down paths I never expect. We are witnessing the work of a filmmaker on a par with Hitchcock and Spielberg; he has his own style, and whatever you say about ""THE SHYAMALAN TWIST"", very few people actually see it coming. The Sixth Sense is a classic, Unbreakable was for me his best film - by far the most thought provoking,insightful and skillful of the current cluster of Comic book movies we have witnessed over the last few years. Signs for me was a dip, but The Village was the best chiller film I've seen since The Ring.<br/><br/>Stunning, emotive, moving, spooky, tinged with a political message, and like all great art - the viewer is left with questions not answers. It's films like this that remind me why I go to the odeon week after week."

","The village is an excellent movie, thoroughly entertaining with little violence, no bad language, no sex, and lots of effective quiet moments.

The Village is better than The Ring because it was much more thought-provoking and with minimal supernatural forces. The acting was excellent, especially the newcomer who played Ivy. All characters were interesting and believably portrayed. The story was very good and unfolded at a good pace. One wonders why the reviewers seemingly cannot give good reviews to a good movie like this. It appears that good reviews only go to movies that have some socially-negative ""Hollywood"" agenda.

This expectation was fuelled by the endless speculation infecting the internet over the possible endings to Night's 4th movie (no, I can't spell his name). How wrong I was. How wrong they were.<br/><br/>The Village is no monster film, though it has monsters in it. There is no shock-horror twist, though all is not what it seems. The Village is a story of love, and the finest I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>We witness the love between Lucius (Pheonix) and Ivy (Howard) with such immense beauty, visualised so simply by his taking of her hand at any moment she reaches out. Her love is returned by venturing into the forbidden woods for him, even though she is blind. The love of the elders for their children, and children's children, by sacrificing all they used to have. The love of Ivy's father (Hurt) for Lucius's mother (Weaver), as he sacrifices the safety of his blind daughter to the woods...<br/><br/>The Village is a beautiful film with talent pouring from every scene.

","I for one loved the film. I found the ending, not disappointing, but insightful and thought provoking. I read these comments about how awful the film was, it was a waste of money, how terrible the writing was and it makes me laugh. Think of how intelligent M. Night Shyamalan is that he makes this trailer and reels in so many movie goers with this horror plot and the truth is it's an incredible metaphorical movie. If you found the movie boring and disappointing, you may want to go back to school and learn how to think and interpret. This director is showing you truth, reality, his philosophy on our world today. All you wanted was a cheap thrill to fill your boring existence. How intelligent was Shyamalan as a writer that he has created a piece of art that not only shows the world in a metaphorical way, but also proves his point and he's made millions doing it. Before you criticize someone's writing, think about it. You payed for the ticket, and you watched the movie, you may not have enjoyed the ending, buy you sat through it and it may not have sunk it (which is proven by the ridiculously idiotic comments that followed)but you were educated in some way. It's people like that that make that movie make even more sense."

","I am still in two minds about this film. On the one hand, the atmosphere created was fantastic - off-screen rustlings and growlings combined with unnerving violin music and some fine cinematography created some wonderfully suspenseful moments. And some of the performances were spot on - Bryce Dallas Howard was flawless, Joaquin Phoenix was nicely understated almost to the point of simplicity at times and it was nice to see William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver again, after what feels like ages. But the story? What a pile of s***. I felt really cheated by the ending. The plot was contrived and unconvincing, and to all whose who praised its genius - go back and see. Subsequent viewings will reveal just how ramshackle the story actually is. Someone should tell M. Night Shyamalan that he doesn't have to include an audience-confounding plot twist in every film he makes - he's got more than enough talent to make perfectly good movies without resorting to such manufactured mindf***s."
"presumin_ed","8","0","0","25 August 2004"," Twist again
","I don't care what other reviews of this movie have said (or will say) but I'm determined to reveal only the barest details of its plot.<br/><br/>Like director M Night Shyamalan's other movies (The Sixth Sense, for instance) it's as twisty and turny as a run-for-you-life through the seriously creepy woods that play a large part in The Village.<br/><br/>At the risk of joking about a clever and suspenseful atmospheric thriller such as this, I have to tell you it's like Little House on the Prairie meets The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>A tough one to pitch you might think, but M Night has already proven his bankability again and again (see IMDb trivia).<br/><br/>He's written and directed all of his films (indeed, made a cameo appearance in each) and the same is the case here.<br/><br/>The movie starts in 1897 wilderness America with the death of a child in the eponymous ""Village"". The name of the place is never revealed and it soon becomes clear that it doesn't really need one as none of its residents ever leaves and no-one ever visits. It is entirely self-sufficient.<br/><br/>Anyone outside the village is ""those we do not speak of"" from ""the towns"". And Covington Woods, which surround the community, are just too darn scary to even step one foot into. Eerie howling sounds emit from the woods, day and night, and there are dozens of rules and legends about the creatures that roam among the trees.<br/><br/>Even colours are part of the myth. Red is very bad and essentially banned from the village, while yellow is ""safe"".<br/><br/>The men take turns manning a watchtower to warn of any incursions by the creatures and the whole place is ringed by yellow flags (and flaming torches at night). Yellow is the colour of cowardice and everyone in the community is in a constant state of fear.<br/><br/>Everyone that is except Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), a young man who asks the village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt) for permission to cross the woods to get medicine from ""the towns"".<br/><br/>Lucius (whose mother, Alice, is played by Sigourney Weaver) believes the child who died could have been saved. And, it seems, Walker's own daughter Ivy (the excellent Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director/actor Ron Howard) went blind for lack of medical treatment.<br/><br/>Soon there is indeed a terrifying visit from one of the creatures and eventually it's not just Lucius who wants to cross the woods. And that's all I'm saying. I think M Night (and IMDb) would be sorely displeased if I blabbed any more.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, he puts the whole thing together beautifully. The pacing is almost perfect and he draws out the suspense in the manner of Alfred Hitchcock, one of his favourite directors.<br/><br/>A lot of the movie has a cold, stark, disconcerted feeling  even during its lighter moments (there is some humour). There is much use of hand-held cameras and the barely-engineered sound gives the whole thing an almost documentary feeling.<br/><br/>Indian-born, Philadelphia-raised Shyamalan became the highest-paid movie scriptwriter for Signs ($5 million) and he earns his cash here too. This movie is a thriller but the dialogue is impressive: pared-down, unsentimental and hugely effective.<br/><br/>At one point, Lucius says to Ivy: ""You run like a boy"". She sees this as a compliment and simply replies: ""Thank you."" And later, during the scene in which they declare their love for each other, she asks if he dislikes her ""tomboyish ways"" (he doesn't).<br/><br/>Love angles are so often tacked on to thrillers in a desperate attempt to give the characters some depth, and, as such, have the audience yawning. This one however, is actually quite moving in its uncomfortable simplicity.<br/><br/>And, as usual, M Night drops clues around the movie to give hints at what's coming next or to cleverly make the events fit together. Go see him do the twist for yourself."

First you have Lucius having to go to the towns; then... I won't spoil the U-Turn. The dialogue? Well, I found it a <br/><br/>little stilted at times; sometimes a little too much so that it was laughably... too refined. Nonetheless, the performances of everyone were decent.

I won't spoil it...Most will see it coming. Most won't. Some people will feel cheated. Some don't. But what counts is the KILLER SHARK of the <br/><br/>story; how Night writes each scene to move the story forward. And how he executes it gracefully, beautifully. And I loved the MOMENTS where there was<br/><br/>anticipation of action in this film (though lots of those moments were too loud; as I mentioned earlier) I thought the scene with Ivy and the red creature in the <br/><br/>forest (after she recalls that Hurt mentioned he heard of rumors of the creatures that he eventually lectured the youngsters about) was exhilarating; thrilling. <br/><br/>And a man even let out a girlish scream in the theater that left some chuckling (comic relief). Reminds me of the scene in SIGNS when the green alien <br/><br/>appeared from the bushes in the TV footage; a dude in the theater screamed so loud almost like a girl... Well, I guess M. Night has the skill to bring that out <br/><br/>in people.<br/><br/>But only upon first viewing, I guess. Once again, thrills via anticipation of action. Will my enthusiasm for this film deteriorate if I watched it with someone who <br/><br/>casts cold eyes?<br/><br/>No. I also loved the underlying of the ""Innocence"" and doing things out of ""love"" for the Amish tradition; kept the story FATTER and gave it more layer. Oh, <br/><br/>not to mention the love story aspect. So, in my opinion, THE VILLAGE won't cheat anyone. Just watch it with no expectations at all. It helps.

Well, I found it a little stilted at times; sometimes a little too much so that it was laughably... too refined. Nonetheless, the performances of everyone were decent. You really feel like you are watching Amish people. You sometimes forget that its William Hurt, or Sigourney Weaver or Phoenix because of the good performances... <br/><br/>The twist? I won't spoil it...Most will see it coming. Most won't. Some people will feel cheated. Some don't. But what counts is the KILLER SHARK of the story; how Night writes each scene to move the story forward. And how he executes it gracefully, beautifully. And I loved the MOMENTS where there was<br/><br/>anticipation of action in this film (though lots of those moments were too loud; as I mentioned earlier) I thought the scene with Ivy and the red creature in the forest (after she recalls that Hurt mentioned he heard of rumors of the creatures that he eventually lectured the youngsters about) was exhilarating; thrilling. <br/><br/>And a man even let out a girlish scream in the theater that left some chuckling (comic relief). Reminds me of the scene in SIGNS when the green alien <br/><br/>appeared from the bushes in the TV footage; a dude in the theater screamed so loud almost like a girl... Well, I guess M. Night has the skill to bring that out in people. <br/><br/>But only upon first viewing, I guess. Once again, thrills via anticipation of action. Will my enthusiasm for this film deteriorate if I watched it with someone who casts cold eyes? <br/><br/>No. I also loved the underlying theme of the ""Innocence"" and doing things out of ""love"" for the Amish tradition; kept the story FATTER and gave it more layer. Oh, not to mention the love story aspect. So, in my opinion, THE VILLAGE won't cheat anyone. Just watch it with no expectations at all. It helps. Hope I didn't <br/><br/>spoil anything here. <br/><br/>9/10"

","What a refreshing change this film made. I watched The village this afternoon at a local cinema with a predominantly young audience and everyone in the theatre seemed to enjoy the whole experience. I for one was pleasantly surprised by how different the film turned out in comparison to Night's previous efforts. I recently found out that the director is a Twilight Zone fan and the influences are there to be seen but executed wonderfully. The acting was great and I am all for a good love story especially in these settings and the leads play it very convincingly. A few critics have noted that the film could have been shorter, maybe they feel the story could have fit into a twilight zone episode but i totally disagree. If anything Twilight Zone episodes were too short and rushed due mainly to the constrictions of television. The photography was superb and the suspense was terrific. This movie made a wonderful change from the regular popcorn pulp that is churned out with the added bonus of no CGI. It was a brave move by the director to take the film in a different direction this time round and i salute him, if only other film makers would take more risks, well done sir. Long may these films continue."

","Wohooow,what a movie!! I saw this film yesterday in "" avant-premiere"" and must say that this is one of the best drama's I've seen in months! From the trailer you would expect this to be a horror-movie but that's totally not true. I'm not saying that there are no thrilling moments,but they're not the main attraction of this movie. It's more about people living together in a small community and how they interact with each other. You really care about the different characters and when something bad happens to them it's as if it happened to you too! Very good acting and outstanding camerawork. The director knows very well how to build an eerie atmosphere! And the end of the movie is also a big surprise,I really didn't see it coming,and that's a rare thing these days in a time when giant blockbusters rule the cinema with predictable endings. I'm not saying that I don't like these mammoth SF-Aktion movies,in fact,I love them! But once in a while I like a good drama that moves slow and is moving without being overly sentimental,and that's not very common in 2004!

","Ever since Haley Joel Osment uttered the words ""I see dead people"" in Sixth Sense, it catapulted the Indian born director M Night Shyamalan into mainstream Hollywood. His movies has been blockbuster successes, with the use of paranormal and supernatural going ons in each one of them. It starts off with ghosts in ""The Sixth Sense"", superhero powers in ""Unbreakable"" and extra terrestials in ""Signs"". However it is not this that had made him one of the influentical directors of modern day cinema. It is the use of the unbelievable twist, in which catches the audience unawares. This latter ingredient in his movies can be a serious hindrance for him, since he is continuously will be known as the ""twist doctor"", and the audiences will be constantly trying to anticipate the massive twist in the movie.<br/><br/>In ""The Village"", the M Night ingredients are all there. The story is set in quiet isolated village in the olden times. It seems too idyllic, yet a sinister presence is keeping the villagers in their town. It seems that in the woods, which is opposite the village, lives evil monsters which maim and kill livestock and people who angers them. The villagers understood this and never set foot into the woods, in fear of these beasts. However one day, this all changes when one brave fellow, Lucius Hunt feeling that his curiosity has to be satisfied and ventures into the woods. This seems to be a bad idea, since the monsters causes havoc and places fear into the villagers, by skinning some livestock and hanging the carcasses from the porches. This changes the future of the village forever. With this story in the forefront, there is a romantic sub plot developing. This includes a love triangle between Lucius Hunt (Phoenix), the partially sighted Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the mentally unstable Noah Percy (Adrien Brody).<br/><br/>The actors in this movie are quite good, especially Howard's portrayal of Ivy, and Phoenix's of Lucius. There are good support roles by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, and not forgetting Adrien Brody. The cinematography is so atmospheric that you could feel the fallen leaves rustling underneath, as you first enter the woods. You could really feel that you were there.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>Now this is where my criticisms come into this movie review. I felt like that the story was too long and very plodding. Some people like stories to go slow, so that the characters can be developed, but I could not see it. It was going in such a slow pace, that a Skoda could have beaten it in speed. Also there were too many twists in the movie. With the movie being too slow, it is just getting boring after a while, even when you were meant to be surprised by the twist(s).I counted three and to be honest, the final one seemed so unbelievable that i felt like M Night had taken the easy route out of the movie. To be honest, I wish he had a better ending.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you have time to see a beautifully shot movie with good acting, but not the greatest of stories, then this is the one for you. But remember, anything that is a 12a is not a horror. Just look at The Haunting with Zeta Jones"

","***Serious Spoilers***<br/><br/>I liked the movie. I knew there was 'something up' when the characters kept referring to the outside world as ""The Towns"" all the time. That made me very suspicious. Also, I actually commented out loud in the theater ""Considering they are 'Those we do not speak of', y'all sure are speaking of them a lot!""<br/><br/>Unlike some other people who evidently went into the movie _looking_ for the twist, I found myself surprised by the stabbing of a main character, and didn't even notice the apparently anachronistic use of certain words and concepts (""dumpster"", etc). I also noted the (again, out of place) glass greenhouse.<br/><br/>Another thing I noted, after the fact this was all on a game preserve was revealed, was the fact that the village was lucky to remain secret as long as it had. Even if commercial planes were diverted from above the preserve (and this ignores the fact that planes _many_ miles away can be seen from their contrails), that does not mean a small, private plane could not fly over the preserve. Teens would try to sneak in to camp (or just as a lark, like the village teens standing on the stump), and of course, these days there are web sites that provide satellite imaging of any part of the world you like. Granted, the images are a few years old, but the village is what, 20-30 years old. Has NO ONE ever looked at a satellite image of the preserve and seen the buildings and fields???"

","'The Village' already had its work cut out to live up to the hype gushing over the Atlantic and I'm sad to say it failed in most categories for me.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot is about the only positive thing I can say about this film.<br/><br/>Even the most seasoned actors (Hurt & Weaver) seem to have difficulty with the script, with Hurt bordering on hammy.

I think it may be time to change the format.<br/><br/>Despite the big budget, the appearance of Sigourney Weaver (which is always a pleasure), the not so subtle Political messages and Nights shocking piece of acting, this film left me completely cold, bored and weary eyed (I have to say I even fell asleep at one point.)<br/><br/>Not one for my DVD collection I'm afraid folks - 2/10"

","Lucius (Phoenix) is the shy yet brave blacksmith in The Village, a place trapped by the presence of mysterious creatures in the woods which surround it. The creatures, against which the villagers must always be vigilant, will accept no incursion into their woods. This state of affairs manages both to protect the villagers from the outside world and make their lives within the village slightly more precarious. The only wrinkle in their perfect, crime free existence is the end of the medical supplies from the 'Towns' outside the woods. When a young child's life could have been saved by these medical supplies Lucius decides the time has come to brave the creatures wrath and enter the forest. But will his actions mean the end of the villages' existence in more ways than one?<br/><br/>This is an interesting film, which tries to tackle the serious issue of fear as a control and trust in community leadership. How do we create a better world for our children? Serious questions but this film also has a sense of humour. <br/><br/>The villagers all seem to make an effort to speak in a forced frontier version of American English. It is not clear whether this is poorly written dialogue or an intentional jarring to make you realize that there is something unnatural about the villagers and their cut-off way of life.<br/><br/>The romance between Phoenix and Howard is the most absorbing part of the film; it is a real pleasure to watch the quiet Lucius and Tom-boy Ivy developing their relationship and eventually their actions lead to the films finale. Phoenix seems to have cornered the market on vulnerable insecure men emerging as leaders and Howard is just wonderful as the strong and independent Ivy.<br/><br/>Some scenes don't reach the intensity the director was aiming for, but still the sentiment behind them is obvious. I found myself having to actively force my suspension of disbelief on some points, and the film could quite easily become unintentionally funny if you let it, this is especially so of our first sight of the creatures. If you go expecting a pioneer version of Predator or Alien you will probably be disappointed, but if you go looking for a gentle drama, well acted with a few boo scares along the way and some subtle insights into society you will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>If you liked The Others, Cold Mountain or Signs this film is for you."

","This Movie can be summed up into a category of words. I myself choose enthralling and intelligent. Though, perhaps it's too intelligent for most of you critics. M.

However, is you enter the cinema hoping for a non stop shocker, which is lacking in dialogue and plot, you're in a for a sore disappointment, as this movie is more of a tender look into the lives of those who have suffered, fear for their lives every day, which I think some viewers may not be able to appreciate.

","I decided to see this film because I knew it's director from such works as The Sixth Sense and Signs, the latter of course starred Joaquin Phoenix who also stars in this film. 'The Village' is a simple title for a complicated film which has many levels. I shall not give away any details, however I will urge everyone to see this film. I fear that when it is released on video and DVD that it will not do it justice compared to seeing it on 'the big screen'. The Village contains some of todays best actors. Bryce makes her debut in this film as a young blind girl with incredible courage and what a stunning debut it is! She certainly deserves to do well in her acting career and I'm sure she will accomplish many great things in her life. Other great actors in this film include William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Judy Greer and Adrien Brody who portrays a confusing character extremely well. However I found that Joaquin Phoenix was the best actor, not only in this film, but in any film I have yet seen. I was blown away by his quiet but emotionless character that is so hard to play. Never once does his character have a fault and not once does he not convince us of his characters personality. One of the faults I have heard of this film is that it's not 'scary'. I honestly think it is scary in a psychological way rather than the obvious horror portrayed in other films. I came away feeling scared of what people were capable of rather than the 'creatures in the woods'. So I suggest to you to experience this film for the fabulous story which fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, has the best writer, director and producer you could wish for and the best actors I have experienced. If you miss out on this film then you are purely missing out on cinema history."

The other was the poor use of exposition. Without giving too much away I thought the movie's ""faults"" were down to the fact that one man wrote/directed/produced it. It just needed someone to say ""that exposition is a bit too obvious - and there's a bit of a plot hole over here"". I think the concept was good - I just don't think it was executed very well...nothing a good script editor couldn't have fixed...

It was so dull, I almost walked out, which I never do (""Daredevil"" being the exception). Couple of rather gross scenes that made you react, but in general I kept waiting for the point of the whole thing to emerge. The big surprise ending left me thinking ""Hmmm"", not ""Wowee"".

","I saw The Village last night with no preconceptions except, ""didn't he do SIGNS! PAH!"". Hoping that this would be more sixth sense and less unbreakable/signs, I went along to see this film. The village, in my humble opinion, exceeds the quality of the sixth sense. This Shyamalan guy has a really great sense of timing and suspense. The atmosphere is incredible, especially in a cinema with really loud surround sound. Well done to whoever did the sound on this film as well, without that it may possibly have been as laughable as people are saying.<br/><br/>The village is, and I am saying this without feeling the slightest bit of shame, really creepy. The lack of gore and the fact that we are given only sneaky peeks of scary things makes it frightening. It would not be at all scary if we'd been shown even the slightest amount more gore/scary stuff.<br/><br/>The film is about a newly formed village of people kept inside the boundaries through blind fear of ""those we don't speak of"". No wonder nobody speaks of them, they're HORRIBLE! They are honestly really messed up, if I thought they existed I'd soil my pants too. I know that, after a while, as the mini society progressed, people would begin to question and become more and more curious about the towns outside of this little village, especially since the towns seem so much more developed, but it works because the village has only just been formed. Everyone, except for the elders, was raised there and accepts that way of life because they know of no other. They don't really have time to think about what might be better, they're too busy worrying about whether they're wearing the ""safe color"" or not and making sure that they have no trace of the ""bad color"" on or around them.<br/><br/>This film leaves you with a lot to think about and judge on a moral or even a ""there are holes in this narrative"" kind of way, although I kind of like the way that this narrative reveals itself. If you're nit picky or you try to work things out as every second of the film is unveiled before your eyes, please don't bother, you'll only complain. Enjoy as a passive audience member, not a connoisseur. Just make sure you see it when the 12-15 year old kids are tucked up in bed or your enjoyment may be spoiled by screaming girls."

The script is poorly written although the concept is kind of good, and the scenes are poorly acted to make things worse.

The mere mention of the ""magic rocks"" was so utterly stupid i had a hard time thinking of much else. Also - how could you have a whole ""VILLAGE"" as it were living - completely unbeknownst to the world - in the middle of a nature park? I just can't believe the utter stupidity of it all, but perhaps the worst part was the ending. I think the only perk was M. Night's cameo towards the end, although i am quite unsure why he would want to take credit for such a travesty.

","I almost didn't see this movie because of all the bad critics' reviews that I read about it, and I'm glad that I saw it anyway, because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Many of the reviews that I read said that it didn't meet the expectations of horror that were advertised, ""the twist"" was disappointing, and the action was plodding. I went into viewing the movie with an open mind as if I had heard nothing about it, and I can say that I totally disagree with those reviews. Rather than a horror movie, I see this movie as almost a fairytale, complete with suspense, romance, monsters, and a brave heroine in peril. The storyline also makes you think about what people are capable of doing to protect our loved ones - the misguided acts and the heroic ones. The atmosphere of the movie draws you into the action and you can feel the joy, fear, and emotional pain of the characters. I thought the performances of William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard were very strong. Bryce Dallas Howard fairly glowed. More than one unexpected and surprising event took place, and I was in tears at one point.<br/><br/>Although I had guessed what the final revelation would be by the end of the movie, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the film. The critics should stop rating M. Knight Shyamalan's movies by how effective ""the twist"" is, and just review each film independently on its own merits. This movie was not meant to be another ""Sixth Sense."" It can stand alone as an enjoyable, moving, and thought-provoking film."

Warning levels (slain animals, markings of the bad color, etc.) are manipulated by the Village elders in a similar manner that the Bush Administration manipulates color-coded ""terror threat levels"" to keep the citizens in perpetual fear which ultimately and ironically makes them lean towards their leaders for protection, giving the leaders more control even though they are the one's manipulating the threat after all.

The movie parallels the love interests of several of its main characters in a very clever and subtle way, which I found most enjoyable.

Its just one of those things.. I am curious as to others who may have seen the movie and could provide this information to me or even their thoughts about the Character. <br/><br/>Ivy never mentions a mother and always looks to her father hence I believe there is no mother present. One other thing I noticed that was disconcerting was the following. When Ivy was ""kneeling down"" and the townspeople were running around asking if anyone was hurt. Who was the old guy standing in the doorway. I don't remember seeing him as one of the elders.. So where did he come from?"

","I've heard all about the ""crappy secret"" in this movie, and after viewing it, I found it to be an unfair representation. I really enjoyed this film. I thought the twist (actually, there were several) was just as good as that in other thrillers -- ""the Others,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" etc. Think about it... if someone told you a film was about a bunch of birds going crazy and attacking people, would you think it was any good? But ""the Birds"" is a classic. This movie uses lighting, cinematography, and most of all suspense to thrill the viewer. I also thought the romance and performance by Joaquin Phoenix was very endearing. It's a fresh take on a new twist, and it all tied together nicely. Suspend some disbelief, have some fun, jump out of your seat -- it's a likable film!"

Somehow, even if you do guess the surprise ending (as many will) you will still find yourself questioning other possible ideas- surely the sign of a good movie well made? Acting is, as usual in Shyamalan's films, a treat, Joaquin Phoenix providing a sound performance, as well as the intriguing character of Bryce Dallas Howard. Parts of this movie made me really smile, the emotion coming from the two afore mentioned. Some kind of sweet, olde world love. It drew me in and made me want to know how it all unfolded.

","Spoiler!! I must admit, without appearing too pretentious, that I had guessed the ending before even seeing the film or reading about it. Having seen 'Steptford Wives' I toyed with the idea that 'The Village' would also turn out to be the contrivance of a single person intent on living in a utopian society cut off from the outside world. I had dismissed this idea though because the realities made it seem impossible but I was wrong.<br/><br/>I have since read many reviews claiming this film to be a disappointment but few have grasped the true message and nature of this film. It is not supposed to be a gripping thriller but an insight into a disturbed mind and a twisted reality. The trailer was, admittedly, cruelly misleading but that was only to attract the masses.<br/><br/>The camera work was exquisite at times and the acting was (despite the dialogue) sensitive and involving.<br/><br/>Now for the true message of the film. I see the film's Puritanical and quasi-Amish society as typical of many societies in the US at the time (19th century); ruled by the fear of God and restricted by the guidelines of their 'faith'. Here, Shamalayan has given us a subtle, cunning satire on a religious society ruled over by fear created from this faith and indeed religion as a whole. The Amish undertones and the 'Rules' that had more than a hint of the 10 Commandments about them revealed Shamalayan's true agenda.<br/><br/>This is not an adrenaline trip. It invites one to think, consider and learn. A true masterpiece."
"kgwyly-1","Null","0","0","18 August 2004"," BRILLIANT...SHYAMALAN'S BEST FILM TO DATE
","I don't quite understand what all the fuss is about pertaining to M. Night Shyamalan's latest film. I personally feel it is his best film and the best exercised combination of his writing and directing skills. Shyamalan is like a great novelist who can produce tale after intriguing tale that are not only tailored to his strengths but are fresh at the same time.<br/><br/>WRITING & DIRECTING: One of the reasons I admire Shyamalan is that he writes and directs all his films and retains complete control and vision of them. His directing skills here are amazing as he continually exhibits such patience with his subjects while keeping the camera still. That is a noble gift to have in this MTV-frenzied era of directing. He truly admires the position of the camera and the composition of the frame. Of course, this has been obvious since the first time I saw ""The Sixth Sense."" He is clearly one of the best directors working today and he has yet to disappoint me.<br/><br/>ACTING: A droolworthy group of actors were assembled for this movie. Of note are the performances of these actors and actresses: Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard. To my surprise, Howard emerges as the true star of the film and carries it brilliantly. Hurt, whose voice and demeanor can sometimes be almost narcoleptic in other films is a perfect fit here. His conversations with the elders in the film are stirring, especially one in particular late in the film. Phoenix, who remains relatively quiet as his character requires, becomes a fascinating character to watch as the film progresses. Brody, with probably the meatiest role in the film besides Howard, is brilliant and a fascinating portrayal of heartache and confusion in an important scene late in the film. Gleeson and Weaver are also quite good but didn't quite affect me like the other actors. Nevertheless, Howard is clearly the standout here. My only disappointment with the acting is the limited use of Cherry Jones. She was utilized brilliantly in ""Signs"" but here she is nothing but another town elder.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Ah, Roger Deakins. One of my favorite directors of photography. He's become a favorite of both Frank Darabont and the Coen brothers. His lighting at night is spooky as hell. He manages to make dark spaces LOOK like dark spaces. Because of the time period, the only lighting utilized at night are lanterns and torches. And that is all you see. And during the day the clouds are always overcast, making certain bright colors pierce the landscape.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant film and it is definitely Shyamalan's best. I'm proud that Shyamalan made this film. While it is vastly different from his other films in regard to the ""scare"" factor, it is clearly a more mature film. Hopefully, the creative energy that produced this film will bear even tastier fruit for his future projects.<br/><br/>MY RATING: **** out of ****"
"Angedelamort","10","0","0","20 August 2004"," A reflexion on today's America
","I have just seen the movie which I thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end. I have been pondering on the numerous ideas raised by the movie and have spent much time reading reviews on the IMDb board. Seeing how diverse and passionate the overall reactions to the movie are, I realized that M. Night Shyamalan fully succeeded in his enterprise. <br/><br/>**** SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>Many people walked into the movie theater expecting a scary movie dealing with the supernatural. Instead the movie deals with modern society, the fear of others, making up lies, keeping secrets ..... and the temptation to create a utopian society secluded and isolated from the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I am not surprised that most American viewers did not react favorably to the movie. ""The village"" is a metaphor of today's America dealing with its fears of terrorism and immigration. Shyamalan was inspired by the events of 9/11 when he wrote the scenario (something he talks about openly in Europe but keeps somewhat quiet in the US). The terrible things that each family in the village experienced in the past are symbolic of the trauma experienced by the attacks on the towers. Thus, the temptation to make up new fears (Iraq), manipulate people and build a wall around yourself ..... Lies, deception and secrets ....... Sound familiar ?<br/><br/>Yes, this is not your summer blockbuster movie. It's reflective movie which makes you think. Each person makes up his own opinion about the motivations of the elders in the village. Whether or not they are good people or completely clueless. <br/><br/>Yes, the outside world can be scary and reality harsh to deal with.... So how the does world cope ??? How do you make things better ????<br/><br/>The movie does not provide answers but has the merit to make people react. Just like people are deeply divided on Bush and Iraq, people will be deeply divided on this movie."

Except the ending annoyed me. I wanted it to continue ^^;; I wish I could explain, but I don't want to ruin the movie. But I will say this: I was hoping for a scene in which one of the elders would be discovered, by possibly Lucius Hunt, in costume.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody's role as the village idiot made me smile, especially during light moments such as Ivy's first sign of an attraction to Lucius."

","Expecting a movie that will have unexpected twists and turns I decided to see the movie the first weekend itself without getting any second hand impressions. I am lucky that I did that. The grey atmosphere of the The Village adds to the simple life style of The Villagers. The ""Bad Color"" stands out in this background. The chillness in the air touches your bones. Excellent cinematography. The acting was great by the entire cast. Though Sigourney Weaver was wasted. Or maybe she just paled in front of Bryce Howard. The cast took us back in time very convincingly. The innocence of the kids and adults alike was heart warming but at the same time there was always a worry that something bad might happen to them. The want of the youth to expand their horizons but curbed due to the fear of the unknown was well depicted. Great music and sound effects especially when Ivy is chased. Lastly, direction was simply great. Not an iota of what to expect or when to expect. And I came out thinking ""Why didn't think of this before?"""

How could it end like that? The movie could have been taken farther if they had stuck to the creature-in-the-woods theory, not the one that was chosen. The movie also might have been a little better, and more frightening than it was. I saw it at the drive ins, and at parts that were meant to be sad and emotional, people were crying alright, crying from so much laughter of the horrible acting and the stupid story lines.

","I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies because not only do they fulfill that craving to experience fear, but they also get into the experience of being human, and leave plenty to speculate about long after the film is over. ""The Village"" was no exception. Mr.Shyamalan's films are not cotton candy slasher films that leave you breathless and giggling from fear as if you had just stepped off from a roller coaster, but thought provoking and intelligent films. Despite terrible reviews, I find that this was his best film since the ""Sixth Sense."" It requires a patient and intellectual audience who will see beyond the ""horror film"" surface to the point of his tale, which I interpreted as an allegory for the fabric of society. If you are expecting Freddy Krueger you wont find him here (though there are definitely scenes reminiscent of the ""Blair Witch""), however his story is clever and touching and the fear that he creates is a fear that we can all relate to."

"india_no_jones","Null","0","0","17 August 2004"," Nice concept. Concept Illustration?? hmmm...
","OK. Firstly, I enjoy Shyamalan's movies. They're not your average fare and mainly his movies are not always what they seem at first glance.<br/><br/> From that point of view, The Village is as much a movie about monsters as Signs is about aliens. What I think Shyamalan does is write a story about a concept or a theme and choose to illustrate it in a way that grabs our attention. This method of illustration is the alien invasion in Signs or the monsters in The Village. That our assumptions and preconceived notions (""...but where is the twist???"") detract from our opinions about his movies and our movie-going experiences is a little unfortunate.<br/><br/>With those general comments out of the way, let me get to the movie itself. I've already said that the theme behind the movie was pretty good, possibly his boldest yet. I just felt that the story that he chose to illustrate his theme left a bit to be desired. The good thing about his previous movies was that all the plot points were in some way or the other tied in to the underlying story. Be it Joaquin Phoenix playing baseball in Signs or the children drinking water or having asthma. No wasted scenes and no coincidences.<br/><br/>Thats a problem in The Village. Some scenes appear to have been added on to bulk up the story and have nothing to do with the theme at all. The thin sub-plot between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver is an example. It feels like the story is a little thin and stretched.<br/><br/>The fact that the ending or so called twist was predictable is irrelevant. What Shyamalan attempts to do in this movie is make us wonder about the answer to the question ""Who are the real monsters?"".<br/><br/>Say what you will about the plot, the story and the dialogues. Shyamalan's skill as a director is increasing with every film and this one is wonderfully shot. The mood, lighting and music suggest a feeling of fear when the storyline sometimes slows down.<br/><br/>All in all a solid movie. Possibly his strongest theme but his weakest story so far. Well directed but plot, story could have been better written.<br/><br/>Overall:.. hmm.. 6.5/10..<br/><br/>p.s. can't wait for ""life of pi"", Shyamalan's next. The book is brilliant."

Night Shyamalan's films, there is the obligatory twist, which is evident in The Village about half-way though the movie.

"embrilliant","Null","0","0","23 August 2004"," Very Creative. (Don't know if it's a SPOILER)
","Like Signs, there really is something subjective that horrifies people in The Village. Some people suppose it to be a horror film while some people find out it is completely a love story. A girl ventures to save her fiancé's life. The environment, the buildings, the furnishings and their dressings make us believe that they are in an earlier time when people are unsophisticated. The elders of the village frequently hold conventions about the village. <br/><br/>Its music with mild melodies suggests an artistic atmosphere. The role Lucius Hunt played by Joaquin Phoenix is somewhat chubby and dumb, which is varied from Phoenix¡¦s roles in other films such as the one in Gladiator.<br/><br/>The story reveals the danger and the high criminal rates the modern American society contains. The movie is categorized in the genre of horror. To my mind, however, the flick is not that frightening actually since it is known that the threat is only from an objective creature. This is a very creative story. It effectively leads our emotions from expecting something terrifying to happen to feeling compassion for the village isolated from the modern but risky society. Shyamalan, the director and writer, overall has built a convincing thriller in this film."

","My girlfriend and I walked out of this movie wondering about a lot of things. Sure, it was a decently done movie, with an interesting (if somewhat predictable) twist at the end...but I felt like I was missing something. It was good, but not M Night good. M Night's movies are very purposefully written and directed, so much so that there just had to be something else to it. After discussing it for a while, my girlfriend and I came to the realization that this film is a social commentary about the current state of American...hidden inside a horror movie. We felt the real genius of the film was that M Night created a commentary more biting than Fahrenheit 9/11, but so disguised that most people didn't even realize it was a commentary. <br/><br/>We found it hard to believe that there would be so many parallels to the society in this film to our own post 9/11 world simply by accident. M Night is far too thorough a writer and director to let that happen. Surely it was by design. Think of this movie in the context of current events, and excuse that I saw it opening weekend and wasn't really looking for social parallels:<br/><br/>We live in a world created by events of terror. This world was created by, and is shaped by, a small group who use fear to control the masses for what they see as the greater good. The monsters we are afraid of were created by the very leaders who use the fear of them to maintain power and shape our society. The monsters our leaders created have in turn led to others becoming monsters themselves. Our leaders send out troops, blind to the whole truth, to protect and save those who have been harmed by the monsters created by their lies. When the troops return they are changed and unsure what to believe, but still have faith in the society, if not the leaders, and are comforted in their mission to save those they love.<br/><br/>Again, this is a broad overview from what I remember. I really want to see the film again paying close attention to hidden social parallels between this isolated society and our own current state of affairs."

Too many movie-goers have to have huge budget special-effects, and fast-paced plot driven movies to be entertained. Atmospheric, ethereal movies that not only make you care about the characters but capture the mood and essence of the time period they are set in seem lost on these viewers. Sure, Sixth Sense was good, but I am less taken by plot twists than the mood the director was able to generate in that as in his other films. My willing suspension of disbelief was not overly strained in any of his films, and I think The Village was superb film-making, with excellent acting and cinematography. If you need big explosions and CGI creatures and car chases to banjo music, maybe you should stick to movies like Independence Day, where the jet-fighter pilot/President of the United States communicates telepathically with the alien invader."

","Don't get me wrong, M. Night Shyamalan has proved to be a master of psuedo-suspense films. I say 'psuedo' because his movies transcend pass the big noise and shock of being pure horror to touch deeper themes. His films, while intending to scare you, are not only about the big scream - they are also about the little touches, the voices in your head, the feelings in your heart. <br/><br/>""The Village"" joins the ranks as another film of superb craftsmanship. Unfortanately for Shyamalan it winds up being his least effective, probably because he makes it more emotionally complex than it needs to be. Adrien Brody picked a hell of a follow-up to his Oscar-winning leading role, because his supporting job here doesn't register at all. He is the obligatory subplot who winds up being ""pivotal"" - Night, you did that already with Phoenix's character in ""Signs"". It worked a lot better then too.<br/><br/>There's also some odd moments of misdirection, Night choosing to use a wide shot when maybe a close-up would tie us better to the moment. This makes some of his more brilliant sequences all the more tough to swallow, cause you're caught saying, ""Do it more like that!"" <br/><br/>As for the film's plot and ""surprise"" twist, I won't go into the details and instead focus on the big picture. Most films of this type, where they intend to lead the story in one way before pulling the rug out from under you, fall victim to the before and after effect. In essence, the suspense and the dread and the anticipation of what comes next is often better than what actually comes next. When the secret is revealed, you may indeed be shocked, and if you're like me the actual method of revelation will have your pulse moving, but afterwards your thoughts will be, ""Is that all there is?"" <br/><br/>Night's films have always been at some level about suspension of disbelief, and ""The Village"" probably requires the most. Like ""Unbreakable"" he has constructed an average sum out of some brilliant individual parts. In short, ""The Village"" is too much of a peak and valley film, emotionally, psychologically, etc., to rank it up there with ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".<br/><br/>It may be time for Shyamalan to move in a different direction, utilizing his indisputable film skill for a radically new purpose. ""Ocean's Eleven"" showed us the jazzier side of Steven Soderbergh. I know at one point Night was asked for a screenplay to the next Indiana Jones movie, which once again seems to be stuck in development hell. How about another ""Stuart Little""? Ha! Relax, Night, you don't need to be THAT different."

","The Village is a well-made movie. If you are just waiting for the so-called ""twist"" in the movie, you will be missing out on a good story. Sit back and enjoy the characters and the plot. Forget about trying to figure out the twist, which the director of Sixth Sense is famous for. In many ways, The Village is like the old black and white Twilight Zone stories, only more detailed. If you don't spend your time trying to guess what the director has ""up his sleeve,"" you will be pleasantly surprised at the end. While not quite as good as Sixth Sense, this movie is definitely better than Signs. The acting of Ron Howard's daughter is especially notable. I would therefore definitely recommend this movie, except to those who expect lots of monsters. For what this movie lacks in monsters, it makes up for in being a good thought-provoking story!!"

","I was reading some of the reviews here, and while people certainly have a right to their opinion, I really think they missed the point. This was true to Night's other movies in it's vision and attention to detail. It was different however in that he wasn't going for the ""shocker ending"". The ending was to me just part of the story. There were tense moments, monsters, and perhaps events one did not see coming... however- the conclusion was only what the people in the film were running from: that violence had touched them where they thought it would not. That you cannot control your environment to that degree and that bad things can and will happen ""where you live"". You can however choose to be brave in the face of it to help someone who needs it; to be an unsung hero if you will. That's it- simplified of course. I could go on about the imagery and the metaphors that he used, but instead just go watch it- A brilliantly told, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed film."
"crombiekid711","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," Well the final twist was good...
","When watching the trailer of 'The Village' you would think it would be a horror movie but it is far from a horror movie. The Village is an ensemble drama. M. Night Shyamalan tried something new with his new movie. He put his signature surprise ending but everything happening before that is different from any of his other movies. Unfortunately, everything that happens before the ending is boring. Warning: There will be some spoilers!<br/><br/>The plot is about a secluded area called 'The Village'. No one can leave the village where the ""towns"" lay because there are monsters in the woods. So all the people of the village are stuck there but do seem to be living happily. In the village lives a blind girl named Ivy Walker (newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard) and Lucius Hunter (Joaquin Phoenix) who fall in love. However, Ivy's mentally ill friend, Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), stabs Lucius because he is jealous and doesn't want to lose Ivy. Lucius wound is extremely serious but the elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt), allows Ivy to venture off through the woods to the towns to get the medicine for Lucius.<br/><br/>That is the most I can say about the plot without ruining everything. However, I can say the plot was extremely dry and boring until the very end when everything came together. In the first half of the film, we basically see love blossom between Ivy and Lucius. However, Lucius is such a dry and forgettable character that there is no connection what so ever between them.<br/><br/>This could be the worst and most forced love story that I have ever seen. The second half, however, picks up as we see Ivy venture out to find medicine for Lucius and find out the truth about the village.<br/><br/>This is an ensemble cast so there really isn't a character you follow scene to scene like you would see in other M. Night Shyamalan films. If I had to name a main character though, it would be Ivy Walker played by Brynn Dallas Howard. She is a newcomer and her first performance is by far the best one in the film. She captures a scared and blind person amazingly. Joaquin Phoenix, however, has the most boring character in the film and he ruins the first half of the film. However, its not him as a actor who ruins the first half of the film but its his boringly written character. Adrien Brody is also amazing as the mentally ill Noah Percy. He truly shows his acting ability here but unfortunately as soon as his character is important he disappears. William Hurt gives his usual performance as a dry and plain character, who happens to be the elder in this movie. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in this film. She does the best she can with the little screen time she has. She deserved a bigger and better role than this one.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this film is when the twist is revealed, everything comes together but we do not see how is affects the characters. This is by far the biggest problem with the movie because the most exciting part about the twist is seeing the characters reaction and we don't see that. I can't get into this complaint too much without spoiling the movie but the ending was just plain awful even though the twist was great.<br/><br/>Overall, the final twist is great along with Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brody's performances. But other than that the film is very disappointing. If you don't know anything about the movie I recommend you to see it just for the final twist."
"leachsongs","Null","0","0","13 August 2004"," The question on our minds are...is this film an M. Night film?
","In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan began his big film making career with the hit thriller: ""The Sixth Sense"". Then came ""Unbreakble"" followed by ""Signs"". ""The Village"" is a new one. A new suspense/thriller that may make some M. Night fans disappointed in the fact that it isn't that truly scary. It is mostly a dramatic romance with added chills and thrills along the way, not to mention downright scary images/scenes. But what some viewers may be looking for, is a ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, ""Signs"" is much more comparable with ""The Village"" in that it is mostly dramatic and touching with a dropping tear, than the horror and violent images and scary sequences like ""Sixth Sense"". I'm not saying ""The Village"" is a complete waste of time and money, because it is worth seeing again and again, but if you are looking for a ""Sixth Sense"" i'd turn back, if I were looking for a downright chilly drama/romance, take a seat and enjoy the ride!"

You will love this movie if you can appreciate really having to think for yourself.

"dexter59","10","0","0","16 August 2004"," The village was great!
","I really liked how these people lived in the woods happy and peaceful. And these Woods are populated by mythical creatures who fear the color red and who will attack, and presumably kill, anyone who crosses the border from the village into them. They have an accord with the Village- you leave us alone, and we'll leave you alone. And even though the villagers live in a society ruled by fear, they live happy simple lives away from MONEY, but it was a lie. Give them a choice don't rule a society with FEAR!<br/><br/>People get the wrong idea with this movie.<br/><br/>I think it is because of the director's history with making a certain kind of movie, and that's what the audience expects to see when they watch a ""M. Night Shyamalan"" film. They expect to be sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting for those big TWISTS so they can scream out loud when they are taken by surprise (hey, I did just that in ""The Sixth Sense."")<br/><br/>And that's exactly what Touchstone Pictures tried to sell ""The Village"" as- another thriller just like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs."" Heck, they even used clips from those 3 in ""The Village""'s trailer! That is likely to frustrate moviegoers who will undoubtedly be disappointed if a thriller is what they expect to see. I should know- I'm one of those viewers. It's like Touchstone didn't know how to market this movie, and so they thought, ""Hey, we'll just sell it through Shyamalan's other hits and that will bring in the box office bucks."" And they're probably right, even though they have upset a lot of viewers in the process. <br/><br/>That is what gives this movie such a bad rap!<br/><br/>I think that ""The Village"" fell victim to the circumstances of marketing. If you go in thinking it's another ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs,"" then you'll undoubtedly be disappointed. But if you can shut out those thoughts and just watch it as a movie, then you might see something else."

","""The Village"" was actually not as bad as what people had told me. I enjoyed it quite abit....although, some of the conversations going on between the characters were a little off subject, if the film even had one. The music was twice as loud as the voices, which explains why I pretty much had no idea what was going on half the time. I don't want to give away too much of it, so I'll just say I'm glad that the producer kept it in reality, but at the same time I'm alittle upset that he did just that. Go see this movie and you'll understand why I say that. It had a twisted ending which is good, who doesn't like endings like that? If you go see this film, you'll find that you will be jumping at the wrong times. Acting was fine, story was disturbing but good, and the loud music in the theater kind of ruined it. I'd give it a ""Two eyes barely open"" rating."

","I am a fan of great storytelling and in this movie, more than any of his others, the storyteller in M.

In previous movies, the twist(s) changed everything about the movie - in The Village, the twist(s) change everything about your (the audience's) perspective on the story, but left the movie alone. In this right, MNS has demonstrated a thoroughness of thought that few other writer/director/producers seem to put into a single sub-plot.<br/><br/>Not that everything was a surprise - many things in this movie are plainly evident, almost daring you to question your beliefs in the utterly obvious. In the end, however, you question WHY you believe the obvious.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended, a real ""makes you think"" movie that incorporates the best of true horror with the best storytelling so far this decade.<br/><br/>-- Mike :)"

And it happened time and time again!!! There was the microphone snaking its way into the screen or just hovering there, throughout various scenes. It became so distracting that people were pointing and laughing. Millions of dollars poured into a movie and they can't take care of that? That alone was horrifying enough, then to add a weak twist and purely comical creatures just completely took advantage of the audience. M. Night - you're no Alfred Hitchcock.

"NoArrow","Null","0","0","22 August 2004"," Aside from Bryce Dallas Howard's stunning debut, this is a major letdown from Shyamalan, definitely his worst
","Before I start let me just say that I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Sixth Sense' was the most frightening movie experience I've ever had, 'Unbreakable' had a terrific slow buildup to a glorious climax and ending (with great performances too) and with 'Signs', his best movie, he created wonderfully realistic characters before getting into the horror parts of the story. He is one of the most interesting filmmakers today, and one of the best thriller directors in decades.<br/><br/>Reading this you might think my expectations for 'The Village' were highthey weren't. The movie was already spoiled for me, which doesn't necessarily ruin it (I knew the endings of both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and still thoroughly enjoyed them) and I heard many negative reviews, including my idol Roger Ebert's one-star review of the film. I had low expectations; it was about as bad as I thought it'd be.<br/><br/>This is a disappointment, because I thought the story was intriguing when I first heard of it, and the trailer sent shivers down my spine. The plot takes place in 1989, in a village surrounded by a forest. No one dares to enter the forest because of 'Those We Do Not Speak Of', fierce creatures that, until we first see them, all we know about them is that they're 'big' (naturally, of course, seeing that they're not supposed to speak of them). For the first hour or so we mostly get to know the characters and their stories. There's the leader Edward Walker (William Hurt), his blind daughter Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the boy she loves, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver), who has feelings for Edward. Oh, and the retarded Noah (Adrien Brody) who prances around the village and also loves Ivy.<br/><br/>Before I start into my major quibbles I'll just mention a few things that annoyed me. Shyamalan has filled his script with a lot of extra crap to make it soundwell, cooler, I guess. The creatures  which could very well have been called 'The Creatures'  are instead called 'Those We Don't Speak Of', though no one in the village ever has any reluctance or fear in mentioning them (this is clear in an early scene in a school classroom, when young children talk about them with Edward and no one seems to mind). Also, the 'bad colour' that supposedly attracts the creatures and the 'safe colour', whichdoesn't, I guess, have little relevance to the plot.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most is how all the characters spoke! They talk like someone (someone very young) would think 1800s people would talk like. Edward Walker takes an eternity to make a point because of all the pseudo-1800s crap Shyamalan shoves in. In the end this kind of makes sense (kind of) but that doesn't make the journey there any less excruciating on the ears.<br/><br/>Some subplots were also pointless and dull, like Alice's romance (or lack thereof) with Edward. She likes him, he apparently likes her, they have a brief scene together near the end, but their whole story is never cleared up.<br/><br/>The acting is another low point, most of the time anyway. Joaquin Phoenix has a great scene with Bryce Dallas Howard and an interesting character, which could've made quite a hero, but because of a plot element which I won't spoil her becomes seriously underused. Brendan Gleeson and Judy Greer  as Ivy's sister  were also underused. William Hurt has a big part, but his dialogue is the absolute worst. There's a point where he delivers a big speech, and his facial expression and voice are great, but his lines are terrible, so it's hard to admire it. I was also surprised that Sigourney Weaver was so confident about the movie in interviews, because on screen she looks terribly uncertain as to whether she's in a good movie or not. Oh, and I once thought that any actor could play a retarded person marginally wellAdrien Brody proved me wrong here.<br/><br/>There is one fantastic performance here, and that's from first-timer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) as Ivy. She has the energy and confidence that the other cast members lack, and somehow manages to get all the best lines. She plays blind perfectly, and when she cries we think it's her crying, not the script. I look forward to her next film role.<br/><br/>A lot of people are complaining about the end twist of the movie. There are about three, one was surprising, one was clever and well executed, and one was aggravating, but it didn't have to be. You see, in 'Signs' Shyamalan spent the bulk of the film setting up his characters and their situation, how the aliens would affect them, before moving to the horror scenes, like the terrifying scene in the dark cellar. He seems to be doing the same thing in 'The Village', but just when you think the horror stuff will start, something happens that will pretty much prevent the rest of the movie from being scary.<br/><br/>I think Shyamalan thought he was making a terrific horror film because he focused more on the characters and their stories, with the horror story as more of a subplot. Problem is, the characters weren't all that interesting, except for Ivy, and the horror parts weren't scary, except for one small jump. What 'The Village' needed was just a little more focus on the creatures, making them scarier and not campy (I laughed when I first saw 'Those We Don't Speak Of').<br/><br/>But, I'm willing to forgive; after all, every director has a stinker here and there. I'll look forward to Shyamalan's next film, 6.5/10."

","I know I'm not alone when I say that I knew what the ending was going to be but I still couldn't forget how well made this film was leading up to something fairly predictable. I hope future viewers will ignore what the others are saying about this and judge it for themselves and see that it's an effective mystery. Story is about a village that is deep in the woods where the inhabitants raise livestock and farm and live by a set of common rules which includes that no one ever sets foot in the woods surrounding their village. They have a truce with the creatures that live in the forest where they both respect each others borders but the people still have round the clock watches in towers just in case the alarm is needed. The village is run by Edward Walker (William Hurt) who keeps things running by consulting with the elders on issues at hand. Edward's daughter is Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is blind but still very strong willed and she is in love with Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) who petitions for a chance to venture into the woods.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>The village idiot named Noah (Adrien Brody) is also in love with Ivy and he stabs Lucius badly which leaves him on deaths door and desperately needing medicine to combat the infection he has acquired. Ivy tells her father Edward that she will go get the medicine from the town but first he confides in her about the secret of the creatures.<br/><br/>
M. Night Shyamalan directed this and shows his usual gifts as a storyteller such as well written characters, deliberate pacing, and of course the twist ending and while I understand that many did not care for this I am still recommending it because everything leading up to the ending is very well done. One of the best things about Shyamalan's films is the taut editing that keeps viewers guessing and occasionally jumping out of their seats and this is no different. The editing reminds me a lot of how Clint Eastwood edits his films in that every scene is significant and every shot has meaning which is why his films are still fun to watch a second and third time. Howard as Ivy gives an inspired performance and their were times when some of the lines of dialogue she recites sounds a lot like poetry especially when talking about seeing the world in her own way. I do admit that I knew what kind of ending was coming up and it's no fun to figure something like that out but I was intrigued when one of the creatures pops up later in the film. Also, one can't dismiss Hurt's character sending his blind daughter into the woods when he probably could have gone himself. This is a glaringly strange moment in the story that I think hurts the film and with the ending I can understand the viewers frustration. This is not one of Shyamalan's best efforts but it's still a good mystery and like ""Signs"" it possesses some truly eerie and nerve wracking moments."

Sure, I agree that the movie was marketed incorrectly, however, that doesn't mean that it was a bad film. Acting was excellent by Bryce Howard, Joaquin Phoenix (as usual) and the rest of the cast. Shyamalan has a great vision of cinematography and atmosphere and James Newton Howard's score tells the story by itself and in my opinion is one of his best yet.<br/><br/>If you go into the movie, forget about what the critics say, sit back in your seat and let yourself into the story, you'll probably find that it's a heartbreaking love story with enough frightening situations to keep you on your toes. Too many people went into this movie desperately trying to figure out the much talked about ""twist"" instead of letting it flow naturally. If this had been Shyamalan's first film, I bet it would have merited the same praise as The Sixth Sense. <br/><br/>This movie was not supposed to be the biggest thriller of all time; if that's what you were looking for, you may be disappointed.

","It is no surprise that this film has been so misrepresented by the media. It is not the ""horror flick"" it has been made out to be. With such a prestigious name in the industry attached it is no wonder, but it seems to combine his previous film themes with the perfect blend of plot and chills. If you are looking for a terrifying thriller, this would be a poor fulfillment. However that does not mean that it is not a worthwhile film. On the contrary, going in with an open mind, I was enthralled and I find it is among my recent favorites. The writing is honest, the plot twists and turns are jaw-dropping and the acting is superb. I have heard it described as ""artsy"" and I must agree. The filters and setting give is a distinctly artistic feel and the establishing shots are breathtaking, though awkwardly placed from time to time. Howard is a phenomenal leading lady that we will no doubt see more of. One other point of interest is the amazing score. Dominated by strings and woodwinds it bathes the entire piece with remarkable ambiance. Overall I found it to be a very enlightening experience and those who I have accompanied for, the most part, concur."

","This latest installment of Shymalan's horror flicks did not deliver on the goods that were advertised. The previews to this movie indicated fear, suspense and horror. I neither screamed, nor gasped, nor jumped from my seat. Instead, I snored, stared into space, and continually checked my watch in anticipation of the eleven o'clock news. I'm still wondering what the ""twist"" is that's been making all the headlines? I at no time believed the story to be in any time-frame from the beginning. There's parts to society that exist in this manner today. The Amish for instance. So really, if the time-line was the gimmick, it just didn't catch me. That's a whole lot of movie to depend on an incredibly weak ""catch."" Perhaps the twist was the identity of the adversary? The ""...persons we're not to speak of..."" Honestly, to say that was a ""twist"" would imply that it hasn't been done before. Did Shymalan ever see a single episode of Scooby-Doo? Because IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE. Really, if you couldn't see it coming, it's probably because you were sleeping, or checking the text messages on your cell phone. I think success makes people stupid and haughty. And I seriously doubt Shymalan entertained the idea of letting anybody else read this script. Because if he had, probably 9 out of 10 writer's would have told him IT STINKS. Take it back, spend more time developing the story and re-think the ending. Movies don't always need a twist. To become stuck in that MOLD, would be similar to an entertainer never receiving a make-over in order to stay in touch with the buying audience. Like M.C. Hammer coming out in 2004 with the same baggy-pants, and gheri-curl, and doing the ""running-man"" dance like he did in 1988. Change is GOOD. The problem is, if you stake your entire reputation on movies with a twist, then your success will be soley judged on the twist. Not on your ability to direct, or film, or write, but on the single ability to make the twist work. And if they don't work, you've failed, and an entire story is ruined on the anticipation of a single aspect of the movie. In my mind, this movie was a failure. The twist was weak and uninteresting. I kept waiting for the real woods people to show up at the end, but alas, it was ""A FARCE, ....a farce!"" Deeply disappointed."

Not only does he surprise you with the ending, you just don't know where he is heading with the ending till you actually arrive there. The exact ending I feel could have been a little better, but I wouldn't know what you could really do to change it due to the fact you really felt the ending occurred a few minutes before.

Although I I wasn't sure that she was right, I kept waiting in the film to see how the ""twist"" would be executed. Since our first sighting of the ""monsters"" was so obvious that ""they"" were just people dressed in red capes with stuff on them, I thought that maybe the twist would be that, although the ""monsters"" were fake,there would actually turn out to be real monsters. I had hoped for something more imaginative than what my wife suggested, and was a bit disappointed when she was basically right. <br/><br/>I was confused though. The photo showed all of the ""elders"" standing in 70's-era clothes in front of a ""Counseling Center."" Were they all mental patients? Were they the counselors? Were they criminals who themselves killed all the people mentioned on the voice-over when they went through whom in their families were dead and how they died? <br/><br/>My first comment when the end credits suddenly started rolling was, ""That's it?""

This also occurred, except this time the focus is more on the woman (Howard's character) than on the man (Phoenix's character), whereas in the previous 3 movies, the focus was on the man (Willis's characters in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable and Gibson's character in Signs).  Third, a brief cameo by the director, which did happen, though in a different style than in previous times.<br/><br/>After seeing the Village, I know discern a fourth feature common to all 4 movies; one of the main characters has an extraordinary ability which he/she does not fully appreciate at first, but later comes to use with great responsibility.  This was the boy's sixth sense in the first movie, the security guard's unbreakable body in the second movie, the daughter's appreciation of water in Signs, and the blind girl's ability to ""see"" several steps ahead in this movie.  <br/><br/>Various other devices were stolen from the previous three movies for use in this one.  These include the masked villian which few discern until it is too late (like Jackson's character in Unbreakable), the artificial villian (the ghosts in Sixth Sense), and the various characters who are widowed, orphaned, or have suffered the premature or even violent loss of a loved one (Gibson's widowed character in Signs).  These various devices appear as major plot events in the Village, though in a form that is hidden until the story has finished.  <br/><br/>In all, the scares weren't as scary, the plot twist was not as sudden, the dialogue a bit artificial, the villian was really not evil, just an ""idiot"", and the music not as captivating.

And as usual there are whinges about the twist and how it is a cheat. It's not a cheat if there's no contradiction. The comments I've read here seem to have ignored the deeply spiritual/religious side of all Shyamalan's work, and that is to the fore here. If you have not seen this movie and wish to be surprised by it, do not read the following sentence: The Village is like The Truman Show, but with Christof inside the bubble.

Do yourself a favor, save your money for something good, and wait till it comes out of pay per view or comes into Blockbuster, if you're really anxious to be disappointed. It seems M.

","I do apologize for the title.  I will not give up anything and there is a small place in the movie called the resting rock, i will not lie. However, I will not give away spoilers.<br/><br/>  M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village""  is about a quaint, peaceful, tranquil, and boring little village in the middle of a clearing surrounded by forestry. The little village is not quiet though. People are living in fear. fear of something they have never seen, to an extent, something that has never attacked them, something they do not speak of.  They have three real rules in the town.  Don't let the color 'red' be seen. Don't go into the woods, and when you hear the warning bell, run like hell.  Thats all well and good.  But as you watch the movie, you begin to see the ultimate twists and turns that Shyamalan is known for.  The acting is very good, each person seemed to feel their role as simple 19th century villagers. <br/><br/>  The village itself is very authentic looking.  The borders to the village (wooden flag polls) that line what seems to be a mile wide little town. everything down to the lock on the 'quiet room' door is that of the turn of the century. Shyamalan did another excellent job keeping the scenery authentic.  Since all of his other movies were set in the late nineties and the early millenium this must have been an interesting change for him.  He took that curve very well I must say. Overall, this is a hard review to write since saying anything that happened in the movie would give away a shock, I must advise you go see this one yourself.  If you have a date, he/she may jump into your arms. It does shock both sexes. I saw people of all ages in the audience jumping and gasping at certain scenes.  Heck even I jumped, and I do not do that very often.  So I hope you'll who do watch it, enjoy it! -knightblade"

","While not quite as good as 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense', I found 'The Village' very enjoyable. It was eerily atmospheric with the usual unexpected twists M. Night Shyamalan delights in. This film is a reminder that with good camera-work and an original story, CGI and computer-added effects are not always needed.<br/><br/>The story centres around an American village of the Nineteenth Century that is surrounded by woods inhabited with strange creatures. There is a truce between the villagers and the creatures that so long as the villagers don't wear red nor breach the woods then they will not be harmed. This truce is violated when a young blind girl has to cross through the woods to bring medicine for an injured loved one.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a vague summary but I can't say too much without ruining the twists (which there are three of).<br/><br/>Some critics have said they saw the ending a mile off but somehow I doubt it and I imagine these critics are the sort of people who criticise a film to make themselves look 'sophisticated' and 'intelligent'. I think Shyamalan has created another masterpiece and directed excellent performances from the cast, in particular William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard, although Sigourney Weaver did seem a little under used.<br/><br/>One major problem is that this is the sort of film that should be released in the US and the UK on the same date. Shyamalan could find a drop in UK sales primarily because some UK cinema-goers will know exactly what the twists and may avoid the film are thanks to a number of inconsiderate American viewers who saw the film then in their reviews announced to the world what happens without leaving spoiler warnings. Therefore, I and a few of my friends went in knowing exactly what would happen, and like all of Shyamalan's films, knowing did take some of the fun from the storyline."

I hasten to add that I've never read Running Out of Time by M.P. Haddix, the book it's allegedly based on, either.  I was just so BORED, my mind started to wander aroud the several yawning credibility gaps. The real giveaway was the pre-eminent role the women played in the Council of Elders.  Even if you've only seen the film Witness you'll know that pre-industrial societies weren't keen on giving women any kind of  political voice.  Either The Village was badly written and had sacrificed realistic period social reality to pander to modern actresses need for more vocal, prominent roles - and let's not dismiss the ""badly written"" idea out of hand - or there was another explanation for, to give a single glaring example, Sigourney Weaver's character being allowed to lead the town meeting warning about animal mutilations.

Shyamalan's story is laid out to build tension nicely, the camera-work is clever and attractive, the characters are interesting and likable even though they are not highly complex, and the creatures are genuinely creepy.

I like the fact that his films are more psychological than simply grossing the viewer out and scaring the wits out of you. This movie is just scary enough! It was scary without being frightening. The actors were believable and I just loved the setting for the movie which was filmed only a few miles from here. The storyline was interesting and kept you guessing what the devil was going on. Several friends have seen it since I did and they all loved it too! Kudo's go out to you...AGAIN M. Night!"

","Disappointing? Only if you go expecting your typical horror movie. Though deeply terrifying at times this is a story-driven film, not a mindless adrenaline rush. Like his films before, M. Night Shyamalan gives us a complex and nuanced story. Hurt and Weaver are established masters at their craft and not surprisingly they deliver fully on the promise of their reputation. Phoenix once again lends a powerful likeability to his pensive hero. It is what Bryce Dallas Howard contributes that is most refreshing, however -- a character unlike any other, unique and not in any way cliché. Additionally, this tale is artfully presented and a handful of particularly stunning shots stand out as startling images long after the film is over."

","M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is characteristic of his other films in that there is always a twist at the end the viewer does not expect.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's films tend to appeal to a more artistic group of movie-goers, (especially ones who can use proper grammar and punctuation) as his films are not cut and dry like Spielberg, Lucas or others in those genres. His films are left somewhat untied at the ends to give the viewer the option of drawing their own conclusion and thinking for themselves, instead of letting the writers do it for you.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Shyamalan's other films, you will most definitely like this one. I didn't particularly care for Unbreakable, but the others made an impression on me, and I admire his style.<br/><br/>The acting might be somewhat less than perfect, with the exception of Phoenix, who, as always, gives a wonderful performance. However, the setting, supposedly turn of the century rural America, might make up for the simplistic dialogue.<br/><br/>Again, any fan of Shyamalan's previous works will enjoy this well-made, intellectually stimulating film."

The Village is a much more balanced film, with a gradual revealing of characters and plot that kept me involved enough to really enjoy the ending.

"dee.reid","7","0","0","18 August 2004"," A most complex and troublesome film
","""The Village,"" M. Night Shyamalan's latest twisting thriller, is full of ideas and creepy moments, but is hurt by much subtle complexity and very troubling storytelling.  Since he hit it big in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" he has become one of Hollywood's last truly innovative filmmakers, and therein lies the problem (I think).<br/><br/>We've come to expect so much from him lately, that we may flock to his latest flick and then comes a big letdown after a most wonderful buildup. But that doesn't automatically make ""The Village"" any less thoughtful; at least he tries.  Most other directors wouldn't have lasted past the first hour.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has been on a wild streak since ""The Sixth Sense,"" and most people would agree (though I don't) that ""Unbreakable"" was a letdown and the masses are pretty much divided on ""Signs.""  Die-hards will unanimously agree that ""The Village"" is a monumental letdown and should never have seen the light of day.<br/><br/>Superstition is the latest topic up for discussion with ""The Village."" Shyamalan seems to have an interest in exploiting certain aspects of our culture and using them to full effect.  In ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was childhood fears and ghost stories.  In ""Unbreakable,"" we learned about superheroes and that they may be ordinary people like you or me.  In ""Signs,"" we got a lesson about faith and an alien invasion.<br/><br/>""The Village"" plays with the popular superstitions of a Puritan-like community and uses those to set up a story about deadly creatures that live in the woods outside the town.  And one of its citizens is questioning those beliefs and is eager to see what truly lies outside the town's borders. Shyamalan plays with these beliefs, getting us to accept them like the people of this community and terrorize us at the same time.<br/><br/>He has a way with endings and ""The Village"" is no different from any of his previous three blockbusters.  To me, it did come as a big shock and was totally un-hinted on earlier in the film.  In ""The Village"" however and unlike the previous three, Shyamalan has created an atmosphere that is deliberately misleading and that is something I didn't find in ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" or ""Signs.""<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Village"" is still a valiant, if somewhat lacking effort from one of our last and most innovative directors."

","Overall, 'The Village' was an entertaining flick. The movie did well in creating suspense, all the actors were great and I liked plot. However, if your looking for a movie with another one of those spectacular twist endings, such as the 'Sixth Sense', then you'll most probably be disappointed (much like with every other M.Night movie after 6th Sense). The twist ain't great and its actually pretty predictable but if you go in just expecting to see a good movie, not anticipating some sort of brilliant ending that will leave people breathless as they exit the cinema, I think you'll be pleased. I recommend that people see this movie on DVD tho. There's no need wasting money to see it on a giant screen."
"paulodaly","7","0","0","10 August 2004"," Slow, a little dull to begin looks and sounds fantastic but fails to deliver the shock ending.
","The movie starts off with an interesting premise, an isolated town away from civilization kept in line by fear of the monsters that roam the nearby woods. Unfortunately that's really about as interesting as M. Night Shyamalans latest offering gets.<br/><br/>Beautifully set in the woodlands of middle America, this little township certainly looks the part with excellent set design, cinematography and visual shots. This coupled with excellent sound effects certainly builds it up to being a Shyamalan movie. So far so good it looks and very importantly for this genre sounds the part too with excellent creepy noises from the darkness.<br/><br/>Character development is where this movies starts to slide, William Hurt the towns elder is simply a cardboard cut out bellowing out warnings and historical fact, Sigorney Weaver simply isn't in any way remotely interesting or important to this movie as her script and her role seem pointless. I genuinely thought Joachim Phoenix would be the saving grace or at least give us a little comedic relief like his character in Signs, but he barely even has lines and stumbles across the ones he does have. Bryce Dallas Howard is very good in what she has to do and is a star to look out for in the future, but sadly will not be remembered for this role.<br/><br/>Then, as per all Shyamalan movies, is the twist in the tale, well maybe this movie simply was thought out as well, but i figured it out from about half way through which simply ruined the movie for me. It wasn't nearly as surprising or interesting and any of his previous movies even the poor Unbreakable was better and more believable than this. The most thought provoking thing about Shylamans movies is the twist and in this simply fizzles out and leaves you feeling nothing for this movie no love, no thought, and a lack of caring for it. Maybe he has exhausted this type of movie now, this was one twist movie too many i feel. He should try his hand at telling a good story instead of trying to make us think about the movie when we leave, because most people wont think about this movie at all."

","I would like first to apologize for any grammar or spelling mistake, English is not my first language.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it didn't attract the right crowd. >From what I could see from the preview, it really looked like an horror movie, the kind of movie that makes you whimper in your seat with what i call ""jumps"" you know when the monster jumps out of nowhere and scares the hell out of you (when it's well directed although) BUT it was not that, the monster story is more like a pretext to talk about values, fear, isolation and the myth of utopia with a touch of suspense.<br/><br/>Luckily for me, I enjoy dramas and suspense so I really liked the movie even if it was not what i expected, I think I prefer it to be like that than an horror flick. But it is obvious that anyone who was really interested in seeing a horror movie might felt cheated. And those who would have liked the movie but didn't like horror didn't go to see it because they thought it would be an horror movie. I would personally blame it on the previews who were misleading.<br/><br/>The same thing happened with the movie ""Willard"" (The remake not the old one, the old was not very good) I think it was a very great dark movie about anger, rejection, revenge and social misfits (the movie is not perfect I admit it but I still think it is great :) ) Anyone who would have liked it didn't go because they thought it would be a gore-filled tripes-all-over-the-place and rats-killing-spree horror B movie and those who wanted that and went to see it were deceived.<br/><br/>Well lets return to the Village, shall we ? To be honest, the plot was OK, YES the twist was predictable but I don't think the twist is the main point of the movie, the actors were great (all hail to adrian brody and Bryce Howard) the D.O.P is wonderful, simply stunning and the artistic direction is really great (the choice and the reminiscence of colors was well done) and the music is incredible<br/><br/>It IS a good movie and I think that it deserves a chance. Well let's give it 3 stars out of 5. And this as they say is that."
"lawrence-55","Null","0","0","9 August 2004"," Forget the twist, it's a love story.
","My verdict on last night's UK preview of The Village and M. Night Shyamalan's post-screening talk?: A moving love story. A masterful piece of ensemble acting. Beautiful & moody cinematography (how did he manage to steal Roger Deakins from the Coen brothers for long enough?). Great tension and emotion, with just a few hints to let you know there's something else not quite right (apart from ""those we must not mention"", that is).<br/><br/>The film has superb acting. Edward Walker (Hurt), Lucien (Pheonix) and Noah (Brody) are first-class performances but the relative newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard, is the real star, as Ivy.<br/><br/>Wonder why Sigourney Weaver got good billing but only a support role? Answering our audience questions, Night hinted this was an homage to Alien where the established actors set the scene but, with a sudden change of direction, it was the relatively-new Weaver who stole the show. After Kirsten Dunst declined, Night gave Howard the role without an audition, and knew she'd steal it. <br/><br/>How did he get such a tight ensemble cast? Well, having the 14 principle players arrive 3-weeks before shooting to live on set in those Pennsylvanian woods did a great deal for their bonding. It wasn't just the American History and Utopian Society lecturers who helped them to develop the mind-set. While they were there, the tragic events of 9/11, including the crashing of the jet in other nearby woods, brought-home the attractiveness of living in an isolated enclave versus the evils of our modern world.<br/><br/>At the film's centre though, is a tender love story. Inspired by the awkward, slow, and largely unspoken, love in Wuthering Heights (which he ultimately turned down) Night directs a tender piece with 17 great 'touchstone' moments. If you miss 16 of them waiting for the twist, you'll miss a great film.<br/><br/>So frustrated is he that people just watch his films for the twist and miss the other good stuff, Night seriously considered starting the film with the reveal scene  on the road  immediately after the titles, and doing the rest in flashback. He said he wanted to say 'OK. You've spotted the twist, now just watch the friggin' film!'<br/><br/>So don't get hung up on the watching whole film just for his cameo or trying to spot the twist, (""playing chess with me"" as Night himself says). Unlike Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the deception is not of the audience, but of the characters. That's not a twist in the plot - it IS the plot, and the context in which this fine drama is set."

My wife had the plot diagnosed about halfway through but mercifully let me have some reason to stay once the popcorn had grown cold. The premise of the isolated village being able to support a group of the size depicted in the limited area presented in the movie cast believability out the window very quickly. The poor blind girl presentation was not well presented or acted out with sufficient plausibility to carry the slow start of the other concurrent sub-plots.

"UltramarineX","5","0","0","17 August 2004"," To put it simply, I was disappointed
","**Warning: Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>     There's no easy way to sugar coat this so I'm just going to come right out and say it.  Out of all the movies I have seen by M. Night Shyamalan, The Village is without a doubt the weakest one he has made, and one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing Shyamalan's last movie Signs.  At the time, I thought Signs was his best work to date, and I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Or maybe I was expecting something from the movie that it had no intention of delivering.  I wanted a movie as creepy as Signs, but instead I got a movie that was, at times, tedious.  In the end though, I just can't recommend The Village.<br/><br/>    The premise of the movie centres on a close knit community who lives in the daily knowledge of dangerous creatures surrounding their village.  Some critics (like Roger Ebert) have labeled the story as `hokey', but I don't think it's any hokier than some of Shyamalan's previous movies which deals with the undead, superheroes, and an alien invasion (which some of these same critics liked).  My problem with the movie doesn't have anything to do with the premise itself, but with its execution.  Signs was a movie that continuously had a sense of dread; that something simply felt amiss.  We get none of that in The Village.  <br/><br/>     Yes we get a few jolts once in a while, but in between we often get some pointless rambling about how the village should be run, that everyone has to bury anything with the `bad colour', and to not be afraid of `Those We Don't Speak Of', which brings me to my next point.  Why do they call it the `bad colour' and not simply red, or `Those We Don't Speak Of' the creatures in the woods (or something like that).  Will saying red somehow call the creatures forth from the woods?  I'd like to know, but Shyamalan doesn't seem to care enough to explain.  Now don't get me wrong, I love movies with a lot of dialogue, just as long as its not worthless talking. Maybe he added those terms (bad colour, etc.) into the movie to make it seem more intelligent', but in my opinion without explaining the reasoning behind those and other terms it just seems pointless and stupid.<br/><br/>     The revelation about what the creatures truly were in the movie was a little disappointing.  I won't divulge what the revelation was, but I will say that I couldn't help but feel somewhat cheated, but I was willing to accept it in the hopes that the ending would prove to be interesting.  Ah yesthe ending.  The signature twist ending that is the hallmark of Shyamalan's movies.  I thought the ending was great in The Sixth Sense, okay in Unbreakable, andnot so good in Signs.  Don't worry I won't reveal what the ending was, but only say that I had mixed feelings about.  It was definitely something I had NO idea was coming, and this was both its strength and weakness.  I like unexpected endings such as that in The Sixth Sense, but the ending in The Village was over the top (which is something I know many will disagree with) and, to be honest, unnecessary.<br/><br/>     On the other hand the acting in The Village was, on the whole, solid. The most notable standouts were Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. Phoenix plays the quiet Lucius Hunt.  It was hilarious to watch one of the village girls profess her love for him, and watching him stand there with a deadpan expression on his face.  Howard plays a blind villager named Ivy Walker.  I immediately developed sympathy for her having to live the way she does, but she shows great fortitude throughout the movie, and it shows when should stood terrified outside of her house waiting for Lucius during an attack by the creatures, but never running away.<br/><br/>     M. Night Shyamalan is a director who his loaded with talent.  But even the greatest directors will once in a rare while make a movie that is not up to the standards of their previous works.  For Shyamalan The Village would be this movie.  I also think that it's a wake up call for him, that he needs to start changing his twist ending shtick.  I know that pretty much every movie watcher will expect some kind of payoff at the end when watching his movies, but it's starting to get really old, really fast.  I still want to see what Shyamalan does for his next movie, but my expectations won't be so high the next time around.  <br/><br/>I give The Village a 5 out of 10."

","I saw ""The Village"" at a midnight movie on opening night. I'm a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's other films and I was anxious to see this one. I was immediately drawn to the simplicity of life in the village and the loving way that the characters interacted. I was surprised at how drawn I was to the community and their supportive, self-sufficient lifestyle. Their total acceptance and integration of characters who were flawed or handicapped into village life was compelling. The underlying tension of trying to avoid ""the bad color"" and keeping the monsters at bay seemed peripheral to the interaction of the characters and the love story that developed between Joaqim Phoenix and Bryce Howard and the loving tension that was suggested between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. <br/><br/>However, when the action heated up after the betrothal scene, the crowd in the theater went wild. They laughed uproariously at scenes that shocked and saddened me. I had invested my emotions in the characters, and many of the audience seemed to be oblivious to their pain and heartache. Every time there was a scare or a shock, the audience would laugh or someone would shout out something completely inappropriate to the mood of the moment. <br/><br/>I don't go to the theater to watch movies very often. I prefer to watch them at home. I loved this movie and was truly touched and surprised and entertained. However, I came home feeling that I lived in some angry, antagonistic, juvenile society where people don't care about each other and can't empathize. I lay in bed that night, thinking that I would rather live in a loving village where there are monsters lurking just out of sight than in a society where the monsters are sitting next to you in the dark, laughing at pain and deriding some good acting and a worthy piece of work."

On one level, the film is a beautiful love story filled with many interesting characters. On another level, the film is a well crafted character study and on the final level, the film is an intelligent look upon society that inspires highly philosophical debate about happiness and isolation. Of all of Shyamalan's films, I consider The Village to be his most well casted. Bryce Dallas Howard is brilliant in her portrayal of Ivy Walker and I expect great things to come for Ms. Howard. Her beauty is unmatched and and her performance deserves to be recognized by many awards committees. The Village is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the greatest stories ever written. The only expectation one should have when viewing an M.

","The Village is one of the best movies to come out in a while now (excluding some certain sequels). Why ten percent of the voters gave this a 1 just to make the ranking lower baffles me. This movie deserves about an 8. It is not a horror movie, though there are some intense (read:not really scary) scenes. I personally didn't really appreciate the end, I thought it was unnecessary, but I loved the rest of the movie. It is very thoughtful and insightful about the direction our culture has gone from that of our forefathers. It is different from what your are expecting.

","I loved The Sixth Sense, was moderately entertained by Unbreakable, marginally entertained by Signs, and completely disappointed by The Village, which I had eagerly anticipated. It's a weak story and the Olde English dialogue was painful to listen to. Although the basic premise is interesting, the movie is so slow and there is so much innuendo and vague reference to what might really be going on, that I lost interest completely about a third of the way through the movie, and really didn't care by the end what happened to anyone. William Hurt, one of my favorite actors, does his best to save this silly story and rise above the crazy dialogue, but can't quite manage it. If the story is weak the ending is worse. This movie represents two hours of my life lost that I will never get back. I expect much, much better from M. Night Shyamalan."

","OK...  we've all read some of these comments for the latest of M. Night Shyamalan's films....  Seems that people either love it or loathe it... Many offer up reasons that we should do either option - leaving no middle ground....<br/><br/>My advice?  Drop all expectations and notions at the door.  Go into this movie without all the hype or hatred this film has garnered.<br/><br/>As for many comments posted around:<br/><br/>* * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS INVOLVED * * *<br/><br/>So what if the plot twist was easy to see for some....  I knew it in 20 minutes and found a few supporting items along the way.... the doctor's glasses, a line of dialogue about a sister being raped and murdered in an alley 3 blocks from home, certain other aspects of the dialogue...... Just go in like an innocent child and decide for yourself.<br/><br/>M. Night may very well be attempting to be the next Hitchcock, and he's got a lot of his characteristics down - making suspense thrillers, appearing in small cameos, etc....  He is NOT trying to make horror films, any more than Hitchcock was...  they're into the suspense...  letting the plot and the actions 'scare' you...  Expecting a horror monster movie - go see 'AvP'.<br/><br/>As for the dialogue sounding 'flat' to some - remember, this is a 20th/21st century 'scholar' (he's a teacher, remember?) and his concept of what the language would be....  And, recall, that many of these people were 20th/21st century people....  So, they can only ASSUME what the verbage and words would be....<br/><br/>To the ones that bring out about how everything looks fresh and new and yet you assume that the 'Village' has been around for at least a generation... Get real!  Given the 'twist', and how most of the items are only about 30 years old, it makes perfect sense that the items would not be threadbare and ruined....  And, if you need proof of the timeline, look again at the picture of the 'elders' outside the counseling center...  That is a decidedly mid/late 70's Ford in the foreground....  I'm a car buff, so I knew THAT one right away....  Also, given the potential money that the Walker family had, it is completely plausible to have many of these items made and in as-new condition.  But, again, if you were paying attention to the details, you'd have caught it...  One look at the glass of the buildings and the plates in the opening feast scene show you that they're made with modern technologies and NOT from the late 1800s....  So, you either chalk them up to 'continuity errors' or you think about them....  See above for other examples (doctor's glasses, for example....)<br/><br/>This movie was made to make you THINK.  It was NOT meant to be a late summer BLOCKBUSTER of a film....  That's not what M. Night is all about....  He's far more subtle than that....<br/><br/>MY OPINION - and it is just that MY opinion:<br/><br/>The movie is very good....  it has a slow point or two, but enough suspense to keep the audience engrossed...  Yeah, there are a few plot issues (holes?) that can seem jarring, but many CAN be explained by the twist.  Not M. Night's BEST film, but not his worst, either....  And he's got a lot of years left ahead of him....<br/><br/>One final thing to ponder - the 'sounds' of the creatures in the woods.... Do you think that they could the the sounds of the sirens from the ranger trucks or from some trains passing in the distance?  I grew up in the Pennsylvania farmlands outside of Philly...  And a train that is 10 - 20 miles away could sound very much the same...."
"poeticfist","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," How NOT To Make A Movie
","What made this movie even more disappointing was the fact that I hold M. Night Shamaylan in such high regard as a director and writer. What I think was the key of this disappointment was that I think he knew that. Night knows people hold him in high regard, and took himself entirely too seriously. For one thing, what the movie reminded me of was all the things I believed I would always want to do in a movie, and he gave me a good lesson in why those are terrible ideas. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! The first thing I thought would be cool was (1.) Kill off the main character. This was the only good twists and only nice surprises in the picture. Switching off the importance from Lucius to Ivy was a better idea, yet a less exciting idea. This automatically takes away all of the suspense. This also unravels the plot in a very sloppy way. Night unravels the foreshadowing in a more ""HEY! LOOK AT THIS! IT'S VITAL TO THE PLOT"" manner. That's awful directing. (2.) Create an unreal threat, a farce. This was a turn for the worst. I knew, as soon as I found out the creatures were fake, that this movie was going to be a complete bust. At this point, you have completely eliminated the conflict, the scare factor. The audience has figured out at this point that this is no suspense/thriller, and they're pissed. But yet, they paid $5.50 for this show (it was the first show of the day), so they stay for the rest. Yet this badly drawn twist totally takes out the knees of the final surprise. (3.) Turn the world completely upside down on the audience. BIG MISTAKE! This might have been a better idea had the previous twist not been such a let down, but such was not the case. By the time Ivy had leaped over the wall and ""flashback voices"" were going on about their terrible occurrences, I had already seen this ""surprise"" coming a mile away. It was just as Ivy was led by her father into the shed housing fake ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" costumes, I knew that a. the creatures were fake, b. there has to be a reason for fake creatures, c. they don't want people going in the woods, d. something is on the other side of the woods, e. the ""real world"" is on the other side. It became so obvious as I saw how ridiculous these ""deterrant rituals"" were (ie. just because the color red attracts them, doesn't mean that the color yellow deters them).<br/><br/>All in all, in my book, this movie is a failure. Even as the twists continuously fail, the movie turns out to be anti-climatic anyhow. The only thing I was impressed with was how Night turned up (This was also another HUGE hint to the movie's ""secret""; Night cameos in his films, in Hitchcockian fashion, and a dark skinned man of Asian decent has no place in a 19th century village, duh.), and that was no huge feat. The score, although incredibly composed and performed, was terribly executed, and I found it obnoxiously annoying at times when it just wasn't needed, or was out of place. Both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" were incredible, and I personally feel that this movie was M. Night Shamaylan's ""Bad Movie"" (every great director has one or two). Maybe in a few years, he will stun us with another masterpiece, but I can honestly say ""The Village"" was the worst and most disappointing movie I've seen at the theater since ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and that is saying A LOT."
"madmatt7800","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," The Essential is the Message (possible Spoilers)
","Some have said this film is disappointing, especially when compared to other M. Night films. While I'll agree that The Village may not be his strongest film, it is still worth seeing.<br/><br/>M. Night's purpose for this film is not the plot, or the ""love story"" or even the ""horror"" of the monsters. It is the underlying message of a group of people that feel so disgusted by the world as it is that they ""start over,"" in a sense, by continuing their families in an isolated, Amish-like community. They go to great lengths to preserve the secrecy of their establishment, sacrificing truth and quite possibly the freedom of their children. However, when the need for modern medical supplies arises, the man who originally developed the plan is forced to share the secret with his daughter in order to save the life of another villager.<br/><br/>In the film, the audience begins to see this man break down as he and the group of ""elders"" start to question the true intentions of their elaborate plan to preserve innocence. This picture made me rethink the value of modern conveniences, the affect of culture and media among our society and perhaps our own lost innocence.<br/><br/>I will admit, I am not much of a movie buff, and I (along with perhaps most of the general public) have not seen every ""twisted plot/suspense/horror"" film made, so I did not see anything ""predictable"" about this film. I did not expect the ending that happened, and I realized after the first 20 minutes that M. Night was not showing me a ""horror"" film - there was something deeper there that was slowly unveiled throughout the rest of the film. That deeper message is what this film was about, and not necessarily the surface story."

","Before going to the show I checked out the comments here on IMDB.com and thought I knew what I was in for.  I was wrong.<br/><br/>First off, I won't rehash the plot line here - you can read all about it elsewhere.  What I would like to say is that this is a phenominal movie and you really should go see it.<br/><br/>The acting is very good (newbie, Howard has a BIG, BIG future ahead of her), John Hurt is great and Joaquin Phoenix is sexy as ever....<br/><br/>But aside from the good acting (yes the language is somewhat stilted - it's supposed to be 1897 for Pete's sake), the plot and story line are TRULY UNIQUE in an era where movies fall into predictablility!<br/><br/>Although my brilliant husband figured out what was going on pretty early in the flick, neither of us had a clue about the surprise ending!  (Although it did explain John Hurt's ""slightly Yiddish"" accent on the way out to the ""forbidden shed""). (Was I the ONLY person in the world who heard it? - OY!).<br/><br/>What I particularly enjoyed was the metaphorical aspect of the movie - yes, yes, call it a moral if you want.  Nevertheless, I like a movie that actually promotes THOUGHT and INTROSPECTION (as apposed to movies by Spielberg who have to TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK EVERY SECOND). This one allowed me to draw my own conclusions. And what powerful conclusions they are. Parallels about what is truth.  How much truth to hide for your own good or the good of the ""many"".<br/><br/>My only question is this.....With only a hand full of ""original elders"" (eight or ten - somewhere around there), where in the heck did all these people come from?  There had to be at least 75 people at those tables! Were ALL THE WOMEN PREGNANT for the past 25 years or what?<br/><br/>Anyway, for the thinking movie goer - a great, great movie."

","This movie really was something extraordinary, the thing is all the teenagers and pretty much everybody were expecting to see ""Signs"" all over again, a big scary movie with bumps and jumps. But it wasn't that, but the trailer made you to believe it was. It was a love story, a science fiction, and a psychological thriller. It had many shocking scenes and many beautiful scenes and now I am going into spoiler territory, its impossible to discuss this film without it, it being two weeks after the movie has come out, I feel its okay.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The stabbing scene was absolutely petrifying. You had no idea something like this was going to happen. At every theater I know that you could hear a big GASP the second time when Noah goes down to stab Lucius again. Also thinking for about 3 whole minutes that the main character is dead is also shocking.<br/><br/>The big twist in Shyamalan's movies was last minute, OH, he's dead, OH, he's the villain, OH, they die with water! The last half hour in this movie we all found out new things. The farce, Noah dressing up and killing the animals, modern day, just everything about it. <br/><br/>Bryce Howard was absolutely phenomenal, and she stepped up when Joaquin got cut out to make the movie work and have a likable lead. William Hurt was also beyond amazing, his scene where he is talking about the elders about keeping the Village innocent was powerful, especially the second time you see it. Joaquin Phoenix was very good as usual.<br/><br/>This movie is still very haunting, the sadness of the Village and the sadness of Noah, if you watch the movie again, when you see them running up to the sitting stone, you see the happiness in his face and you just feel your heart ache about the things that are to come.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard is my favorite composer, yes, over John Williams. He's done such greats as Peter Pan and all of Shyamalan's movies. And he does not stop with his greatness here, the score is beautiful, one of the most hauntingly original I've ever heard.<br/><br/>The Village has a great story, with phenomenal acting (even with the sometimes funny-sounding 19th century talk), a great twist and even a few scares.<br/><br/>RATING: A-"

A few minor nitpicks regarding potential plot holes that don't affect the overall tenor and focus of the movie.  Beautifully directed, cinemetographed (if that's a word) and generally commendable acting.  While Ms. Howard was good, I must complain that she didn't come across as a blind person very well -- her eyes seemed to focus on whatever she was ""looking"" at.

I'm a huge fan of Night's because of the way he directs his movies. I love the sub-text, the symbolism, the deliberate way he tells the story. In all his films the creepy/horror factor is only the vehicle for the deeper story, so I never feel ripped off if the 'aliens look fake' etc.<br/><br/>The Village is a love story, and while it's fairly simple in plot, love can also be simple. When you love someone, you'll do whatever it takes to prove it. <br/><br/>I personally don't see the whole 'fearful villagers' thing as something to do with 9/11 or how religious sub-cultures are fearful of the world. That hasn't been my experience at all. The biggest thing I got out of this movie was that people make choices, good or bad, out of love--for each other, for innocence, etc. The characters are good people dealing with dark forces rather than people who seem okay on the outside but are really filled with all kinds of evil and psychosis. One character's outburst speech shows why he made the choice he did, and I understood it, whether or not I agreed with it. <br/><br/>If you want to see this movie, go in open-minded.

Mr. Shyamalan again disappoints with his poor writing skills and amateurish style that he actually claims to own. I still wonder why he even dared to put his name up in the credits for that. I pitied the perfectly good actors and actresses that you saw hold back perfectly good emotions because the script lacked the words to say and never even offered. You see Ms. Weaver nearly bursting over her poorly constructed Old English-and spilling her guts to the viewing world.<br/><br/>If M. Night Shyamalan did, however, deny any relation to the screenplay-you can applaud his for his creative thinking and brilliant plot that you don't see to often now in this day. But you pat him on the back and ask him why he ruined a perfectly good idea with a sour writer. There were some bits of the movie that were, in fact, successfully executed that left me on the edge of my seat-looking through my fingers ready to shield myself from any unsettling scenes.<br/><br/>I applaud ""The Village"" for its originality and suspenseful moments, with hope that M Night Shyamalan never picks up a pen (or claims to) again."

","I'll try my best to keep this brief.<br/><br/>As I have gathered from others that I talk to and as read in various other reviews outside of this site, the general feeling on this film seems to lay along the lines of either ""bad"" or ""disappointed"". A majority of us have grown accustomed to M.Night's work: we know he uses a certain style of suspense as well as a fondness for a certain ""twist"" ending.<br/><br/> From those I have spoken with, it seems their main complaint(s) is(are) that the ending is predictable and/or the movie is not scary at all.<br/><br/>And for the most part, they are correct. This is generally not a scary film.<br/><br/>However, regardless of what you think, this movie still remains as one of the better films to come out this summer.<br/><br/>As is the norm with his films, Shyamalan's unique form of direction presents this movie in his own trademark way. Particularly in the very well done ""violent scene"". He makes you feel emotion beyond the typical ones usually tapped among other movies. What makes this movie ""bad"" in many's eyes is that we have become so used to the story teller's style that some sit brooding throughout waiting on ""the twist"". In this fashion, yes, the ending is predictable. But unlike some of his previous work, the point of this film isn't necessarily to gasp and be surprised in the ending as it is to be surprised in the actions of the characters within and your own views on them depending on the impact of the change once it is confirmed.<br/><br/>What really made me appreciate this film wasn't the ""twist"" ending but the depiction of what this type of situation views from the inside out. When I think of a village like this, I think of a cult. But the way in which the story is told, whether you ""knew"" the ending or not, holds the viewer within the village until the change comes. <br/><br/>Think now. For the majority of the film you sat involved within a very different community as well as a very different type of love story. You may have known the truth about the creatures (or thought you did) or even about the village itself, but regardless...the focus of the film itself seemed more upon the love story. Yet when the truth was revealed (or confirmed) it was at that point the viewer really evaluated the situation. You began to see things from a different angle, from the outside, as you normally (probably) would have. I believe you'll find few film/film makers who are capable of the same.<br/><br/>My best suggestion for you if you did not like this film is to try to watch a movie for what it is regardless of expectations. No, it is not The Sixth Sense. And that is exactly it."

","SPOILER I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan--6th Sense and Signs I really enjoyed and Unbreakable was OK. After seeing this film, though, I left the theater troubled with too many unanswered questions. Are the 8 elders really mentally distraught over all their 'losses' that they'd think its the 1800s and live like Amish people?? Would they really have lived there for 20 some years and have no one discover they're there? Call me naive or oblivious but I did not see the twists coming but once they revealed themselves, the film began to fall apart. The first 3/4 of the film is OK--the audience freaked at the ""one who shall not be named"" and the thrills that ensued. Adrien Brody as the village idiot was interesting--I'm not sure what 'modern' complication he has---ADD among other things I'm sure. If Ron Howard's daughter was to play a more convincing blind person--she should have been directed to the way Al Pacino portrayed a blind colonel in Scent of a woman. I like Shyamalan but he needs to change his routine up a bit in his next film...otherwise this might be it for him."

","I'm a film major at Penn State and I would just like for everyone to stop bashing The Village. <br/><br/>Obviously everybody is familiar with how M Night makes movies by now. There are ninety minutes of movie time where the characters develop, the plot builds up, and a few suspenseful moments happen. Then there is close to a ten minute ending where a twist occurs and it is supposed to invoke a ""Ohh now that makes sense"" reaction.<br/><br/>Instead of looking for a twist, simply go and see the movie. When you look for a twist, you miss out on important character development and plot structure. I did this with Unbreakable, and I regretted it later on.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, other than the brilliant people that saw it coming and predicted it and posted it on this website, nobody thought that the twist had to do with the setting, and everyone thought it was with the creatures.<br/><br/>All I ask is that when you see a movie of his, do not try and measure it up to The Sixth Sense. That is his golden movie, and other than Spielberg and maybe Elia Kazan, most directors have one golden movie and then a bunch that don't measure up. The Sixth Sense is probably one of the top ten best made movies of all time, and to compare everything he does to that is not fair. Nobody compares ""1941"" to ""Schindlers List"" and that is why all of his movies turn out great reviews."
"ReardonSteel","6","0","0","8 August 2004"," There was a better story here.
","M. Night Shyamalan earned his way into the consciousness of the American moviegoer by stylizing the twist ending on the big screen. His movies play out like an extended version of Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone. This comparison goes beyond the surprise endings. Both contain themes exploring the complexity of human nature in the midst of tense and often mysterious situations. This review will contain no spoilers, but I will talk about the ending in general terms. <br/><br/>People who watch this movie for the twist ending will be disappointed. First of all, it is quite predictable. Also, it plays out very gradually, rather than just hitting you in one, climactic moment. It's just not very logically or emotionally satisfying either. This does not make it a bad movie, however since Shyamalan's reputation is largely built on his endings, this will probably end up hurting the movie at box office. I'm still going to recommend the movie, however. But, this recommendation will come with the warning that you will likely leave the movie theater saying to yourself or your companions that, ""There was a better story here."" <br/><br/>The acting is fine. The supporting cast is great, but the movie is basically all supporting cast. Joaquin Pheonix and Bryce Dallas Howard share a staring role, but there is no Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson character in The Village. But, the characters are interesting. The pieces you get of their stories makes you yearn for more. But Shyalaman is too wrapped up in his reputation to stop to satisfy this yearning. His tricks are becoming tiresome. When you go to the theater, take note of the moments where the audience (if there is one) reacts the most. Observe if they are reacting to the moment on the screen or the juiced up volume of a sound effect after a period of extended silence. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is certainly a capable director. He is an artful creator of atmosphere. He also has a skill for pacing and I happen to enjoy the casts he selects for his characters. It's time for him to prove that he can bring a bit more to the table than a few cheap scares and a shock ending. You won't hate this movie, but you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>2/5"

","At first glance this supposed late nineteenth century village seems picture perfect--a handful of Villagers living harmoniously in an idyllic setting. However, this close-knit community lives with the frightening belief that a race of frightening creatures resides in the woods surrounding their village.<br/><br/>The sanctity of 'The Village' is held in constant check by a sort of an unwritten treaty with the creatures referred to by the townspeople as 'Those We Don't Speak Of.' The villagers live in a state of constant fear of the evil and foreboding force that lurks outside their tranquil settlement. So terrified are the people that no one dares venture beyond 'The Village' perimeter into the darkness of the woods. <br/><br/>Despite the advice of his elders, a curious and determined Lucius Hunt (JOAQUIN PHOENIX) has a burning desire to step beyond the boundaries of the town into the unknown to bring back supplies and medicine from neighboring villages. Town leader, Edward Walker (WILLIAM HURT) warns Lucius of the danger beyond the town's outskirts, and Lucius' mother, Alice Hunt (SIGOURNEY WEAVER) begs him to stay at home and spare himself the greed and desires that exist in the outside world.<br/><br/>Lucius' strength and courage is matched only by Ivy Walker (BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD), a beautiful and mesmerizing young blind woman with a profound wisdom well beyond her years. Her fearless nature and gift-like perceptions are beyond anything Lucius has ever known. Both Lucius and the mischievous village idiot, Noah Percy (ADRIEN BRODY) admire Ivy passionately, though her heart only has room for one of them. Her devotion eventually leads her down a tortured forbidden path where terrifying truths are revealed and sudden violence plays out its fearful hand. The so-called truce between 'The Village' and the creatures seems to be ending and the ominous presence of the unknown force ultimately boils over into chaos for the town. And so, the story begins to unfold.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this haunting saga's music and direction sends terrifying chills and conjures up horrifying images waiting at every turn only to turn out as ordinary events or things. Much like his previous movie, 'Sixth Sense', Shyamalan has a knack for creating tension and fear without having to produce a terrifying giant lizard such as in 'Jurassic Park' to justify the terror. <br/><br/>The fear and respect given to these unseen creatures seems analogous to what early man must have gone through as beliefs were formed as the result of real and/or imagined forces that ultimately set up certain behaviors that were thought to placate these forces. In 'The Village', the people learned to avoid the color red and would go about destroying any red plants. Occasionally a slaughtered animal was left at the edge of the Village to appease the creatures. They learned to wear certain colors they were led to believe would keep the creatures away. Essentially, the effect was to create an artificial religion that may have ultimately bloomed into a fully formed and organized faith, much like island natives who worshiped and sacrificed animals and people to volcano gods in order to appease them.<br/><br/>The acting was superior to most films, however, nowhere near the level of an Academy Award. The film is to be admired for its ability to keep you terrified and involved; however, after a while it became quite wearisome when no bogeymen appeared to justify all that uproar and tension. Once the plot unfolded, it held many surprises, although somewhat implausible. Basically a fairy tale, the 'Village' is worthy of attendance as long as there is plenty of popcorn available to dispel the tension of two hours of fright."

","I loved the Sixth Sense, it will always be his best to me. The Village just didn't cut it. The acting wasn't the best. Although I did enjoy Bryce. The plot was predictable, the fate of the village was not. Except that Bryce being blind was convenient. I was able to determine the twist too quickly. In all fairness however, I did get thrown a curve ball with the scene in the woods and the appearance of ""those we don't talk about"". I almost want to say wait for the video, but by then the word will be out and the plot exposed, so it's up to you. It's worth seeing just to try and figure M Night's twist.

","He pulls the rug from under your feet, you pull out your wallet - that's the M. Night Shyamalan way. Box office receipts prove that building a movie around a twist can work beautifully, but what's left if, like me, the viewer is wise to the scam?<br/><br/>Nobody gave away the ending of The Sixth Sense, but I'd done the math before the movie even started - ""The kid sees dead people!"" + ""There's a great twist!"" = ""A-ha!"". I enjoyed it none the less. The Village did actually have to begin before I worked out what was going on, but where The Sixth Sense still managed to sustain an air of suspense and creepiness, this became a mere exercise in red herring-spotting.<br/><br/>No matter how rich the photography or how many orchestrally-prompted shocks and starts he throws in, Shyamalan squanders an intriguing set-up with a ""so what?"" denouement.<br/><br/>The cast aren't to blame: Richie Cunningham's daughter is excellent and William Hurt gets his best role in years but all the talk of ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" and the inevitable opening of ""The Shed That Must Never Be Opened"" made me wonder when Night is gonna give us a ""Movie Not Based On A Gimmick""."

","Well, I have to say that I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a great movie and also showed a lot of creativity and scary parts that would leave you either startled or impressed. ""Unbreakable,"" however, did not really impress me except for the ending which didn't even come close to my thoughts, but it was still a decent movie. ""Signs"" was definitely an impressive movie and I loved the suspense and the terror he brought over you while you watched the movie.<br/><br/>Now, ""The Village"" however was not as impressive as I hoped it would be. A lot of things were left unanswered and a lot of things were not used well enough to bring the same terror that he has brought in his original movies. Like, for instance, it was smart on how the people used the dead bodies of the creatures to keep people from ever attempting to reach the towns, but at the same time, it was stupid. I know A LOT of people went into that theater expecting to see numerous creatures, but we were left with only see one for each scene. There was no terror to the movie except for the scenes that u truly believe there are real creatures in the forest. However, I can say it is the commercials that ruined the movie, they pumped it up to make it seem like it was nothing but a scary movie with terrifying creatures but it turned out to be a movie made out to display nothing but how one person can love another in many situations. Ivy's love to cross the forbidden territory in hopes to find medicine for Lucius, Noah attacking Lucius due to his love for Ivy. M. Night Shyamalan is however very impressive to display these things, but, it wasn't at all what it was shown to be.<br/><br/>I wish it would have shown the creatures when they did exist in the forest and when they did attack the people, before they died.<br/><br/>I would rate M. Night Shyamalan's movie a 6 out of 10."
"bbbl67","7","0","0","12 August 2004"," Seems bad at first, until you think a little about it
","I waited a couple of days before writing this review. I'm glad I did, because it doesn't seem as bad upon sober second thought as it did after first seeing it. I was even contemplating revealing the surprise ending, so that others didn't have to bother watching this film. But I won't give it completely away.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a twist at the end, although the twist pretty much gets revealed about 30-45 minutes from the end. The twist gets fleshed out in more detail from the first revelation to the final ending, and you are even wondering part way through if the twist is the real twist or if there is something even more twisted underneath. I'll let you know your first impression of this twist might be that it is a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>
But prior to the revelation of the twist, we have about another hour of character development. It's filled with very idyllic scenes of 19th century American village life. Simple people going about their simple lives. Communal dinners in the outdoors. People socializing with each other. It's almost like watching a documentary -- with scary music that is. I sometimes wonder if Shyamalan isn't really more cut out to do documentaries on simple people; most of his movies have had some scenes of simple peacefulness -- even The Sixth Sense. Really good scenes, and I dare say only Shyamalan could get away with putting such slow-moving scenes into a movie -- because you know that there is going to be a twist at the end which will put this idyllic life into perspective. <br/><br/>All I can suggest to you is don't be too disappointed by the ending, it's not as bad as it first seems."

I'm glad that I decided to give it a chance after all, and go into the theatre with an open mind and no special expectations for what it would be about (as one always SHOULD, if it were not for the often stupid, insulting, and misleading previews).<br/><br/>The photography and atmosphere were beautiful, and by and large the acting was very good as well. Some complain about stilted dialogue or language, but when you realize who these people really are and what they are actually doing, it pretty well fits right in. It makes sense!<br/><br/>The overall plot held together as well as any Hollywood film, although I am surprised by the number of viewers who apparently cannot comprehend such a simple plot once they have seen it, and still come up with outlandish takes on the film. Maybe they were not really paying attention or listening to the dialogue.<br/><br/>When it all comes to a head, the twists at the end, and I counted about three places where the audience's train of thought was deliberately rerouted, are suitably explained, or at least hinted at, by what came before. And this writer/director's film's have never been really profound OR scary, after all, but they usually make some sort of sense and he has not cheated anywhere.<br/><br/>The following might be considered by some to be a spoiler, so be warned! I think The Village is primarily a human story, a commentary on how bad our modern society has become and to what lengths people of like mind might go to find something better, and it is a romance and a tragedy. Go to it with expectations for nothing else, and you will probably enjoy it."

It was worth it.<br/><br/>I'd warn you about potential spoilers below, but then again, if you don't want your movies spoiled, then you shouldn't be reading IMDb reviews before you see something. :)<br/><br/>The Village is a socially relevant film on a global level, with points that have obviously been sadly missed by the folks who are too busy trying to outsmart its maker.<br/><br/>Think of The Village as a metaphor for America. It's a microcosm of our own country. Its leaders, or elders, came from the grim realities of the world with sincere hopes of building a new society from scratch, cleaning their grimy slate for the future of their children, and leaving their evil world behind. In order to do this, the leaders, or elders, are faced with a fundamental challenge: to keep the the truth of the real world a secret from their people. To handle this challenge, the leaders use the power of control through fear and brainwashing in order to keep their new generation of children within the physical boundaries of this newly manufactured ""perfect"" society. Once the villagers are psychologically bound to their existence, the leaders have an almost complete control over what they see, hear, and think. The leaders instill a fundamental belief in their people that ""those we don't speak of"", or ""the creatures"" outside the boundaries of the village, are inherently evil and are proactively out to harm the village. The leaders fabricate and implement psychological mechanisms of control (monster suits, myths of the color red, etc.) in order to exploit the natural fear of the unknown into their people, who, not surprisingly, happily accept this illusion and don't question it. It is clear that the leaders are succeeding: our boy with the golden cloak is literally nauseated from a fear of something that isn't there. However, the plan is also arguably backfiring: the mentally unstable guy has ironically taken the tools of control (costume; weapons) and used them to create his own personal brand of terrorism inspired by his own passionate fervor. Sound familiar, my fellow Americans?<br/><br/>Nice job, Night. Some of us get it.<br/><br/>Ignore the ignorant."

In ""The Village"" the main underlying ideology is in fact ""Love"".<br/><br/>A love so profound in conquers all disabilities and obstacles that render impassable. The movie has us imagining the passion that wields between the two protagonist as endearing and insurmountable. Stepping back we are brought into Shayamalan's fantasy of moulding the entire scenes and exploits into one gigantic display of affection and tenderness..even the colour red, a well known symbol of love, continuously inhabits the movie overlay. (There were even some scenes in the movie where I imagined even the dead wood rising up to protect and conceal within the forest).<br/><br/>I have observe most movie patrons comment on twists and turns, but I feel that in every movie there is an idea to it which is carefully developed and articulated..this movie brought out that theme righteously.<br/><br/>[Danger: Spoilers] I do not think that a commune hidden away so mysteriously in a modern era is in itself realistic.

I don't think it is a big deal what year it is. The mystery to me was who the 'creatures' are and who is doing the bad things. I had an inkling that it had something to do with the William Hurt character; but I did not quite figure out the whole thing beforehand. After the truth is told to Ivy, and she is attacked in the forest, I started thinking may be there are real creatures. I did not catch that twist at all. My wife thought Ivy was imagining.<br/><br/>I plan to watch it at least one more time to figure what what clues Shyamalan left in regards to who the creature is. Based on the comments on this board, I will be looking for missing people and any such clues. I think that would be fun.<br/><br/>Also, I think many reviewer's do not give good reviews to Shyamalan's movies because (i) They are used to watching movies once, and Shyamalan wants his audience to watch his movies at least twice to appreciate the clues and hints he meticulously puts in a consistent manner, (ii) Shyamalan does not suck up to these reviewers; he lives in Phily (not in Hollywood), and (iii) Many of the reviewer's think how dare he write, direct and produce his movies.

The human element is more pronounced here than in any of his previous movies. In my opinion, Shyamalan's movies (this included) are all about our deep inner self, our hidden passions, vanities and guilt. It wasn't evident to me until I saw this movie, which lots of people would agree that it is similar to ""Signs."" It had the same human inner emotion link to it (inner belief in ""Signs"" vs. inner guilt in ""The Village"").<br/><br/>True to his film-making ways, Shyamalan tries to provide twists and turns while exposing the human element to the story.

The village and what is going on there is something I share a sense of longing for, as I am sure do many people. I have often thought, would it not be great to live in a world like that, free of the burdens of all this Western society crap? If we could, would we not want to preserve it? I feel the pain of the characters that drove them to seek out this solace and understand their desire to have that, what we all truly long for in our isolating and often painful world, the innocence we lost, and a world of simplicity. Kudos to the director, you see in true colours, I only wish everyone else would try to as well."

","Anyone interested in an entertaining, suspenseful, gritty psychological movie should see this film. Don't listen to the people on here that say ""it was so predictable"" and all that B.S. They're full of it. There is no way that, unless you are the director himself, you could see all the plot twists in this film. And there are plot twists. However, I would advise not even trying to look for them, just sit back and let the story unfold. Everything in this film has it's meaning.<br/><br/>~~Spoilers beyond this point, please do not read unless you absolutely do not intend to see this film~~<br/><br/>I will attempt to answer for some of the criticism Shyamalan is receiving for this work. <br/><br/>""The dialogue is dry and over-the-top,"" ""The performances are weak.""<br/><br/>As to the dialogue, I believe this to be intentional. The over-the-top feel is intentionally there to make you see the effort that has gone into fooling an entire village into thinking they are in colonial times. It's one of those things designed to stick out before (""Why are they talking like that?"") and after the plot twists (""It was a detailed sham pieced together by a history professor, I get it""). <br/><br/>As to the performances, they are first-rate. William Hurt and Joaquin Pheonix are superb, and Ron Howard's daughter Bryce is phenomenal. The porch scene is gripping and touching, and regrettable after later events. This is acting at its finest.<br/><br/>The symbolism in this film is extraordinary. The ""bad"" color, the one that caused all of the elders to create a village in the first place. There are some very interesting themes running under the surface that I think people would enjoy if they were not so intent on trying to predict the twists, albeit impossible.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the majority of people who shoot down the film just don't get it. That is not to say there aren't valid criticisms to be made of the movie, but just that the majority of ""save your money"" critics probably thought highly of Catwoman until someone with sense told them it was terrible."

The Village has fine performances, an engaging story and if you aren't surprised at the ending (I actually was) you shouldn't be dismayed or disappointed either. There will never be another movie in this genre with the impact and effect of ""The Sixth Sense"" but that's no reason to avoid every movie that Shyamalan authors just because it doesn't overtake the first one.

","SPOILER!!!<br/><br/>Has it occurred to anyone else that Night intended his audience to feel deceived and misused just as Ivy feels when her father reveals that the forest monsters are not real? It's interesting that the fear of the monsters was used by the elders to keep the young people of the village from entering the woods just as Night (and/or the studio execs) used the monsters to get moviegoers to enter the theaters. The source of the outrage and vehemence against this movie is that it left many feeling like the village idiot. But one of the main points of the movie (and the main reason that Walker and the other adults founded the village in the first place) is that the monsters are all too real--in the real world. It would have cheapened this movie if the ""monster"" that attacked Ivy had been anything other than Noah in a costume. And doesn't that go to the heart of the movie? Even though the villagers adorn themselves with 19th century garb, utilize antiquated, stilted speech patterns, and seal themselves off from the rest of the world in their idyllic ""utopia,"" they cannot escape the monsters living within themselves. Reviewers who focus solely on the predictable plot twists and lack of ""real"" monsters are missing the many thought- provoking points of this superb movie. Negative reviews of this movie only reveal that those reviewers lack the imagination and intelligence to appreciate Night's."

","Shyamalan weaves his cinematic magic once again in this beautifully-filmed movie about a 19th-century community with a terrible burden to bear. The villagers are terrified of the creatures in the woods...and with good reason. They have showed up recently...leaving mutilated animal corpses in their path; marking the doors of the village with blood; terrorising the villagers due to the periodic visiting of the forbidden forest.<br/><br/>The village must be self-sufficient enough to sustain itself, for no one is allowed to leave it or enter it. What are the creatures? Why are they so angered by the villagers' trespassing? <br/><br/>These are the basis for Shymalan's beautiful and terrifying tale. This film, however, is not a horror movie. It is a very interesting psychological journey into human nature; rather like ""Lord of the Flies,"" in fact. No matter how innocent we seem to be, we can never escape the Deadly Sins: tragedy must fall upon us at some point. It makes us more well-rounded and three-dimensional. It has elements of everything from Wuthering Heights to Greek tragedies to Hitchcock, and, aside from the abrupt denouement, is nearly perfect in its storytelling.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning as Ivy and has made an incredible acting debut in ""The Village."" Adrien Brody, as the village idiot, is flawlessly brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix is marvellous and heartbreaking. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking...and frightening.<br/><br/>
Shymalan's inevitable cameo is also quite clever.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this little movie. Do not go in there expecting to be thrilled...expect to gain insight into human nature and war. It might be lost on too many people, sadly..."

","M Knight Shyamalan is an interesting and accomplished writer/director but he's not a perfect storyteller. I enjoyed the setup for The Village: a remote rural community has an uneasy truce with monstrous creatures who live in the forest surrounding their community. The borderline is transgressed and the monsters start laying down some heavy warnings (skinned animals, blood daubed on doors - that sort of thing). The three young characters, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Adrien Brody) are very distinctive and interesting. But just when I'm getting ready for a great ending, the third act falls apart.<br/><br/>I want a great ending! So I start thinking what I would have done. Here as I see it are the problems with the third act and my suggestions on how to make it better. See what you think.<br/><br/>1. Lucius, our protagonist, the one driving the story, is stabbed and remains unconscious for the rest of the story. Ivy becomes the new protagonist as she heads off to the town for medicines to save Lucius. COMMENT: this is a radical act of storytelling. We have to be convinced that Ivy, who is blind, has the strength, skill and determination to carry the story to its conclusion. 2) deprives her of the opportunity to prove this to us. 2. Ivy's father tells her the monsters are a myth created by the Elders.<br/><br/>COMMENT: a protagonist should be increasingly active in the third act. Ivy could discover the truth by her own actions when she fights Owen, disguised as one of the monsters, in the woods. 3. John Hurt's speeches decrease in pace and increase in ponderousness.<br/><br/>COMMENT: Please, someone, trim his dailogue and give him a kick up the backside. 4. There is a final twist. Ivy climbs a perimeter fence and lands on a tarmac road. This is the 21st century not 1880's - a potentially brilliant reveal (cf the original Planet of the Apes). COMMENT: this was revealed too quickly. If Ivy comes upon it at night, we could discover step-by-step through sound and touch from her pov that this is the modern world. 5. The present day scenes - getting medicine - are boring and anti-climactic. COMMENT: end the film with Ivy's discovery. The explanation for the existence of the village can be given as a visual epilogue. There, I've probably gone on far too long. But I hope this interests some of you."

Also, if no one other than the council knew ""the truth,"" why would the rest of the village need to be told that it was the nineteenth century?  They wouldn't know the difference if they were told it was 2004, but still lived life like people in the 19th century.  However, if they wore modern clothes and lived off the land, I guess they'd just sort of be hippies, which would make for a boring movie.  They'd have to call it ""The Commune"" or something.

I think he is an exceptional story tellerhis movies appear at first to be simple plots consisting of aliens, ghosts, monsters...but those are entertaining cover ups to his wonderfully thought out plots which explore a range human emotion and relationships, as well as basic paradoxes and clichés- good vs evil, fate vs coincidence. His character development is just amazing, of course it doesn't hurt that he casts great actors. Basically, you can take it for what you see, or you can invest a little time(and by time, I don't mean arguing about why the aliens didn't know water hurt them and the composition of the human body) and see his movies for what they really are - compelling investigations into human nature, relationships and what drives us."

","The concept of this movie is very interesting. Especially as technology, culture clash, and economics complicate and infringe on people's lives. At one time or another we all wish that our lives were simpler. If only we could get back to the basics. Get back to the things that are important. This movie takes that idea to a new level while adding some unexpected twists along the way. Also, I have not seen such a wonderful cast in a long time. The actors weren't chosen for their name, but for their skill. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix were amazing in their roles. A superb film by one of todays better movie makers. Refreshing to have an alternative to the typical ""Hollywood"" films."
"MukilLi","Null","0","0","10 August 2004"," Good concept but poor execution.
","Shymalan's movies are gradually going down in quality from Sixth Sense to The Village in that order. Sure the man got talent but I guess he is getting overconfident about his subjects and treatment and underestimating the audience. Well then you have a cost to pay and the cost is ""The Village"".<br/><br/>
Although the plotting is almost similiar to ""Sixth Sense"", I like the concept of the movie (Which I won't describe). It metaphorically connects at multiple levels from Parents protecting their kids to terrorism threat to America to social segregation to ethnic segregation. The rich concept loses the battle to terror and twist ending, the signature of shymalan movies.<br/><br/>The movie does scare in couple of places but overrall it does not fit into the narrative. The only character I was able to connect to was Bryce howard Dallas. She did a fantastic job. Gentlemen a star is born, no doubt. Adrien brody is good in patches and Joaquin Phoenix has nothing to play.<br/><br/>
In general the movie does not fit into horror or drama or thriller, it just makes a hash of all these and mess it up badly."

","Perhaps a justification of it for those making mention of the less-than-spectacular dialogue and acting:  yet another 'hint' of their apostasy from contemporary culture -- their uneven efforts at speaking in the vernacular of the period they wish to emulate -- a strange tongue for them, and therefore interspersed with ""Thanks"" and the such.  I don't believe that it was a mere oversight in the scriptwriting.  I do believe that this and the robotic/inorganic-seeming delivery was fully intentional. p.s. saw the movie on Sunday, am still digesting it. Saw this one just for the set direction, but was struck much by the social commentary as well.

"igm","8","0","0","10 August 2004"," The Village Idiots
","Shyamalan is quite adept at packaging big, existential questions into thrillers. I know I'm in the minority, but I really enjoyed Signs. In a classic bait-and-switch, Shyamalan lures you into the theatre to watch a creature feature, but winds up exploring the nature of faith, and how a man wounded by love's loss, a man of the cloth, recaptures his faith in God. The creatures were a significant letdown, and could quite possibly have been avoided entirely, but that's another story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Back to The Village. I enjoyed this film too. I kept searching for allegorical correlation with contemporary politics. I thought in the early part of the film that the villagers were meant to represent Americans. I thought that their illusory boundary with the forest, and the menace beyond it, was meant to represent the illusory secure perimeter of the nation, and the terrorist threat beyond. That the 'warnings'--small, shaved and gutted animals--corresponded to terrorist incursions on American soil. The allegory was holding up pretty well. But as the story continued to unfold, the symbols started to fall apart and the true themes began to emerge. The film is a meditation on courage and love. There's a line in the movie that goes something like, ""We sometimes avoid doing that which we most wish to do so others may not know our desires."" The line is spoken by Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) to Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) and addresses Lucius' reserve and withdrawal from Ivy at the moment his love for her began to swell. The remark opens Lucius' eyes to the unspoken love between his widowed mother (Sigourney Weaver) and Ivy's wedded father (William Hurt). Lucius interposes himself between the invaders and Ivy, and is spurred to confess his love to Ivy and propose. Ultimately, Ivy is called upon to face the menace in the woods in a similar show of love.<br/><br/>The maddening thing about the story is the Elder Council, the aforementioned idiots. We learn the true nature of the threat to the community, and it comes from within. It is the elders' fear and disengagement--a sentiment paralleled in the relationship between Lucius' and Ivy's parents, members of the Council--that leads to the Village's vulnerability. And the really maddening thing is that the prevaricators prevail, turning tragedy to their ends.<br/><br/>A Hollywood movie without a happy ending. How refreshing.<br/><br/>I liked Shyamalan's clever insertion of himself into the movie, a la Hitchcock, via over the shoulder shots and a reflection in a glass cabinet door. The film production if beautiful. The dialog is sometimes stilted, especially when uttered almost robotically by William Hurt. The mediocre dialog and creature design are internally consistent deficiencies in the film. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it. Mostly, the film works. Eight of ten."

","All of the negative reviews about this film were written by those who most likely went in to this movie expecting to see a horror flick. As most of M. Night Shamalan films The Village was a thought provoking look at people, their surroundings, their fears, their attributes, and so forth. The terror of it all lies mostly in the audiences heads. It's really the thriller of the mind, if you even want to call it that. If the people who hated on this film didn't enjoy it for the above reason, then the second reason for their dismay was probably the slow pace this film was taking. Each and every scene drew us closer, and gave us answers, but the cuts didn't happen every minute as most movies are these days that are like long extended versions of music videos. I thought this film was shot perfectly, and beautifully. Whoever can disagree with me on that is out of his or her mind! The acting was so wonderful, and I adored Adrien Brody's portrayl of a mentally disabled villager who did something [bad] he did not intend to do, because even with his wrong doing he managed to keep me, at least, caring for him and sympathizing. Ron Howards' daughter was amazing as well. Even though in the film her eyes do not work, she manages to tell stories with them, and show emotion with them as well. Jo. Pheonix was so lovable, I just wanted to give him a hug. On top of the ""weird supernatural"" premise, it was a love story, and a cute one at that. I also spotted M. Night!!! w00t I love playing the ""spot the director's cameo in the movie"" game.<br/><br/>Anyway, disregard the bad reviews, this film is a good watch."

The majority of people look on the outside of the movie and judge it on its appearance. With this movie you have to find the moral of the story which is that actions are based upon love. Throughout the entire move love was a factor. I could say nothing but great things about this film all day. The problem with people not liking movies is that they expect things. That is where they go wrong. Obviously people were thinking that this movie would be some sort of horror movie based on the trailer.

","I really enjoy Night's films because they are more than just ""thrillers""; they always have a message to convey. ""The Village"" delivers on this with it's underlying theme of running from the unknown fear in our lives and trying to control things that, ultimately, we have no control over. The love story between Lucius and Ivy is very sweet but I would have liked to seen it developed more as with the relationships with the other characters. Night has such a splendid cast but I think he wasted their talents. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy) was brilliant in her role and I'd like to see her in future endeavors. The movie plods along in the beginning and picks up the pace about 45 minutes into it. I also thought the ending was rather abrupt and left me feeling like there should have been more.

The plot wasn't for those that wish to force-fed one that is simple and uncomplicated without effort on their part.<br/><br/>That said, it comes as very satisfying to those that engage themselves in The Village. I noticed as the movie went on that it had strong connections to three different children's novels. It was very similar to ""Running out of time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix. There were also defiant traces of two books written by Lois Lowery, ""The Giver"" and ""Gathering Blue"". All three stories are highly recommended.

","Spoilers Ahead, Read Only if You've Seen the Movie or Don't Care to Have the ""Secret"" Revealed. I agree with most of these negative reviews because like so many, I feel I was duped into going to see a movie, billed as a thriller, with a sci-fi twist. I mean why would anyone think otherwise? M. Night has made 3 previous movies, all with sci-fi plots. Granted you never know whether or not the film will end up reinforcing the story it puts out in the trailer, but it's a pretty safe bet. Imagine that the Bourne Supremacy, or some other film that ends up being a pure action flick, has a trailer that presents a love affair as the central theme? Granted trailers are revised based on what movie they are running as previews for (give a film a more romantic edge if you wanna appeal to an audience before The Notebook or some other chick flick comes on). But they went too far here.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me was not that the plot was easy to decipher, because I don't think it's so black and white. Although I will say I guessed at the twist when before seeing the movie I asked someone, ""wouldn't it suck if it was this..."" Still while watching it, I didn't know whether or not it was right because I was fixated on finding out what these creatures were. I was shocked with how ostentatious they looked but I knew that if anyone could explain their existence it would be Shayamalan.<br/><br/>But then he goes and makes the easiest escape possible - these creatures aren't real. I mean come on. It would have even been more interesting if he said they were a figment of the imagination. But to say that they are simply costumes donned by people is the worst way out. So here we have an audience crammed with thrill seeker, who don't just want to be scared but want to be fascinated by an explanation that defies the imagination. And instead they get an episode of Colonial House gone wrong.<br/><br/>At it's heart that's really what the movie is. It seems to cater to the latest craze of reality TV (UPN's new Amish show and Colonial House, for example) and make it into a movie. People came to see this film for the supernatural parts of it, to be scared silly by something that was really scary, not too feel like fools for believing in something so ridiculous that it ends up being just that, ridiculous. He could have gone somewhere with this movie, made it interesting in some way. But instead it joins that list of films that had potential and then chickens out of following through with an imaginative and original plot (The Matrix Revolutions comes to mind here too).<br/><br/>I can appreciate his work for his directing ability and for the acting of the cast, but I have to say that the total plot and even the screen writing is on the weak side. Besides for the unappetizing ending, I also found myself on the receiving end of terrible dialogue that made me believe, more than anything else, that these people were not from the 1800s. It was laughable at times to hear some of the things these characters said and they ways in which they said them. One would also think that if you're starting a colony in today's world where only the ""Village Elders"" know the truths behind it, you wouldn't need to make believe it was 1897 or talk in some archaic language because you're kids wouldn't know the difference anyway. But I guess that's just me looking for plot hole where I otherwise would not have looked had the movie been better. That's just my opinion. I'll still go see his next film because I have faith in him as an artist but after this one I feel used and manipulated. 5/10"

Others put down this movie in shame of the twist, I will admit it was a little predictable and the accents of the characters was a little much but still left me thinking ""The Village"" was a great film. The approach on the twist is much more different in this film than in the rest, I would say ""unbreakable"" is the closest. It is not a big twist in the end just a mild subtle ending, and an unexpected one when you compare it to Shyamalan's other films endings.

","The Village could have been far worse. I for one thought it was a great movie. Yes the previews made it seem like a different movie but don't judge a book by it's cover. Lots of movies are made out to be something different by their previews, but who's to say that the director wants his/her movie to be seen in that light and it's not the movie studio that did that to the film. So the movie wasn't about monsters and about people and love instead, big deal(cry about it). If you go into the theater and find out that it's a completely different movie then what you expected then judge the movie on that, not on what some previews lead you to believe, or what some lame ass review told you. If you've seen it once then see it again...or wait till it come out on DVD, and judge it as a movie about what it is, not what you thought it was gonna be. As for the previews giving you a false sense of what it was gonna be...the studio did what they had to...they got their number one movie and their 50 million dollar opening. As for the actors in the film, I thought Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent(although I want to know how a blind woman has a race up a foot hill). Adrien Brody was fantastic as Noah(I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a nomination for best supporting actor). As for the rest of the cast they were all great. M. Night Shyamalan did a great job."

Everything I've heard, from the advance review of the script at AICN to the article at Creative Screen writing magazine, seemed to suggest that MNS was heading for a fall. Well, it's not bad, but it is deeply flawed film with a lot of strengths and an equal number of weaknesses. As always, he draws good performances from his cast. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and especially Bryce Dallas Howard in her debut role, make a vivid impression. MNS has not lost his talent for setting up a suspenseful scene. Scenes of fleeing villagers in the dark, glimpses of the ""creatures"", and an attack in the woods are scary in their own right. The themes of the power of fear and how it can hurt people that live in it are strong and resonant in this post 911-world. However, MNS falls victim to his own weaknesses. Unlike his earlier films, where cryptic dialogue and scenes were powerful because of their place in the normal world, almost EVERY scene has a close-up of some sort, as if to suggest that every word carries weight, which of course, it does not. The fate of Adrian Brody's character will strike many as unnecessary and confusing given his earlier behavior. This defuses the open ending, since Ivy (Howard's character) would be affected by both the ""secret"" of the village and by the death of Brody's character. Like I said, it's not a bad film, but you wonder if the MNS before the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" would have had the discipline to fully realize this great idea into a great film. As it stands, ""The Village"" is merely an okay one. That is the biggest twist of all."

The premise of the movie (read other reviews for a synopsis) while interesting, brings countless questions, such as; Why did they leave a fear based society to create one? Is the antiquated dialogue and dress really necessary? Also, I can't help but think that during a scene with William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver that they are both wondering why they are in such a ridiculous movie? No one in the village wishes to discuss ""those of whom we do not speak"" (aka the monsters outside their five-building village) which after a while gets hilarious, as does the mention of the ""magic rocks"" that ward off the predators with one character wondering, ""How come we haven't heard of these before?"" The ""Secret Shed"" and ""Secret Boxes"" no one bothers to investigate. No one helps the poor blind rich girl who trips over everything, and no one can find an injured villager when there are only a limited number of dwellings. Don't get in trouble or you'll go to the ""quiet room"". If this was shown here at the Sundance Film Festival, it would have been laughed at. The Blair Witch Project was a real thriller which deserved the praise it got. The Village is more of an absurd parody. Rarely if ever scary, it's certainly not a thriller.

The plot continues to unfold after a series of mysterious events soon occur and a voyage across the woods is much needed.<br/><br/>Based on the fact that the inspiration of the story came from Wuthering Heights for its period drama and King Kong for its community living in fear of voracious creatures, this movie sure has its divergence from any other. If you are in the mood for suspense, this movie wouldn't be a waste of two hours. Ignoring a couple of hokey elements, M. Night Shyamalan has succeeded again."

","Now what did they expect from a movie made by M.Night Shyamalan? Something straight...no way. When I watched ""The Village"" I was ready for it, ready for this great director and his very special way of creating movies. When I first watched ""SIGNS"", i did not like it, because of my expectations. I expected something big, something outstanding and the entire movie was in such a small location. No spaceships, no ray-guns...and weird looking aliens. But somehow I realized that there was more to ""SIGNS"" than what disappointed by and when I watched it later on on DVD, it was a great movie with so much depth and feeling. It was ... intense. And that is exactly where I started getting ready for the village: I was expecting something intense and this was exactly what I got. A beautifully shot movie with very well developed and acted characters and a story, revealing and shocking. I will give no spoilers. When you enter ""The Village"" you should do exactly that. Enter it. Be a part of it to get to feel what the inhabitants feel. Then, I promise, you will see probably the best movie this year has to offer."

","Anyone who spends time talking about the ""twist"" is wasting your time. The twist ending is largely irrelevant to the entire movie. Yeah it is there, and yeah you can pat yourself on the back for getting it, but it is about as meaningful to the movie as a celebrity cameo.<br/><br/>The Village could have been a great thriller, but instead ended up a B level Outer Limits episode. The Village as social commentary isn't that bad, except that it doesn't break any new ground. Basically the overall theme of The Village is that fear is used to keep society in line. Sure the message is relevant, but most people know this and M.Night doesn't really bring any new dialogue to the table. <br/><br/>Like most of Nights films you can nitpick the movie to pieces, but it is pointless because thats just how he writes his movies. M.Night is a big picture kind of guy, the minutia of details are irrelevant.<br/><br/>The end result is The Village is a letdown because it isn't good entertainment. It is social commentary, but without any revelations, so the great setup and mood is ruined."

","Shyamalan really found the right combination with Deakins behind the camera and James Newton Howard composing. The music and cinematography was just a perfect mix for me. The shots were simple and non-intrusive, yet still said so much. You can see that most every frame was narrow and tight, sort of capturing the constricted views of the village, in a way. Deakins' ""Shawshank-ian"" techniques really came through in that aspect. I loved that shot that panned out to the wide open, foggy landscape when Lucius and Ivy first kissed, almost showing how they had sort of transcended the confines of the village for a bit. As for the score, Hahn's violin parts were perfect. It reminded me of Zimmer's eerie cello composition from The Ring, only with a twist of romance.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I really think this could have been Adrien Brody's best performance, to date (rivaling The Pianist). To me, he was quite possibly the most horrifyingly innocent character in any movie i've seen. The only thing he was missing was an M-16 and an angry drill sargeant. Bryce Dallas Howard's character was so persistent and passionate and Joaquin Phoenix's character was such a great compliment (it is very interesting to see, in the movie, how a blind person and a practically mute person can be so perfect for each other). These three characters lended to an interesting See No Evil (Ivy), Hear No Evil (Noah), Speak No Evil (Lucius) dynamic in the movie.<br/><br/>The color said a lot, as well. The shunning of ""red"" seemed to satire the ""Red Scare"" days of American politics. Other colors just came alive in their own artistic way, coating the characters and painting the set. Shyamalan also made sure to insert his usual political/social commentary in there in other ways, though I can't decide if it was with more or less tact this time around. Either way, Orwell certainly provided some inspiration.<br/><br/>Call me a sucker for off-beat romantic thriller's, but I have to give this movie a 10. Maybe it was the dark, vintange 1920's movie theater I saw it in that did it for me. Maybe it was that damn slo-motion sequence, I don't know. Overall, it just killed."

","The most effective way to get a demographic to a movie where they wouldn't normally go is by misleading trailers. If the trailers for The Hulk depicted it to be an outstanding drama, like it was, I would doubt it would get its money back. The same goes for The Village. M. Night Shyamalan, known for his what-you-don't-see-scares-you type of movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), now has done The Village, which, according to the ads, is a scare-fest around 1900. In reality, it's a period piece about some haunted woods. The movie chronicles their interactions with each other, for the most part.<br/><br/>In a small village surrounded by woods, the people of Covington live in constant fear of the creatures that live in the woods around. They have struck up a shaky deal with them-neither of them enter the other's territory. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is blind and is in mutual love with taciturn Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix). Since it seems that simple-minded Noah (Adrien Brody) can enter the woods without being harmed, Lucius tries it and ends up disturbing the balance between the two life forms. Soon Lucius is put out of commission and Ivy has to walk through the woods to get medicine. You know, even though it's 1900, I would think that people would have more sense than to have a blind person go through haunted woods by themselves.<br/><br/>Shyamalan knows how to create fear, and for a few fleeting seconds, he does in The Village. The failing point is that there's barely any moments in which that could happen. Most of the movie is spent on the characters and unnecessary subplots that have no purpose. Shyamalan knows the what-you-don't-see-scares-you way of going about it, but with another overbearing score, James Newton Howard takes the what-you-hear-scares-you way of going about it, and winds up being almost farcical, which is what the movie becomes at times. Seeing the creatures is one of the funniest moments in a movie this year. I mean...come on! Still, when it is scary, it's pretty damn intense. But for one minute out of a 108 minute movie, it's not a good ratio.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is known for his twists at the end of movies. The Sixth Sense had one that was truly shocking; Unbreakable's was also mind-blowing but one I'd need to see again, but Signs' was just plain silly. Many people feel that in both Signs and The Village he's writing a script so he can have a twist at the end. The twist is what basically saved this movie. It's a shocking twist, one that I didn't get, and most people didn't, also, even though they say they did. It's much better than the stupidity of Signs' ending. That's where the first hour and a half comes in. It's basically fluff, with unnecessary subplots thrown in (including the love twist with Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt) and a bunch of random characters. Also, with the slow build-up of the creatures, instead of a slow pay-off of slowly revealing the monsters, they come out all at once. And as I said before, I cracked up when I saw them.<br/><br/>The acting here isn't as good as Shyamalan's others. Phoenix (who seems to have taken over the wheel from Bruce Willis) isn't as good as he was in Signs, surprisingly. Howard isn't worthy of all of this praise, but she was still good. Weaver doesn't have much to do, but Hurt totally owns the screen whenever he's on. If you're looking for a reason to see this movie, see it for William Hurt. I'll probably be killed for this, but I think Brody was better here than in The Pianist. He seems to be having fun here. If you go into The Village looking for a fun time, you probably won't find it. You may come out of it with more than I did, but it has its moments, especially at the end.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations."

","The Village manages to do absolutely nothing original or interesting. <br/><br/>
   Where many reviews focus on the plot and its various elements, this one will competely ignore the plot and focus on the Artistic elements of the film.<br/><br/>   As usual, M. Night  Shyamalan provides a very well-crafted setting for his story.  On a fundamental level, there is nothing out of place or odd. However, that is this films greatest flaw.  A society completely isolated, which has been around long enough for children to be born and raised, and there is<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY nothing unique to this village other than the prohibition against<br/><br/>the color Red.<br/><br/>  Limiting the set and costume design by dropping a color is a nice touch, but there isn't much story behind it.  On a political level, the society is as communal as they could possibly make it....very Red if you follow political color schemes.<br/><br/>   In short, Shyamalan's greatest asset in his film-making has always been his eye for detail, color, and visual ploys/plays.  It just doesn't happen in The Village.  It is lack-luster at best.   Music is bland, cinematography is<br/><br/>unimpressive.  Costume Design and Set Design is at the level of a badly funded stage play.  <br/><br/>   Take all of this and combine it with an unimaginative scrupt and you get<br/><br/>nothing special.<br/><br/>   On to Acting:    Joaquin Phoenix does an effective enough job, but it is not up to his usual standards.  He seems less than interested with the world that<br/><br/>Shyamalan gives him, which I blame the director for more than the actor. Adrien Brody does an exquisite job playing Noah Percy.  The character<br/><br/>illuminates a drab screen and ands interest and intrigue. The true gem of this film is Bryce Dallas Howard.   Her character is vibrant, well-acted, interesting and commanding.   She pulls out of the script a<br/><br/>performance that was frankly better than this film deserved.    Expect her to thunder onto the Hollywood main-stage as soon as she gets a role worth<br/><br/>playing.<br/><br/>Her performance, along with Adrien Brody, help keep this film from being a<br/><br/>dismal failure.

","There is much to recommend about this film.  It is beautifully shot, and has several very thrilling scenes.  The acting is very good, especially by Adrian Brody (sp?) and William Hurt (I think his best).  The story is really interesting, but I figured out the plot halfway through, at which time the suspense really dies off.  Do yourself a favor, don't read too many revealing reviews.  Having read a bit, I knew not to expect a horror, but I can see why people who went to see a horror would give this film a bad review.  I think the previews were misleading and hurtful to the film, afterall, horror fans aren't looking for a cerebral slow developing film, which this is, and will surely be disappointed.  <br/><br/>I find what you think about a film has a lot to do with what you expect when you go in.  See this film expecting a cerebral thriller, with powerfully presented social commentary (none of which is anything new though, I'd say rather cliche...).  So.. what's this movie about?

","A pox on all the so-called ""serious"" movie critics who are panning this fine effort... they are missing the point. The reason some films are made is simple: entertainment.

The 19th century Gothic novels it was paying tribute to are also slow paced. It's all part of the mood the director is trying to set up. The acting is very good, the script is very well written, the camera work effective.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie with lots of car crashes and political messages, go see something else.

","Here we have a seemingly picturesque nineteenth century village in rural Pennsylvania. But of course, things are not as they seem.<br/><br/>
Possible spoilers after this point.<br/><br/>I won't comment on the ""surprise ending"" which was no surprise to me since I guessed it half-way through the movie. What I really want to know is why did these elders who founded the colony think living in a nineteenth century village would make the perfect utopia? What's wrong with electricity? Or modern clothes? Or indoor plumbing? Why use mid 19th century speech patterns? Do any of these things have any real intrinsic value in regards to a society? I don't think so. <br/><br/>I know the whole idea was a retreat to innocence. But I fail to see why living in a relatively primitive society would enhance innocence. Sure, you may have simplified your life on the surface, but in ANY society with two or more human beings, there WILL complications. Mankind can't exist in a state of pure innocence. It's simply human nature. And to delude yourself that living a Amish-like existence will heal all your wounds is very sad. You can't run from your pain. You deal with it. But these elders did no such thing. They ran from their problems and founded a doomed utoptia. And of course all utopias are doomed from the start. Of course I also realize that the use of the 19th century by the writers was simply to throw the viewer off for the ""surprise"" ending.<br/><br/>
Now in regards to the love story, I felt this was tastefully and realistically done. Normally I don't like hollywood love stories because they are so trite..ie ""Titantic"", but not so here. There was also some decent suspense and the acting was good throughout. I rated this 6/10. It's worth a look, but wait 'till the DVD comes out."

","The Village did not meet the standards of your typical M. Night Schyamalan film, nor was it nearly as scary as some, including myself, had hoped it to be. Despite these failures, though, the movie was enticing from beginning to end, with many unexpected events and two huge twists at the end. Neither were completely predictable, and the slight loopholes in the way of life in the village kept me engaged to see how it would all be explained in the end. There were also plenty of suspenseful moments. The camera work was spectacular, most notably in the scene in Covington woods, and the acting jobs by Howard and Phoenix far exceeded my expectations. All in all, do not go to see The Village thinking that will be reminiscent of the Sixth Sense, or as scary as Silence of the Lambs, for it will disappoint you, as it has many, under these standards.

","Contains spoiler!!! I'm not referring to the makers of the film, but to the army of critics who have made it sound like another Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br/><br/>What is their problem? And what is motivating this inexplicable, over-the-top hostility towards M. Night Shyamalan? <br/><br/>Uh, hello? The dude makes GOOD films. <br/><br/>I went to see The Village this afternoon, despite all the negative buzz, bracing myself for something REALLY bad, like Bats, or The Haunting, or even Battlefield Earth. <br/><br/>But not only is there nothing terribly wrong with the film, it is, in fact, an absorbing, suspenseful, carefully made, expertly directed Mystery/Thriller/Romance - yes, a bit self-consciously arty at times and with Shyamalan's characteristic hiccups of awkward-sounding dialogue - but a more-than-satisfactory movie-going experience and far better than the typical summer flick, with a standout performance from newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, and able support from veterans William Hurt (who for once brings his ""A"" game) Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody. <br/><br/>It also delivers the director's trademark twist ending, one that I, for one, did NOT see coming. To all the geniuses who like to boast that they - SPOILERS! - knew all along that the story actually takes place in the present day and not in the late 1800s, I have two words for you: you're lying. <br/><br/>Because Shyamalan presents his films partly as puzzles to be solved, a segment of the audience who fancy themselves great intellects enter the theater not in the typical relaxed movie-going mode of simply wanting to be entertained, but with arms crossed, feeling challenged to ""crack"" the film, prove they're smarter than it; in essence, wanting desperately to beat Shyamalan as if he were not a filmmaker but an opponent at Chess. Therefore, they're guarded, closed off, emotionally inaccessible and unlikely to enjoy themselves, regardless of how good the movie might be (and in fact is).<br/><br/>The film is only a cheat from the standpoint that Shyamalan is associated with the supernatural, and when the explanation in this case is a rather prosaic one - uncomfortably close to the unmasking of the monster at the end of an episode of Scooby Doo - it is a bit of a letdown. If studies show that over half the population believes in ghosts (or aliens) then I'd estimate that the other half WANTS to believe in them. And that is why The Sixth Sense and Signs were such huge hits - in them, Shyamalan confirms those beliefs, validates them by making the supernatural world seem not ridiculous and far-fetched as most do, but tantalizingly realistic.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the marketing of the film is so misleading, priming one to expect a spooky spine-tingler with chills aplenty (something like The Others) which, despite a few well-placed jolts, The Village most certainly is not. It is, of course, primarily a love story, with Shyamalan, I believe, having been inspired by Wuthering Heights. But, while the well-liked Spider-Man 2 is a love story disguised as action-adventure, it's a convincing disguise, the movie suffering from no shortage of action and excitement. <br/><br/>The Village's disguise is not nearly so effective, its marketing the equivalent of slapping a splashy Stephen King dust jacket over a copy of The Age of Innocence. <br/><br/>One can also question the casting of Joaquin Phoenix, a dour, somewhat charmless, far-from-handsome actor in the crucial role of Lucius, the strange, silent, sensitive young man consumed with a secret love for the free-spirited Ivy and a desire to venture into the forbidden woods. I think much of the negative reaction to the film can be explained by a subconscious desire on the part of most men and women for a more accessible, likable, and, well, better-looking actor to play that particular part. Had Orlando Bloom, for instance, been cast, I firmly believe general reaction to the film would have been much more favorable. <br/><br/>Phoenix does finally come alive in that vividly acted porch scene where he suddenly declares his love for Ivy. And that was the scene that got me, the centerpiece of the film, where it ""clicks"" into place, reveals itself for what it is and makes no apologies for it. Lucius and Ivy belong together. You can see it in their eyes, and it is impossible for me to dislike a film that is able to capture such honesty of emotion. The essence of successful film-making is the ability to create the illusion that two people are in love. It does not happen often. <br/><br/>So how to explain the critics' wildly inaccurate evaluation of the film, as well as their seeming hatred of Shyamalan? I can only guess that it has something to do with Shyamalan's films having a certain overly delicate ""goody-goody"" quality which makes them easy targets - I really don't know. I do know that, unlike some, I don't go into any movie determined to ""crack"" them, or even enjoy them, but I always go in determined to give them a chance."

","Tension, building drama, and a great story...all things one would expect from an M. Night Shyamalan film. Actually, just one film, The Sixth Sense. Since then, with Unbreakable, Signs, and now The Village, he has been on a downward trajectory that is inexplicable for someone of talent. Is it laziness, or is it the fact that just because a film has a twist (The Village has a few), it's worth seeing?<br/><br/>The Village is a monumental disappointment. Not because I expected much, but rather because the story is incredibly flat, minus any real suspense or tension. Once the hidden elements or ""twists"" were revealed (I had already guessed them correctly, like any 12 year old might), I wondered why I had forked over $8 to have my intelligence insulted. This is the stuff of junior high short-story contests, not feature film material at all.<br/><br/>The score and cinematography are excellent, but in this case they are wasted, as is Howard's performance, which is a stand out.

Is it any coincidence that the one person who did make it across the wall was blind, and so could not speak of what she 'saw'?... Ivy was told by her father that the creatures were a farce.

But then you face reality, and realize that danger really does exist and what was it that Ivy told Lucius, that he in turn, told his mother? That when you don't want someone to know how you feel about them, you try to convince them that you couldn't possibly feel that way, or something like thathow many times have I done that?

The premise actually is the tale of a College professor that had an idea...of starting a commune out in the middle of the woods...because the real world was too much for them....and the way they keep their children and everyone else from fleeing the village is by having the village elders dress up in (excuse my language) goofy ass costumes and run around in the woods...WTF? its all a lie, its all ""farce"" as William hurt would put it as he said himself in the movie. I was very disappointed, this movie had so much potential yet to be wasted to try and display deep metaphorical value.

","Spoiler Alert i would like to point out something that many people seem to have missed in a sudden but fierce attack of stupidity. multiple commentors are stating that Night created a flawed movie in that it was set in the 1800's but there were ""modern things"" in it. the movie was NOT based in the 1800's. the village itself was based on life in the 1800's as it was self sufficient - had it not been, communication with the outside world would have been unavoidable due to the need for supplies and whatnot. this film was set to be in our day and age... hence the park security RANGE ROVER. (hard to find those driving around in 1897, isn't it?) now i don't mean to be rude, but if you can't comprehend such a simple concept as that, who are you to be critiquing films? <br/><br/>now as for the film itself... although it was advertised as a horror movie, we all know that it was not (thanks to the millions of people complaining about this fact all over the place -- such as my boyfriend in my ear every two minutes throughout the entire movie). despite the fact that i entered the theater with the intentions of being frightened, the at first disappointing realization that i was NOT going to be scared was not as unfortunate as i had expected. overall, it was a beautifully done film. the acting was superb, the cinematography was impressive, and the messages that the story relayed to the viewer were touching and inspirational.<br/><br/>do not see this movie if you are expecting to be scared and will complain when you aren't - there are enough people milling around that can't accept the film for what it is rather than what it isn't. but on the other hand if you want emotion and a wonderfully done story and movie, the Village should be your next cinematic experience."

Night's third big horror film I was relieved I saved for this movie and not ""white castle"". I have no doubt that it IS a funny movie, but I only had 7 bucks and I would rather watch a ""film"" than a ""movie"". The Village has few truly scary moments in it that would make you shrink in you're seat, but what is there is honestly frightening. yes there are shock moments in the movie, loud noises when something on screen flashes by for .05 seconds.<br/><br/>The creatures themselves are oddly designed, rather shoddy looking in some shots, however when you see the film frame-to-frame you understand why they look so shoddy. but they are very bulky and menacing, and actually made me wish that I didn't take the front row seat because I was a bit too close to the screen for my own comfort. I will admit that I was disappointed when certain facts were brought to light....then drawn back....then brought back into light again. the movie is so misleading that at times you feel like a yo-yo that M. Night has his hands on, and he is walking the freakin dog! the forest itself is the most frightening aspect of the film, with branches twisting in odd skeletal shapes, and fog shrouded areas looming every which way. a few actors really stand out after the lights go up in the theatre. mainly Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, and a very notable performance by William Hurt as Ivy's father. Joaquin is a very handy actor and I see him in other movies with bigger names in the director chair, but here he gives an awkward stoic kind of banality that I really did not care for.<br/><br/>the movie's message is very noble and it's notions should be carefully examined and to a much lesser extent be practiced by people. of course there will be a twist at the end...this is Shyamalan for godsake! it is surprising if you haven't seen his films, and run of the mill if you have. 3/4 stars sounds good to me =)."

","In spite of varying opinions about the value of the film, there are those of us who wholeheartedly ""get it"" and, in fact, not only rate it highly but could do an entire master's thesis about the various themes explored in The Village. In other words, come prepared to not only be entertained by M. Night Shyamalan's latest offering, but also prepared to have your brain waving with delight for days after. <br/><br/>On the surface, the talents of William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are, as usual, impeccable. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is a delight. It is specifically because of these folks that the questionable parts of the film, like the sometimes stilted conversation, become clues rather than distractions. And it is because the the perfectly melded cast that the themes of The Village are both obvious and subtle at the same time.<br/><br/>Questions abound, both answered by the film itself and asked by The Village, left for you to ponder as you relate the story to mankind's history and your own life story. And in the characters, you will find yourself and those you love. Intense personal emotional pain is shown by Hurt in a subtle masterful way, as is the love that finds its way through the protective wall he had built. The courage and love shown by Howard's character is thrilling. Strength, hope, doubts, fear, happiness, sorrow, trust, and more...it's all there. And it's all wonderfully woven in to the story to highlight the social metaphors about the ills of society, how we choose to deal with such, and whether or not we can ever truly be ""preserved"" from those ills.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has created a gem here for those who go beyond the entertainment value and mine the deeper vein."

However, being somewhat of an insane movie buff, I was somewhat interested in the film, considering the prior works of the director. I was not amused. And it wasn't just me either. My friends and I (as well as the whole audience) found ourselves laughing out loud instead of cowering in fear. Our first qualm was that, although the female lead 'Ivy' was cursed with blindness, she still ran, broke up fights and looked people dead in the eye when talking to them. It was not without its moments however, the bad color (red) among barren forest gave some scenes a somewhat shocking beauty...but these moments were short lived as another 'twist' sent us back off into peals of laughter.

"kburditt","10","0","0","3 August 2004"," A Gothic tale by a gifted story teller.
","This is a great story, a well crafted film, and a positive move for a young, talented film maker. M. Night Shyamalan has proven that the power of a movie is in the story, not the special effects. It is in the directing, editing, cinematography, and acting, not the cheap thrills. If you're expecting a formulaic thriller, a bloody slasher film, or another sci-fi twist at the end - you will be disappointed. If you go wanting to be mesmerized by a complex, layered story, and terrific ensemble acting - you will be enjoying and thinking about this film for days. <br/><br/>This film is about fear, and how fear impacts lives, and controls a communities future. This film is about the community misfits rising above the group fear to face the unknown, the unseen, and find their own courage and leadership. Something to think about in this time of Homeland Security and Code Orange Alerts. Shyamalan is being compared to Hitchcock - but Hitchcock at his prime, with years of film making under his belt. Compare Shyamalan to the young Hitchcock of ""A Lady Vanishes"", ""Sabotage"", and the first ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". There you will see a strong story teller, testing his theories, and refining his craft. Is this the best Shyamalan film? I hope not, I hope in 10 and 20 years Shymalan will be weaving his stories, and keeping us on the edge of our seats with greater films. The man is a gifted story teller - and his medium is film. <br/><br/>And for those who have criticized the 'stilted' dialogue - if you read diaries from the 1800's, the dialogue is not far off the mark. It was a time when people considered speaking and oration an art to practice.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it."

","I've never felt compelled to comment on a film here at IMDb until viewing ""The Village"" last night and then reading the comments already posted here. I did'nt go into the theatre expecting a horror film as M.Night's previous works have always been more Twilight Zone-esque (including that mother of all Twilight Zone ripoffs ""Unbreakable""). Let's just say that I was disappointed that I was not given a chance to work out the so-called twist ending because the film gave it away within the first few minutes! I don't consider myself a genius by any stretch but anyone paying attention to William Hurt's opening Q&A session with his schoolchildren, wherein Hurt's character gives us all the details on ""Why we must'nt go into the woods"", should have been able to write the rest of the script themselves. When a film gives you a piece of information, you can't help but momentarily ponder that information (and this film gives you LONG stretches of moments with which to ponder) and in the case of ""The Village"", it took me about 30 seconds to figure out what was going on. Not that I wanted to! I wanted to be swept up in the plot and the ""mood"" of the film. I was not on some sort of crusade to unravel the mystery of ""The Village"". Unfortunately, the director unwittingly gave the game away by either underestimating the intelligence of his audience or with hack screen writing. All I was left to do was endure the pointless misdirection and banal love stories until the movie reached it's painfully obvious climax. This film was like an 8th grader's creative writing assignment. ""The Village"" is embarrassing!"

","First of all, I love this movie. I can't say that I left the theater with the overwhelming feeling, rather it's something that crept up on me. M. Night has a talent that is rare and absolutely refreshing in today's pre-packaged, preservative laden, look-at-this-actor-he/she's-oh-so-hot, gimmicky, production line-movie world. That said, if you're looking for a pre-packaged, preservative laden, production line-movie, this is Not the movie for you. At this point, I could go into the whys and wherefores that make Shymalan movies so Incredible (to myself) but I'll limit my musings to The Village. I was not hit by the full impact of this movie until discussing it later with friends. No, the movie is not the 'horror' trailers made it out to be, but being a Shymalan fan, I knew from the beginning not to expect the blood and guts gore that resonate so well with horror-genre favorites.<br/><br/>Shymalan's particular brand of horror is unique and utterly psychological. Plots, story lines, characters, and visuals wriggle their way under your skin only to work their way back out in unimaginable places at unbelievable times. A psychological brick to the head as a person waits in line to pay for the Big Gulp and Twizzlers, if you will. <br/><br/>The Village- a quaint, picturesque, perfect, peaceful town governed by the Elders. The same Elders that systematically instill fear into the townspeople and their own children in an effort to protect them from the harsh realities of a world gone amok. Young men and women that live in absolute terror of the unknown- 'Those we do not speak ofÂ…'<br/><br/>Shymalan's characters create a place that is to be the antithesis of the one they left behind, but in doing so, the characters create a world far more complex, ritualistic, and terror-laden than the previous. A new world complete with murder, mayhem, madness and all the intricacies produced by nature and by defect that are human. <br/><br/>My preservative-laden take: Jim Jones goes Pennsylvania Dutch, pulls an Anne Heche, and a whole town goes along for the ride."

","""The Village"" is clear proof that M Night Shyamalan is one of the most talented filmmakers of our time. Unfortunately, many are under the impression that his only purpose in life is to shock moviegoers with his every film. This school of thought, sadly, tends to be the not-so-subtle undertone to all IMDb comments and forums. I have seen the movie twice in its opening weekend, and I must say, without hesitation, that this film is absolutely beautiful. What viewers must realize is this: plot twists are always essential to a good story, but that in no way means the film must have surprises that hit as hard as the ending of 'The Sixth Sense.'<br/><br/>That being said, allow me to continue discussing a few of the film's strong points (of which there are many):<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is flawless. For being one of her first leading roles she has shown talent that makes even the most polished actresses appear as amateurs. Her ability to express emotion throughout the film is so believable it is haunting, and this gift is only amplified by Shyamalan's keen sense of writing and camera movement. Two of the most powerful scenes in the movie exemplify this: the first, when Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are speaking on her family's porch, and the second when Howard fears that something horrible has transpired and moves hastily toward Phoenix's house.<br/><br/>Without delving too much into the details and disclosing too much of the story, focus on Howard's and Phoenix's exchange in the first scene. This begins with how she is able to 'see' with her feet (a subtlety that some people tend to miss) and ends with dialogue that is so beautiful, it almost removes the characters entirely from the film's disturbing premise.<br/><br/>The next scene to which I am referring is a single shot that centers on Howard (as she struggles to maintain composure at the thought of something horrific), which stretches halfway across the entire village. Her movement through the fear, sadness and desperation is perfect. I only hope that other directors will be able to harness and utilize this talent half as well as Shyamalan has done here.<br/><br/>This is why I would like people to disassociate themselves from their preconceived notions as fans of M Night Shyamalan films. The basic foundation for his films is not to trick or dupe the audience, but rather to tell a good story; and whether or not you can determine beforehand what the ending will be, it is the journey that the characters take that is so 'shocking.' That's what viewers of 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' had to realize. The level of fear to which the audience is subject is not to make the film scary, but rather to add depth and dramatic tension to the decisions the characters make. There will be points in all of his films whereby you feel terror--but this is not necessarily for the purpose of shocking the audience; it is a method of storytelling where we feel the same emotions the characters would if we were in the same position.<br/><br/>There is a fantastic subtext to each and every film that Shyamalan has made, but that subtext has only been made clearer with 'Signs' (faith), and 'The Village' (love). Do not go to his films to be shocked, startled and scared, but go to them with an open mind with the eagerness to see a well-made story; there is a much larger picture than that which appears on screen."

Having seen it twice; once for the entertainment and again to pick up on the clues that lead you to the ending, I did enjoy the acting. The director set the bar very high for himself and his audience with the Sixth Sense and Signs and it is unfortunate that this movie has to be compared to his earlier work. As a stand-alone effort it is good but not what is expected when compared to the others.<br/><br/>The difficulty I had with the movie was the lack of explanation of the details of how the Village came to be and how it is sustaining itself (It apparently had been going on for about 20 years).<br/><br/>For example, the only time I saw farm animals (alive) was near the beginning when there was a flock of sheep in a long shot. Where were the other animals needed to support a commune: cows for milk, horses for plowing, pigs for ...whatever?<br/><br/>It also seemed strange to me that there were no other live animals present like dogs and cats. (The one exception was a sheep dog seen herding sheep in the distance) It was also strange that when the skinned animals (dogs?) started showing up, why were the villagers not upset at loosing a pet?<br/><br/>Also, where were the villager's crops (the time line went from summer into winter)? All I saw was small gardens and from what I could gather they appeared to be vegetarians. <br/><br/>Finally, how did the villagers get items like kerosene for the lamps (and they used a lot of lamps!), where did they get nails and other hardware from, and simple items like shoe leather, buttons, etc.?<br/><br/>I would like to have seen more set-up in the beginning or am I expecting too much?"

Then, at one point she's standing at the top of some some steep stairs next to someone and not holding on to anything. Regardless of how long a person has been blind, they do not have the best sense of balance and standing on top of steep stairs next to someone, fearless, is unfathomable.

William Hurt is forced to utter phrases that are amongst the most moronic ever spoken. Adrian Brody plays the most idiotic idiot ever to tarnish the silver screen. Sigourney Weaver appears confused most of the time, as if some voice in the back of her mind is pleading with her to reconsider what she is doing with her career. Joaquin Phoenix, however, should be praised just for staying awake in his scenes. He wanders through the movie as if he had just been shot with about 45 tranquilizer darts. He has two expressions: Blank and slightly pained. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a cluttered, incoherent mess. It would be watchable if indeed it was the huge joke that it at first appears to be. The suffocating heavy-handedness of the proceedings, however, soon made me realize that although I was laughing hysterically no one involved in the making of the film was let in on the joke. Basically, the movie is just a long-winded excuse for M. Night Shyamalan to offer the audience a twist which, when it comes, is so predictably dumb that one has to question his sense of reality.<br/><br/>Does he live on this planet? Does he exist day to day with people that find his pseudo-philosophical musings worthy of their time? Can he be held responsible for his actions? Basically, this movie, if it ever had a chance of being watchable, would have begun at the ending, for only then is the true scene really presented. In other words, this is not really a movie. It is an elaborate excuse for a setup. It is a long depiction of a guy getting ready for a date. He preps endlessly, walks for miles to get to his paramour's abode, rings the doorbell and then...the movie stops. Woe to those who witness this unholy spectacle! May you, with time, be able to remember that elysian past before you walked into the theater one day, glanced at the show times, and thought, ""Hey maybe we should go see The Village."" I, for one, am not sure if this is possible."

","Though not nearly as much of a disappointment as SIGNS, THE VILLAGE is M. Night Shyamalan's third disappointment in a row, beginning with UNBREAKABLE.<br/><br/>Whereas UNBREAKABLE was just boring, and the plotline of SIGNS had so many holes in it as to make it almost laughable, THE VILLAGE (just like SIGNS) starts off strong, but ends very weakly.  So as not to spoil the movie for those who intend to see it no matter what, the completely illogical encounter between Bryce Howard's and Charlie Hofheimer's characters robs the film's ""message"" of whatever strength it might have possessed, a strength that might have been quite forceful had Shyamalan not written himself into a corner and threw in a slap-dash ending.<br/><br/>In horror/suspense films, there is a fine line between believability and idiocy.  Shyamalan walked this line expertly with THE SIXTH SENSE but floundered pathetically with SIGNS.  This latest venture only proves that THE SIXTH SENSE was a fluke - its expertly constructed suspense an anomaly in Shyamalan's repertoire - and that Shyamalan needs to take refresher courses on how to tell a believable story that is cohesive and does not rely on slap-dash endings to get the film to end in a ticket sales-friendly time frame.<br/><br/>Mr. Shyamalan's message came through loud and clear.  However, for such a message to be couched in a stretch of a premise (and it is a bit of a stretch) with such an unsatisfactory ending is shameful.  Admission to a movie is much too high for one to leave the theatre two or three hours later unentertained and, in some cases (depending on the type of film), unfulfilled."

","I now officially love M. Night Shyamalan ... or at least I love his films. In these days of cat scares, cliche gore, action thrillers, and hyper-ironic post-modern fear factors, it seems that Shyamalan is one of the few people who is experimenting with Suspense and Suspense as vehicle to tell interesting stories.<br/><br/>If you liked _The Sixth Sense_ and _Unbreakable_, know that this is a different kind of movie.  There is no ""big twist"" at the end.  This isn't a film where you won't be able to at least have a guess at what's going on. That's not it's point.  The joy in this film is in watching how events unfold and how these characters act and interact.  Their primal struggle is internal, conveniently externalized for us by the mysterious threat that forces them to fight their more personal demons.  <br/><br/>This is a film about our loved ones, what we do when we develop them, what we do to protect them, and what we do when we lose them.  (Listen for Hurt's line about love that ends a scene you've been building up to for awhile.)<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot.  It's well-crafted.  It has several exciting performances played with great honesty in a ""close to the chest"" intensity that captures a reserved people placed under pressure.  That's a style that Shyamalan likes for his films, and here I find it succeeding the most so far.<br/><br/>It's too early yet to start talking about him as the modern day Hitchcock, but I sure can't wait for this filmmaker's next film."
"katydid4819","5","0","0","8 August 2004"," Shyamalan's Glory Days Are Over
","Unlike his previous films, M. Knights Shyamalan's The Village is more Hollywood expectations than decent, original filmmaking. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs Shyamalan toyed with strange scenarios, experimental lighting and a powerful sense of honest suspense. In The Village all these elements still exist but they are overshadowed by the weak ending and stiff characterizations that keep you from being completely drawn into the film. <br/><br/>Color has played a big role in Night's films and here it does again. Red is the bad color (The Sixth Sense, anyone?) and it is countered by yellow. The people of the village wear the strange shade of mustard hoping to protect them from whatever it is that they are so afraid of. The red things, I guess.  They live in a village that is completely set apart from any time period. Though the tombstone in the beginning says 1800, the grave is surrounded by barbed wire and the presence of plastic is not scarce. These people idealize innocence and perhaps in trying to capture this, the script abandoned plot development for this more free feeling. As the village idiot chases a blind girl through a field, the audience is still trying to figure out how any of this is relevant. It's not until more than half way through the film that there is more going on then burying the `bad color'.<br/><br/>The Village wants to be a film that the actors carry. If the casting had gone better then maybe the whole movie would have been salvaged. But as it is the story is just not strong enough to overcome it's own faults and the poor performances of it's actors. Ron Howard's daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard) plays the blind girl, Ivy. I didn't know she was blind until someone said so. When she speaks to someone, she looks them in the eye, when she walks it's exactly where she wants to go and she's not clumsy in the awkward way she should be. Apparently Ivy has the ability to see people by the specific color they each have. This is so ridiculous it can only be explained by the fact that they had to give her something because she couldn't pull off playing someone who's blind. Oh, a quick side note about Bryce Dallas Howard: It's funny that her hair is red. That should have been a sign not to cast her. Adrien Brody, coming fresh off his Oscar win, gives the best performance of the film. It's not a hard character. He plays the slightly retarded Noah Percy. It's the usual bag of tricks: dopey eyes, laughing, clapping. See Sean Penn in I Am Sam for a better take on this type of person.<br/><br/>There is nothing exciting about The Village. In all fairness, it doesn't deserve the trashing it has received from critics but Shyamalan disappoints here and for him, this kind of let down will hurt twice as hard. I suppose it is true that all thing that go up must come down but Night had a long way to fall and I have to say I hope he hit the bottom. Another Village and Shyamalan could be said as a flash in the pan with The Sixth Sense. Nothing can ever top that and if you can't go up, there's nowhere but down. I suppose The Village was doomed from the day `I see dead people' was penned. **1/2 out of *****"

","when we went to see this movie, we were expecting the movie to be a real thriller about monsters and the fear of them coming out of the woods.  We couldn't have been more wrong.  from the point of view of a person who is in love with horror movies and films about monsters, this movie couldn't have been more disappointing.  They spent so much time in the beginning of the movie focusing on life in the village, that when they finally got to the part about the creatures coming into the village, you couldn't help but to let out a sigh of relief.  Finally! time for some monsters!  But even then you were disappointed because it only lasted for about 3 minutes.  And as for the twist.  I can't really say that I was surprised.  I had heard somebody say before the movie even began that it was probably going to take place in modern times.  I was sitting there during the whole movie hoping that person would have been proved wrong. But yet once again, I was let down.  The twist for me was just not enough of a slap in the face.  The Sixth Sense, no one saw that coming.  Unbreakable even had a pretty good twist.  Signs, well, I can't say it was really a twist, but at least it had a nice cool surprise coincidence.  But as for the village, even if you hadn't guessed out right what was coming, I don't think it was as much of a surprise as every one is letting on.  For me, I think I could have liked the movie a whole lot better.  I just wish the movie would have been marketed differently.  The movie is not about monsters and the fear of being attacked thereof.  It's about living life in a simple village, and the consequences of keeping secrets and burying pasts.  Nothing more.  It had it's good parts, and it had it's bad parts.  Overall, I think it moved far to slowly. <br/><br/>

","There was absolutely no mystery in this film. The setting, architecture, and clothing only worked if The Village existed in modern time. I wanted to think, naw, that's not a twist, is it? He's just pulling a Tim Burton, drawing from many time periods to create a sort of ""time out of time"" and make The Village a metaphor... Clearly, I was giving the man WAY too much credit.<br/><br/>As soon as we see Ivy with her cane, we know two things. 1) This is now confirmed as a modern piece. Think of Helen Keller in the Miracle Worker, or John Malkovich's character in Places in the Heart. It's anachronistic, especially for a society that has been afraid to contact the outside world for decades. 2) We know she will venture alone into the ""modern"" world and not be able to tell anyone about what she sees there... If you needed any other clues, look to the fact that Those The Writer Dared Not Think Deeply About wear red, the color that supposedly offends them. Heck, it's so offensive, they even use it on every door. Looks greatr on a poster, makes about 6 senses less than Shyamalan's first film. None, whatsovever.<br/><br/>Now, 6th Sense was... passable. The twist did hold up. There just wasn't anything else of value to the story. I wasn't ever scared or all that intrigued. It would have made a decent half hour Twilight Zone. Unbreakable had a good ending, but it was a painfully long process to get there. And Signs... Was it one of the worst movies I've ever seen? Signs point to Yes. I had low expectations for this film, and it didn't even meet THOSE.<br/><br/>
What IS Joaquin's color? More important, when people try to claim this is romantic, what makes it so? How does Ivy form this romance with a boy who almost never speaks? Love at first sight? Oops, no... Isn't her love in the final analysis as shallow and juvenlie as her sister's?<br/><br/>Besides, she's a horrible actress. Her blindness sort of comes and goes. Much the way her sister's period speech comes and leaves for the rest of the film. The film is full of cheap cheats, like the repeated back and forth exposition of the creatures. When the voice over tells reminds us that the creatures might actually exist, there's a sign that the plot went wrong. And, Night, you're no Hitchcock, and with your extended, useless cameo, you're a Tarantino. And in my mind, that equals ""got lucky once, and have stretched your 15 minutes to the breaking point.""<br/><br/>Wretched, weak filmmaking."
"kg22384","Null","0","0","8 August 2004"," The Beauty and the Ecstasy
","It may not be said that this is M. Night's greatest film.  People will look at it and compare it to the height of his twist ending in the Sixth Sense; people will assume he's following the same old, same old song and dance, and conclude that it's not as good because the twist was not as unforeseen, not as viscerally chilling.  These people are missing the point entirely.  This is a vastly more appealing film than any I've seen in a long time because it works on more intellectual levels than most films do.  The horror in this film, the scary things in this film are not the creatures in the forest, as you are led to believe.  The scary thing is the machinations that are in place perpetuating seemingly sane and intelligent people to create a utopian society that is held together by an all abiding fear of something false. Indeed, what drives us to perpetuate lies and fear in the pursuit of peace and happiness?<br/><br/>After all, the realistic suspension of belief is not so hard to swallow. One has only to consider the Amish in reference to the cherished adherence to an antiquated way of life.  One has only further to consider the array of cults that have risen and fallen within the past few centuries to realize the lengths we intelligent creatures will go to create our own bubbles of order and harmony.  If you had more money than God, were fed up with the violent tendencies of such a vast and volatile society, and were traumatized by the brutal death of a loved one, would you not consider creating your own paradise; your own utopia.  And so our committee of the Village, an apparent group of traumatized therapy patients, decides it can create a Utopia under the leadership of Hurt's Walker.  A modified Amish village where love, community, equality and justice are admonished above all else.  A community that thrives on peace.  And it seems as though they are successful for a time in their experiments; their children are the beneficiaries of this slightly twisted grip on the truth.  These children are pure of intent and of good character.  They may be altogether stunted in their relational skills when compared to our own modern context, but within the context of the reality that these committee members have created, they are pure.  They are honest and forthright.  They are loved and supported.  Men and women receive equal standing in the eyes of all.  The committee is comprised of an equal amount of men and women, none above the rest.  Those crippled, either of mind or body, do not receive unfair treatment.  All are special, all are wonderful.  <br/><br/>The inherent problem of any utopia is the abiding construct that is holding the society in place.  The safety and security of the Village is not merely kept by a fence and security watch, it's kept by controlling the minds of the innocent.  By creating and enriching a palpable fear to challenge the utopia, so that its benefits are not soiled by divisive perspectives of the world.  So the question is posed, and the true conundrum revealed:  Is it acceptable?  Just as in Huxley's ""Brave New World"", do the lies and fears of this utopian bubble justify the bliss and purity and happiness that are enjoyed by the oblivious trapped within it?  In the end, is this not what any idealogy is; a group of people perpetuating lies, partial-truths, and conclusions about the unknown to ensure peace of mind, social stability, and happiness in the lives of those idealogical adherents?<br/><br/>Take this one step further, which I have no doubt the intellectual aptitude of M. Night was intending, and again, as in ""Brave New World"", we have an allegorical tale that is creating a simplified mirror of ourselves.  M. Night has not simply told this story to entertain us.  He is trying to show us who we are and how we work, whether you see it from a religious standpoint, or a political, even an economic one.  Whatever ideals you cling to, whatever faiths you have, the question is posed; is it better to blindly believe those and accept the benefits of it, or is it better to know the truth, even though it can be cruel and violent?  We are the village, in whatever capacity our lives are filled with ideals and faith.  Whatever irrational, brave, or loving things we decide to believe, and whatever counterparts we choose to ignore, we are all of us constantly creating a utopia for ourselves within our own perceptions; we are all of us trying to attain happiness by organizing our perspective.  Some by striving for happiness today; some by looking for happiness tomorrow; and some by waiting for happiness until some unknown time and place.  I know some will find these espousals far-fetched.  Its only a movie, perhaps a silly one at that. But I think M. Night is offering you so much more than just a movie this time.  He makes no final judgement on the morality of the experiment; indeed might I present the question again:  Should this be allowed?  Is it morally acceptable to allow lies and fear to produce peace and happiness in your life?  We are Ivy, blind and unaware of our own blind faith, and we have for a moment realized ourselves outside of the bubble and are unsure what to make of it.  What will we now do?"

","I went into this movie thinking that I was going to be impressed by M. Night's directing and writing skills. I left slightly disappointed. It went off to a good start until it was revealed that all the so-called creatures were fabricated to shelter the village people from the town beyond the woods. It went even more down in creativity when we discover that they are actually living in present day when Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) enters the town. And the fact that the star of the film (Joaquin Phoenix) was hardly even in it. The movie was about 2 hours long and he was only in about an hour of it...the rest he was lying in a bed unconscious trying to fight for his life from various stab wounds given to him by a jealous and mentally challenged Noah (Adrien Brody) for taking his girl. It was not a horrible movie, but I think M. Night just got sloppy with this one and could have done a lot better."

","It's unfortunate that the director was more interested in another ""twist"" plotline than working with the other elements available to him that could have crafted a great film.  The first half shows a great deal of promise as the actors create interesting and empathetic characters involved in interpersonal conflicts.  But instead of exploring these people in a straight drama and allowing the actors to continue to shine, the film is forced to veer in the direction of being a ""guess the secret"" semi-thriller, a direction that takes it straight downhill.<br/><br/>Perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie more if the secret had been more of one, but the director dropped so many conspicuous clues as to the nature of the twist that both my husband and I figured it out about thirty minutes in. (I spent the rest of the movie hoping that there was something more to it, but no -- that was really it.)  In addition, unlike ""Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" which held up very well to scrutiny once the twist is known, the plot of ""The Village"" has so many inconsistencies that it falls completely apart.  <br/><br/>I'm not sorry I saw it (although my husband considered it a waste of time), but I was extremely disappointed."

","With The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan took what was essentially a run-of-the-mill ghost story (albeit a well thought out run-of-the-mill ghost story), gave it one wallop of a twist ending, and thus became an overnight wonder boy that cursed all of his follow-up films.  I found Unbreakable to be dull and unimaginative, while Signs was taut, exciting and frightening. The ending, put me off with its simplicity on how the aliens are defeated, but not enough to not feel fully entertained, or that I hadn't gotten my money's worth.  However, neither of those films lived up to the expectations that were placed upon them.<br/><br/>Now, Shyamalan takes us into The Village, and judging by the horrendous write-ups, coupled with the film's nosedive at the box office, not many people enjoyed the trip.   <br/><br/>William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody are residents in a sleepy 19th century village surrounded by deeps woods.  The woods are inhabited by creatures that the town's people have a shaky truce with.  For reasons that aren't fully, clearly explained (one of the films few faults), that truce seems to have ended, and the creatures begin to assault the village.  A series of events climax with the daughter of the town father venturing into the woods to seek help from the outside.<br/><br/>To say anything more would risk giving away the big twist that Shyamalan is expected to deliver in each of his movies.  The Village has a couple of them this time.  One that I had an idea about, but was incorrect enough to still be surprised, and one that I had caught on to early on, but didn't fully figure out until right before it's reveal.<br/><br/>Say what you will, but Shyamalan knows how to set up a film.  The picture is gorgeous.  It's crammed with sweeping vistas, leaf blown woods and skeleton-like trees.  The cast, for the most part, is also quite good.  I wasn't as in love with Joaquin Phoenix's performance as I was in Signs though.  He just kind of sleep walked though this film, and with the exception of one particular conversation on a porch, wasn't given that much to do or say.  I know his character is a man of few words, but this tested that boundary.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Adrien Brody walked the line of being credible as a slow-witted adult, and being a cartoon.  While his performance wasn't bad, it didn't do much for me either.  Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron) portrays Ivy with such compassion and strength that she shows she's got the chops to be a rising star.  I look forward to her next role.  Both Weaver and Hurt give strong performance, and the rest of the case fill in nicely.  Last, but certainly not least, I need to mention the score.  The music is haunting and adds loads of dread and suspense.<br/><br/>
*******SPOILERÂ….DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF YOU READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH********<br/><br/>I just need to mention one part of the film that I picked up on, kept going over in my head, and now wonder if it was simply an error on the part of Shyamalan, or meant to be a clue to the ending.  The film opens with a funeral.  When the camera shows the tombstone in the background, notice the dates, especially the date of death.  Even for that date, the village, people, customs and language seem awfully old.  If I hadn't noticed the date, I would have guessed the people to be living at least a hundred or more years prior to the date the tombstone shows.<br/><br/>
*******END OF SPOILERS **********<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense came from nowhere, and was such a sensation because nobody saw it coming.  Shyamalan is now expected to top himself with each film, and none of them can or will reach that height again.  The Village is a well thought-out, entertaining film.  It may not be perfect, but if any other name was in the writer/director's credit, I think it would be hailed to as close to perfection as one can get.<br/><br/>My grade: A"

","I have no idea why so many people seem to dislike this film, but I assure you that they don't know what the *)&@# they're talking about. This is a truly incredible film that continues M. Night Shyamalan's reputation of genius, and I certainly would recommend you all at least see it before you judge it. I think maybe a lot of people came into it with the wrong idea about what it was, and that's why they were disappointed. This is not supposed to be a horror movie or a monster movie, or at least not in the traditional sense. Aside from about 3 points in the film, the director is not intending for people to jump out of their seats in fright. So if that's what you want, then don't see it.<br/><br/>What this movie is, and what it's supposed to be, is a creepy, unsettling, and darkly humorous commentary on humanity, society, and the modern world. And although it may or may not be ripped off from a book (the author of a book with a similar story is apparently suing), it's certainly a unique and extremely thought-provoking cinematic experience. It's really hard to explain without giving away anything, but you'll likely be debating for quite some time over whether the village elders were right to create what they created and do what they did to preserve it, and whether their methods are used by real-life governments. And it's hard to really explain how this fits in, but it will also spawn debates about whether constantly hearing about horrible things in the news has a negative effect on society.<br/><br/>Anyway, in addition to touching on a lot of fascinating subject matter, the film is also visually beautiful, with incredible use of color, and the two main characters are interesting, likable, and memorable. In the middle of the film the director actually switches the focus of the film from the seemingly central character to another character, which I think is a really fascinating and ballsy move from a story-telling perspective. Some people of course didn't like it, but I loved it. It reminded me of when Hitchcock killed off the main character in ""Psycho"". I love it when directors throw the traditional Hollywood moviemaking formula out the window like that.<br/><br/>In any case, most of the negative things said about this film are pretty ridiculous. The movie is certainly not predictable, and it's certainly not ""slow-moving and dull"". The dialogue is occasionally cheesy, and some of the camera shots are annoying, but other than that the movie continues M. Night Shyamalan's tradition of near-flawlessness. As for the ending, I found it to be both greatly satisfying and greatly amusing : )<br/><br/>Anyway, it really disgusts me that so many people have been saying negative things about this movie, because I really think that it's an incredible film. It may in fact be my favorite Shyamalan film, although it's very close between this and ""Unbreakable"" (I tend to think ""The Sixth Sense"" is slightly overrated). Please go see this if it sounds at all interesting to you, particularly if you appreciate art more than horror, because I think there's a very good chance that you'll greatly enjoy it. It's kind of a love-it-or-hate-it thing I guess, so I supposed there's a 50% chance you'll love it : ) Anyway, I give it a 10/10.<br/><br/>And by the way, M. Night Shyamalan is only my 5th favorite director (my fav is Zhang Yimou), so don't dismiss this as the word of just some crazed Shyamalan fan : )"

Let me say, the trailers have nothing to do with the actual hidden plot of the movie. Every twisted detail will surprise you. Nothing is what you expect. Shyamalan is great in turning the movie around on the audience, as he always was. He also managed to sneak a hidden moral in it as he does in all his movies.

It's a great movie and worth watching.<br/><br/>I give it a 8/10"

","Seeing so many comments and posts here focusing solely on ""did you guess the twist?"", I feel the need to remind everyone that there is a whole movie here, not just an ending. I am really fascinated by this film. I think this film presents such a strong commentary on so many things... the controlling power of fear, the struggle of dealing with things we don't wish to deal with and the natural tendency to try to escape it and avoid it, the sacrifices we make without question for love, not love for yourself, but for others, the natural compassion we feel towards a stranger in need and how horribly twisted this compassion has become today, to the point where we mistrust and are afraid to take concern of anyone but ourselves, and the choices that face us when we make sacrifices to accomplish something and then must continue to make in the face of adversity to keep with what you have started, to succeed for the greater good of those you made those choices for. <br/><br/>There's plenty of modern day significance too. There is the difference between infatuation and love, between self-preservation and life-preservation, between knowing and believing and the gripping, influential power of each. It's easy to find social commentaries on right and wrong (the interplay of speak-no-evil-Lucius, see-no-evil-Ivy, hear-no-evil-Noah), the unwavering love of parents for their mentally disturbed son, and the love and acceptance of the community for this person when we often ignore and don't bother to try to understand such people today, the political commentary on perceived fear (as one amusing reviewer put it, ""are there weapons of mass destruction in the woods?"") and on the trust and faith we put in our leaders, and conversely on the choices they make and for what reasons. And of course, there are the big questions, ""Who are we? Who should we be? Where can we go to find peace from the things that destroy us?"" <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, see it. Form your own opinion for sure, but I beg that you look at the film as a film and not as just a twist. Don't waste your 2 hours trying to predict the end, because whether you do predict it or you don't, that's not what it's all about. This isn't just a novelty, there is a real movie here with something to say, and it says it wonderfully. If you're waiting just for the end, you're going to miss the best stuff M. Night has to offer, which is not the twist(s). <br/><br/>I saw someone else used this quote on watching a movie just for the surprise ending, and I feel its worth repeating because it hits the nail on the head:<br/><br/>""It's no way to see a movie, because you're never unself-conscious enough to let the drama work on you; you're concentrated on the game. And at a certain point the whole exercise is rendered anticlimactic: The only suspense left is whether you got it right or not,"" (Stephen Hunter, Washington Post).<br/><br/>If you see the movie, I hope you enjoy the movie and not just whether or not you got it right. Or, I hope you don't like the movie, regardless of whether or not you figured the twist out beforehand. M. Night has a tough career ahead of him. Please do your best to at least respect him enough to judge his film, and not just your predictive skills."

If you can recall, this item was in the newspaper being read by the wildlife preserve commandant (cameo by M.Night Shyamalan). How does this correlate to the opening scene of the child being mourned by his father? Also, were the elders prompted to create the village to escape the wanton violence of the outside world that had befallen so many of their loved ones? Was this attempt at a Utopian society created to shelter their young in an idyllic, almost perfect world, or was it flight from some type of wrongdoing they had committed on the outside.

","Spoiler Anyone who thought that this movie was a brilliant piece of work has clearly been a victim of the hype surrounding this movie and the faltering reputation of M. Night Shyamylan. There are so many factors that contribute to the disappointment of this movie, but the greatest fault was re-shooting the ending. If anyone noticed, only couple of scenes made the difference in the existence of the creatures. Take out the Adrian Brody death scene and maybe the scene when Mr. Walker shows Ivy the costume, and the creatures exist. The existence of the creatures definitely added the extra suspense and eerie feeling that was missing from this film. It seems obvious that M. Night Shyamylan has become obsessed with his reputation to surprise the audience and add that extra twist that no one is expecting; so obsessed that with each new movie his story loses something. The Village is little more than a mess of twists intended to shock the audiences, but even this is not accomplished. In his previous movies, M. Night Shyamylan managed to leave his audience with a feeling of satisfaction and surprise with the clever way that everything fit together in the end. The Village left the audience feeling cheated and disappointed. Shyamylan's obsessive desire to surprise wrongly overruled his desire to create something brilliant; something spooky, thought provoking, and fulfilling to his audience. I would really like to see the original ending. At least this would remove some this movie's ""secret-over-plot"" fault."

","OK first of all the marketing for the movie made it seem like it was a thriller so of course most people are going to be disappointed when they see it. <br/><br/>Second if you are going to make a TWIST in a movie i think the best way to do it is to start with something mild and end it with something much better and much bigger. <br/><br/>Now the reason this ending didn't work to well is he went from a huge scary plot to something very mild. The sixth sense used the formula right it went from mild to a something much bigger in the end. The key is to end bigger not smaller. It's like expecting to get a huge gift of great value, then you open the box and you get something much smaller and of lesser value, of course the natural reaction is to be disappointed. <br/><br/>just my two cents. :)"

","Someone told me before seeing The Village that the less you know about the film going in, the better it will be. I took this advice to heart and thoroughly enjoyed M.

Though it is a little slow-moving in places and Night would have done well to shave off about fifteen minutes of 'village stuff' that really wasn't that important to the plot, it was still excellent and held my interest through the entire two hours. <br/><br/>Though the twists in the film did not make me jump out of my seat or gasp in astonishment, I didn't expect them. However after they were revealed, you could see the careful planning and all the intricate tie-ins that the casual viewer would brush off as mere coincidence if it were anything but an M. Night Shyamalan film.<br/><br/>The characters in this film were rich and interesting and made each and every scene remarkable and full of life. I was especially captivated by the stunning Bryce Dallas Howard who played the young blind woman named Lily and quite possibly the most captivating character in the entire story.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing and worth seeing soon. Or else hiding in a closet until all the talk has died down. You do not want to know the twists until you see them for yourself because they won't seem as significant. Of course, most people won't take this bit of advice, but it's worth a shot."

","Even though, yes, the plot twists aren't as buried or hidden away as far as his previous films, Shyamalan seems to be more involved in things that last with people long after the twists have worn over. These elements include character development, ethical debauchery and tone/imagery conduction. It seems as though M.Night (throughout his so-far short carer) has been dabbing into his colourful palate of emotions each movie unlocking more colours. Yes, I had guessed the Huge plot twist (What we discover after ivy comes upon th end of the woods, involving an expected low key cameo by the mastermind) months beforehand, but it was just one of many guesses I had come across. Does anyone here come to his films specifically to solely experience the cheap thrill of the ending? For those who bought his DVD (or the ever so decline of VHS)do you just skip to his last scene and call it a night? I hope not. I watch his films for the unreal scenes he sets up and in this film he has pulled off a little more than what I had gone into the movie expecting.

"tnfoilstar","Null","0","0","2 August 2004"," the most incompetent and facile film-making i've ever seen
","I could go on and on about how horrendously, farcically terrible this career nosedive botch-job is, but I'll limit my comments to a few of its most outstanding offenses. forget about the allegorical levels of the movie for a minute (or, in my case, ignore them out of boredom and disinterest) which are so inconsequential, veiled to the point of almost utter transparency, that it would probably be as easy to interpret ""white chicks"" as a 9/11 parable as well.<br/><br/>The most glaring problems of this film, as a matter of fact, are not very complex or difficult to observe. Not even the utter lack of suspense (unless you count jumping from your seat at sudden loud noises on the soundtrack suspenseful) contributes overall to the brutal mediocrity of Shyamalan's ego-stroking pomposity. It's simply that this film shows not a single instance of film-making ingenuity, much less competence. It's not just that the film is poorly paced, terribly acted, ponderously staged, incoherently conceived, and deceptively marketed; it's the sheer absence of everything that absolutely must be in place for even the most modest of film productions to succeed: clear visual ideas, confident editing, a rhythm to the narrative, a script that survived more than a single set of revisions, the sense that the director is invested in what's in the frame. ""The Village"" exhibits Shyamalan's brazen indifference to nuanced characters, dynamic framing (i.e. staging scenes with characters on different planes of space, rather than standing on a single axis in the middle of the frame), editing that doesn't suck the life out of every frame...<br/><br/>To me, however, the most offensive element of the film has to be the dialogue, which is blatantly inconsiderate to an actor. If you've ever tried to write a script and give it to actors to read, then you must have experienced some sense of responsibility in giving your collaborators something which won't inevitably come out stilted, flat, inane and anachronistic. some of the preposterous lines Shyamalan inflicts on his actors is so embarrassing that it borders on cruelty. but truthfully the film doesn't exhibit a single drop of concern for real human life or emotion; Shyamalan, nominally a ""suspense"" director, seems so preoccupied with keeping his ""twist"" (which is about as surprising as a hangover) intact that he sacrifices virtually everything from the cinematography to the fundamental comprehensibility of the story in order to protect it. as far as I could tell, the one moment where the director seemed concerned with showing us anything remarkable was when he ever-so-deftly inserted himself in a cameo role that could seriously not be more contrived and obvious if he had a name-tag on. I had never seen the man before and it was so painfully obvious who he was that I felt ashamed to even be paying attention. <br/><br/>that being said, this movie is so entirely inept that it's almost funny. and as someone who watches a lot of overstuffed bad films for scraps of humor, i have to say that the insufferable atmosphere of inattention that pervades this film stifles even the bits of laughter brought on by the inconceivably contrived dialogue (the bit about the magic rocks, and ""the old shed which we do not use"") and by Adrien Brody's oblivious performance, who will go down in history as the most laughably, woefully over-performed village idiot in the history of cinema, just as the Howard girl will forever be remembered as the least convincing blind person in any movie ever made (and that includes Ben Affleck, which is saying so much that it feels like my teeth might fall out). if you want to see a movie with dialogue, acting, and direction just as bad, but funnier by the power of ten, then I would recommend ""Dreamcatcher"", a film that at least has some buried sense of campy irony somewhere. Sitting through ""The Village"" is like dying slowly of gangrene while watching your parents set penicillin on fire to light crackpipes before your pediatrician puts cigarettes out on your forearm."
"VaporFlux","8","0","0","2 August 2004"," Very interesting concept
","No spoilers in this comment, so read on. I found this film to be not quite so good as the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but better than Signs. The sense of isolation, a main theme of the film, was superbly imparted and added a great deal to the psychological impact of the movie. Watching the film, I felt a strong sense of uneasiness and anxiety whenever the very palpable division between Covington and the surrounding woods was shown. This feeling of apprehension was noticeably stronger during scenes which took place closer to the borders of the woods. Shyamalan, as always, proves adept at instilling a sense tension and fear by showing less instead of more. Another aspect of the film worth noting is the vivid use of colors in the costumes and the flags and banners in the village. These bright colors stand out markedly in contrast with the dark woods and usually overcast sky and serve to drive home the fact that Covington is an island surrounded by a dark, dangerous, and unknown forest. The acting was generally very good, particularly so in the case of the girl who played Ivy Walker. She managed to display a very realistic mixture of strength and fear. Joaquin Phoenix also did a good job portraying a brave, good-hearted Lucius Hunt. With regard to another Shyamalan trademark, this film had a couple plot twists. One of the twists was pretty obvious and I saw it coming from a mile off, while the other took me completely by surprise and made up for the obviousness of the other. Overall, I found the the Village to be a great psychological suspense film with a refreshingly new concept at its core. 8/10"

","After being horribly bored watching Signs I really had no expectations regarding M.Knight's latest project, The Village. I attended with my 13 yr old cousin who is over 20 years younger than me. We go to all the pg-13 & under fright flicks that we can as my wife and toddler daughter aren't big fans of horror/supernatural films. When I saw the advance press for The Village I knew I'd soon be a part of it's audience once it hit town. After watching the film yesterday, I felt pretty satisfied that Signs wasn't the best example to judge MK's creative potential by.... a sophomoric slump of sorts perhaps, but probably nothing more.<br/><br/>The Village was a throwback to the creature-feature matinees I used to enjoy as a kid on Saturday afternoons once the cartoons had stopped running for the day. I suppose if I had gone into the movie trying to guess ahead of time what the 'twist' was going to be that I could have figured it out ahead of time but why try and ruin the whole experience for myself? That just sounds plain dumb. <br/><br/>MK is no Stanley Kubrick but I don't think that bothers Shyamalan much anyway. He is a modern master of sustaining suspense without resorting to exploitative gore or obscenity just because it's titillating. If I had anything to suggest about his next movie it would be to drop the 'twist' gig if for any reason just to mock the folks that spend their hard-earned money to tear apart every film's plot as some sort of pseudo-intellectual hobby.<br/><br/>Aside from the haters, anybody who appreciates character studies and high-quality acting will enjoy The Village for a multitude of reasons. Hurt, Brody, Phoenix, and Howard are brilliant. No goofy cameos or anything, just solid performances from a variety of academy award caliber actors. The dialogue and sets were flawless and engaging and ultimately, a lot of fun. A great film for a rainy Sunday, a large tub of popcorn and a few hours of scary fun."

The cinematography, the location, the costumes, the decor, the camera movement, etc, were all done beautifully, but the story just isn't told as well as it could have been.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has decided for his trademark to be a filmmaker whose movies have a significant twist in them. In The Sixth Sense, he did this beautifully, while in The Village, he opted for a more deliberate, completely unsubtle, and ""spoon-fed"" twist. In addition to this sloppy twist reveal, Shyamalan brings it on far too soon in the story so that the rest of the film seems pointless and comical at times. It would have been much more poignant if Shyamalan had kept the twist until the end so that the events leading up to it came off as truly frightening instead of just semi-creepy (if that). <br/><br/>Shyamalan's choice of narrative flow for this film is what has ruined it from being considered on a par with The Sixth Sense, as well as keeping the cinematography of the film from getting the acknowledgment that it deserves."

","I loved the Village and thought it took M. Night Shyalaman to a whole new level. I'll give you the marketing was bad and prepared you for an entire different movie, but generally that is not the directors fault. I believe in order to get the whole frightening issue you had to put yourself in Ivy's shoes. My god the girl was blind! If you were stumbling around in the woods which you had grown up thinking deadly monsters dwelt you would be scared! I think Night challenged us to use our imagination to experience just what Ivy was experiencing. Movies are getting to be much the same. Especially the horror movies. All you see are hapless teenagers or young adults running around screaming with some murderer or doll chasing after them, eventually killing them to the delight of the audience. For some reason most people tend to like blood and gore. But it is no reason to condemn a movie just for it's lack of it. Night is trying to almost create his own genre, and I commend him for it. I am sick of all this never ending violence. Plus his movies have morals, which today's cinema is seriously lacking. Our entertainment standers are plummeting and I thank God we have some one like Night making movies that raise our expectations and make us think."

In other reviews, I constantly saw<br/><br/>complaints about the story being weak.  i disagree.  I found the<br/><br/>story to be genuinely scary and extremely thought-provoking.  One<br/><br/>question that I found Shymalan asking us is if it is right to try to live<br/><br/>in an utopian world by means of fear and bribery.  I also saw<br/><br/>complaints about the monsters looking cheap.  Although I did not<br/><br/>find the monster to be thoroughly convincing, it worked.  Besides,<br/><br/>the costume was made by humans who, most likely, had no skill<br/><br/>in creating bone-chilling monsters.  I had issues with the ""twist<br/><br/>ending"" since I was expecting something scary instead of<br/><br/>revealing.  I also had a hard time accepting that the founders of the<br/><br/>village would make a decision to start again so drastically.  But<br/><br/>then again, I've never been in the type of situation.  Unlike most<br/><br/>people, I had no trouble understanding and accepting the<br/><br/>dialogue.  I give the story 7.5/10<br/><br/>The acting is what makes the film so good.  Joaquin Phoenix, who<br/><br/>plays the most important character (since he is our hero and is<br/><br/>first billed), dishes out his usually excellent performance.  I<br/><br/>wouldn't say he was better than he was in Signs, but he was better<br/><br/>than he was in Gladiator.  Adrien Brody, with a complex role, is<br/><br/>also excellent.  William Hurt deals with the most dialogue in the<br/><br/>film and talks as if he were meant to talk this way.  Sigourney<br/><br/>Weaver was also good, even though I had a tough time accepting<br/><br/>her as a character other than Ripley.  I also had a tough time<br/><br/>accepting Brendan Gleeson as an American character, but he<br/><br/>gave a fine performance nonetheless.  And Judy Greer, as one of<br/><br/>the Walker daughters, is very good and was, thankfully, able to<br/><br/>show off her acting skills by being something other than comic<br/><br/>relief.  Last, but most definitely not least, is Bryce Howard.  As the<br/><br/>main character, she carries the tremendous weight of the movie<br/><br/>almost with ease.  Hers is one of the best performances I've ever<br/><br/>seen.  None of her lines sound wooden or forced and all of her<br/><br/>movements (which are very important since she plays a blind<br/><br/>woman) are convincing and appear 100% genuine.

","With the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan re-ignited the use of the twist ending (which has been greatly overused since) and does not fail to create another suspense-filled movie that audiences love in ""The Village."" Using the recurrent setting of eastern Pennsylvania, M. Night's formula of unlikely heroes versus the unknown is flexed once again as a rural, isolated village managed by a council of elders lives with the imminent threat of monsters on their borders.<br/><br/>Though lacking superstar performances from the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, or Mel Gibson, the cast of ""The Village"" is wonderful in this apparent period piece. William Hurt nails the role as the small town's leader and Joaquin Phoenix (who gained a certain amount of fame from ""Gladiator"" and M. Night's ""Signs"") plays the character of the quiet yet brave possible hero very well. However, the importance of Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard is downplayed in previews yet fit right into their positions as the hero and the unknown.<br/><br/>Even though I basically predicted the ending from the preview and the commercials, I had no idea it would specifically end the way it did.<br/><br/>Finally, as my friend commented, ""This is like a blind Blair Witch,"" I believe she is right in that many who see this movie will shudder a bit on next time entering the woods and seeing the color red."

","I didn't see any previews or know much about the movie when I saw it last night. I thought it was superb. The multiple twists in the plot are expected by now, that's just a little bonus logic game M Night wants to play with the audience. It's fun.<br/><br/>(spoilers ahead!)<br/><br/>For the first twenty minutes or so I was struck by M Night's ability to convey as much drama as possible in such a restricted setting. When all actors are so confined in their mannerisms and emotion, every little thing that does get through counts, it speaks volumes. Well done. I was also amused by being so wrong in my initial criticism of the dialogue and delivery. I thought these actors were not trying too hard to slip into a 19th century style. Some sentence constructions were so forced into the bygone style of speaking, it was getting humorous. How wrong I was though. This director can easily be underestimated. Just wait till the end, he always seems to say.<br/><br/>By the end of it we see how a group of people will go through so much effort to construct a fantasy world as a response to their despair over the real world. M night may even perhaps be self-referencing here, with the quirky temptation of the filmmaker who wants to make his movie and fantasize about living in that world he has constructed, a world where every mystical occurrence has very naturalistic explanations (the explanations which can be delayed for a very long time, the important thing is to captivate the audience by their own imaginations), and most importantly that there is always finality after tragedy in an M Night kind of way. Our cameo appearance of the director this time is indirectly given only as the voice of the manager of security and a thin reflection on a fragile glass surface. Behind his image, a stockpile of medicine. I wonder why? Is the Walker Preserve M Night's self-contained world of a film, and his job as creator/director in part is to simply keep things running smooth and not let the outside world interfere with his project? He himself is the gatekeeper to the well being of his characters lives and so on? It can after all be a very stressful experience, keeping all that in order.Digressing.<br/><br/>But the very thing the people wished to escape from had risen up in their very midst, among their very own offspring. Such a failure was bound to happen because their entire fantasy was founded on secrets and lies. Curiosity and feelings of betrayal lead to unexpected reactions, the presumption of innocence itself was a lie. Suffering so much loss in the ""survival of the fittest"" world that modernism had borne inspired a history professor to head up a new colony to start afresh under the very same principles which modernism in part started with. Man living in perfect unity within a Utopian environment. The Puritan/Mennonite/Amish world was just a mode to operate under, what perhaps 20th century folk might start to consider the ""noble savage"" in their simplistic and naive forms of living. But they do find that purity itself was a constructed illusion. By deciding to remove themselves from the surrounding evils of the world, they thought this would eradicate the existence of evil in their midst because their motives were ""pure"". But what really mattered were the same things that matter in the rest of the big bad world... courage, wisdom, love. Innocence is a fantasy, only doing good is what counts. And doing good is what is done in response to surrounding evil, not in the absence of evil.<br/><br/>Overall beautiful movie. The real ""horror"" in this movie was their seeming final agreement to preserve their microcosm after all that had transpired."

This film is teased as a monster movie that we won't see to the end but the twist in the end raises more questions than the few answers. This is a one and three quarter act film.

Anyway, if you liked Signs, Sixth Sense, and/or Unbreakable, you will like this movie. If you did not like those because of subject matters, you might still like this movie because it has a very different setting/plot.<br/><br/>As always, Knight's movie is about the people, the decisions they make, and the trials they go through. It's not about having realistic scenarios or anything. They're what-ifs. With that said, the cast is awesome, the writing is fabulous, and the directing is great. Normally, I don't make a comment like that, but the unusual camera angles and deliberate color schemes really add to the film.<br/><br/>What I also really appreciated was that there wasn't an overload of suspense that makes you stop breathing after awhile (oh no a guy might come out of the corner - wait never mind - oh but there is another guy coming out of another corner) like you might find in something like Dawn of the Dead."

"utepian","Null","0","0","2 August 2004"," The Village: Persuasive theme, uninspired narrative
","I watched ""The Village"" on its opening night. The film is based upon a premise that had been worked in Hollywood some ten years back with a very big star. That film is considered a tour-de-force for the actor who was cast previously in very predictable roles. However, M. Night Shyamalan's approach in addressing the same premise focuses on strengths that he himself possesses - educe fear and then stun the audience. But trudging thru the same formula, in movies prior to ""The Village"" (""Wide Awake"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""), Shyamalan was able to embed in his stories, a content that almost had a mystifying quality. The narration therefore rivalled a spiritual discourse. <br/><br/>In terms of content, ""The Village"" is by far Shyamalan's most meritorious commentary on people's entreatment of basic human nature. But in presentation Shyamalan's narration for the film fails in elucidating that human nature sympathetically. He is also failed by his actors in key roles.<br/><br/>""The Village"" contrary to its advertising hype is a love story. The movie I mentioned earlier that worked on the same premise, never left focus on the innocent love that made the crux of the story and therefore in the end succeeded in the audience rooting for its protagonist. In ""The Village"", the fear factor only contributes to diverting the attention of the audience, in the process making the young couple in love look quite foolish. Unable to generate sympathy for the romantic lead lends the audience to also be unforgiving towards the holes in the premise of the film itself. The young couple (Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard) work well, but veteran actor William Hurt in the key role of the village chief appears Shakesparean preachy, when the demand was that he shepherd the film thru its innumerable plot twists. Perhaps the writing itself is to blame for this mis-performance.<br/><br/>There is also an expectation from the audience that a Shyamalan film will bowl you over in the end. That expectation is very hard to live up to when constantly compared with the cardinal ""Sixth Sense"", where the twist came as a gratuitous topping. Any Shyamalan film is by nature countenanced with a fanciful, varied and incessant postulation of the audience's own. No amount of ingenuity can therefore be satisfying across the board. A lesson perhaps for Mr. Shyamalan to gracefully bow out of the genre of plot twists that he successfully created and enjoyed the audience support for. Given his genius I am sure he is capable of contriving a completely fresh narrative all over again.<br/><br/>To sum up, the content of the ""The Village"" is M. Night Shyamalan's most persuasive as yet. In its presentation, Mr. Shyamalan crawls back to his successful yet stagnating and increasingly dissatisfactory savoir-faire.<br/><br/>****************************SPOILERS************************************<br/><br/>The presentation of the subject in the similarly themed ""The Truman Show"" in my opinion was far more compelling."

","Spoiler Alert I myself saw the previews for this film and somehow my brain decided that I must see it! I actually loved Shyamalan's previous films: ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Unbreakable"" ""Signs"". Although none of them were very 'scary', they were all filled with suspense and, of course, Shyamalan's signature twist ending.<br/><br/>""The Village"" contained some of the best music I've heard used in a film possibly in this decade; however, that was the best part of the film. When the music is the best thing in the film and you're not making a musical, something is seriously wrong! The acting was right on par, the characters well developed, and the scenery amazing. Now to the problems with the film...oh, where to begin! The film was boring! I found myself fidgeting with the straw in my large Sprite! I kept wanting to get up and go to the bathroom or sneak into The Notebook because there was a slim chance it could be more intriguing. Then there came the twists...just when you think it's going to get really good...you're instantly let down when it's revealed that the entire basis for suspense is merely ""a farce""! What the Hell was Shyamalan thinking? We may never know. Then you still have faith when Ivy breaks her cane and is lost in the woods...she's blind! It was comic relief at its best...and then, out of nowhere comes the retarded Noah in a monster outfit...and Ivy kills him! I laughed like there was no tomorrow, and there almost wasn't one because I got a popcorn kernel stuck in my throat and was out of Sprite by this point. Finally, Ivy gets to town...and while at the beginning of the film it states that the year is 1897...it's really modern times...yeah, that's great Shaymalan, thanks! The people in the village live in a wildlife preserve! Why you may ask. I'll tell you why. Because they all had a close relative murdered...boo hoo! That doesn't mean that you up and move into the wilderness and live like Puritans! It means you put the puke into prison and hope he gets the chair. Anyway, basically Shyamalan's fourth effort, if you can even call it an effort, was a gargantuan disappointment and not worth paying to see. If you want to see if for cheap laughs, horrible foreshadowing, although you can tell the characters are wearing Nikes and such and there are telephone poles of some odd sort, and the overall feeling that you were just anally raped and you weren't even trying to buy a used car, than be my guest, otherwise download it or borrow it from some remedial friend who thought it was one of the most intellectually stimulating films since ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion""."

","I grew up in a very conservative Christian home.  I remember hearing about how the world is slipping down a moral slope.  With prayer in school gone and the lie of `separation of church and state' permeating our society.   We as American's have lost those Judeo-Christian ideals that the founding fathers put in place.  Hence we were a fallen nation, and that's why there are so many problems in this Country.<br/><br/>While I'm not asking anyone whose reading this to embrace these ideas, they permeate M. Knight Shyamalan's new film `The Village.'  An intriguing motion picture that asks and yet never quite answers the questions many American's are asking in this post 9/11, postmodern, and enlightened period.<br/><br/>
THE VILLAGE is a quaint little place far from the bustling `towns' of evil and greed.  It's a 19-century prairie town, and a utopia where decent people live out their lives in peace and modest prosperity.  Money is not and issue, for the people of THE VILLAGE have no need of it.  They all speak and act like Quakers, and hold close to traditional family values. <br/><br/>
Of course THE VILLAGE has its own local government.  It is ruled by board of elders, who are strict but fair.  There seems to be only one rule, `Stay Out of Covington Forrest.'<br/><br/>You see the forest is the only problem with the Village. It's full of monsters.  As long as the people stay out of the wood The Monsters leave them alone. The other problem is that The Village needs some basic drugs to save its people.  As the film opens we see the casket of a young boy who died because he did not have simple medicine's to keep him alive.  It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off? Or is it?<br/><br/>THE VILLAGE is the type of movie I personally love.  It is a film about subtext.  But what gives the film its spark is the fact that it doesn't play its message at you. But you only realize this if you give it some time and patience.  If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.  Without being preachy and overwrought.<br/><br/>It plays with some of the things we as American's have gotten used to in these dark times.  The color terror alert systems, false terror alarms, and presents people like you and me, people who want to go about their days without having to worry about the darkness hiding in the woods.  THE VILLAGE is a typical suburban town, if it was transplanted onto the prairie.<br/><br/>I loved the scene with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix, GLADIATOR) and Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard, The Grinch) as they sit on the porch in the middle of the night and preach their love to each other.  The scene is alive with energy and light.  Shyamalan frames the shot so close up, you feel like your part of the action, and the actors turn the stilted Quaker like dialogue on its head.<br/><br/>Howard is just phenomenal.  She fills her character with color.  The other actors around her seem weighed down by the stilted dialogue, which I'll admit takes some getting used to.  Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.  Like a young Holly Hunter mixed with Julia Roberts, Bryce Howard has the potential to be the next big thing. Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.<br/><br/>The other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.  Man did he have a good time.  There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.  It looks like he's having a ball.  I'll admit there was one moment I thought he was laying it on a little too much.  But I'll forgive him that small moment cause he's just dead on the rest of the time.<br/><br/>At its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument. For some they will look at these characters and think them pathetic.  Why give up your freedom for safety?  Why allow the government to fuel your fears?  But other will look at these characters and say `isn't it great that these people got away from the horror of this world? Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?  I wish I lived in The Village, free from all the evil influences of the world at large.' <br/><br/>As for the patented surprise ending, it works sort of.  If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.  I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.  If you don't buy the premise you'll be let down and hate the movie.  But that's okay.  Great movies don't have to be universally loved, as long as you don't leave the theater indifferent the movie will have an effect on you.  It will keep you talking and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>

Imagine my surprise when I found myself more involved in the characters than I had expected to be from the outset. That being said, let me stress that I am not saying that Shyamalan does a poor job of developing characters, you need only look as far back as Unbreakable, in which I think he did a superb job. The characters in this movie were engrossing and I must say that not only did Bryce Dallas Howard look beautiful in this movie, I was very much moved by her performance as a blind daughter to the Village's head elder. <br/><br/>At the theater I saw this at, which was in Boston, I sensed a lot of disappointment. But I didn't understand why. Yes, I know that many people, younger people especially, were expecting this to be a horror movie, as I said, however, I think the audience's downfall is its need to search for the meaning of the movie before the movie even starts.

And while the story and ultimately his signature ""twist"" has been seen before, I loved the way that he did this movie.

","Okay, it was a pretty good movie, but what I want to discuss is this: Joaquin Pheonix's name in the movie is Luscious Hunt, now, did anyone notice when they finally mentioned his father's name that is was Michael? That's right, say it with me boys and girls, the father's name was Mike Hunt! Now I can't help but wonder was this intentional on the part of the director, or just perhaps some weird over-site? I did like this movie, unfortunately you can't say a whole lot about his movies without spoiling them. I did think that Ronnie Howard's daughter did a very good job. I assume that this was her first role? Does anyone know if she has ever done anything else besides this movie?"

After reading about the film in ""Entertainment Weekly"" I figured it out. They did not reveal any details about the film, except to say no one new much about it and there was a twist. I think I just kind of jumped to the next conclusion and happened to be right.<br/><br/>Not that it's a bad ending. Far from it, but I kind of felt that it was not delivered as well as I think it could of been. I think he left one clue that was unnecessary, and then revealed the end about 30 secs to soon.<br/><br/>My other complaint was that it is billed as a suspenseful thriller. Although there are a few scenes that made me jump, the movie really wasn't all that thrilling. The characters also have a lofty way of talking that seems to drag out some of the scenes.<br/><br/>The story is more a romance between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Howard (Ron's kid, by the way) than the supernatural thriller we (my brother and I) expected to see.<br/><br/>On the whole it was a good film with a poorly delivered ending."

","I saw the film last night and at first I found it a little rambling and confusing. I was also looking for the usual shocks that come from M. Knights films. As the story progressed things began to make sense and it became clear what the message was or at least it became clear to me. These are people consumed with fear and looking for an alternative. Of course they also have the means to create an alternative(the money of the Walkers - thus Walker Wildlife Preserve)and so they do. They create a town protected by walls and the guise of being a wildlife preserve. The ""Elders"" create a fantasy tale of the ""evils"" of the other side or the town to ""control"" desire to seek life outside the village. This serves to continue their efforts and to reproduce what they have started, not to protect the children. The fictional villain is created and the ""color"" of fear is instilled to keep control. Much like our current situation of fear ""code red or orange"". The basic premise is fear. We cannot nor could the people of the village avoid the human element for destruction and creating fear for control and for personal/ or financial benefit will not change that.

","An accurate observation of this summer's box office hits would be comprised of multiple films set in the past, such as 'King Arthur' and 'The Notebook.' But one film may catch a suspense-thriller's eye. M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' captivates movie-goers everywhere, while taking in $50.8 million on its first weekend. <br/><br/>Do not come into our woods and we will not come into your town. That is the motto for Covington, Pennsylvania, a small town surrounded by a forest bearing peculiar, cloaked creatures. The town is soon being invaded after a member of the community, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) decides to explore their woods. The plot continues to unfold after a series of mysterious events soon occur and a voyage across the woods is much needed.<br/><br/>Based on the fact that the inspiration of the story came from Wuthering Heights for its period drama and King Kong for its community living in fear of voracious creatures, this movie sure has its divergence from any other. If you are in the mood for suspense, this movie wouldn't be a waste of two hours. Ignoring a couple of hokey elements, M. Night Shyamalan has succeeded again. Five stars."

How people can find this film enjoyable is beyond me. The script had some of the worst lines i've ever heard in a film. The village is one of those movies that have a good idea, but fail to put it into it's full effect. Simply put, I would rather watch water world than this. <br/><br/>The cinematography was the best part of the whole film. It was all shot very naturally, and gave you the feeling that you were really in the settings on the screen. It may have been the only thing I enjoyed about the film to be honest. <br/><br/>The acting was very weak, if not terrible at times. It felt very unnatural all throughout the movie. By far the worst aspect of the whole movie.<br/><br/>The story must of started as a good idea in someone's head, then later slipped away when they were writing it in the bathroom. I just can't stand the way this movie went downhill from the very start. I became totally uninterested halfway trough the movie, and wanted to leave.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? It could of been great, but wasn't. This movie is good for a few moments through out it, but most of the time is a total and utter letdown. Everyone will make a bad film in their lifetime, it's a fact that can't be avoided. To M.

","DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS<br/><br/>'The Village' was not what I was expecting but I still enjoyed it. The movie was very Grimm fairy tale-esque as opposed to the sci-fi of 'Signs' or the ghost story of 'The Sixth Sense'. But with all Shyamalan's movies I have seen there is always a theme behind the horror, such as losing faith in 'Signs'.<br/><br/>All fairy tales are metaphors for something else in society, with the woods being a classic example. A young girl enters the woods and finds a dangerous but temping creature imploring her to pick flowers off the path instead of going straight toward her grandmother's. A brother and sister are cruelly abandoned there when their parents chose to no longer care for them. There they find a candy house that seems to good to be true with, unbeknownst to them, a hungry witch lurking inside.<br/><br/>In 'The Village' there is no wolf or witch. The danger of the woods are the villagers themselves. The village leaders are using fear of the fabricated ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" to keep their people under control, away from the outside world and, in their minds, safe. Even without our current political situation this tale's metaphor is timeless. But, as with all fairy tales, it can be interpreted however the viewer chooses. So take what it gives you and run with it."

While their motives were undoubtable pure, there actions were unmistakable inhumane. And there lies the true horror good people trying to do right and in their extreme actions to protect themselves their families and their chosen way of life they bring about terrible tragedy resulting in a horrible death.

Alright, I can see disappointment, but being angry that ""The Village"" wasn't scary does not qualify it as the ""worst movie ever."" Lord, if you've seen Chronicles of Riddick, you know that the Village isn't even in the same league as the other contestants for the Worst Movie Ever. Frankly, I thought it was a very well made film, with fine acting and a storyline that was concerned more with making you think than with making you jump. Shyamalan weaves an intricate plot that conveys a profound statement on facing fear in its many forms. Beyond any cheap dime-store horror movie plot, he tells a story based on character development and atmosphere. The cast is stellar. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix give standout performances as the hopeful youths who think beyond their small village, while William Hurt some of the best acting he's done in recent years. The score by James Newton Howard is beautiful and greatly enhances an already solid film. My only complaint lies with the way Adrien Brody's character is finally dealt with. I won't give anything away, I just wasn't really pleased with that. Anyway, if you're going expecting a scary monster flick, of COURSE you'll be disappointed. Wait a week for Alien Vs.

","Frankly I'm shocked. The fact is simply that Shyamalan has created another story that is not what it seems, and yet again I hear audiences reacting negatively. Too many have come to expect two things from M. Night Shyamalan. First, that he makes horror films. Second, that there will be some awe inspiring twist at the end. Unfortunately neither is true and it leaves many feeling disappointed. What is true is that he makes movies that shatter preconceived notions. The Village looks to be about monsters in the woods when in fact it is about belief. <br/><br/>This film asks a question of it's audience: Is ignorance truly bliss? I can see from some of the negative reviews that in some cases it may be. It's easier to keep living the lie that is a ""M. Night Shyamalan Horror Movie"" and hate his films for being smarter than us, than it is to accept an interesting film that refuses to follow our pre-set notions of where a story should go."

","This film is Shyamalan at his best. The twist is totally unexpected and the surprises appear at every turn. The old-school use of sound effects to scare the audience is refreshing. Most so-called ""scary movies"" of our time use gore and violence to scare the movie-goers, but ""The Village"" uses our own imaginations to scare us. The unexpected happens when it is most needed. The plot itself has its weaknesses, but I think that the film comes together very nicely in the end. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scare, but without all the bloodiness commonly associated with movies that are meant to scare us. I would not recommend this movie to those who are looking for a deep and meaningful film because this isn't it. Taken for its pure entertainment value, this film is well worth the ticket price."

The commercials for this movie lead you to believe that it is an original edge of your seat thriller and this movie was hyped up to be something extraordinary, which was what attracted me to it in the first place.<br/><br/>To say that every part of this movie was completely bad would not be true, because I do believe that the acting in superb and Ron Howard's daughter shined very much (you get into her character very much) and the characters were well-developed. However, I feel that those strong points are heavily outweighed by the negative parts of this movie. First of all, this is not in any way, shape, or form a horror movie and for those of you who wish to go see it (although I strongly advise you not to) I will not spoil anything. What it is however, is a dramatic love story, but I found it quite comical.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has an eye for setting a mood that draws you into the story, but once you are there, it is utterly disappointing. The story itself makes sense to me, but the reasoning behind any of it seems completely ridiculous. I didn't find the ending predictable because a thought so unusually dumb never crossed my mind.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is not what you expect it to be, but misleading and in my opinion it is by FAR Shyamalan's worst work.

","I saw this movie the day it came out in theaters, and it started out good. As one would expect it was very similar to the movie ""Signs"" in terms of the mood and characters. The beginning was very suspenseful and kept me in my seat waiting for what would happen next. Then as soon as the so called ""creatures"" were shown it sort of came across as being corny, and ruined a lot of the suspense i had of what the creatures might look like. As the movie goes on, it slowly starts to reveal to us creatures true identity and their purpose for frightening the villagers from going into the woods and reaching the outside world. Overall I don't recommend this movie if your looking for scary or si-fi. Although I enjoy movies that make you think and this one most definitely did. I think that as the real meaning behind the ""creatures"" and the village is revealed it ruins the whole story. Literally its like they turn out to be ""omish"" people in todays day, who are frightened of the real world because of life's tragedies and our trying to hide it from the rest of the village and create their own society in the woods.

","Most of us have seen director / writer M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, and many have seen his other  widely released films. I've even seen his earlier gem, WIDE AWAKE. And I like everything I've seen. Let me re-state that, I love everything I've seen, until now. Everything in THE VILLAGE looked great, the actors were all in good form, and it even gives us something to think about. But I have to admit, this is his weakest effort. The problem, however, is not the movie we're seeing, but when we're seeing it.<br/><br/>Mr. Shyamalan has taught his audience well. Ever since SIXTH SENSE, we've learned that when watching one of his films, any minute now (and certainly by the last few minutes), things will be turned on their head and some kind of clever plot twist will be revealed. Sometimes it's more subtle than others, and requires a little more focus, but it's always been there. And it's in THE VILLAGE as well (though I wouldn't give it away if you paid me real money - and shame on those who have).<br/><br/>M. Night has affectively created his own problem, by making us smart to his plot trickery over the years. The bar is raised and he raised it. If THE VILLAGE had come out right after - or before - SENSE, I think we'd all be raving about it. But it's not 1999, and we've had quite a few twists and surprises from the director. Now we're prepared, we're looking, expecting it. We've learned his style, maybe some of us know it as well as he does. And that's really the issue.<br/><br/>I think M. Night has done a great job of writing suspense stories, and in learning his style many of us have also learned to spot his hints. We go in focused and alert, with our thinking caps on so to speak, because we know it's not Explosion Movie Part 6. I believe it's this reason that left me with fewer surprises and less satisfaction walking out of the theater. The story - and again it's a good one - had me looking constantly for clues, and then just waiting for the confirmation of my suspicions; that's a lot less fun than what we all got at the end of SIXTH SENSE. <br/><br/>All my whining aside, there are much, much worse films to see and I was still pleasantly entertained. I hope everyone still has fun seeing it, and it's still a smart film - he hasn't sunken to dumbing things down as yet. But I also hope Mr. Shyamalan clues into his own smart audience and figures out how to write a story that makes us think we're going where he usually goes, then doesn't. That's the one I'd like to see next, but that would be a big challenge for any writer. I do think he's up to that challenge, but time will tell. Until then, THE VILLAGE is still good (maybe great for some other director), but really not up to the M. Night standard. That bar, in my book, sits pretty high."

","And ""The Village"" is an even-numbered film.  Not to say that ""The Village"" and ""Unbreakable"" aren't good movies, but they aren't up to the caliber of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""  It's not coincidental that their box office performance bear this out.<br/><br/>That said, ""The Village"" is a good movie.  It's well acted, beautifully filmed, and directed with the solid virtuosity we've come to expect from M. Night Shyamalan.  Besides his plot twists (more on this later), Shyamalan's trademark is his ability to set the right mood for genuine terror in the aisles.  And he delivers in this movie.  As with all his thrillers, excellent character development has a lot to do with this.  Shyamalan is often accused, wrongly, of delivering B-movie horror thrills, but in fact he does exactly the opposite, as B-movie thrills aren't very thrilling at all. If you don't care about a character, you don't fear for the character, and you care about his characters.  When Ivy is in peril, you are terrified for her.  (Howard is terrific as Ivy.)  Shyamalan also knows how to frame an image that is so primordially scary that you feel the fear no matter how much you tell yourself it's just a movie, like Graham in the cornfield at night in ""Signs.""<br/><br/>Another hallmark of M. Night's movies are sillinesses that you just have to get over to enjoy the picture.  And there is a lot to enjoy once you do, but you have to get through that shell of plot contrivance.  You have to believe that an adult male child psychologist will approach a child patient for the first time walking down the street alone.  You have to accept the fact that aliens who can travel from other planets can't get through a wood door barred with a shovel.  But if you can put yourself off skeptic-mode and not sweat the small stuff, you will be riveted.  (And if you can't, there's no way you could have enjoyed Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance.)  This is true of all of his movies, and it's true here too.  Just relax -- it's worth it.<br/><br/>The big problem with The Village are the twists.  I won't reveal what they are, but there are two here, and while they are sufficiently effective to move the story along, they aren't particularly moving or unsettling.  In fact, they are a bit flat (even predictable).  One in particular is considered by many to be very silly, but I think that's a little ironic, considering that it's not nearly as far-fetched as the idea of the existence of superheroes, the idea of an alien invasion or a supposed ability to see ghosts.<br/><br/>That said, movies are for keeping your attention and interest in the theater, and this one will definitely do that, trust me.  I look forward to the next odd-numbered movie, though."

Night's movies, he has an ability to use film to convey metaphors and truths that most of us either take for granted or have forgotten.  ""Signs,"" for example, was about the loss and gain of Faith. ""Unbreakable,""  on face value, was about the truth of good versus evil and the legend of a superman/messiah; more importantly, though, it was about ""self image"" and how an accurate or distorted one can shape who you will be.<br/><br/>I believe that most of the bad reviews about ""The Village"" are written by those who missed the forest for all of the trees.  This movie has a simple theme...that one should maintain hope and love in the face of adversity and evil; that love will conquer all.  All this may seem stupid but I bet if you re-watch some of these movies with these themes in mind, you will see them in a new light.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.  Go with an open heart and mind and, whether you agree with my interpretations or not, you might actually get something out of the experience."

","I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought that it was just as suspenseful as other movies made by Shymalan. I had reservations about paying to see it because of all the bad reviews it had gotten. DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS! See it for yourself! It is good and the performances are awesome. Bryce Dallas Howard rocks! I would recommend it to anyone. This movie will have you feeling every emotion. I cried more than once. True, it is not as scary as say Signs, but it was still enjoyable. Addressing the question of no plot: Hello! Did you see the movie? I thought there was lots of meaning and while at times it may have seemed slow, it kept my attention throughout."

","I was disappointed by The Village, especially since i enjoyed Shyamalan's 3 previous films very much. What saves this film from being terrible is the strong cast. I enjoyed the movie every time Joaquin Phoenix was on the screen and missed him in every scene he was not. Don't get me wrong the supporting cast is solid, but Phoenix outshines them every chance he gets. The movie isn't bad and your money won't be wasted but it felt very much like an average episode of the ""Twilight Zone."" Thought provoking, but particularly memorable or life-changing. If you are fan of Shyamalan I recommend seeing this movie. But if you didn't enjoy his previous work, I would stay away."

","Well, I went and saw this movie opening night because I am an M. Night fan and had anticipated its release since I first saw the trailer. I have to say that my expectations were exceeded greatly and I absolutely loved this film. The acting was very well done and the production quality was superb. I very much enjoyed the story and the way it played itself out. I was very surprised at it's twist, for even though I suspected something, I couldn't decide what it was. I liked this movie so much, in fact, that I went and saw it again the very next day with my friend. Although the surprise aspect was gone, I still enjoyed it very much and spent the duration looking for clues that pointed to the outcome of the film. I noticed very few which is good, because it makes it harder for someone who has not yet seen it to guess. I have to say that thing that impressed me the most from this film was the lack of CGI and special effects shots. M. Night did a great job at simply telling the story using rather simple techniques. I also liked the lack of bad language and sexual content in this film, as its hard to find great movies this day and age with out at least one of the two. Props to you, M. Night. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. ...<br/><br/>Go see this movie... now."

","If you see this movie with expectations because it is from M.

It all unravels as it typically does for M. Knight. So many pieces falling into place all at the same time. But then he teases you some - and gets you questioning it all over.<br/><br/>I am critical of films - and yet, I liked this one a lot. If there is one primary fault, it is in the marketing of the film. Marketing tends to discover the most powerful caricature for a film and run with it. This is probably why the film is getting such poor reviews.<br/><br/>But go at it when an open mind, and you'll be very pleased."

","Don't expect terror. It's not very scary. Remember M. Night Shyamalan has a clear style and has still not departed from it. He does not scare you with real obvious terror much, he lets an idea build over time and tries to make you uneasy gradually. He works your mind not your reflexes. The main point is that M. Night likes to create an idea that might be plausible in real life, although a stretch, believable in a movie and that he always uses a twist ending, that especially in this case, was easy to foresee and he tries to make a statement about human nature, which is the theme of this film, the monsters are not really the point, so if you come see this film for that, you will be disappointed. Expect the same statements to be true of future M. Night films. To a thoughtful person, a good, but not great film. Analogy of terror: what Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was to James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" if you are expecting scary."

","The language between the elders is contrived, in the old fashioned of ""Would I but long for the fevor of the flower""-type of old English. The creatures -are- Halloweenish. I didn't notice any of the microphone sights or anything else like that, then again...I wasn't looking for them. The movie has one glaring flaw involving a mentally challegned village patron, but I am more than happy to over-look this one flaw for the beauty of the rest of the film. Flaw-ridden...yes, contrived language, not-so-scary monsters...but the subtle-savy understand exactly WHY these flaws were made, and the exact ART that was involved with the risk...at the end of the movie. The use of color is -amazing-, but there is a re-occurring question on the part of Ivy to Lucius that is never answered. The violence involved is nothing short of beautiful poetry. Actors take you into the heart of the movie's eerie forlorn tone and hold you there...and the ending scene, while minorly frustrating, leaves you feeling as if they haven't let go. However, Mr. Shyamalan gives us credit of imagination...and by not giving us an ""alls well that ends well"" gives the audience a credit of intelligence. I felt as if he was saying ""You know what happens, no use in wasting your time."" AND the HUGE importance of ""let down"" last scene that was mentioned...you do sit and go...""What tha?""...but later I appreciated the tension, and was glad that the movie didn't ""end"" traditionally...because to me...the character's didn't end. Though, I must admit...I guessed the ending very close to the beginning of the movie...but I think any director, writer, producer that is KNOWN for twists...well, that sometimes it's easy to expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it takes a savy palate to enjoy this film, it's full of intelligent humor and smart terror that plays perfectly on the big screen."
"heilmane","9","0","0","1 August 2004"," I don't understand all the criticism
","Everyone who criticizes The Village's twists or style clearly has not seen any other M. Night Shyamalan movies, and if you have, did you like those either? Shyamalan has a distinct and unique style that was established in his first three movies, and his newest is not an exception to that style. The point of all of his movies is not in fact the scare tactics, but instead he uses those scare tactics as a vehicle to make a larger comment on different aspects of humanity. Therefore, if you don't appreciate that, fine. If you want to be scared by mindless gore, then that's fine too, but don't go see a Shyamalan movie expecting that and then criticize him for making movies in his own style.<br/><br/>I for one found The Village to be scary at times, funny at times, and really thought provoking which is very much the same way I felt about Signs. The music was excellent, and while the first half an hour I found it difficult to really feel attached to the characters, after that I became completely engrossed in the characters particularly those played by Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. Both Howard and Phoenix did a stupendous job and I think that once again Shyamalan should be congratulated on not only a great story and cinematography, but also for his choice of cast."

Although there are a few jumpy moments, the story is much more than you would expect. It incites a lot of thought. <br/><br/>The other people around me left the movie disappointed by the ""surprise"" ending. Shymalan is going to be cursed forever by The Sixth Sense so now everyone is going to want him to top that ending, which he'll never do.<br/><br/>The Village had one of the more impressive casts that I've seen in a long time. The younger actors, Bryce Dallas Howard/Joaquin Phoenix/Adrien Brody, all out did the seasoned veterans, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. I was really impressed by Howard.

This movie seems to be more of a ""thinker"" than his others - I didn't decide I liked it until the next day, now I actually want to see it again. And don't discount the studios role in this. They have a history of screwing up production and promotion of films they don't get. Star Wars and Jaws barely got made and after screening Star Wars one exec. suggested C3P0 should have a mouth b/c moviegoers wouldn't understand how he could talk! So it's entirely possible and I wouldn't be surprised if the studio up-played the horror angle to get the summer audience into the theaters thinking (wrongly again) if we knew the movie was deeper than the usual slasher fair we'd stay away.

The movie looks awesome but you grow tired of looking at the valley and the village after a while. It's filmed beautifully but it just sits there doing nothing.

A lot of my friends didn't like it because they were expecting a scary horror film, but i for one didn't go into the theatre expecting one nor was i expecting something different. I saw this on opening night and enjoyed it very much even with the crowdedness of the theatre seats. The twists in this I thought were very different and had a point to them that made people think ""Wow, why would someone do that?"" Then you understand why they are in the secluded village and then you realize that people will never be able to hide from or keep crime away as long as there is love in the world. Because with love comes jealousy and heartbreak which brings peopole to doing things they never thought that they would ever be doing in a million years. <br/><br/>That brings me to that characters in the story. There is Lucius the quiet, fearless young man who wants to journey into the woods to get to the ""towns"" and fetch medical supplies after a boy dies because of lack of medical supplies. Jouquin Phoenix did a wonderful job, but he is only in the first forty five minutes and it makes u sad to see him go. He falls is in love with Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Ivy Walker and that is in fact what this movie turns out to be. M. Night Shyamalan has made a love story. Howard was okay as the blind daughter of one of the elders, but i didn't find her very convincing with the blindness. Other than that she did a great job. Ivy is best friends with Noah Percy, a young man who has a learning disability. He is played by Adrien Brody. Personally I think that his performance stands out among all. He created this character that is in love with Ivy as well, but she doesn't know. And once he finds out that the other two are together it leads to some unfortunate events that lead to the twists of the story. But Adrien has created a character with depth that has some quite funny moments that provide some comic relief to this movie.But towards the end you can't help but feel sorry for him even after all that happened, and it is quite sad. He well deserves a nomination of some sort for that performance. William Hurt does a fantastic job as well.

"PrenticeZarathustra","8","0","0","1 August 2004"," A Philosophy movie boxed as a horror film?
","Without revealing too much, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that having just come from the theater I am astounded at the intricacy and intelligence of this film. Let me first of all state for the record that I am not a Shyamalan apostle--I very much enjoyed The Sixth Sense, but his other films (Unbreakable and Signs) I thought of much less quality. This film redeems him in my opinion as one of the more intelligent film makers in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>There are numerous themes and metaphors (some which tremble on the threshold of being clichÃ©, but are worked in skillfully enough by the director not to cross that line) used in the film and it would require a larger space to cover all of them. Suffice it to cover three major themes Shyamalan hits on: the state of nature, alienation and modernity, and love.<br/><br/>Of the first, Shyamalan seems to take a page from Rousseau in his presentation of this idyllic village of closely knit people in the sense that this film captures the classically liberal theme of man's natural benevolence. Yet, this natural benevolence is contrasted with the corrupting nature of 'society' on individual human beings--forcing them into the exile we see in The Village. What Rousseau wrote about the advantages of a small republic like Geneva, for instance, are at work in the bucolic 18th century beauty of the Village. Yet, the appreciation of the lifestyle of Geneva was only appreciated by Rousseau because of his experience with the cruelties of another world--just as it is with the Elders of the Village. Yet, Shyamalan doesn't entirely embrace Rousseau, and through Brody's character (a brilliant performance by Brody, by the way) explores the possibility of evil coupled with the natural benevolence of man. In the midst of this pastoral little village, there is a philosophical quest to understand evil--both the perceived external evil of The Ones, and the internal conflicts of men.<br/><br/>Yet, the idealism and innocence of the Village is suddenly broken in the course of Shyamalan's work by The Ones. The Village was only kept innocent by the presence of a fear they dared not challenge, and yet are they better off living in the innocence of the village then in ""the forest""? The distinctive themes of more modern philosophy are echoed in the issues of fear and the alienation that drive the Elders to their Village, themes touched on in Kierkegaard extensively. Likewise, the Elders find faith and hope for the future, and find strength in one girl's idealistic love--the love they have ever fought to keep innocent.<br/><br/>At its heart, The Village is not a horror movie--though it has its creepy moments that are done with great taste. It is rather a love story, and its hero is a Homeric blind girl who sees more than those with vision in her town. Her journey toward love, which Shyamalan applies as a vehicle for Enlightenment, begins with wide-eyed idealism. Yet, the end of that journey offers no easy solutions. If by the end of this film you think you have a happy ending, you've missed the coming-of-age questions raised by this film.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has produced a movie that was sold as a horror movie, but it is so much more. People's views of this movie are likely to be wildly divergent, as those who are seeking a scary movie or who believe this is a movie only about surprise endings are bound to be disappointed. This is a very different sort of film from Hollywood-a film of ideas, not simply of characters. For those who are searching for an intelligent movie about the nature of man, love, and enlightenment, you will not be disappointed. 8/10"

It was advertised, at least in the papers I read, as a suspense, drama. For anyone who has ever read the book ""The Giver"", I found the two very alike. Also, I think the acting was very well done.

As with his 1st movie, it didn't take very long for my husband and I to figure out what the deal was. So it made the movie a let down when all said and done.

","Spoiler The Village is a highly stylized Twilight Zone episode, as all of MNS movies have been. Within the final moments of the movie, the twist is revealed and everything you thought was true is not (similar to Sixth Sense).<br/><br/>The fun part of this movie is trying to determine what the twist is.<br/><br/>I really liked the movie, but, someone pointed out, why did Hurt's character not go for medicine, instead of sending his blind daughter. I can only chalk up Walker's decision due to the ""oath"" never to return made with the Village's Founders. The reason that a blind girl is sent into the Town is obvious. Forgive me, but, I found it incredible at how well Ivy was able to navigate the woods without sight, and that she picked the right direction to take on the ""hidden road.""<br/><br/>I found clues through out as to what the Twist was going to be. The real twist caught me by surprise, but looking back (esp. the clothing, something seemed out of place with some of the clothing...ties especially) I guess some clues were sprinkled. However, the biggest clue was came from MNS penchant for putting himself in the movie. It seemed like this would be difficult, given the milieu.<br/><br/>I also liked that MNS does explain all of the peculiars of what we saw in the town once Ivy arrived at her destination. But, I guess with a few billion dollars, you could buy quiet a bit.<br/><br/>With Signs, you kept waiting for the ""the aliens are not real"" moment, but the were. The film was intense and you could take it on face value. Unbreakable was an odd film, because it was a ""origin"" story for a superhero and the last few minutes of the film did not contribute to a ""oh, he's not really a superhero"" moment.

"Kathrynicus","10","0","0","1 August 2004"," Shyamalan's different approach
","I think that when people went to see this movie they set their expectations high and for good reason. After the monumentous success of 'The Sixth Sense' everyone was waiting for a movie where things jumped out at you and a plot twist that actually twists (which are very rare these days). People were disappointed when Shyamalan took a different approach. He used his monsters more as metaphors than as the horror type movies we're used to. I think that yes some of the acting wasn't up to par, but over all it was a very good movie. Very well done and something that goes against our expectations of what his movies ""should be like."" Shyamalan took a risk and tried something different with ""The Village"" and people were to busy trying to guess the plot twist than paying attention to what they were actually watching. Saying this was the worst movie ever made is a little uncalled for because there are so many movies out there that are 10 times worse. I was very pleased with the movie and I really enjoyed it."
"colbycuppernull","Null","0","0","1 August 2004"," Disagree
","I would have to say that I disagree with most of what the other person who commented has said. I too figured out the twists of the movie about a half hour in, but to me this didn't harm the film too greatly. I felt that this was Shyamaln's most mature work to date in that it relied less on the twists and focused more on the message and reflection of society. The biggest problem I had with the film was in the dialogue and in the performances. I thought William Hurt was terrible, misemphasizing lines that were poorly written to begin with. The dialogues were almost unbearable at times and their delivery did not aid them in the least. Adrien Brody was the bright spot. His performance was easily the film's best and was probably a direct result of the fact that his character rarely spoke. Noah Percy, his character, was the movie's hinge though, and Brody played the character very well, if slightly derivative. I wasn't impressed when I left the theater with the film so much as with what Shyamalan was trying to say. The film has its moments of suspense and intensity but if you are seeing it for those reasons you will be disappointed. Essentially it is a movie about us as a society, how we use fear to preserve innocence and how those tactics fail us every time. From the fire and brimstone of hell, to the WMDs in Iraq, we use fear of boogey men to control and manipulate. See the film for this reason and you will walk away happy. See it for horror and you will not. I found thinking about it and about the world in the car on the way home more fun than actually watching the movie though."

","Rather than dwell on the plot, or possibly make a revelation in this review that would ruin your experience in being shocked or drawn in by this film, I choose to write this review solely on the message and concepts addressed in `The Village' alone. If you want a plot summary, you can read them online, or go the website listed above.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's `The Village' is certainly one of the most impressive films to be released this summer. The story, however, is not what you will expect-perhaps the only thing ever to expect from Shyamalan's films. But moreover, the movie ends on a note that is not acceptable to the average filmgoer: one of the reasons why so many people are not enjoying the movie. But why should an unconventional ending deter a moviegoer's experience or enjoyment? After all, movies that have come from the greatest filmmakers ever have been unconventional. Imagine a film by Stanley Kubrick ending on a happy note, with a swelling score and every actor on the screen walking away into the sunset with smiles on their faces. It just does not fit Kubrick's style, as is the case with Shyamalan. With four major features under his belt, Shyamalan seems to be developing a pattern. With `The Sixth Sense,' we end on a note of truth and acceptance for that truth. It is a hopeful ending. With `Unbreakable,' we end with truth, but the world that we inhabit remains dark and sinister. `Signs,' like `The Sixth Sense' ends on a note of hope for the future and resolution with the past. Now, we have `The Village,' which ends on a note of darkness. There is resolution, but the characters remain static-many knowing that there is a truth beyond the borders of their village, but choosing not to be a part of it. Furthermore, keeping it a secret from those who trust them. There are three major messages that I took away from this movie relating to fear, escapism and good intentions. First, the concept of fear-just like F.D.R. said, `we have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Shyamalan has used this concept in all of his movies, in one form or another. In `The Village,' fear is used to keep the people in-line with the rules and ways set forth by the village elders. That fear, it is believed by the elders, will protect the village people from not only the others that they fear beyond their woods, but from themselves. Moreover, by developing a credible fear in the populace, those who govern are able to control their people into believing in their goals and aspirations by making them afraid of a threat that is actually not as great as they make it out to be. This message was also made present in another summer blockbuster, `Fahrenheit 9/11.'<br/><br/>	 The second message that Shyamalan addresses is that of escapism in the wake of some great grief. This is a common belief in society, as well as historically. It is documented that after the death of his wife and mother, Theodore Roosevelt took to the American west in search of relief from sadness.  People believe that somehow they can escape some great emotional pain by filling the void with an adventure or new way of living. Rarely, if ever, is this the case. Grief and despair at some point or another will find a person, regardless of where and how they live their lives.<br/><br/>	Lastly, the concept that good intentions are not enough is addressed. Good intentions have been used throughout history to rally people against a supposed evil or danger. A perfect example is that of the Vietnam War, or the Great Leap Forward in China. Reasons for intentions have to be analyzed and thought out well with the consequences weighed. If not, all the good intentions of the greatest individuals in the world could bring about their own and many other's downfall. 	In terms of filmmaking alone, `The Village' is great. The performances are excellent. The score from James Newton Howard with violin solos by Hilary Hahn are eloquent. And it would not be a Shyamalan film without seeing the director in at least one scene, which has an excellent use of mise-en-scene. ***1/2"

","I looked forward to seeing this movie, as I am a big fan of Shymalan.I thought this movie was pretty good, but it should have ended before it did. After the reveal of the ""twist"", the rest of the movie was pointless, and it ended leaving the audience feeling dissatisfied (at least it left me feeling that way). Long, drawn-out story, and a sudden ending do not make for a good movie-going experience. I must say that the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard was very good (although I didn't believe she was blind even for a second), and Adrien Brody was adequate in his role. I think Shymalan needs to understand that after ""The Sixth Sense"", the audience is now looking for these twists, and he'll have to go some to beat the shocking ending of that one. This one didn't even come close."
"LycoTheMovie","Null","0","0","1 August 2004"," Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
","Here's the deal. The movie has a twist (shocker!) halfway through that negates the whole movie, and renders the second half of the film utterly pointless and ineffective.<br/><br/>And the final twist is so goofy, and so unbelievable, and so stupid, that it just left me angry. M Night Shamalamadingdong needs to stop watching old twilight episodes.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD... Don't READ IF YOU Don't WANT IT RUINED FOR YOU...<br/><br/>Its hard to explain why i hated this movie, without properly explaining the plot and the twists. Here it is, for those of you who don't plan on seeing it. ...<br/><br/>A 19th century village of puritan types live in fear of the creatures in the forest. the creatures in the forest wear and are attracted to red, (the bad color) and are repelled by yellow (the good color). maybe its being a New Yorker, where the terror alert is being raised from yellow to red on a weekly basis, but i saw through this thinly veiled metaphor from the getgo.<br/><br/>Anyway, the entire first half of the movie, M Night Salami teases us with creatures in the woods. Finally, at a crucial halfway point, a blind girl must spend the second half of the movie traveling through the woods to get medicine for her ailing boyfriend.<br/><br/>OK, now things should get going, right? WRONG! because just as she goes into the woods, M Night Shamalammayomamma reveals to us that there are no creatures in the woods, and its a farce put on by the elders to instill fear in the hearts of the citizens, and keep them from venturing outside the town (more post 9-11 metaphors...)<br/><br/>I appreciated the effort, to disguise a horror film as social commentary, but the movie tips its hand too early, and it sabotages the movie. The scenes in the woods are now pointless, and not in the least bit scary. Even when one of the creatures shows up, we know its only going to turn out to be a puritan in costume. <br/><br/>But the real stinkbomb doesn't get dropped until the final few minutes, where we find out the puritans are actually living in a modern-day wildlife preserve, thus revealing the reasons for the elders not wanted their citizens crossing the woods... they might find internet porn!"
"TheyShotSirus","Null","0","0","1 August 2004"," Cultural Criticism
","First of all I believe there are movies that in themselves may not be great but raise good questions that may be explored in discussion as we do here. Cultural Criticism looks at a film or work of art from the perspective of what was going on in the world of the film maker. This means that a movie such as The Village can be looked at as a note book for M Night to jot down his ideas about the world today. So yes in the film he may have been taking a jab at bush or, and I think this is more probable, making a statement about crime and punishment.<br/><br/>I know my spelling sucks, bite me, or ill bite myself...which ever comes first. Noah is in a sense the blank slate on which the Village writes its rules. Its almost as if Night is saying that a Society's rules must be understood be even its weakest and most base individuals. If this is correct then what is a simpleton (Noah) to understand about the society in which he lives? Heres a few thoughts from his perspective: The elders work through fear, teach through fear...creating fear in others is a fun and good thing. Make promises not to hit (NOT stab) and then break that promise...it must be OK to break promises. If you commit a crime you can be jailed but then others are free to abuse you...does this mean that the more intelligent people in society have the right to violence where as the weak and slow do not. <br/><br/>Noah commitied a crime, he may not have understood it but he committed a crime. Walker is so diluted that he would prefer to mentally abuse the children of multiple generations than expose them to the sometimes brutal but often wonderful world. Remember when Ivy said to the security guard "" you are kind, I did not expect that."" The children of this village are not so much afraid of the monsters of the woods as they are of humans outside their own village. Night is making a case that a society that teaches through fear will only lead to violence. This is what noah thought. Even though star wars episode 1 sucks, the breakdown yoda gives to the kid about fear leading to violence is what I am getting at. These kids in the village don't look at a tree and see beauty as we do they see the fear and danger of the forest. Apply that lesson to the world around you now and it seems a timely lesson. But I think that night makes movies and teaches lessons that go further beyond today. Who really cares if he is commenting on today or yesterday, its a good lesson.<br/><br/>The Mistake of this movie is the same mistake they made with Clive Barker's Nightbreed. The studio didn't know how to market either film so they give you slasher film trailers. Night has made such an impact on me that they could have had a trailer that simply showed his name in white on a black background saying ""M Night has a new movie go see it."" But that doesn't work for most of our society. I find it silly that they still preface his trailers with ""From the director of the Sixth sense.."" If someone needs that kind of reminder please do not throw them in a theater with me because the movie will let them down. Most people in the theater i saw it in thought they were going to get die hard the minute J phoenix said he was not afraid of the creatures. You can fill in the blanks when they found out the creatures were not real.<br/><br/>Great movie, bad marketing. Bottom line a discussion movie whose messages were stronger than it's delivery."

This was the last time I spend any money to see his work. The only talent I see is M Night convincing audiences that he still has a good story to tell. And wouldn't it be nice if he'd stop putting his no-acting-talent ass in his movies.

","Up front: I enjoyed the movie. I write stories myself (though not yet published) and have spent a long time thinking about how to create and develop characters and plots. Obviously, MNS works backward in his stories, making them feel like Twilight Zone episodes, which is fine with me. I enjoy unusual plot twists. <br/><br/>However, even though I understand why a blind character was necessary and why she was sent into the woods, I would NEVER think that an adult would actually send a blind girl into the woods to do their dirty work. Especially since they know she's going to have to climb a fence and might come into trouble along the way. It looks like MNS tried to avoid that problem by sending escorts with her, but that doesn't work either. The escorts would never let the blind girl go into the ""towns"" alone. <br/><br/>Also, Pheonix's character was stabbed a number of times in places that are not easily fixed. No doctor would say, ""If only we had some Neosporin and a couple of bandaids we could fix him up."" He needed more than antibiotics for that stomach wound; and what about the chest wounds? That was unbelievable. Why wouldn't the Village people just bring basic medical supplies with them?

","The Village is a sociology experiment disguised as a cheap horror movie. The plot is simple, a group of people live an Amish lifestyle deep in the Pennsylvania woods. Nobody in their uptopian community dares venture into the surrounding woods, for if they do may the creatures they do not speak of have mercy on thier souls. Somebody gets hurt and therefore the frightened yet peaceful people send one of thier own (who just happens to be blind and therefore fears nothing) into the woods to the ""towns"" to fetch medicine for thier fallen Lucius. This film was written, directed and produced by M Night Shamalyan, a highly skilled filmmaker who is in the zone to be the next Spielberg. This movie isnt bad, not by any means. Shamalyan still writes some of the best conflicted and tortured characters in hollywood. Its just a shame that he is being sucked into a stereotype of being the Sixth Sense guy, making movie after movie with cheap (but i must admit effective jump scares) and twisted endings that get the water cooler buzz going. He's already proved his natural aptitude for creating suspenseful situations. Mosty notably in Signs and the vastly underrated Unbreakable. In Shamalyan's village he weaves a semi-believeable story with strong and emotionally engaging characters. His big mistake is the jump scares he throws in, if you have seen only one of his previous films anyone should know exactly where and when he is going to scare you. Too bad all the scares in the Village feel way out of place and placed for audience gratification. I liked this movie, i liked the ending, i liked the suspense but the movie tried (mostly thanks to its marketing scheme) to be a horror film. Mr Shamalyan, you've got the talent, you show signs of an early Spielberg (i.e. Jaws, ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind...), but please leave the jump scares to the Halloween and Friday the 13th franchise's.

","It seems that most reviewers (the press and we amateurs) miss the sub-text of this worthwhile and engrossing film. (Spoilers coming): This -is- a monster movie. The monsters in question are the ""Elders"" of the Village, prohibiting the residents their freedom and an understanding of the world they actually inhabit. All of the people who live in the Village, save those controlling Elders, believe they are living in a world threatened by horrid forest-monsters, but it is the human monsters that actually threaten and control them. The Elders have kept everyone blind to the reality of life as it exists outside of the fence that corrals them in a Nature Preserve. That a blind girl has to venture to that world in order to get medicines only guarantees that the truth will never be revealed. She could not see the truth -- she can not reveal the truth. The Village is an allegory, a fantasy, a comment on control. Are we, as an audience, similarly controlled (by political and entertainment ""Elders"") so much that we can not see the full story in this movie?

","The Village, the latest film from producer, director, writer and actor M. Night is a story about a small village surrounded by trees and mysterious creatures that roams the woods.  The creatures and the villagers live in harmonious peace as long as the villages don't ever enter the woods.

When they reveal the twist in the films, I was thinking, so what.  There is nothing shocking, nothing unique, in fact the film is rather boring.  It is slow in the beginning, slow in the middle, had a couple of interesting points, but that is about it.  I mean, you are going to be sitting there and really not care.  They have the ever boring William Hurt who mistakes indifference for acting.  Joaquim Phoenix repeats his same sense of acting he used in SIGNS in this film and while it seems fresh in SIGNS, he style is quite boring in this film.  Sigourney Weaver is just a name in this film and completely wasted.  She isn't require to do much but be a familiar face you have seen in films before.  Adrian Brody does a good job, a bit over the top at times, but it's nice to see him getting more parts and he pulls his character off rather well.  The bright spot, the star of the film is Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.  I guess those acting classes really paid off.  She reminds me of a younger Mia Farrow.  <br/><br/>  But the main problem is the writing.  It is so uninspiring and M. Night's gimmick is getting kind of old now.  It is obvious that Alfred Hitchcock was a big influence on him in not only in film making, but now it becomes a game to see if you can spot the director.  Still, I cannot fault the young director because he is trying and he is different.  Unfortunately the advertisement for the Village is better than the actual movie.

All of the rest of the pieces are in place, but the story makes no sense the moment you press on it.

That citizens can leave modern life and talk in an absurdly stilted dialect for 24/7, with no references to anything in the outside world.<br/><br/>2. That these unnamed citizens can get away with *all* government agencies ignoring them. No sheriffs? Social workers? Taxmen? Nobody?<br/><br/>
3. That these unnamed citizens can actually bribe the government to reroute planes overhead, soley to keep the illusion intact.<br/><br/>4.

That's what really bothers me about the movie: MNS has to conspire against his audience to keep things going. So, just like a Scooby Doo episode, we have ""sheds that can not open"" and ""mystery boxes"" that are only opened to reveal the truth of what's going on. This information is unnecessarily kept from the audience -- there's no reason in plot terms to be so coy. Unless your whole raison détre is to mess with the audience's head.<br/><br/>The final battle with the blind girl and Noah is meaningless: it's shot like a horror movie sequence, but there's nothing scary about it. How could there be? We already know it's a guy in a suit. What's scary about that?<br/><br/>
Scooby Doo wraps it all up in a half-hour and never takes it too seriously. This is taken incredibly serious, which only makes it worse. Ranks with VAN HELSING as the worst movie I've seen this year."

","I was completely transported by this film. As in all Shamaylan films, there is a twist, but this time, he puts out many indications, as if it is not important to have a surprise ending, but to take you on a journey.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews I have seen have focused on when the viewer ""figured it out"". That is missing the point of the film. This film is about love, choices, and sacrifice.<br/><br/>The acting is superb (especially by Brody). I get so fed up with actors playing disabled people. Their choiced are hackneyed and offensive. But Shamaylan makes the choice to have a character who is different, yet very smart, smarter than the other villagers in a way, the embodiment of all they fear. This is another film that does not use gratuitous violence, gore, language, or sex to entertain its audience. It simply provides a tantalizing ""What if?"" and brings forth that premise in a unforgettable way."

","OK, M. Night made a movie called the Village. I went to see that movie tonight. But let me start before the movie...<br/><br/>Let us first think back to the trailers, teasers, and promo for this movie. If I am not mistaken, this was put off to be some kind of thrilling movie with strange creatures and freaky things happening. We hear that these people moved to this place and are surrounded by some beings that won't let them leave. Well yee haw. Sounds like this movie has some great potential eh? I can only imagine what will be in store for me when I sit down!<br/><br/>I think that the promotions of this film were blatant lies and probably could be sued for false advertisement. If I were to say that I thought this movie was a waste of time it would be because it was not shown to be anything near what was it actually was. In other words, I wasn't expecting what I got. Some people may argue that this is what M. Night does, however, it just isn't right to toy with peoples wallets when you toy with their minds.<br/><br/>I don't really feel like talking about the movie. If you want to go see it, what i say is :<br/><br/>1. IT IS NOT SCARY, DON""T EXPECT IT TO BE....unless you're VERY VERY easily frightened. By this I mean ""frightened by children running in the grass""<br/><br/>2. IT IS NOT THRILLING. Subtle psychological and very anticlimactic plot changes are used FREQUENTLY, so don't be surprised if you are wondering what happened to the story line every few minutes. Also anything that might seem interesting is promptly made not interesting by some event in the movie that immediately follows the interesting part.<br/><br/>3. IF YOU ARE A M. NIGHT FANATIC, I doubt you will have too much trouble enjoying this movie. Just don't expect The 6th Sense and you'll be fine.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILER BELOW<br/><br/>4. THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOVE STORY; IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ALIENS, STRANGE CREATURES, OR ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...WELL EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THERE IS A VERY SMALL VILLAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST. It is a movie about dealing with pain and loss. It is about how love drives you to do crazy and courageous things. At least thats what I think it is, I'm not really sure. <br/><br/>5. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK UP DIFFERENT PLOTS WHILE THE MOVIE IS PLAYING. When I was watching it, I got this idea. What if the Village really was surrounded by some horrible creatures Then this guy wanted to leave the village but he couldn't... He throws on some awesome red clothes (red is the forbidden color) whips out some big swords and goes to town on the freaky aliens, only to discover that they are protecting the village from some greater evil...bla bla bla...well yea that would be a bit over the top but you get the point. The fact of the matter is the plot changes so often in such absurd ways that anything is in fact plausible.<br/><br/>6. STOP READING THIS REVIEW, you have no choice...it is over."

It made me jump in my seat which a movie hasn't done in a long time. The originality of this and the ending which was a real punch in the face made it so great. The acting was decent for all the characters. Shyamalan is, in my opinion going to be at least the master of horror and suspense in this time period. People compare him as the new Hitchcock. While I do agree that this may be a bit of an overstatement, it is safe to say that he is a master at what he does and has originality in his scripts. Overall I give this movie a 4 out of 5."

","In The Village, we see the quaint, simple town of 1897 Covington, Pennsylvania. As anybody who has seen the previews knows, the woods around the town contain a horrifying danger...creatures who will kill anyone who enters the woods or who displays the ""forbidden color."" Yet, as we have come to expect with Shyamalan's films, there is a twist. <br/><br/>Very little can be said about the plot without giving away the twist, so I will give far more valuable - albeit vague - information. The movie is about the power of fear, love, and the desire to protect innocence.<br/><br/>The pacing is perfect, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances (not surprising, considering the cast) are impeccable.<br/><br/>This is what summer blockbusters can be. They don't have to be loaded with cheap special effects to mask thin characters and plots. The Village's characters are complex, sympathetic. The plot contains just the right amount of moments that make the audience silently say, ""what a minute..."" and then ignore their suspicions just as quickly.<br/><br/>A word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film - go to the theater, enjoy the acting, directing, writing, photography, and beautiful subject, and marvel at how Shyamalan has done it once again."
"SteveC21","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," Don't Waste Your Time Visiting the Village.
","I'm sorry to say this, but The Village was a really terrible movie. I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan for many years and came into this movie with high hopes. When the movie begins you find a small village of modest people living isolated from any other towns or villages. The people live almost a utopian-like lifestyle and are unconcerned and unaware of other activities in the world. The one thing that does concern the people of the village are the ""creatures"" that live in the woods surrounding them. The story then proceeds to tell about these two characters, Lucius and Ivy who fall in love and are planning to get married. Unfortunately Lucius has made the mistake of entering the woods and upsetting the ""creatures"". During the night the ""creatures"" enter the village and warn the people by painting red marks upon the doors.<br/><br/>The story holds a lot of potential but sadly the director failed in his attempt to chill the audience with another of his famous suspense-thrillers. Many questions I felt were left unanswered and the ending was a great disappointment. The acting however was fantastic. The entire cast did an extraordinary job of portraying simple villagers trying to lead a life of innocence. M. Night Shyamalan did great things during The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs but missed the mark with The Village. Hopefully next time we can expect another great thriller as Shamalayn has proven that he can create."
"Gideon777","8","0","0","31 July 2004"," Elegantly understated
","I appreciate very much the depths to which Shyamalan goes in his writing and directing. He has the good sense to not simply make a genre movie, but to make a movie about something in particular, and wrap it up in a certain genre, almost as a tool through which the audience can better see the characters. We are often too wrapped up in our own way of life to see other people like us objectively. So, he uses a plot device to help us to 'see' better. And in yet another movie, it works.<br/><br/>The guise in The Village is that it is a horror/thriller that pits the members of a small town up against the mythical and horrific creatures of the woods. Unfortunately, far too many scripts stop at this point. Shyamalan goes further, and this seems to be the point at which most people tune out, which is a shame, because it is here that the movie gains its better qualities.<br/><br/>The film is really about love and facing our fears. And deep down, it is simply a love story. There are many elements that represent our fears, both metaphorically and realistically. There are the literals, with the monsters in the woods, but also the larger metaphorical focus of the the reclusive nature of the village in response to the corrupt and fallen outside world. And it is an interesting foray into our fears and how we deal with them.<br/><br/>All of this is thrown into high contrast by the character Ivy having to face the fears she has been grown up to have to save Lucius. While she is told that the monsters are not real, she is nonetheless forced to deal with one of them. And it is handled in a very classic way. There are the woods, and the rain, and the dark (e.g. ""it was a dark and stormy night!"") and she was abandoned by the two other boys. She is alone in the woods, a common literal fear and metaphorical projection for us all. <br/><br/>The great theme in the movie however is not that she faced her fears on principle alone, but for the love of another. This element takes an average horror movie and interesting commentary on fear and turns it into a genuinely touching love story. <br/><br/>Perhaps I am naive in seeing this, or lack the cynicism of other movie goers, but I very much appreciated Shyamalan's style of telling a 'tale' and all it represents."

","I had seen some negative reviews before I went to see this film. I certainly am glad that I ignored the negative reviews. This remarkable film creates an atmosphere unlike any I have seen before except, perhaps, for the Grapes of Wrath. All of the characters speak in an unusual and soft toned manner. They interact with one another in a gentle and straightforward manner. Even though the language is soft and kindly, there is an undertone of fear that permeates the film until it is almost over. There is also a kind of innocence and occasional joy that both seem to add to the strange atmosphere.<br/><br/>The cinematography is a stroke of genius. A still layer of fog is in the background of a remarkable love scene and the fog adds to the intensity of the emotions of that moment. The performance of all of the major players remains consistent to the story so all of their actions remain understated. That very understatement lulls the audience into a false sense of security that makes the later revelations more dramatic.<br/><br/>I can not recommend this film highly enough."

","This story has probably been told many times before. However, Shyamalan has a knack for creating meaning and depth in even the most mundane circumstances. The story itself is not what made this film so enjoyable and so interesting. Shyamalan is an incredibly stylistic director in the way Tarantino is. This movie reflects the nuances of Shyamalan just like Kill Bill did. Ostensibly their movies do not necessarily revolutionize or break ground like some would desire but they are simply examples of very skillful film making. From the costuming, to the cinematography, to the acting, the Village was the visualization of a classic story. Bryce Howard steals the show and this movie is her stage. The entire cast is very skilled but some of the supporting characters seem a bit subdued. If anything, the story could have been longer and a bit more fleshed out but thats not what Shyamalan wanted. I'm not gonna complain. Great movie, not quite a horror film but the story is engaging and will not fail to entertain."

I was continually guessing and trying to fill in the blanks on my own. And hey, that's good enough to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>As far as the ending goes, well, it's gonna make or break the movie for a lot of you. I don't think it is as effective as the endings of The Sixth Sense or Signs, but I will say that at least it did surprise me. There are a few obligatory twists along the way that aren't exactly earth shattering (yet still effective), but the revelation at the end is the big surprise. Is it completely satisfying? Not for me. I had my own idea of how I wanted things to turn out, but hey, it's M. Night's vision, so I can appreciate it on that level.<br/><br/>The revelation does turn the movie upside down, so if you're the type who gets easily upset when a movie doesn't turn out completely how you expect, then you could be disappointed. But chances are, if you see this movie with somebody else, then you WILL be talking about it afterwards.<br/><br/>There are some minor annoyances in the film. I don't think the story is as tight as The Sixth Sense or Signs. There just seem to be a few more plot holes, none of which I can discuss here, but all of which I can easily make fun of. If you've seen the movie then email me and we'll talk. One of the things we'll most likely talk about is William Hurt's Jeff Bridges impersonation. And the dialogue is a little laughable at times. Why did they have to use so many Yoda-esque phrases? ""The old shed that is not to be used""?? And if the creatures are ""those we don't speak of"" then WHY DO THEY SPEAK OF THEM SO MUCH?!?!?!<br/><br/>Ah well, for me it's all stuff that is easily overlooked. What M. Night has done is taken a vision and constructed it into a suspenseful little story, never giving away too much at any one time. He messes with your mind and completely manipulates you until the very end. I have no problem with that. It's a movie! Manipulate my emotions all you want! Slap me around, and I'll thank you for it later! If you're the type who likes everything completely straightforward, well, you've been warned. <br/><br/>THE GIST:<br/><br/>The thing I like about M. Night's movies is that going in you know there is gonna be some sort of a puzzle. You can sit back and watch the pieces fall into place, or you can try to solve everything yourself.

We must have gotten a bum film copy or the theatre did not set the film right, because the boom microphone kept popping into the screen. This happened over 30 times throughout the movie and it was very distracting. My husband thought it was meant to be that way to give you as hint of this town being stuck in modern times.

","The current mind-blower of American cinema is at it again. M. Night Shyamalan has carefully crafted another interesting exercise for the viewer.<br/><br/>
I say exercise because this film lacks the heart present in Shyamalan's earlier works ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"". <br/><br/>I might as well get the spoiling out of the way now because in order to move on to the themes of the film it is required. The story of the film is a sham within a sham. The residents of a 19th century ""village"" are actually hostages of a group of crazed or fanatical neo-puritans who call themselves the ""elders"". <br/><br/>These elders keep control over their totalitarian mini society through the use of clever manipulation and propaganda techniques. They have convinced all the other residents of the town that to leave the borders of the town is certain death at the hands of some mythical or supernatural creatures. They even portray these creatures using elaborate costumes in order to frighten the younger residents into submission. Their goal is to isolate and control the environment in order to separate the residents from what they see as a evil modern world. <br/><br/>The next level of sham is that this ""19th century"" town isn't simply isolated from their industrial revolution age peers. They are actually a living, breathing human time-capsule existing within a huge nature preserve in the present day. The preserve was set up by the billionaire relative of William Hurt's character, who is a university professor.  The whole thing started when a grieving Hurt comes up with the bright idea that the elders, all members of a ""relatives of victims of violence"" support group should start their sham society. I know, I know...it sounds contrived and it is. But the method to this madness is effective and eerie. I enjoyed the superb cinematography and good performances by Brodie, Phoenix, Weaver and Hurt. The dialogue must have been a chore to deliver and they do a passable job of keeping straight, even earnest expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>
I'll pretty much see anything M. Night makes because it is never boring. I much prefer ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs"" to this film. The end is either reassuring or horrible depending on whether you like faux-19th century totalitarian brainwashing or not."

This leaves the film only 30 minutes to finish both the conflict, with a climax, mind you, AND the conclusion.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that the climax is longer than both the conflict and the conclusion. Why? The conflict between the one on the journey and ""those we don't speak of"" takes about 10 minutes. 20 minutes are given for the climax, and there are 0 minutes for the conclusion. You will feel angry that the film ends with no conclusion.<br/><br/>Now, this wouldn't make a movie; I am sure someone could contend that there have been great movies with this sort of timescale. The problem is that the way that the movie is presented, you are expecting to get every bit of info now as opposed to later. Basically, the only thing that is stopping you from leaving the theater is the cost of your entry.<br/><br/>I WANTED this movie to be good. I expected much more than just a 30 minute movie. I hope that Night will learn from this unholy mistake."

","I've come to expect a lot from M. Night Shyamalan. My expectations have never been met precisely. They've been blown away. 'The Village' is no exception. Beautifully photographed, well played, masterfully edited, this film is a tribute to the art of film-making. I have a habit of studying movies for application to my classes (I am a film student), but I found myself riveted by this film. The first time I saw it, I was unable to make any analysis during the film. All I could say was ""Wow."" M. Night has once again stepped beyond the boundaries set by previous films.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's interesting to see the writer's exploration through the past four films. Not only is there marked improvement from movie to movie, there is a sense that M. Night is experimenting with various ideas. In 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' he played with the story twist of a main character not being what he seemed throughout the major part of the story. In 'Signs,' he used the technique of placing clues throughout the movie as to how the story will end, then tying them all together in one big circumstance. In 'The Village,' he turned the twist used in his first two films around. The whole world that the characters were living in was not what it seemed throughout the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see how M. Night used hand-held in this feature. Previously, he used hand-held a lot to invoke a sense of connection to the characters and a bit of chaos to the film. In 'The Village,' he limited hand-held quite a bit. M. Night seems to be a director who likes to break the trend of Hollywood. For example, it seems that several directors are becoming fascinated with quick editing techniques made famous by Guy Ritchie. M. Night doesn't do that. The entire last scene was one shot. The whole scene inside the park ranger's office was one shot.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an amazing journey into the lives and fears of the people living in this village."

","This film is liable to disappoint quite a few people. That being said, it's really not an awful movie; it's just over hyped and underdone.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. William Hurt's line delivery is often painfully slow and monotone (especially toward the end). Bryce Howard's emotions aren't bad, although her blindness is questionable. Adrien Brody is wasted, as is Sigourney Weaver, who looks throughout the film as if she would rather be doing something else. There are too many characters with whom we are meant to sympathize, ultimately confusing the viewer; e.g., were we supposed to love Noah or hate him? Should we respect or deride the elders' decision to keep things the same?<br/><br/>The first big plot twist is fairly predictable, but makes sense; it's quite a bit harder to see the second curve ball coming, and it makes much less sense. The ambiguous ending is unsatisfying and, to be honest, made me kind of uncomfortable with all the slow speaking and silence and pseudo-emotion and whatnot.<br/><br/>Anyway, decent acting + okay script + decent directing = a movie that, although not great, is fairly respectable.<br/><br/>6/10. Okay at best, but it'll be a cult hit. Somebody will remake it in 20 years, and we'll all pretend we loved it."

","Pity M. Night Shyamalan. That twist ending from The Sixth Sense is going to haunt him forever. My advice: don't go into The Village with the wrong expectations. Look at this as a story, not a mind-trick.<br/><br/>Personally, I really liked it. Good performances bring interesting characters to life. The suspense is present at all times, even when you have figured out what's going on (or think you have). And yes, there are a couple of neat surprises throughout the movie. Will the ending make you re-think the whole experience? Um, no, but not every movie has to pull the rug from under you. I'm more concerned with having a connection with what's going on in the screen, with being involved in the story. Something that's difficult to achieve when you focus on trying to second-guess the plot.<br/><br/>Now, granted, I'm not saying this is the case with every person that goes to see the movie and doesn't like it. I can completely understand people being turned off by Shyamalan's slow pacing, the odd speech patterns he gives to his characters, his old-style approach to suspense (not showing the threat unless it's absolutely necessary and even then, only barely, most of the time), etc. Personally, I like it. I like his style, and it's been pretty consistent throughout his movies (all of which I've enjoyed a lot, with the exception of The Sixth Sense, which was ok but definitely was an instance where the gimmick made the movie). So here I am, jumping in to defend a movie whose biggest sin seems to be that it didn't set out to do what its audience expected it to.<br/><br/>Oh, well. In case you're wondering, my favorite Shyamalan movie is ""Unbreakable"", so I wasn't in the majority already."
"Rogue-32","9","0","0","3 August 2004"," let's twist again!
","You know you're well on your way to becoming a filmmaker of serious note when your films start to become either passionately loved or hideously reviled. Judging from what I've been reading of late, M. Night Shyamalan has definitely gotten into that league with his new film The Village.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film that works as both an allegory and as an actual story, with characters you care about. It's brilliant because Night manages to take a really tricky plot and execute it with dazzling clarity of vision. The thing I liked most about it was how I was expecting it to be a different kind of movie - this is what Night wanted us to expect, so we'd be caught off guard by what the film actually is about. A lot of people (including some very vocal ones at the Arclight in Hollywood, where I saw the film last Saturday) were bent out of shape by this, whining that Shyamalan 'misled and tricked' them. To these people, I offer three words: GRIP. GET ONE. If the film had been what they had been set up to expect, these same people would have been carping that it was predictable. <br/><br/>What I recommend: don't read reviews (you can stop right here with this one, if you want). Don't listen to people who've seen it. Just go check it out for yourself. If you're looking for an original, thought-provoking movie that will leave you with goosebumps (but not for any of the reasons you might expect), you can't go wrong with The Village."

I could see most of the twists coming long before they showed up except for the last one which just made me think how cruel some humans could be to other humans if this Truman Show like twist were true?  <br/><br/>And the monsters? What was that? I think that M. Night Shyamalan saw the Pact of the Wolf too many times as that monster from 18th 17th ? Century France was far more creative than the Village's monster. This movie seemed more like a homage to far better movies like the Truman Show and the Pact of the Wolf. It hardly reaches his creativity in the Sixth Sense or even Signs. More like the yawn producing Unbreakable.<br/><br/>The acting was good though especially the new actress playing the lead and Adrian Brody.

","As with the previous Shyamalan movies, I loved the way he makes films.  I always feel like I'm right there in the movie with the characters.  I thought the story was excellent, especially due to the fact that I would love to live in a small society practically independent on the modern world (except for my computer and cable modem...lol).  I'm going to say this film was very good.  Not quite on the same level as Sixth Sense, The (1999) or Signs (2002), but I'll definitely buy the DVD when it's available.  M. Night Shyamalan has a distinct way of storytelling and film making that appeals to me and this one was no exception.  It was a good story, good characters and great suspense.  However, I felt that the end was too abrupt. I thought 2 or 3 more minutes showing how Ivy and Lucius carry on the tradition of the village life would have been a more fitting ending.  Regardless of this, I did really enjoy it and recommend you see it in the theater because the scenery is beautiful.  Also, being from Philly, I gotta support the hometown boys.  Go, Night.

","I personally liked this movie and found it enjoyable. It did drag a bit here and there, but I've come to expect that from pretty much every drama I see nowadays (I'm not the most patient of people). As for guessing the ending, I did as well. But since we all know that Shyamalan's movies always contain a twist ending, I was thinking over all the possibilities from the beginning. I was bound to get a few right. ;)<br/><br/>I found the movie to be spooky, though not outright scary. I guess for people who are looking for a lot of jump-at-you gore and horror, this wouldn't be their type of movie. But for those of us who like suspense, well that's what you'll get with this.<br/><br/>Another commentator mentioned that Bryce Howard's character doesn't ""act"" blind. It's mentioned at one point in the movie that she was not born blind, she went blind later in life. I can tell you that often those who had sight and lost it will still act in the same way they did before going blind. They remember what it was like to be sighted and will often unconsciously act as they used to. I know this from experience, as I have known two people who went blind later in life.<br/><br/>I found Howard's and Joaquin Phoenix's acting to be very enjoyable. Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt were great, as always.<br/><br/>Not Shyamalan's worst effort, in my opinion, but not quite his best.

","The thing that bothers me about the Village is that the trailers and the hype leading up to the movie point to a tremendous horror film. Therefore it drew out the fan of this genre, people who enjoyed movies like The Shining, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And then it tried to sell them on a dramatic thriller. This is a prime example of false advertising. If it is a thriller, sell it as a thriller, don't try and make everyone think that you have this spine tingle horror movie and then give them something else. <br/><br/>If this was to happen to you at the grocery store, you would ask for your money back.

","The Village is probably going to be one of the highest grossing movies in a somewhat disastrous summer movie season. The film which centers on a ""19th century"" village surrounded by woods filled with some sort of creature is incredibly slow and dull, and while the music and film itself are quite beautiful to see and hear, most people probably wouldn't be willing to pay $10 to go see this film. Much has been made about how this movie shouldn't be judged alongside Signs and the Sixth Sense, as it is a separate movie. However even when judged the film is too dramatic and slow. The actors are all excellent at conveying the overall mood of boredom and high drama, but in the end this film is probably one of the worst and most disappointing films ever made."

","This film has been getting panned by a lot of critics, and while I agree with some of the things they've been saying, I still enjoyed it. The largest trend in many reviews is that Night's directing excels over his writing. I agree; Night's got a great way of telling a story, but this one isn't his best. That doesn't make it a bad story. It's intriguing enough, and while the ending might be a little predictable (I saw it coming about 2/3 of a way through) the way it's presented make it worth watching.

","Read Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix. There are many similarities between this young teen novel and this movie. Maybe I am no longer easily shocked--The Sixth Sense shocked me and I had to see it again to see ""the clues"" I had missed. Signs was well done and the ""alien sighting"" caused gasps. This movie was well acted, especially by Bryce Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. I also enjoyed the love story(?) between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. It is always refreshing to see a man and woman over the age of 40-something attracted to each other, instead of a much younger person.

","For starters, do not, and I repeat, do NOT (possible spoiler)walk into this film and expect to be scared to death. The Village should be viewed as a psychological drama. I think that the advertising campaign really betrays this movie for what it really is. Second, without giving away the big ending, I really cannot imagine ANYONE getting the end of this movie before the ending is finally revealed. I don't consider myself the ""village idiot"", but someone has to have a ""sixth sense"" to get the ending. If you truly got it before it was revealed, I applaud you.<br/><br/>Now, after that is out of the way, (possible spoiler) The Village was a sad, complex, yet hopeful movie dealing with isolationism and how our fear of the unknown can imprison and destroy us. Good performances is basically the glue that makes the story work, and thankfully, the performances are incredible. Bryce Howard is perfect as the blind heroine that makes the story believable and sad. Joaquin Phoenix plays the silent and brooding Lucius, with an almost puzzling and stunning brilliance. Easily the most disturbing and depressing character is Adrian Brody's Noah, a mentally retarded young man with feelings toward Howard's Ivy. The other supporting actors are excellent, with the shy and concerned Sigorney Weaver, as Lucius's mother, and William Hurt as the calm and knowing father of Howard.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a couple of scares at the beginning of the film, but please again, do NOT take this as a preview of things to come. I have been thinking long and hard about how i would rate this film. It did not live up to what I thought, yet it was superior in the areas that one rarely thinks of. SPOILER: There are two twists to the film: a large and a small. They both serve as a significant ADDITION to the plot. The endings to the Sixth Sense and Signs were impressive, yet really do not add anything to the core message. Unbreakable had a ending that somewhat added to the plot, but the movie was stupid anyway. <br/><br/>I'll wind this up with a rating of 8/10. I do recommend seeing this film, not necessarily in theaters, but at least once somewhere. And finally, and I'll say this one last time, (possible spoiler) if you walk into this movie and expect a mile a minute thrills, you will be severely disappointed. If you still want to see this different and intriguing film, then i highly recommend it."

","Many people are saying that The Village was not scary enough, not fast enough, etc. upon first viewing the film. Well, if you are in the mood for The Fast and the Furious, then go see the Rock's most recent movie. I love Shyamalan's films because he has a complete disregard for what the viewer is expecting to see - scratch that, he KNOWS what the viewer wants to see, and uses that to surprise them. What makes him the master of screen writing is that, unlike any other writer/director I've ever known, he hides the red herrings of the story, so that the most intelligent viewer will think he's caught on to something, when in fact he's falling into the trap. If you like brilliant film-making, then see this movie at least twice. I know that the best viewing for me was the third time, because only then did I truly appreciate all the effort that Night put into this film, even more than he did in The Sixth Sense, already a classic film. On top of the surprises, he adds themes of romance and deep grief that only a great director like him would be able to communicate in such a moving way. These elements portrayed by such great actors as Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver, and William Hurt, and most of all the amazing new Bryce Dallas Howard, lead me to give this film a 10 out of 10.

I heard a lot of people saying that the beginning was boring, I thought it was all very interesting. I do, have 3 minor problems with the film, they are:<br/><br/>-The lack of suspense and or scary scenes- I know M. Night doesn't want to show us too much, but I think he could have scared us at least a half dozen more times.  I thought the scenes with the townspeople were interesting, but I wanted to be scared more.  Show more scenes at night with the creatures or something.<br/><br/>The second problem was: -Plot Holes. Sure there's probably a dozen if you try hard enough, but the major one for me is with Noah. Why in the world would he go after Ivy in that suit? That never made sense to me. Did that costume take control over him? He was in love with her, they say. If you have an answer to this, please email it to me, because I'd really like to know<br/><br/>and lastly: -What happens to Lucius? They never say, and that bothers me. I wish it would just be resolved.<br/><br/>I did like a lot of things in it, like the music, and I even liked the twist ending, even though some people didn't.

","I would have to say that I enjoyed this movie very much. I did not go into this movie thinking it was going to be scary. Signs wasn't scary. MNS's movies are about expecting the unexpected and looking deeper into something. Not just seeing what was on the outside. For example, in the village, the elders had come together to find 'innocence'. They all had a tragic loss and wanted to escape society as they knew it and live a more simple life. For their own protection they created the creatures in the woods to protect themselves from the evils of todays world (so they thought). As it turns out there is no way to escape human nature. So do you hide and try to protect those around you from harm or do you give in and except that there are also good things that can come from industry, technology, science, and human kindness. It is all out there for the taking. It is a choice that is made whether we use it or not. I thought that Adrian Brody did a great job. How much did Noah know about the goings on in the village? What about his excitement when the creatures came around? And the next generation, will they continue as the elders did? I thought that the movie was VERY entertaining and fun. I walked out thinking and wondering, what would I do if I had all the money in the world? What would I do to protect the friends and family that I love?

It wasn't as much as a horror thriller as it was supposed to be as it was commentary on utopian society. It had it's thriller moments. In the likes of Huxley with a Brave New World, Shyamalan wants to say what all anti-utopian society writers say. A utopian society doesn't work no matter where you are. That's whats great about this movie. So what if there were some talky parts, thats in all of his movies too. As for him being in his movies I think it is good, kind of a signature for him.

","The trailer made The Village appear as if it would be a chilling horror movie with hideous monsters lurking in the woods ready to rend limb from limb any villagers stupid enough to enter but - SPOILERS AHEAD - we are thrown a curve ball and the movie is not what we expected. That, in itself, may be the reason why some people are giving this movie such bad reviews (some critics give it a B- and others an F ... which is why I never listen to what critics say). There is a Village - supposedly a 19th century village - which has settled in a valley that borders a wood that purportedly contains creatures ... ""Those We Do Not Speak Of."" There is a truce that the creatures or the villagers do not cross the barrier between them. But someone has and the creatures begin terrorizing the villagers. The elements of the movie, right there, are chilling but it is when one villager decides she needs to cross the woods to get to the towns on the other side that the movie takes a twist and we find out what the real secret of the Village is. I was waiting for the twist that M. Night has become known for and when it was revealed, I admit I went, ""Huh?"" But upon further reflection with my wife, I admit that I loved it. I found it to be an exceptional movie, but my only complaint is that it should not have been touted so heavily as an out-and-out horror movie. I gave it an 8 out of 10."

Likewise, I ROBOT, with the automatons - on-crack bouncing off the walls while Will ""Too Cool For This World"" Smith single-handedly beats the nuts and bolts out of them. Appearantly he has super-peripheral vison as well because he can keep track of all 50 of them coming at him at once.  I digress. THE VILLAGE, like M. Night Shyamalan's other films, returns to a kinder, gentler time of filmmaking when the viewer could actually be drawn into a story at a normal pace, with character development, beautiful and lush orchestration and a gripping drama that picks up the pace as it goes along. About the first 2 movies I mentioned - I liked them, but found them forgettable 20 minutes after I left the theatre. About THE VILLAGE - it's the kind of movie experience that only comes along once in a blue moon, or at least when Mr. Shyamalan puts a film out. I give it a 10+++"

","I smartly avoided all but the original creepy trailers for M. Night's new flick, and thus I avoided all hints of the twists and even the basic premise of the film. I went in blind much like the main character, and like Ivy I could see the colors of this film, that most of you (including Roger Ebert) have missed. The Village is a movie with several layers that get peeled back as the story reaches its climax. First and foremost I would say it is a period romance. Innocent and charming. The success of the film is that it peels away a layer and makes you question that innocence. There is an almost Puritan sense that what is pleasurable is sinful, and the use of vague words like ""the bad color"" and ""those we do not speak of"" is more about the parts of their own humanity the ""Villagers"" have supressed than it is about ghouls and monsters. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone reading this so it will be difficult to discuss any further, but suffice to say ""The Village"" is not about what lurks in the forest. It's about what lurks in the heart."

","Some people just cannot appreciate a good film. M. Night, is a very good director with his own style. People tend to look at whats realistic and need an action sense, but really anyone with an intelligent mind who goes to the movies looking for inspiration and looking at all the details of the movie such as acting, script, direction, and production value can appreciate this film. All of M. Nights flicks are not meant to be realistic. They are fantasy and drama and what ifs. M.Night is a great director and I have always loved his own sense of style to his films. People these days just cannot realize when a good movie comes out. Star Wars, a very unrealistic Trilogy took the globe in the box office and crowds loved it. But possibly times are changing towards watching realistic movies but movies are meant for art and to take people away from the real world and put them in the directors mind.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10. It is a very intense good flick that makes people think which most people do not like and love to be entertained with explosions. Well this film is not an action flick. Its a drama/romantique/thriller, with plot twists that are well thought of and give the crowd something to really think about. The acting is top notch, production values are great, directing is great, and the script is well written. Lots of deep intellectual conversations, just like of all M. Night's Films.

","So what if M. Night Shyamalan's latest twist ending is shamelessly ridiculous.  To write-off THE VILLAGE because of its conclusion would be dismissing an Oscar worthy supporting performance by Bryce Dallas Howard (you can tell this girl is going to be able to do _anything_ on screen), her tender scenes with Joaquin Phoenix and the lovely music that flows out of Hilary Hahn's violin.  This is an intriguing, textured film; the work of a master storyteller.  When you're under Shyamalan's spell, there's nothing like it.<br/><br/>A group of settlers live in fear of the creatures inhabiting their village outskirts.  The movie isn't terribly interested with the inner workings of this community -- what do these people _do_, anyway? -- nor does it quite explain why everyone speaks contraction-free.  It and they seem to exist solely for us to eventually find out if the monsters (""those we do not speak of"") are for real or not.  For the answer, look no further than the message board below.<br/><br/>There's a revelation made late in THE VILLAGE that, on the page, you probably couldn't help but laugh at.  On the screen, though, it sorta works, because by the time we get to it, the proper atmosphere hass been established and the timing is right, and it doesn't linger.  Too much. Those who dwell on it and don't forgive the rest of the film aren't giving Shyamalan credit for how gifted a filmmaker he is.  He knows how to compose scenes in a way that's distinct: like Tarantino, or Scorcese, or Fincher, we can tell this guy's movies apart from other directors.  He knows how to write dialogue and, better yet, knows how to pick the actors to perform it. Phoenix doesn't have a lot to do, but does a ton with his eyes.  Even William Hurt, who usually bugs me to death, comes off just right; I loved the scene where he explains himself to the elders for allowing his daughter to do what she does.  <br/><br/>And, Bryce Dallas Howard floored me.  I don't know how long it'll be before I've forgotten her quiet exchange with Joaquin Phoenix, talking about when they'll dance together.  Ivy Walker is blind, but gets around without trouble.  She's resilient, warm and genuinely caring a person.  Determined. You root for her relationship with Lucius.  You feel for her safety during a confrontation with one of the ""creatures"", even though we already know what to expect.  This is a complete, three-dimensional performance by a talented, extremely agreeable actress, and she deserves all the recognition in the world for her work here.  <br/><br/>Does THE VILLAGE need a better finish?  Of course it does.  I could have easily done without Adrien Brody's last scene; it adds nothing.  I'd also like to have it spelled out for me why red is the bad color, and why Lucius picks those holly berries.  <br/><br/>Still.. haunting stuff."

The acting was great, the direction was great, the art direction was great, the cinematography was off, but not distracting, the music was very good, and the editing could have been better.<br/><br/>The performances by Adrien Brody, Bryce Dallas Howard, William Hurt, and Joaquin Pheonix were great. Especially Adrien Brody. This will be a great chance for Bryce Dallas Howard to become a big star. She has great talent, and is pretty to boot.<br/><br/>The direction was good, it was a well crafted movie, as it was. It could have been done better, but i'll get into that in the spoilers section.<br/><br/>I loved the sets, the locations, the costumes, the lighting, all the technical aspects were wonderful.<br/><br/>The cinematography couldn't decide if it wanted to be interesting arthouse or standard Hollywood. That was the major downfall.<br/><br/>NOW THE SPOILERS! IF YOU STILL PLAN ON SEEING THIS FILM, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER! IF YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN IT, PRESS ON!<br/><br/>The major twist at the end, us finding out that it's a town living in confines in the modern world, was entirely predictable. I honestly say that i had inclings of this twist as soon as i heard this premise months ago. I didn't know for a fact, but i had feeling about it.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, a few years back, i had the very same idea for a story. under similar circumstances. Now, i'm not claiming that he ripped me off. I never wrote anything down, nor did i speak of it to many people. It was an idea. And many people have common ideas. This just shows that i think on the same level as a former thrill-master (Sixth Sense was a great thriller, no matter what any of you think), and i take that as a compliment to my creativity.<br/><br/>But putting that aside, i saw it coming. Totally and utterly saw it coming. As soon as they revealed that the monsters were fake. That just made it all too aparant that the villiage was fake too. <br/><br/>Had Shymalan left that minor twist out, the end twist would have been even more surprising. But he just made it too obvious, and that is the downfall of this film.<br/><br/>Finally, i give it a 7/10.

"~AleXa~","5","0","0","2 August 2004"," Can we say propaganda?
","Can we say propaganda? Personally, I feel that M. Night Shyamalan's name was attached to this movie for sole purpose of enticing everyone and their dog to go see it. One of the main purposes of the film medium is to communicate a message or messages to those that watch, but a message is only effective when the viewers are receptive to it. You do NOT advertise a movie as a scary horror flick and then try to make a profound statement to the viewers and expect them to hear it. <br/><br/>Knowing M. Night Shyamalan's work and style, I wasn't just expecting a good scare, but an *intelligent* scare. I found neither of which. The plot was very poorly structured, the dialogue was weak and the whole concept just felt forced not to mention it's been done before. What I keep coming back to is that not only does this movie lack Shyamalan's stylistic touch, but it lacks substance. I just felt it to be very hollow, and maybe that's because it wasn't what I expected, but I do not feel that Shyamalan brought anything new to the idea. The whole point of this movie could've been communicated in three sentences--it was not worth the hour and a half of my life I lost.<br/><br/>
And not to say this was a horrible movie, just very mediocre and lacking. I would've never thought that Shyamalan did this movie--he had a point, but didn't know how to make it, and as such, the movie is just lost on everyone. The one thing I would say to those who haven't seen it is that if you're just looking for a good scare, you WILL be disappointed; this is NOT the intelligent thriller it's made out to be.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"
"kmase","8","0","0","2 August 2004"," (Spoiler)Themes of Universality and Social commentary pervade this thriller
","For me The Village was a giant social commentary wrapped in the guise of a thriller, the best apart about this is that it was never apparent until the end when it was revealed that The Village was in modern times. Once this revelation took place all of events of the movie took on a different meaning. If you look back on Nights last film signs there was a definite religious undertone and statement being made, from my perspective Night was again trying to make a statement; this time about the evil of man, the power of love, and the capability for strength in all of us. When Lucius got stabbed my initial thought was, WOW, but then I thought how will they defend themselves without Lucius, who was clearly the strongest and bravest member of the village. That single act sets the stage for Shymalan's commentary to take center stage; you just don't realize it until it's over. The stabbing of Lucius by Noah, makes the attempted utopia a failure all of the elders were trying to escape the pain of loss that they believed was brought on by modernity, they were some how convinced that if removed from those circumstances they would be safe from the evil of man and the pain of human emotion. By having Noah commit such a heinous act Shymalan is showing that the capability for passion, rage, and violence exists within even the most innocent. Shymalan balances that by making Ivey the heroine, blind and alone Ivey was easily the most vulnerable member of the village but drawing upon her love of Lucius she finds the strength to kill Noah and save Lucius. Ultimately I think the most interesting question raised is how much would we give to get back what we lost ? The villagers forsook modern life and all its accoutrements including vital medicine under the seeming belief that money and possession drove man to evil acts, and reverted back to an ancient lifestyle devoid of material wealth in favor of sharing working toward a common good. But when the utopian concept is proved wrong, by Noah they still want to go on. I think this was daring effort by Shymalan and it builds nicely on the themes he has covered in previous movies. It might seem like a stretch but that's what I got after seeing the village."

","*A FEW SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I for one was confused when the reviews came out. <br/><br/>1. Everyone alway's trashes his movies<br/><br/>2. The critics hate him<br/><br/>3. Everyone seems to think that all movies should be realistic?<br/><br/>Ok. do you go to a star wars movie and complain that there is no such thing as Laser swords? Do you go to a Stephen King movie and expect to laugh? Ok so every movie this guy has ever done is sorta the same way? Why should you expect anything else and then trash it because it is not?<br/><br/>I thought this movie was excelent in so many ways. I jumped in 2 or 3 spots. I as a lot of people did figured out about half way through that something was up and that we were living in modern times. The reasons for everything do not have to be understood to enjoy the movie maybe you did not enjoy the movie because you spent to much time trying to figure out every little plot hole? I did not catch the one about the elders talking about the skinned animals them selves. But if you will but think for a moment. The leader of the group himself did not know who was doing this. It would seem that just because they all knew that they were there and in modern times and that the monsters were unreal not all of them were working in unison. This may have been one of Mr Shylaman's points that even in the most perfect utopia that things happen, death happens, crime happens. He could have done like some would have expected and the politically correct ending would have been to realize that they had failed in their experiment and they were doing the same thing they were trying to protect against but no. That's why I respect this man and his movies. He goes against what is neccesarily PC and makes a movie. I would suggest that if you don't like these types of movies then don't go to another one by him. I will say that I liked this one much better than Signs though I have seen signs sevral times and love it still.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 only because there are a few things I was disappointed with in general but not about the movie itself just don't have enough words left to describe. <br/><br/>1 last thing.

Well it gets worse..believe me... The first dumb part is the whole 'blind girl' idea... she RUNS around, she LOOKS at people, oh..did i mention, she RUNS through the woods and never trips, stumbles, falls, or even slows down! OK...bad acting/planning aside... The first glimpse of the creature... a man in a red cloak wearing a suit! WOW!! so 'creature-ey' ... what is this? 'The thing from planet Morpheus'?.. I'm sorry, men dressed in animal skins don't cut it anymore... WAIT but I thought red makes the creatures angry..yet the creatures WEAR (yes..monsters wear clothing nowadays) RED! Sure, i suppose it could work, considering the people in the village have the average intelligence of 10 year olds...Then comes the 'love story and murder' part...this had to be the high point of the movie, with some amount of 'depth' to it. Two friends love the same girl, she chooses, so the crazy guy tries to kill the other! pretty basic, but better than the rest of this crap... Then comes the whole 'truth' behind the village... its all a farce! some rich guy tired of crime in 'the towns' buys some wildlife preserve, bans planes and people from going near it, and builds a retreat/sanctuary for fellow crime victims who want to go 'innocent', and spreads the whole 'evil creatures' story to keep the people from leaving... an interesting idea, to be sure, but i cant help feeling kinda ripped off... i honestly wanted some fun monster-rampaging-through-village movie, but the whole 'it was all fake' setup kinda p***ed me off. Its a cool idea, but as a whole, it feels cheep. Then u have the jerky-slow-motion (WHY i slo-mo so damn jerky in these movies! haven't they heard of 'high speed cameras'?) monster chase, in which the BLIND girl manages to memorize the route to some pit a kilometer away, even though she just got scared running round (personally, i wouldn't be able to find my way anywhere after spinning around 20 times and running blindly in the deep woods like she did)... and finally, when the girl climbs over the fence and talks to the 'security guy'... if i was Mr. security: blind girl, wearing yellow cloak, climbing OUT of a restricted area, talking like Queen Elizabeth approached me and asked for healing medicine... MENTAL HOSPITAL!! ... but fine..the security dimwit is obviously turned on and gets her medicine for her from a first aid cabinet the size of a London Drugs pharmacy and voila! she goes back over the fence, all happy joy-joy.

Night does a pretty good job of beginning what could have been an A-class thriller. The movie then goes downhill from there by focusing on boring situations and weird plot twists. Although there are a few thrilling moments, the movie itself would not be classified as a ""thriller"" or even in the horror genre. The final classification? Romance. Maybe mystery, or drama, but definitely not horror. The famous M. Night twist was horrible and without a doubt ruined all hopes of salvaging the movie. If you're planning on seeing this movie: don't.

The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable were all exceptional films, two of which have their standing in the top grossing films of all time. M. Night has become the Alfred Hitchcock of our day in his manipulation of an audience and his revelations in the final chapter. The particular allure of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was brought by the final pages of the secretive script and people in mass began talking to friends, family and co-workers about the 'I didn't see it coming' endings. <br/><br/>The trailers for The Village looked as promising as any other summer scare. Lacking the big names of Willis or Gibson, M. Night instead went with a familiar if not paparazzi hunted group of talented actors. Joaquin Pheonix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are ordinary villagers in Covington Pennsylvania who live their lives in a Little House on the Prairie environment. They eat dinners at long tables, bake their own bread and eat their own livestock. It is a peaceful place, a tranquil settling. Or is it?<br/><br/>At the village border is a forest marked with yellow flags, burning torches and lookout towers. Teachers impart the history of the village, frightening the youth with stories of creatures that embark upon the woods.<br/><br/>'We have always had since the day we settled here a gentle understanding with a the creatures who live beyond our borders. We do now sway into their woods, they do not come into our village. It is a truce.'<br/><br/>Also forbidden is the color red (for reasons not particularly clear, but a between the lines explanation can be found) and the rules of the village are upheld no matter the cost. When a young villager dies, Lucius (Pheonix) offers to leave the town in search of the next village where he can find medicine for those that are ill. But the elders are not willing to risk the life of someone traveling into the land of the creatures and they hold back young Lucius from attempting his journey.<br/><br/>However, an accident of jealousy leaves a villager in desperate need of medical attention and this time, a young blind woman named Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard in an exceptional performance) petitions an elder to go into the woods and trek to the nearest doctor. Her wish it granted and the movie runs from a state of paranoia to a M. Night does Blair Witch Project. <br/><br/>Writing a review for a M. Night film is like reading a who-dunnit book and stopping before the last chapter. We have to pull ourselves from revealing anything that the audience might not foresee to give them the same sense of revelation as we felt days earlier. Major plot points are kept from the writing as to not sway you into finding out the films secrets and we dance around the issue with anything but grace or agility. <br/><br/>I can say that The Village does have two twists, both of which you could probably figure out since you know to look for them as soon as the drapes reveal the theatre screen. I actually found it a distraction trying to connect the dots one step in front of the director's imagery instead of enjoying the film as a whole. <br/><br/>That said, I was not overly impressed with this production and maybe I can go as far as to say that I was disappointed on how it resolved. The premise and the director gave hope that this might be one of the scariest movies to hit the screen since The Exorcist, but instead, I felt teased like someone was tickling my foot with a feather Â– enjoyable but ultimately annoying.<br/><br/>In this crazy world of special editions and director box sets, I think it might take about 15 years and 9 or so more films before this one is accepted for anything more than a good attempt that failed to win over a mass audience. When M. Night is given the royal treatment of a directors set much like Stanley Kubrick, I like most will hope that The Village is part of the collection. For like Kubrick's The Shining, this film was not one of the best, but it wouldn't seem like a complete set without it.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, my disappointment will have to stew and hopefully, M. Night can follow the great Hitchcock model and quickly erase our memories with a better effort."

","I liked this movie - which doesn't mean you will. Most things I have read have given brutal ratings but the word of mouth I have heard from the few friends who saw it was positive. Which isn't really a big shocker for a Shyamalan film - you either love it, hate it, or disappointed by it. This isn't a true horror flick, and it doesn't have a whopping climax that I'm sure everyone is desperate to see. Instead, we have an accurate portrayal of colonial living and some supposed supernatural influences. I have heard complaints about the acting: I thought it was superb. I have heard complaints about the pace and mood: I thought it was appropriate. I enjoyed the love story, the ending, the people, and most of all the directors' careful camera angles. I won't recommend it though, because I can see why people would hate it - if you're going to the movies to be shocked or surprised you probably won't be. And, of course, there are some really big coincidences to make it all smooth and end well but I didn't care. I had a good time at the movies seeing this, and that is what matters to me."

"Jeffscr5","10","0","0","31 July 2004"," Best Allegory in Response to 9/11 (Spoilers)
","Innocence and Hope is what the villagers in the small utopian community put all their stock in. The goal of its founders is to engender a community of interdependence and purity in a world inundated with greed, crime, and injustice. The elders achieve their goal by injecting fear(terrorism and personal safety) into the hearts and minds of the young village citizens by inventing mysterious creatures(Al-Qaeda) and then empowering this enigma with a set of strict rules(Patriot Act) that all must abide by. This fear occupies their provincial minds so that they are unable to look past their highly-protected (governed) border and into the masked reality. This fear causes blindness and ignorance (confidential government) which over period has a byproduct of innocence. The fear is perpetuated by acts of violence (Terrorist alert levels and threats) to remind the citizens of evil which unsettles their safety and builds fear, which in turn leads to dependency on governing leaders (George WALKER Bush). Consequences and repercussions (War on Iraq) are immediate when the community regulations (safety of the innocent) are violated in order to build fear. In this case, the violators and peacekeepers are members of the same unified community; therefore, the response comes in the form of non-violent ambiguous warnings to increase their fears (Opposite the divided world we live in). The leaders in this case are also the ones who perpetuate the fear (government and media), which in turn helps to maintain the young's innocence (average citizen). The leaders are the only ones cognizant of reality (confidential government), which, in turn, leads them to be the fabricators of the masked reality (Weapons of masked destruction?) that they place over younger citizen's eyes (average citizen). The governing body channels all of the citizen's hatred at these mysterious creatures (Terrorists) causing them to unify as collective body to protect themselves (our temporary unified patriotic nation), and unknowingly their innocence and hope. In order for unanimous unification there must be only one enemy (Iraq), enemies within the unified community cannot exist. <br/><br/>Eventually, the village's innocence is threatened within by the inescapable human nature- jealousy, crime, and impurity manifest themselves within the village borders. Human beings proclivity to sin since the fall of man has produced every type of evil that exists. The catalyst for this evil is another inescapable human characteristic- their ability to love. Theories of dichotomy claim that in order fully know something you must also know its polar opposite. Naturally, if one claims to love they are also claiming to hate. If love exists hate exists. If hate exists, evil exists.<br/><br/>Evil was manifested in the form of jealousy (capitalism and democracy) that caused a violent act of injustice (suicide planes). <br/><br/>The audience is given the reality through horrifying stories of the elders which prompted them to create a protective innocent community. In the outside the fear has many faces and it is propagated not only by the governing but also by the media. The two pages of newspaper shown in the corrupt world contained five stories all of them dealing with crime. People are forced to live in fear because it surrounds them and this fear affects every single move they make. Therefore, the sick-cycle of fear as a protector and inhibitor continues. <br/><br/>Juxtaposition also occurs in the environments. The village is: self-sufficient, utopian, pure, protected, self-governing, and selfless. Whereas, the world outside its boundaries is war torn, crime infested, self-serving, and filled with greedy capitalists (Trump). The only common denominator is that they both thrive on fear. The biggest separation between the two is how they use that fear in balancing the love versus hate continuum. In the village, love drastically outweighs hate. In the world outside the village's boundaries hate overwhelms love.<br/><br/>The second factor that threatens the village's innocence is man's mortality. Man's mortality causes the fear that breeds all other fears, the fear of death. Man's mortality also plays a role in preserving their goals when they are no longer around. Eventually it would be time for the next generation to lead the following generations (leadership changes). In order for them to take control they must lose their innocence and fill that void with hope- a hope that what they are doing(war) is justifiable to those they protect(citizens) with their decisions and regulations.<br/><br/>Fear resides in every character of the film. Ivy, who is blind, is proof that fear is the result of physical being, it is an emotion created by the limits of our imagination. The character of Luscious was proclaimed as fearless, until he found purpose in his life. Prior to proclaiming is love for Ivy, Luscious felt that his purpose in life was to use his fearlessness to help others who fear. However, when love set in, Luscious' new purpose was to protect the one he loved because he feared for her death. The love he felt for his mom and the love he felt for Daniel did not cause such emotion, platonic love did. It was apparent that the roles of the elders would be passed down to Ivey and Luscious because they were had leadership qualities and they had the respect of everyone in the town. However, fear did not set in to the mind of Noah because he was mentally incapable. It takes mentally disturbed individual (Bin Laden) to violate the social contract of the world, but his insurrection was transient because it was only for personal gain. Noah fulfilled his purpose in the community; he became the severe symbol for fear. His death restored justice, helped propagate the secret of the village through fear, and supplanted the old non-violent consequences of breaking the rules with a more severe punishment.<br/><br/>The movie's second twist shows that while this seemed to be an event of the past (colonial America) it is in fact contemporary. (9/11; corrupted reality)<br/><br/>MNS strikes gold again: by twisting the audience's perception of reality, getting superb performances from his actors, while inspiring and enlightening his audience. MNS is not only the greatest director of our time, he is one of the greatest screenwriters of our time- scripts filled with powerful messages, rousing soliloquies(like Hurts in Village, Gibson's in Signs, and Jackson's in Unbreakable), humor, in a PG-13 format. Just like every other MNS film this gets a 10/10."

"setanta-","Null","0","0","2 August 2004"," A `Twilight Zone' Episode Stretched Thin to Two Hours
","In his latest offering M. Night Shyamalan continues his ambition to become the modern-day Rod Serling.  Unfortunately, this time out he tries to stretch an hour's material twice as long as it has the elasticity to bear. It is unfortunate because when we strip away M. Night Shyamalan the writer and his eccentricities of plot, then we are left with M. Night Shyamalan the director who is revealed to be average or less in some cases. <br/><br/>
In particular, in heavy dialogue scenes he leaves his actors a bit stranded. Poor William Hurt bears the brunt of the expository burden and he seems to shift rudderless through those scenes, trying to make his body do the work of the camera.  In a scene where Judy Greer talks to her father about a love interest (and the subsequent scene) the camera never gets closer than a medium-shot of her, making the emotional material difficult for her to communicate.<br/><br/>I also question the structure of the film at some points.  The use of flashbacks seems forced and unnecessary at parts.  It feels a bit like a bad gear shift through an acceleration.  I think different choices with the editing might have made the film stronger.<br/><br/>However the film is not without value and the standout has to be Bryce Dallas Howard.  Her performance is talented and moving.  She is not quite perfect but perhaps some of the stilted dialogue would not sound true from anyone.   She makes the film meaningful.<br/><br/>The photography is also wonderful, that is one of the things that attracted me to the film from the preview, and I was not disappointed.  Roger Deakins uses the muted palette to glorious results, creating crisp, autumnal paintings on screen.<br/><br/>***SPOILERISH***<br/><br/>If I had one major complaint about the film it would be that I wish M. Night Shyamalan would play it straight for once.  I think he had the cast, crew, and fragments of story to make a very good film.  Sometimes irony isn't clever, it's just a crutch for people with out the bravery to be honest. Perhaps his `twist' worked in `The Sixth Sense' (though I would debate that) but here it hurts the picture.  The true meaning of the film lay in a unique love story- not some amateurish social criticism."

","I don't think it's a spoiler to say there's a twist at the end because we all know that's Shyamalan's thing. At any rate, I think you're overall opinion of this movie will depend on how you feel about the twist at the end. Maybe that's why there's so many 10s and 1s on the board. Either you'll think the ending is brilliant or you'll hate it. <br/><br/>Other than that, it comes down a lot to expectations. When I saw Signs I was expecting something totally different, and walked away disappointed. I think most people felt the same about Unbreakable, even though there's a lot of good to be said about those movies. Even though this movie does have a twist ending, it isn't the Sixth Sense. It isn't too terribly scary either, though it has a few moments. I think if you go into this movie not expecting so much, you'll get a lot more out of it. <br/><br/>I did like the cast a lot. At first I wasn't sure what I felt about Ron Howard's daughter, but she came through in the end. Adrien Brody, as usual, put in a great performance. Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are also worth mentioning. The dialogue wasn't too bad, and neither was the acting. There were moments before the beginning where I didn't care much for the editing, and why were there so many slow motion shots? They didn't really seem to fit in this movie. So, there you have it. Probably not Shyamalan's best, but I think pretty worthwhile none the less."
"mopolymer","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," Cant decide
","As always, I come out trying to hear what others have to say, primarily a sigh of relief this time as I walked out of 'The Village'. <br/><br/>Comparison to Alfred Hitchcock will be doing a disservice to both the late genius of Paranoia and the young Shyamalan, note I hold back from prefixing an adjective. It is not that he does not deserve it is just that Mr. Shyamalan has a long way to grow before he can be called Hitchcock of our times.<br/><br/>By journeying ""the Village' into shyamalan's mind I decide that shyamalan is a short story buff, one that likes twists, He likes to think through the audience,<br/><br/>An excellent screenplay writer is one that keeps the reaction of the audience as primary and the story and script secondary, or as tools to achieve a certain reaction within the audience.<br/><br/>Mr.Shyamalan is a sophisticated reaction monger, he sets himself and the audience into a conversation, has their undivided attention, engrossed the audience can jump or wrench to his screenplay. His past movies, his reputation and the promos of ""the village"" are preludes to the reaction monger. I cannot think of any director of NOW having such a reputation to twist, in this department Mr. Shyamalan impresses me, he does not loose control and overuse the audiences attention, he keeps the stomachs of the audience loosened most of the times only to grip them sporadically.<br/><br/>Mr. shyamalan's previous movies in my belief had the grip rather vice even through the ending, but in ""the Village"" he seems to have grown up, in a more mature fashion as if organically continuing from his past, <br/><br/>When the twist that is revealed it brings about a sigh of relief, a sense of contentment. An answer to the question that had unsettled you. The story lasts beyond the first twist and reveals you to a more mature second one.<br/><br/>Is this second twist the beginning of the end of Shyamalan trade mark intrigue and twists,? I really hope so, he is more than intrigue director, he handles his actors well, there is a sense of consistency in all his characters as if they hear the same story.<br/><br/>Apart from Mr. Shyamalan being a short story reader I think he has read the Atlas Shrugged. <br/><br/>The movies appeal cannot cross the western boundaries"

","Although many portions of this film seemed rather predictable, the little things Hollywood film creators have lost touch with, M. Night nails. The mood is created through thematic use of music cued to coloring and emotional movements throughout the film. It may not be a film to see if one is the typical Hollywood formula lover, rather it is a return to films similar to those from the silent era that relied on techniques beyond the actors (eg., creative scenery, camera angles, use of music, and other things). Lastly, I would recommend this film to any that appreciate the film-making styles of Dave Mammet, this is something that is a must see beyond the boundary of just a plot. I think M. Night hit this one right on. And in the style of Mammet, M. Night's assumption is that the movie-goer is intelligent, not just a drone to be hand-held through dull character and plot development."
"PrenticeZarathustra","8","0","0","31 July 2004"," A pseudo-horror flick with philosophical underpinnings?
","Without revealing too much, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that having just come from the theater I am astounded at the intricacy and intelligence of this film. Let me first of all state for the record that I am not a Shyamalan apostle--I very much enjoyed The Sixth Sense, but his other films (Unbreakable and Signs) I thought of much less quality. This film redeems him in my opinion as one of the more intelligent film makers in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>There are numerous themes and metaphors (some which tremble on the threshold of being cliché, but are worked in skillfully enough by the director not to cross that line) used in the film and it would require a larger space to cover all of them. Suffice it to cover three major themes Shyamalan hits on: the state of nature, alienation and modernity, and love.<br/><br/>Of the first, Shyamalan seems to take a page from Rousseau in his presentation of this idyllic village of closely knit people in the sense that this film captures the classically liberal theme of man's natural benevolence. Yet, this natural benevolence is contrasted with the corrupting nature of 'society' on individual human beings--forcing them into the exile we see in The Village. What Rousseau wrote about the advantages of a small republic like Geneva, for instance, are at work in the bucolic 18th century beauty of the Village. Yet, the appreciation of the lifestyle of Geneva was only appreciated by Rousseau because of his experience with the cruelties of another world--just as it is with the Elders of the Village. Yet, Shyamalan doesn't entirely embrace Rousseau, and through Brody's character (a brilliant performance by Brody, by the way) explores the possibility of evil coupled with the natural benevolence of man. In the midst of this pastoral little village, there is a philosophical quest to understand evil--both the perceived external evil of The Ones, and the internal conflicts of men.<br/><br/>Yet, the idealism and innocence of the Village is suddenly broken in the course of Shyamalan's work by The Ones. The Village was only kept innocent by the presence of a fear they dared not challenge, and yet are they better off living in the innocence of the village then in ""the forest""? The distinctive themes of more modern philosophy are echoed in the issues of fear and the alienation that drive the Elders to their Village, themes touched on in Kierkegaard extensively. Likewise, the Elders find faith and hope for the future, and find strength in one girl's idealistic love--the love they have ever fought to keep innocent.<br/><br/>At its heart, The Village is not a horror movie--though it has its creepy moments that are done with great taste. It is rather a love story, and its hero is a Homeric blind girl who sees more than those with vision in her town. Her journey toward love, which Shyamalan applies as a vehicle for Enlightenment, begins with wide-eyed idealism. Yet, the end of that journey offers no easy solutions. If by the end of this film you think you have a happy ending, you've missed the coming-of-age questions raised by this film.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has produced a movie that was sold as a horror movie, but it is so much more. People's views of this movie are likely to be wildly divergent, as those who are seeking a scary movie or who believe this is a movie only about surprise endings are bound to be disappointed. But for those who are searching for an intelligent movie about the nature of man, love, and enlightenment, you will not be disappointed. You will be delighted by the philosophic intrigue of this movie, and the brilliance of the acting (although, some of the writing is too contrived in places, that we can forgive)."

The twist (no spoilers here) caught me completely off guard and, at times, I thought I had guessed what was going to happen next, but couldn't have been more wrong. Granted, I did not leave the theater paranoid for my safety (as I did after Signs), but I left satisfied with the ending and sincerely impressed.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix has the top-billing and will surely win your praise (I've come to believe he can do just about anything acting-wise), but Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of the fragile, but strong-willed and witty Ivy steals the show.

(She used words like ""tedious"" to describe it.)<br/><br/>I really wanted to hate it and have fun making mock of it.  Instead, I was horrified to find that there were tears pricking my eyes in a couple of spots.  <br/><br/>There is something gutsy about going ahead with a plot that has been completely leaked to your target audience.  And there is something gutsy to be found in what this film is saying about love and fear. <br/><br/>
It probably shouldn't have been marketed as a horror film, because it isn't. And maybe he didn't need Sigourney Weaver's star power (but you know, she has what is a small, throw-away role and she does a great job with it and I liked her in it).  And no, the creatures aren't real--but what they say about our fear and what it says about the ""elders"" needing to generate fear in order to avoid facing their own, is quite profound.  Some people are calling this a 9/11 film.  If it is, Shamayalan is suggesting that if we face our fears and destroy them, we will be better off than hiding our heads in the sand.  <br/><br/>The acting is low key (with the exception of Brody's over-the-top Noah) and dialogue appropriate to the time in which the folks believe themselves to be living.  (Yes, people actually did talk like that, if the letters I have read from my great gramma's generation are any indication.)  Bryce Howard is riveting to watch, though I was hardpressed to believe she was blind.  And the whole throwaway bit about her and ""auras"" could have been dispensed with.  I was sorry to see a person with mental difficulties cast as the bad guy, but I suppose a ""normal-thinking"" villain would have added a whole set of plot difficulties.  Still, I found it hard to believe that the young man was so mentally challenged and innocent and was still able to come up with the evil plan he did.<br/><br/>On the over all, though, despite the twist (for a much better plot based on the same twist, read Margaret Peterson Haddix's ""Running Out of Time.""  I'm wondering if M. Night read this book and borrowed a great deal from it), I find this film and the very end (not the twist reveal, but the last frames, focusing on the elders' decision and on Bryce Howard's quiet bravery) haunting my thoughts a day or two later."

","I thought this film was fantastic if viewed as an analogy for the current American political/homeland security/terrorist scare situation.<br/><br/>It seemed to me that Shyamalan was using this story as an analogy for the actions of the government post 9-11. The village elders (the government) was using fear of Those We Do Not Speak Of (terrorism) to keep the villagers (citizenry) from disobeying their orders. Their intentions were well meaning -- these were not power hungry elders -- but the story serves to demonstrate how those in power can use boogeymen, even when they have some basis in fact (as Walker said, there really were tales of creatures in those woods) to get citizens to act (or refrain from acting) as they otherwise would.<br/><br/>Even if you don't buy the political allegory, I liked the film for the trademark Shyamalan use of mood, color, and silence."

The latest rumblings from Hollywood saying that The Village may be the last thriller in awhile as his next project is set to be the film adaptation of the hit novel, The Life of Pi. Preferably he would like to go out on top with the genre he made his own playground but that is all up to how the American public receive it, either as another success or a failure.<br/><br/>The story centers on an isolated group of villagers who find themselves confined to their town by the mysterious creatures that roam the woods that encircle them. In the year 1897, the village of Covington, Pennsylvania can be seen as the prime example of a utopian society  there is no violence, no greed, and all work together in upholding the vision of hope that has driven the villagers to bountiful blessings, something the elders of the town believe will continue through the leadership of their children. Covington, to the untrained eye, may seem perfect but the element of fear still dwells within the occupants of the town. What would inhabitants of a utopian society such as this have to fear? 'Those we do not speak of'  red hooded creatures that reside in the woods and make raids on the town when they feel they have been threatened. None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders. Lucius feels compelled to defy the boundaries of the village but at the same time he dares not leave out of the fear, the only one he has, that harm will come to Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder with whom he has fallen deeply in love with. But when an accident occurs in the village and Lucius is found deeply hurt, Ivy demands that she be given permission to enter the woods and obtain medicine from the nearby towns.<br/><br/>The story for The Village suffers from an acute identity crisis in that it plays out more like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone then usual Shyamalan thriller audiences have come associate his films with. That is not to say that it doesn't try, in fact the first half is quite engaging, it's just that it fails to ends the same way. Another Shyamalan thriller, The Sixth Sense, shares a similar trait with this film, the less then surprising twist at the end. If The Village was able to have as genuine and masterfully orchestrated a plot as The Sixth Sense had then it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, Shyamalan demonstrates that either he is losing his once golden touch or he is running low on decent material to scare audiences with.<br/><br/>With as talented a group of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high-profile cast ever assembled by director M. Night Shyamalan, you would think it would no problem for a film with the least orchestrated storyline to be raised to the level of a tolerable feature but that isn't true here. Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of director Ron Howard, makes a surprisingly brilliant debut in the role of Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of leading town elder. All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this. Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he can lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance that goes way beyond the role given to him in Signs. And Adrien Brody gives an emotionally charged roller coaster performance as the mentally challenged Noah. There are times where he can make you laugh, make cry, have you feel sorry for him only to turn around and do something that provokes the opposite effect with the audience. The character of Noah is the combination of both the talent of Brody and dexterous construction from Shymalan's script. The problem with the cast is that there are too many of them for the audience to keep track of each individual character plot. The brilliance about Shyamalan's past films was that he kept the group of characters relatively small in order to allow the audience to singularly focus on the actions of the main characters and not have them confused by separate character developments. The filmmaker diverts from his usually agenda and that in effect hurts the film's script deeply.<br/><br/>Overall, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan trades in his philanthropic messages on humanity and supernatural fantasies brought to life for cheap scares and a story that may turn out to be an accidental rip off of a classic sci-fi television series. Though Shyamalan makes no direct assertions within the nearly two hour feature and quite possibly leaves this up to interpretation, there is the slight assumption that The Village may be a political commentary on the current climate of the United States after September 11th.<br/><br/>What evidence within the framework of the film would support this theory? For starters, the color coded system the villagers develop, yellow to indicate safety and red to imply fear and danger, overtly resembles the terrorism warning levels developed by Homeland Security after the attacks on September 11th. The creatures that wander the woods and raid the town when threatened are nothing more then false reports developed by the elders to keep the townspeople in fear and prevent them from leaving the village, which may be a reference to the accusations made by the liberals about the Bush administration whenever they release a terror alert. And the most convenient piece of evidence lies in the name of the lead elder who orchestrates the entire façade: Walker, which may or may not be an allusion to the current commander in chief's middle name. Granted the deception was in an effort to preserve innocence but in the minds of some individuals, deception is deception no matter the reason.<br/><br/>Even if that theory is proven correct, only a hand full of individuals will probably pick up on that message and doesn't affect a person's perception of the film much if one disagrees with the assertion that may or may not be made. In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past. And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught. There are three twist endings to the film: the first seems misplaced as it totally eliminates the element of fear that is associated with the creatures, the second isn't so much a problem as it is obvious especially if you're one who pays close attention to certain characters, and the final twist gives you the feeling as though you were watching an episode of The Twilight Zone, leaving the audience neither shocked nor amazed, just swindled. But the film's most disappointing aspect is the fact that the audience is left at the end with nothing; no fear, no hope. The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie-goers would take home with them when it reveals the creatures weren't real. This was the key that made Shymalan thrillers classics to so many people. Whether it is political allegory or just pure coincidence, anyway you slice it The Village is a drawn out disappointment."

","The Village is something different in an otherwise boring summer of nonstop sequels and idiotic Will Smith blow 'em up's. It's insightful, intelligent, and a deeply moving portrait on American paranoia and fear of the outside world. Shyamalan seems to dig deeper in each other his films, unearthing humanistic feelings more and more. The Village is his masterpiece and makes The Sixth Sense pale in comparison. The film delivers creepy moments and dreadful situations, but they never over-shadow the film's main ideas of isolation and politic refuge. As great as Signs is, The Village is a punch in the stomach, especially in this day and age of the Bush Administration. Shyamalan could even rival Michael Moore for his truthful views on government paranoia. I loved this movie and on a second viewing, experienced something even scarier than any horror movie could ever show: man's twisted views on his own kind."

","With this being a Shymalan film, I was not expecting to be disappointed. And the trailers seemed to be very promising as well. But I must say, this movie left me feeling very unfulfilled. First of all, it wasn't scary. Every scary element in the movie, was shown during the trailers. If you've seen all the trailers, then you're going to be familiar with all the scare scenes. Second, the movie was just WAY too slow for the first 30 minutes or so. And once we finally got an intense moment, the film's intensity quickly tapered back off again for awhile. It never really kept your adrenaline flowing at all.<br/><br/>I'll admit, the ending threw me for a loop and at least made up for most of what the film lacked. But other than that, the acting of Howard and the cinematography were the only positives in my opinion. Big letdown for me and there were actually a few people in the theater that left early. In my opinion, wait for the DVD. If you simply must go see it, at least catch a matinée so you don't waste upwards of $10 on this film. And don't expect to be terrified by this movie because it's more of a love story than anything else."

","When I go to a movie I want to be transported and entertained. Not spoon fed sappy dialogue and whiz-bang special effects till I snore. I want to say this was not a great movie, but then I realized that I was captured from the opening sequence and kept wound up in the story till the end. Given just enough information in the most tantalizing bits and pieces to keep me guessing. The characters were strong but not obvious and there were lots of little sub-plots adding depth and dimension. The mythos presented was unknown but still complete and understandable. I was genuinely spooked a couple of times. Subtle, exciting, and entirely enjoyable. I think this is an excellent example of modern day storytelling - using the visual aspect of film instead of dialogue or soliloquies to tell vital points. It didn't matter if I knew what would happen next, the joy of seeing this film was watching it unfold in rich and exquisite detail."

"princewonder","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," How Many Idiots Does It Take to Run ""The Village?""
","Okay, I'm a fan of M. Night's movies. I've considered him one of my favorite movie-makers in mainstream Hollywood. ""The Sixth Sense"" introduced us to an original genre of ""twist endings,"" (which some films pre-MNS had like ""The Usual Suspects, but only edited or delivered differently.) ""Unbreakable,"" my favorite one of all, showed true character development of a superhero. ""Signs"" focused more on faith and destiny (not aliens like most viewers focus on). I loved all three of these films because they were well-made and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>As for ""The Village,"" I was disappointed. M. Night's formula failed in this film. I left this movie focusing more on the lack of substance in the film and asking more questions about the empty plot lines rather than speaking about the twist or surprised ending. Was is a twist ending? Sure. Was it a surprise? No. I had it figured out early into the movie.<br/><br/>Now, this disappointment may be my fault because, like in all M. Night films, I try to figure the surprise ending and analyze the movie, but this movie just didn't deliver. I can blame it on the promotions and commercials because the movie was not a thriller nor scary. I can blame on the editing because the revelation of the ""secret shed"" came too early into the movie, which watered-down the ""twist"" ending. However, if you pay attention to the opening credits, M. Night wrote, directed, and produced this movie, so the blame will have to go on him.<br/><br/>M. Night, the great film-maker he is, has cornered himself into a type-cast.<br/><br/>He will forever be known and expected to produce movies with surprise endings. It is the viewer's expectation for him to top each movie he makes, yet ""The Village"" falls flat. I would rather he make a well-made film without a twist/surprise ending than try to use the same dried-out formula.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There were some positive things about the movie. The acting was flawless by the main characters. The camera work was unique, especially the Noah and Lucius ""shocking"" scene. The romantic plot with Ivy and Lucius and their scene on the front porch talking about ""dancing"" added romance and humanity to the story. Even M. Night's messages about the evil in the ""outside"" world, the treatment of people, and the irony of trying to escape sorrow and pain were discussion-worthy, however, this message was subtly expressed only through one-liner dialogue. In his previous films, he left clues that the viewers missed and gave covert history in the storyline which were pieced together in the end, but in ""The Village,"" he lacked the substance, making the movie very anorexic.<br/><br/>As a viewer, I wanted my money back because I expected more out of M. Night.<br/><br/>A movie-maker is supposed to progress after each movie, not digress. In his case, he took a step back this time. I sometimes wonder whether M. Night would still be a successful movie-maker if ""The Others"" had come out before ""The Sixth Sense."" Would everyone still rave about HIS ""twist-endings?"" I guess we'll never find out. I just want him to redeem himself after this movie. Otherwise, I'm kicking him out of ""The Village."" :)"
"jhorrr","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," ""THE VILLAGE"" HAS A WEAK SCRIPT WITH A SILLY PLOT THAT STRAINS CREDIBILITY.
","REVIEW OF 'THE VILLAGE'<br/><br/>Even if you're a follower of M. Night Shyamalan's first three films, his latest effort will severely test your patience, not to mention your gullibility, as a viewer. ""The Village"" is a beautifully-photographed, goose-bumpy stinker. It seems Mr. Shyamalan is content in making the same movie over and over again, and while the plot, characters and settings may be different in each film, the desired effect is the same. Shyamalan wants to cleverly pull the rug out from under his audience with one last, jaw-dropping plot twist. This time, though, the denouement is no big surprise and it severely strains credibility.<br/><br/>What the surprise in ""The Village"" is, I won't say because I don't want to spoil it for fans of this sort of thing. However, by the film's end, I will say I felt cheated. I groaned out loud because I couldn't believe the final twist could be that silly. The late, great Rod Serling wrote these kinds of morality plays 40 some years ago but those were classic examples of mood and storytelling. Most of these ""Twilight Zone"" episodes taught a moral lesson or commented on a social issue and many of them had an O. Henry-inspired twist ending. These scripts also had a wry, satiric sense of humor and were crafted with great skill. The script for ""The Village"" is not. As a director, Shyamalan creates a foreboding atmosphere and a few chilling moments but his flat, clunky screenplay fails both he and the audience as the film draws us toward its rather mundane ending.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's terrific cast of actors tries hard but even the seasoned pros can only do so much with some of this corny and stilted dialogue. Of the ensemble, William Hurt does the best, especially since the dialogue seems to flow naturally off his tongue. One of my favorite actresses, Sigourney Weaver, is basically wasted in a colorless role. Joaquin Phoenix is dour and very serious and pretty newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard, has plenty of charisma as Mr. Phoenix's love interest. In the role of the village weirdo, Adrien Brody chews the scenery but he's obviously having a rollicking good time.<br/><br/>The film looks spectacular thanks to the rich, burnished cinematography by Roger Deakins, who photographs the backgrounds in ""The Village"" as if they were paintings created by Dutch masters. Kudos to Mr. Deakins for an outstanding effort.<br/><br/>Though Mr. Shyamalan has created some interesting characters and situations in ""The Village,"" they're basically abandoned for what is a rather ridiculous and implausible ending. But by that time, I didn't really care."

","Alright, for starters, I did not look at any spoilers or reviews before I went to go see the Village. I wanted to go see it with an open and unknowing mind.<br/><br/>And although I did not know the ""big twist"" at the end, I guessed about 3/4 of the way through, but when I said it to my friend, I just thought that it was weird and unlikely, and probably way off from what it really was. And when the twist came... boy was I kind of disappointed. Great concept, really, but I think that it wasn't as shocking just because of the fact that we were eased into it, not like BOOM! Shocker! There was only one part in this movie that really had me so shocked I couldn't speak, and if you've seen the movie, you probably know what part I'm speaking of, but if you haven't, I won't say which.<br/><br/>Aside from that, this movie is done pretty well. Good directing, great acting (especially on Bryce Dallas Howard's part, she's got talent) I also thought that Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix were fantastic in their roles.<br/><br/>So, all in all, this movie's a real mixed bag. On one side, it was slow-paced, and not as shocking as anticipated, but on the other side, extremely good directing and acting. I honestly think that it depends on what you're expecting when you walk into the theater. It's not as big of a horror as is described in the trailer, its more of a mystery/thriller. So if you're expecting nailbiting horror, you'll most likely be disappointed. But if you're expecting an edge-of-your-seat ""what in the world is going on.. tell me!"" movie, you just may like this film.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10"

There will never be another Sixth Sense because we're all looking for twists now. However, to his credit, Shyamalan continues to develop his craft as a story teller in the grand fashion of Hitchcock. <br/><br/>My viewing of the movie was marred by a vast sea of giddy, giggling teenage girls who must have thought they were in for some teen slasher flick. Even that wasn't enough to detract from the spellbinding visual quality of The Village. What difference does it make even if you guess the end or think it's ""predictable""? Shyamalan has gone beyond that. His work needs to be judged not by horror standards but by literary ones. <br/><br/>He is a superb story teller. <br/><br/>The love story was unique and powerful. The theme of love and protection intertwined -- a rich subtext which pushes Ivy to a different response than the one taken by her elders when they had to deal with protecting the ones they love. Sometimes to protect we turn inward; sometimes we must turn outward.<br/><br/>I'll be just as happy when all the ""disappointeds"" finally just hop off the Shyamalan bandwagon so that people with more subtle sensibilities can watch all his sure-to-come destined-to-be-classic-in-spite-of-current-opinion films in a more respectful atmosphere."

","I don't feel The Village lived up to the hype. I had been anticipating this film since late last year, when I heard the general synopsis. There were some frightening parts, and I love being frightened. But the twist didn't pack a big enough punch for me. I'll admit, I never saw the twist(s) coming, but they didn't blow me away. <br/><br/>The story follows people that appear to be Amish, they live a very simplistic life in an earlier time. There is something dangerous that lives in the woods beyond their boundaries, and they must burn fires around the village each night to keep the creatures away. When someone gets seriously hurt, a very brave young woman (played by Bryce Howard) volunteers to venture outside the village, something that is NEVER done because of the creatures that live beyond the borders. This is when we learn more about the creatures that live beyond the borders."

","the first parallel that came to mind after i saw ""the village"" was ""the twilight zone"". ""the village"" follows the classic show's ""odd people, odd setting, twist ending"" formula. unfortunately in a full-length (such as ""the village"") the formula doesn't hold up all that well. because the characterization is a little shallow and underdeveloped, the drama is so superficial it comes off as funny most of the time, and hardly any of the characters have names worth remembering. <br/><br/>additionally, the plot is very slow and most of the movie is spent establishing setting, character, and mood to an almost redundant level. while failing to actually establish the moods they need to be establishing. the scene on the balcony between Lucius and Ivy in which they discuss dancing at their future marriage comes completely out of nowhere, seeing as how she spent the entire beginning of the movie playing and spending time with Noah, the retard, and only had a single, short, totally unromantic conversation with Luscious before the one about marriage. perhaps if a little more dialogue or some more clever silent scenes showing the budding love between Lucius and Ivy had replaced some of those unnecessary establishing shots of irrelevant barns, houses, and creepy looking trees, their love wouldn't've seemed so contrived.<br/><br/>if this movie had been more economically edited and the amazing star-power more appropriately used and directed, this could've made a GREAT 30-minute, color episode of the twilight zone. but because it was fluffed into two-hours, loaded with melodrama, and took way to long to deliver it's points, the movie falls into that tragically mundane category of ""good, but not great""."
"rbarry2","Null","0","0","30 July 2004"," Well directed, but suffers from horrendous structure - rent Vertigo instead
","possible spoilers<br/><br/>M. Night's films have been inconsistent at best. Sixth Sense was stellar, Unbreakable was very good, Signs was unwatchable bad. Now we have The Village, assembling his most acclaimed cast and one of his more complex concepts (the only concept he's done more complex than ""fake village"" is ""real-life superheroes"" if complexity is to be judged on amount of letters or syllables--and both trump ""ghosts"" and ""aliens"").<br/><br/>This movie had more potential in its concept than I can comfortably admit, having been panning it for months now. The male and female romantic leads acted well, though I did not believe for a second that the woman who played Ivy was blind, as did Adrien Brody. The rest of the cast was unimpressive, which is disappointing when you have actors like William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver on screen together. The direction is more skilled than in any of Shyamalan's past works, and clocking in at two jumps and one chill, this has put me on edge more than his previous thrillers (Signs, by the way, comes in the negative numbers there as I could actually time how long it was until the next ""jump"").<br/><br/>The real problem comes in the structure of the script. What should have been the end of the second movement of a three or four movement film, Shyamalan here turns into the punchline at the end of a two-hour-long joke he plays on the audience. A few mis-steps in structure and a whole bunch of flaws in logic cost this film dearly. First and foremost, why make Adrien Brody's character mentally retarded when it would be far more interesting and compelling to see how the Elders deal with an actual, intentional crime being committed inside their village by someone who is aware of what he or she is doing? Second, why end the film just when it begins to get interesting--when we find out what's really beyond the woods? Instead, why not let it go another forty five minutes and give us a chance to get to really know the Elders, as well as Ivy, and see the way they interact with each other change in light of recent events? Thirdly, why waste so much time on a plot line that goes nowhere and has so little to do with the characters? Where in The Sixth Sense, the thriller aspect flowed naturally from the characters and their relation to each other, by the end of The Village, the thriller aspect (the storyline involving the monsters) feels disjointed and ultimately unfulfilled. <br/><br/>I firmly hold that M. Night Shyamalan has a talented storyteller somewhere inside of him, but I also hold that said storyteller will not emerge until Shyamalan gets over the need to make every film he does an attempt to take the torches from Hitchcock and Rod Sterling.<br/><br/>Rather than blow the money for this at a cineplex, rent Vertigo instead. It's got all the same stuff that this one tries to have - romance, humor, valor, suspense, mystery, jumps - but does it a lot more fluidly."

"geocitiesisgay","Null","0","0","30 July 2004"," analysis of the film
","People are torn about the movie. Let me begin by saying that the cinematography and soundtrack were masterpieces in their own right. But what about the story? <br/><br/>The movie was marketed as a horror movie whereby monsters live in the woods and the village must overcome their fears to survive. Was this what we saw? Perhaps, if looked at in a more metaphorical manner, yes, otherwise it was completely different. There was in fact a monster, but who or what was it, and was it Shyamalan's intent to symbolically create such a monster? Also, we all expected the usual Shyamalan twist to make the whole movie come together in unity to further express a point made in the movie. Midway through The Village the message appeared to be ""The things you want to do the most are the things you wont do out of fear"", such as why Pheonix's character would no longer touch Howards character, because he was feared that she would know that he loved her, and why Hurt's character wouldn't touch Weaver's character because he didn't want his feelings for her to be revealed due to his fear of being accused of having an affair. Was the ultimate twist going to pull this point into the foreground?<br/><br/>The twist was in fact not Shyamalan's style. The twist was more of a reverse Truman Show ending rather than a signs, sixth sense, or unbreakable ending. Essentially it turns out Hurt's character along with Gleeson, Weaver, and the other ""elders"" of this pioneer village created an isolated society to try and make a world for themselves, whereby no evil can be done by the people. The twist, just unexpected due to the fact that we were all expecting Shyamalan's usual style, and he went for a more mainstream tactic of simple red herrings and false information leading to an unexpected ending. Now, in all fairness, that alone was Shyamalan's tactic for his twist. He knew what EVERYONE would be waiting for, and alas, it was a simple and lackluster explanation. Even the story itself, about people creating their own utopia, has been done over and over again. Was THAT intended to be the shock, or is Shyamalan's movie going to turn into a neo-Shakespeare piece where the interpretation turns something of hardly any notable mention into a masterpiece? How crucially deceptive he made this movie. Where most of his plots went from simple and rational into completely unexpected and borderline unbelievable, this movie did the opposite. It went from a story of paranormal monsters and superstition into a movie about a bunch of born-again amish who use fear to ensure they keep their way of life preserved. I am truly baffled. <br/><br/>I simply cannot figure out if this movie was a masterpiece or a piece of sh*t, but i have to admit i was pleased up until the end, and then i just said ""So what? the colony is separate from the rest of the world, thats entirely plausible AND had i not been misled by the previews and expecting Shyamalan's usual style of the blatantly extraordinary unexpected i could have seen that coming a mile away!"" But that was my problem... i expected the same thing over again, and i got something totally new. Was this a bad thing? <br/><br/>But enough about the confusion, after debating it, I've decided that if i INCLUDE my confusion about the twist into the judgment of the overall movie, i got less than i expected but if i SEPARATE that twist and the confusion that comes with it from the rest of the movie, i would argue the movie was phenomenal. For all those who hated the movie, allow me time to make my point. <br/><br/>The acting was by all means absolutely FANTASTIC by EVERY actor. Granted thats not hard to do when you have an all-star cast of Joaquin Pheonix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and countless others, but i was truly awe-struck by performance of the leading lady. For all those who didn't know, her name is Bryce Dallas Howard, and she is Ron Howard(movie director)'s daughter, and this was the first role she has had in a movie AT ALL! Consideering all of this, i argue the acting was astounding. <br/><br/>As for the visuals and sound, i will argue with anyone who sees them as anything less than fantastic. <br/><br/>Also i argue that some of the story was well done, because certain scenes were fantastic. The scene where Pheonix grabs Howards hand and pulls her inside in slow motion just as the beast is reaching out to take her was extremely well done. <br/><br/>Another thing that stands out in my mind is the performance, character, and scenes involving Adrien Brody. For all those who aren't as movie-crazy as myself, Adrien Brody played Noah Percy (the retard who was also in love with Bryce Dallas Howards character Ivy). The scene that will live on for me was when Ivy walks into the room and slaps Noah repeatedly, and gets pulled away, and Noah is once again locked in confinement. Why does this stand out? Because of what Noah did in response. The screaming and wailing that came from the other side of that door was unreal... That scene alone may have carried a lot of the movie on its back because he truly sounded heartbroken, furious, and confused. <br/><br/>Overall, i must say i have no CLUE where i stand... i mean.. here is what i basically believe in a nutshell: the sights and sounds were fantastic the acting was phenomenal some scenes were spectacular the story was bland the ending twist remains a mystery which the answer to can only be found in Shyamalan's head, and it alone holds the truth to whether this was a masterpiece living up to all of Shyamalan's other movies, or if it was a piece of sh*t by all expectations held by the viewers who were awaiting another Shyamalan blockbuster."

","I went into The Village with low expectations. I read some reviews before seeing it, and they all kind of gave me the impression to not expect much. It turns out that The Village has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>First, I thought the acting was superb. Howard does a great job, as well as Brody. Howard really stands out in my mind, but everyone else did good, too. <br/><br/>Second, Like Sixth Sense and Signs, there were times during the film I was tense waiting for something to happen. I wanted to run and hide or at least not look, but there was no escaping. I love when this happens. This means that I was truly involved in the story line. It takes a good film to do that. <br/><br/>Third, The major major twist/surprise really through me off. Looking back, I KNEW that some hints were being given through the dialog and such, but I was so involved in the film, I didn't notice. <br/><br/>Fourth, The major plot points, where the love story is introduced, and where the dramatic conflict is introduced, are excellent. I really feel like this is the best film since Sixth Sense as far as drama goes. (of M. Night's films) They got me so hooked into what the characters are about. This lead to me truly caring about what happens to them. Without this, none of the action matters. <br/><br/>Lastly, I think the symbolism and visual story telling add depth to this film. There are people overcoming personal tragedy, there are traps they must not fall in. There are moments in this film, and even a few sequences, that really felt like a what a film should be. No words, just visuals. When you combine all the great aspects of the story with the superb camera and editing work, you have a solid film. There is nothing more powerful in this film than the shot that didn't cut away. There are several, but each one is just so beautiful, even the violent one. <br/><br/>I cannot say enough good about this film. My only let down was that I wanted it to go longer, that is, I wanted to more of a resolution, but what I got was more than satisfactory. I'm just a romantic i guess. A very solid film. 9/10"

And she actually has a ROLE role in the movie. I found her to have the biggest out of all of them and deserved top billing the most.<br/><br/>Now, did I love ""The Village""?

The theme of this movie has/had the overwhelming potential to affect social change, BUT, Night seems to have dropped the ball halfway through the screenplay.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I am completely willing to go along with the idea that there are these rustic, menacing hogs-head type creatures in red robes threatening the safety of an obscure village--just so long as the characters follow through with that same fear. The problem is, simply put, there is just not enough at stake for ANY of these people, except Ivy's character. And that just doesn't make it a fair fight. If I lived in ""The Village,"" the first things I would ask myself are:<br/><br/>1. ARE YOU FOR REAL?<br/><br/>Has anyone actually SEEN these things kill before? And how do we know there is an ""agreement"" between them and us? Do they speak English? I want to speak to a supervisor.<br/><br/>2. CAN WE KILL THESE THINGS?<br/><br/>Why is this not a matter of simple pest control? Why convince yourself you're beaten before you've begun. We know they have knives and reference is made to the advent of a handgun, let's bring it on!<br/><br/>3. WHY DO WE STILL LIVE HERE?<br/><br/>If these creatures are ""Unbreakable,"" I wouldn't want them in my backyard, would you? Yeah, let's leave. This issue is addressed briefly in the film, but the manner in which the characters deal with it makes me not believe they want to live there at all. If The Village is the BEST alternative for them to live in, they should be willing to risk their lives and/or KILL in order to preserve such a way of life. They simply aren't. If they were my elders, I would have skipped town a long time ago.<br/><br/>The way in which these questions are fielded in the script leaves much frustration. We, as the audience, are just asked to go along with far too much. NO!! As an audience member, I feel myself as though I am a resident of that Village and as a resident of that Village, I say it's mutiny time. But no one in the movie was mutinous.<br/><br/>Can a sequel fix this?"

","I am so angry that I just shelled out money and hours of time I'll never get back, to see what is arguably the WORST film ever made. The Village. If you're determined to see it, be prepared. It's a stupefyingly dull, slow-paced, derivative bit of utter rubbish. <br/><br/>Among its many problems are the insipid, groan-worthy, idiotic plot twists, stiff dialogue, predictable plot points and stereotypical characters. 95% of the theater was yelling insults and booing through the end credits. 5% of the people liked it, but they skulked out in a hurry. <br/><br/>It's the first time I've ever been so angry at a film that I would be willing to campaign against it. I'm furious with Night for wasting my time on that piece of crap and if it winds up tanking his career, he'll deserve it.

","Ah, the all American summer movie. It is part of what makes this time of the year have the atmosphere that it does. Go to the theaters for fun, thrills, chills, and spills(?). But wow does it suck when you come across one that is a real killjoy. For those headed to your local cinema this weekend (July 30th  August 1st), chance are you went to go see THE VILLAGE, and was meant with the buzz kill of your summer-movie going experiences. Not all, mind you, but most.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has made quite the name for himself coming to Hollywood with his first acclaimed film, the infamous SIXTH SENSE. Since then people will claim that his talent has decreased or that he has tried to hard, but I feel none are true as such accusations prove only opinion. SIGNS is often very maligned by others but I actually find it to be my favorite of M.'s films, so it is all a matter a choice. But I feel that when a movie is weak in comparison to past works, then it is weak and this was weak. And is also part of a strange dilemma that only Shyamalan could get into because of his talent as a writer and a director which is still apparently strong in his worse outing at the time of writing this.<br/><br/>Slow, plodding, but rarely uninteresting you grow quite attached to the village and the villagers themselves, and deciding on the title of the movie is better fitted in its final form as 'The Woods' sets up a bit of different expectation. Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy (Bryce Howard) and Noah (Adrien Brody) are the pivots in which this story turns and all are wonderfully developed. Secondary characters seem to get the proverbial shaft though as this is one of the largest casts M. Night has worked with thus far. Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) and Edward Walker (William Hurt) were the only others of real interest and while you got the gist of what they were as folk in this town, there was no proper time to get to them like the many variety of characters Shyamalan has given us before. This especially sucks for me because I am a huge fan of Sigourney Weaver from her ALIEN days up through HEARTBRAKERS and HOLES.<br/><br/>But no matter the actors, no matter how visionary the director is or the writing, when a story is left in a jumble there is nothing to save it. And a jumble this is. Things felt forced at times and at others felt truly ludicrous. I will not post any spoilers, but a rule of film in my opinion is to never just tell what is going on show it, let the audience think and have it unraveled in their minds instead of a character coming forth and saying flat out what the twist or trick is When this point comes in the movie, the rest is ruined in its wake because it was just too important of a detail. A detail in which this entire movie rides on since the beginning and ruins it in the end. <br/><br/>I rate this movie a 4.5 out of 10. Still far from hating it, but even farther from loving it."

","I went into The Village with low expectations. I read some reviews before seeing it, and they all kind of gave me the impression to not expect much. It turns out that The Village has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>First, I thought the acting was superb. Howard does a great job, as well as Brody. Howard really stands out in my mind, but everyone else did good, too. <br/><br/>Second, Like Sixth Sense and Signs, there were times during the film I was tense waiting for something to happen. I wanted to run and hide or at least not look, but there was no escaping. I love when this happens. This means that I was truly involved in the story line. It takes a good film to do that. <br/><br/>Third, The major major twist/surprise really through me off. Looking back, I KNEW that some hints were being given through the dialouge and such, but I was so involved in the film, I didn't notice. <br/><br/>Fourth, The major plot points, where the love story is introduced, and where the dramatic conflict is introduced, are excellent. I really feel like this is the best film since Sixth Sense as far as drama goes. (of M. Night's films) They got me so hooked into what the characters are about. This lead to me truly caring about what happens to them. Without this, none of the action matters. <br/><br/>Lastly, I think the symbolism and visual story telling add depth to this film. There are people overcoming personal tragedy, there are traps they must not fall in. There are moments in this film, and even a few sequences, that really felt like a what a film should be. No words, just visuals. When you combine all the great aspects of the story with the superb camera and editing work, you have a solid film. There is nothing more powerful in this film than the shot that didn't cut away. There are several, but each one is just so beautiful, even the violent one. <br/><br/>I cannot say enough good about this film. My only let down was that I wanted it to go longer, that is, I wanted to more of a resolution, but what I got was more than satisfactory. I'm just a romantic i guess. A very solid film. 9/10"

I must also suggest that you stop guessing what the movie is about and just enjoy the story. If you go in with an open mind you will have a far better time. <br/><br/>The most severe error for this was not anything technical. It was the target audience and the advertisements. As I watched the movie I realized I was one of the only people in the theater with the patience to sit through this type of movie. It was a slow movie based on the plot and character. The themes of the movie were also prominent aspects. This was not a crowd that can appreciate the concept of a theme. They wanted cheep thrills; in all honesty they had good reason to expect it from the advertisements. In stead, what they got was a fairly deep story with deep themes. I do not blame the mindless, tasteless rabble for being displeased when they were fooled into leaving their world of comfortable levity. <br/><br/>If you have finished this review, and understand what I have said.

","I went into Shayamalan's latest film expected to be frightened and tricked. Though the first roughly hour of the film was pretty suspenseful and had some nice heart-stopping moments, I thought Shayamalan's twists were a bit over-used in this work. After about 3-4 major plot 'surprises,' I found that they began to get in the way of the plot and decreased my enjoyment immensely.<br/><br/>My problem with them was that rather than trust his audience, sprinkle the film with nuance, and smack them with something big in the end, Shayamalan opted instead to slap his audience in the face with twists every 10 minutes or so. <br/><br/>After a while, it seemed to me that Shayamalan's flair for incorporating the terrors of everyday people with frighteningly possible results has been lost to an overwhelming desire on his part to ensure that everyone understands what he's saying. ""The world is full of crime! It's bad!"" We got it with the SUBTLE hinting before you smashed us over the head with it.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was an awkward and forced attempt at creating a thriller with a worldly message that ultimately failed. Though there were some nice elements to the movie (the story between Ivy and Lucius is interesting, and there are a few good scares), I was sorely disappointed by the lack of tact and regard for the audience on the part of the director."

The twists were interesting but not as well done as his other movies. The dialogue was also very trying.

","this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie there is no other way of describing it, a word to the wise is to not watch this movie without seeing at least one of this odd mans works.<br/><br/>The village is about a town quarantined from the rest of the world due to various reasons that the elders share with the young inhabitants of the village. Everyone has taken a sacred oath not to leave the village because the outside world is not the place to be and if you do leave the village you may come across the creatures that lurk in the surrounding forest. The creatures have had a truce with the villagers and neither steps on the others land but something is about to change.....<br/><br/>The story telling is creative, fun, thrilling and keeps you interested but the dialogue is just annoying, it attempts to be the English language of the late 1800's and it did not make much sense. Also sometimes the story leaves you sitting there wondering what the hell is going on and keeps in you in that state of mind for too long, which is a problem because it can lose you.<br/><br/>If you have patience and are a fan of M.

","I read some of the reviews people have posted and I am surprised. It amazes me how shallow some of these reviews are. You cannot say that a movie was bad simply because the twist was predictable or because it was not as good as a previous movie from the same director/writer. I think The Village was a fairly good movie and I know that because I saw it this morning and now, late at night, I still have it in my head and I am thinking about it. I think the story is solid, the acting is very good, and the twist is fairly decent. But the movie is much deeper than that. Without giving out much I will say that it analyzes the power of suggestion, organized religion, fear as a way to control people, and our society in general. All of these themes are much deeper than just a ""cool twist""."

","This is not a great film, it may very well be Shymalan's worst, but I can not believe the way it is being savaged both by posters here and, apparently, by the majority of critics. The film is technically solid; the photography stood out for me especially. I thought the cast was very good all around and Ms. Howard was excellent. The film's weakness is the script, which takes a 60 minute concept and stretches it for 2 hours. In the hands of a lesser director this could have made for an extremely tedious film (i.e. ""Identity""). ""The Village"" had enough going for it to keep me from getting annoyed, though my attention may have lagged in parts. It seems to me that Shymalan is held to a higher standard. If this had been a film by a first time director, I think reaction would have been largely positive. One caveat: this is definitely not a horror film, despite the marketing campaign. Anyone who goes in expecting that will be disappointed."

And no, it's not that I'm too dense to understand that the movie is an allegory about how people are able to manipulate others through fear--I get that. See, the problem is not the concept, it's the execution.<br/><br/>First of all, Shyamalan seems to have forgotten the simplest rule when it comes to creative writing: Show, Don't Tell. This rule is simply broken throughout the movie. Revelations that should have been shown are simply recited by the actors in the movie.<br/><br/>In addition to that, his decision to give us an early glimpse of one of the creatures completely backfires. Why? Because what we see is laughable. Moreover, all three twists are revealed in such a way that they deflate whatever little tension remained. As a result, the movie is extremely boring.<br/><br/>Is there anything worthy in this mess? Sure, the acting is solid all around, especially that of Howard, and the direction shows some of the brilliance that MNS has shown in the past.

","I was excited to see ""The Village"" and attended the first showing at my local theater ... and I was NOT disappointed that I set the alarm!! I am not normally a ""period"" film fan, but this one was fine since it wasn't 'overdone'. I enjoyed seeing Ron Howard's daughter in her first starring role. I was not too impressed at first, but her performance really grew on me and I left the film a fan! Her character was not an easy one to make believable, but she did it! Phoenix was dreamy, as usual, and mastered his character. I was looking forward to the plot twists we have all come to expect and enjoy from M.Night, and he certainly did not fail to deliver! The tension builds many times during the film and during some intense moments I wondered about my blood pressure! (Kudos to the teenager sitting one seat away for not commenting on my repeatedly squirming and gasping!) I really liked the Broady character and thought it really helped to 'round out' the feeling of a real village lifestyle. While I thought I had the final twist figured out about 2/3's of the way through (and I did) I didn't mind a bit. In fact, it added to the suspense for me waiting to see what happened AND if I was right! In fact that twist MADE the movie for me! I was also pleased that the movie was not ALL spooky things and breath holding. I thought the interactions of the elders with each other and the other 'villagers' was very interesting. It wasn't long until I was just as interested in what was going to happen next with the village people (in the movie, not the rock group!) as I was about the forest creatures! Even an interesting love story between 2 actors who made it work. In this day and age I found some of the formality of the period refreshing ... again because it wasn't over done. I gave this film a 9 out of 10. I thought it gave me what I came to see ... interesting characters that I cared about, mysterious goings on, tension in just the right amounts and times to be the most effective, cool twists and just a few really spooky parts! So break out the popcorn money and head out to see a great movie that will give you just the boost you need, as we begin the end of the summer blahs!!"

It is to be enjoyed as an experience, not as a way to kill 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon. People looking for an action movie will be better suited elsewhere.<br/><br/>The movie has the feel of a Twilight Zone or an Outer Limits. M. Night's writing style is distinctive once again. The beauty of his characters is that they are normal people. M. Night's characters are never super smart, or verbose.

His talent is truly breathtaking and it adds light years to the movie.<br/><br/>Worth seeing for the true M. Night fan or anyone who appreciates direction, cinematography, score, or strong acting.

Not to spill the ending but, coming from the state that hosted the Amish and, at one time, the Moravians (religious societies that withdrew from the corruption of the world), you are left to wonder whether the community life created by the fear of what's outside is worth the deliberate barriers you have to erect in order to seal yourself off.

It dared to actually have a good story, convincing characters, a convincing and a sweet love, and not focus on all the scares and terror. M Night did a brave thing, and for me, it paid off. He is much more human director than a scare director, and he really showed it. People need to learn to ignore the reviews until they see the film, so they can make their OWN choices. Why do people not like this movie? Well, I guess it's not cool to like it. I guess it's cool to put M Night down for being an ambitious director who tries new things. I loved this film. The twist at the end was not supposed to SHOCK you...or leave you in AWE. It was supposed to point out how the worlds innocence was slowly leaving, and these characters couldn't take it anymore.I thought it was very very clever how he incorporated scares and monsters, without having REAL monsters. His shocks were not all involving the monsters, or whatever...He used peoples emotions instead of fears to shock them. And that was a smart, wonderful move.

","For those who say boo, I have to disagree ...<br/><br/>First the suspense in this movie is tremendous. An ambiance of fear and tension is created leading the audience in a big stress mood. Moreover the actors are very convincing, and realistic.<br/><br/>On the other hand, th plot is very clever and unexpected. Noone can honestly say, (like for Sixth Sanse) I knew it was going to end like this. And then when you have a look back on the whole story, everything becomes clear and logical.<br/><br/>M.

","Last summer there was the Matrix Reloaded, amazing trailer, terribly stupid <br/><br/>movie. This summer The Village, outstanding trailer, worst movie I have seen all summer.<br/><br/>This thing reminded me of a serious case of blue balls, you take so much time thinking about how great the experience will be, then the time comes, the girl starts in on you, teasing you slowly, slowly, slowly, then its almost as though your roommate walks into the room, or in this case the director smacks you in the balls giggles and prances off into the forest while draped in a red hood. <br/><br/>SPOILERS. Yes a red hooded trickster is all we are treated to here, and the only logical direction is to just make the entire ending into as Hurt's character so eloquently puts it, ""a farce"". So after we find out that the assailant is no more than a retarded piano playing holocaust surviver. We are treated to an insanely uninteresting chase through the woods involving a porcupine a blind girl, and a hole . Weird, slightly off topic someone just text messaged my girl friend saying ""she never told us what his color was"" i think that was from the movie regarding Joaquin Pheonix's aura which Ivy could see. Anyways. With all of the<br/><br/>revelations that come at the end of the movie, all we are left with is a cool idea pulled off poorly and a movie with no replay value what-so-ever. Because what made the sixth sense so great was that the twist gave a new point of view for the movie and doesn't lessen the impact of the events prier to the twist. In the<br/><br/>Village the twist defeats any and all reason to watch it again, the suspense is now dead, seeing as how there was never anything to be scared of. Also the<br/><br/>lack of any real lead was evident, I figured Joaquin would take the lead but he is only in about 20 minutes total, and the others merely support, and the blind girl feels like a support with too big of a role. Overall I understand Night's intentions in giving us a massive twist ending but what he did was lose his touch, and<br/><br/>destroy the replay value. 5/10 - you can't deny that he does have a good idea on his hands but if he could go back and re shoot this misguided lunk of<br/><br/>wood nymph turd, he could possibly make this worth viewing.

I would like to say 'Well done', to all the actors, especially Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard. I do understand why some moviegoers were disappointed with the film. I believe that the trailers of the movie set it up mainly as a HORROR film, when i believe it was mainly a drama/thriller. I did however think the movie was creepy and I jumped a couple of times.

Who knew he could do something different? There is no plot twist at the end, as is characteristic of Shyamalan's movies. The twist, in fact, comes in the middle (for those who haven't figured it out by then). <br/><br/>In fact, the director plays with his more loyal fans throughout the movie, leaving them clues reminiscent of past films that ultimately go nowhere. In the meantime, he slowly reveals the details and history of the mysterious village in the woods... which is what the movie is all about. All the while, the movie reflects on the problems of evil and pain, and the power of belief. <br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, the sets are fantastic, and the plot is good for those who aren't expecting ""The Seventh Sense."""

"jfdelgadoinsc","Null","0","0","1 August 2004"," Village Idiocy--Spoilers
","""The Village"" is the story of a small community established by big-city escapees beyond a forest inhabited by evil creatures. The village elders have taken an oath never to return to ""the towns,"" ruled by evil ostensibly worse than the dangers posed by the bloody-thirsty forest creatures.<br/><br/>Edward Walker (William Hurt) leads the community and looks after his wife and two daughters, one of whom is blind. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is the village's dreamer, an inexplicably reserved young man intent on some day walking through the woods and whose heart pines in reticent silence for Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), Edward Walker's blind daughter. The conflict is triggered by the feelings that Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) holds for Ivy. Noah, however, is the village's ""emotionally challenged"" character (okay, he is the village idiot), whose feelings Ivy would never reciprocate. When a marriage is arranged between Ivy and Lucius, Noah's jealousy precipitates a tragedy unlike any experienced previously in the village. The situation requires someone from the village to travel to ""the towns"" through the creature-infested forest.<br/><br/>The film's trailer builds up to a jolt, but the film delivers only a light zap from a defective hand-held prank buzzer. If the dark, drab tones in which the film was shot do not bore you enough, there's plenty of bad dialogue to make you groan yourself out of shyamalanesque stupor.<br/><br/>The film's narrative could very well be a metaphor for the madness of our time. The villagers live in isolation, afraid of what lies beyond the village's boundaries, ominously marked by posts whose eerie lanterns shine at night like motionless, gigantic fireflies to remind villagers where they must not trespass. The original settlers had hoped to escape the dangerous city and instead breed an artificial peace constantly shaken by the possibility of attack from the unknown. The creatures will not attack them as long as the villagers remain within the circle of torches lit on the outskirts of the village. The color red is forbidden, as it attracts the creatures: when a red wild flower blooms, one of the girls in the village quickly pulls it from the ground and buries it.<br/><br/>Had Mr. Shyamalan taken a stand or attempted to make a narrative point, ""The Village"" could have been more subtly and subvertly political than the overtly biased un-make of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Alas, Mr. Shyamalan shuns the possibility of making a statement by hiding behind where the wild things are.<br/><br/>All of it prompts us to ask ourselves whether Mr. Shyamalan wants us to question the wisdom of creating superficial tranquility on the basis of a constant fear of what lurks on the other side. The answer is disappointing, as is the entire film. At the end, when villagers must decide whether to stay as they are or return to their origin, the answer is purportedly ambivalent, as if Mr. Shyalaman wanted an open ending. Not so, sadly. The decision had been taken already when the solution to the tragedy is to have one of the villagers cross the forest in search of assistance, instead of taking a dying man back to a hospital where his life-threatening infection could be treated. <br/><br/>Therefore, while Mr. Shyamalan poses the moral dilemma of the sad consequences of choosing an uneasy, false peace, he opts for the most contradictory solution: it is best to continue to live in inauthenticity instead of facing our own demons. <br/><br/>In this movie some will see subtlety, nuance, discretion; others, like me, will see boredom with a twisted New Age dose of Deepak Chopra masquerading as depth. Only a score jointly composed by John Tesh and Samfir would have made this movie worse.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most absurd character of all is Noah's, aptly and wastefully played by Adrian Brody. His mental insufficiency keeps him from performing as the rest of the sedate villagers, laughing at inappropriate moments and pursuing childish pranks, yet when he is locked up he ingeniously knows exactly what to do to free himself and even carry out a ruse that none of the presumably more intelligent villagers could have even considered.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are brooding, dull entities that crawl across the screen and deliver lines with the celerity and vibrancy of frozen tar. Sigourney Weaver was never less convincing; Brendan Gleeson, who oozed poisoned energy as Menelaus in ""Troy,"" is the embodiment of diffidence.<br/><br/>A most distressing aspect of this atrocity is the paucity of viable patches to cover the plot's gaping holes. If the forest surrounding the village is inhabited by vile creatures who can only be placated by an offering of skinned animals, how did the settlers initially reach the spot where they established the village? Did they drop in with parachutes? While the blind girl is used as the metaphor for the village elder's intellectual blindness, representing the true seer among them, why must she be chosen to cross the forest instead of used to ""open the eyes"" of the rest of the community? When she finds out the truth about the creatures, why does she not suggest that the village elders drop all pretense and go get help to save a dying young man?<br/><br/>Can the other side be so bad when the emissary is able to return unharmed to the village from a foray into ""the towns""? Where are all the evil people of ""the towns"" when the solution to the pressing problem is provided by a kind-hearted person who steals so that the villager can have what the dying man needs back home?<br/><br/>Perhaps you will see this movie and not see discrepancies, distractions, contradictions, bad acting and worse dialogue; you may even think it the most enlightening film of the year, if not the decade. If you do, I suggest you see more than one film a year."

","Did Noah know what was going on? He had no fear of the woods, in spite of the terror of everyone around him, and I don't think that can be explained away by mental retardation alone. Even a mentally handicapped child can and will experience fear when it's appropriate, and it's fairly reasonable to assume that if Noah had the mental capacity to understand Ivy's engagement to Lucius and its effect on him, he could understand being afraid of the creatures in the woods. Also, the elders spent so much time and energy instilling fear of the woods in all their children, which meant that Noah should have been hearing the same warnings from his own parents from day one. I'm sure they would have had at least some effect. But Noah remained unafraid of the woods, and deemed the frightening noises issuing from them as no more than a reason to laugh. <br/><br/>As for his finding the suit, it seemed a little too contrived to me that, while locked in the choir room, he would have suddenly been inspired to pull up the floorboards in only the spot where the suit was kept, unless he knew it was there. Also, since I think those guttural growls and snarls the creatures made aren't really something the human voice can produce, I assumed that the suits might have included some sort of recording device that played the sounds. Which also means that Noah was able to operate them. Maybe he'd worn them before?"

As usual, an observant viewer can guess Shyamalan's tells and figure out the ""twists"" within seeing the first half of this trite piece of cinema. *Spoilers* There are quite a few noticeable plot holes including the conceptual design of ""those who shall not be named"" let alone what the idea of a truce between them would suggest. Woven cloaks are not exactly prerequisite to feral carnivorous beasts. In a key scene, blood appears on a character's clothing that was not there in the previous scene. Another is the appearance of a human-made trap in the middle of supposedly deserted wood that the viewers learn is a patrolled nature preserve where there are no large animals that would be poached. <br/><br/>These holes have been written off by many a viewer by saying Shyamalan was going for a morality tale.

","It really is a shame that such a well thought out movie (especially in the world we live in today) has gone over the heads of so many people. Let's get the obvious out of the way first. M. Night is one of the most talented directors in today's film industry. His use of color and camera angles please the eye as much as his choice of music pleases the ear. I still get chills when remembering a mere chair with the woods in the background and the music that accompanied it. His building of characters is unparalleled. And his story telling via visual images is stunning. <br/><br/>Now, as for his writing...<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Many philosophers have discussed the idea of Utopia. Many writers/directors have flirted with it in their films... few with much success. M Night hit the nail on the head. Much of the world today, unfortunately, is driven by fear. A group of individuals all sharing a tragic common thread create an isolated society, which they can control through fear. This has been M Night's most realistic movie. There were no dead people walking amongst us, there were no super heroes, there were no aliens. There were merely people seeking a better life. Since the beginning of recorded civilization the most efficient way of controlling a population is through fear. You think his use of color was irrelevant? You think his story was far fetched?

","Of all the comments I have read here, everyone seems to be overlooking the biggest twist of all: the entire movie. It seems to me that Shyamalan wishes to not be marked a one trick pony, so the twist here is that he didn't make another sci-fi movie. You thought he was going to, but he didn't. No ghosts, superheroes, or aliens. Just lies. The movie is advertised as another M. Night creepy suspense movie, but in the end it isn't. It starts out with this premise and keeps with it for quite some time then all of a sudden it shifts gears. I can see why he would do such a thing, and I can see how this could be quite effective with regards to his position in film-making. ""It wasn't what I expected, but I liked it anyway"" is what people would say. Only they didn't. Unfortunately, the only director that could have really pulled off such a trick is Hitchcock. He was a master of manipulation even before you got to the theater. Hitchcock was the only director that could have pulled off something so grand as the movie itself being the twist, but then again, Hitchcock knew what it was he did best, and he never strayed from that. I think perhaps Night should take a cue from his idol and do the same. What started out as a novel idea became, in the end, a rather boring movie devoid of any real suspense or entertainment. 2 out of 5."

","""The Village"" was AWESOME. Saw it opening day (yesterday night) and I was blown away by Shyamalan's work.

Part of me was like, wait, this sounds too modern haha. But I didn't put the pieces together of course, so it was great. That was a nice effect when Shyamalan was reading the paper in the Reserve office (for those who didn't realize it, you can see Shyamalan's reflection on the glass door of the medicine case), and the paper was dated July 30, 2004-the movie's release date.

Also, there were holes in how the twigs snapped and whatnot when no1 was there and no1 was moving. I tried to be entertained by this movie but after all the plot twists, there was nothing that couldve salvaged the movie. The ending was also completely horrible. They shouldve ended it with letting everyone in on the secret and letting them decide for themselves if they wanted to be isolated.

","This is not your typical summer thriller. You have to go into this film with an open mind, because it may shake your willing suspension of disbelief at the end. I think those viewers who did not like the film are those who felt they were lead astray by the trailers. They may also include those who aren't really fans of M. Night Shyamalan's previous works. The more I see of him, the more I feel that he's filling the role of a modern day Hitchcock. In his latest installment, viewers should be reminded that the lack of emotional message or moral would be uncharacteristic of his style. Going into The Village and thinking there will not be a greater lesson learned is the equivalent of sticking your head in the sand that is summer film fluff. That said, I believe the storyline of this film is of high quality. However, if you're looking to be spoonfed a scary time chock o' block full of bloody limbs and people hiding in shadows, this may not be the show for you.<br/><br/>Having said that, I think that Shyamalan made some excellent casting choices here. He gave the supporting roles to the usual headliners, and in doing so gave some of the younger stars a chance to shine. The sadly underestimated Joaquin Phoenix has an amazing gift for subtlety that is not often seen in such a young actor. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy) is a great find, and I think she will be a refreshing and welcome addition to the young 20s female actress group we see now (who, though very pretty and all, are sadly lacking in character interpretation skills). <br/><br/>Finally, kudos to costume designer Ann Roth! Can anyone say Oscar nomination? Her color concepts (and yes, there's more happening there than the obvious: red is for baddies) and attention to detail are superb. <br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie to adults (and possibly more mature teens) who are prepared to think during a summer film.

It was worth it even though I had some suspicions of the twists, it still was very well done. I love how M. Knight's movies make you go back and reflect over everything that happened once the twists are revealed. I also like how this move makes me ponder if the creation of a society like this is actually plausible. However, in doing this, i've become stuck on one point: Is the village only made up of the elders and their children/grandchildren? Didn't the population seem a bit large if that was the case? And if, in fact the village is composed only of the elders and their offspring, I don't think it would take very many generations before relationships started to become incestuous. I didn't use a mathematical formula or anything, but I did draw myself a little diagram. Try it. You'll see that it doesn't take long before everyone starts to be related, unless they used very careful planning and began to arrange marriages. Even then, eventually everyone would at least become distant relatives. Soon you would have a bunch of inbred village idiots running around in monster suits. Hmmm... that might make an interesting sequel. Teen agers from the outside world start urban legends about the creatures in the wildlife reserve (kind of like the melon heads) and they would dare each other to climb the wall... OK I'm getting carried away. Maybe there were more elders they didn't show. Maybe that initial group of people got some of their friends to come along and join them. Maybe they put an ad in the paper- "" WANTED: SW M/F, non-violent, to take part in secret experimental 19th century society. Fertile (attractive)child-bearing age women encouraged to apply.""

"bottlerocket91","Null","0","0","30 July 2004"," What is really going on *Spoiler*
","I don't agree with all the 9/11 theories and ties to this movie. I think Night kept this very simple. The photograph in the lockbox gives away that a group of people from a counseling center founded ""the village"" on wildlife reserve property purchased by a billionaire. Each of the ""elders"" went through grief counseling in the 1970's or so, and each had a traumatic story from their past to tell. A university professor poses the idea to the rest (all of whom are grieving some loss) that it would be possible to escape society and its violence and live in a time when things were much more simple. Hence, the village is created. How can you attack a plot like this? Night, you are a genius.<br/><br/>However, I think it is not coincidence that Lucius is the fearless skeptic of the group. He is a baby in the picture outside the counseling center, meaning he moved to the community, whereas all other youngsters were first generation villagers. Perhaps experience in the real world was held in his infant sub-conscious which motivated him to challenge the village and its rules. <br/><br/>So what is the message? Violence is innate and inescapable?? So much for world peace."

","Apparently a lot of high expectations for this film got squashed. After reading some of these reviews I was surprised so many disliked the film. I'm a fan of M. Night's and while 'The Village' didn't measure up to his previous three genre pics, I think this is a worthy film.<br/><br/>The biggest recommendation I can give for this film is to walk in and suspend your disbelief, become one of the villagers and enjoy the film! It sounds like too many people are trying to out-guess the plot or predict the twist -- just let it go, there's no need to intellectualize entertainment. The movie deals well with fears as a theme and where/how they become seeded in the collective mind. Also a nice little love story here to keep things sweet. The monsters are cool looking to boot! <br/><br/>Have fun M. Night fans!"
"kmdkixass","Null","0","0","30 July 2004"," SPOILER: The Id we don't speak of
","M. Night Shyamalan's newest picture is symbolic of our society in many ways. In Covington there is a very strict sense of rules, ediquite and approval. As you will see in the film, purity and morality are conveyed through every interaction that takes place. We see that there is no place for man's most primal urges ""the Id"" within the town. Conformity is needed for Covington to function.<br/><br/>Throughout literature, the woods has represented the inner most cavities of man. That is the deep, unseen wants, thoughts, and desires. The ""creatures"" in the forbidden woods represent these repressed tendencies, which have been abandoned. Societies usually do abandon those who give in to their primal instincts. This primal nature of the Id may be why the ""creatures"" are portrayed as animal like. Adrian Brody's character dwells in the woods on various occasions, we see that his mental capacity prevents him from suppressing his primal desires, this is seen in numerous instances. When he escapes from his holding, his mother refers to him as an animal because the Id is all that guides him.<br/><br/>In the end there are no creatures, the whole idea was simply a hokes to promote conformity. Throughout our lives we are confronted with millions of symbols a day, from cereal boxes to body piercings. Each symbol sends a distinct message,which society assigns meaning to. In Covington, red is bad, we see these ominous woods and skinned goats and creature costumes, promoting a sense of fear. Society tells us to fear those who are different or those creatures dwelling in the woods. <br/><br/>If anyone has any comments on my thoughts, please respond."

Was it mentioned?<br/><br/>One a sidenote, I like the way Shyamalan sets up the premise as classic Gothic story and veers it towards a re-reading of the ""Plato's Cave"" (those who see shadows on the wall believe that the shadows only exist and that they are real!).<br/><br/>But I don't like the way the movie is being marketed and advertised... very falsely -- more false than the farce of the premise. Disney is promoting this as first and foremost a M. Night Shyamalan flick with an eerie and scary premise. Wrong. Expectations are bound to be crushed and over-hype is inevitable. The Sixth Sense is like a ghost that will constantly challenge and haunt M. Night -- will he ever live up to that expectation?

"OneWayFilms2000","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," My full Review WITHOUT SPOILERS
","I figured if I wanted to really experience this film the way it is SUPPOSE to be experienced...I better see it quick, before the secrets are revealed and talked about among my friends. So, I chose the first night to check out this new installment from suspense master, M. Knight Shyamalan, who in my book, is a modern day mixture of Alfred Hitchcoc k and Stephen King.<br/><br/>After having seen THE SIXTH Sense, UNBREAKABLE, & SIGNS, I am warming up to Shyamalan's style of telling fantasical tales and saving huge revelations till the very end. This one is no exception. I wont be giving away any secrets in this review, so don't worry, you are safe.<br/><br/>There isn't much told about this film before going in, except Covington Pennsylvania is a nice quiet town surrounded by a beautiful forest where strange, and frightening creatures live. The people of Covington have a small, yet essential agreement with these creatures. Do not to come to our village, we will not come to your woods. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>These creatures in THE VILLAGE are only a subplot to another story being told, much like the aliens in SIGNS were only a subplot to the real story about a man having a crisis with his faith in God. The real story in THE VILLAGE is a love story; warm, tender, and innocent. A love story that brings danger and opens the door to the entire town facing it's worst fears.<br/><br/>There are some similarities between THE VILLAGE and SIGNS, in that, there are elements of surprise in revealing the creatures and the part they play in the story. A few good jump scenes mixed in with some mystery about the creatures will bring back memories of the aliens attacking the house in SIGNS. But beyond that, the similarities end.<br/><br/>Does Shyamalan tell a spiritual story? Can God be found in THE VILLAGE like he can in SIGNS? No. Don't expect another Sunday School lesson. But one thing that I was pleased to find, was that this is perhaps the CLEANEST film of the summer. I cannot recall a single offensive word, and there is NO nudity, sexual matters, or even off-color jokes to be concerned with. The only justification of the PG-13 rating is for the level of suspense, a few frightening scenes. This one is safe, even for grandma, providing she's got a pretty good heart. <br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix returns in his second Shyamalan film, and does a wonderful job as Lucius Hunt, the towns bravest soul who is willing to face his fears and risk it all to help others. His strongest points in THE VILLAGE is his ability to react to the other characters, as his own is often quiet and shy. But when he DOES speak, his words carry weight, even if it's delivered in the most humble and meekest way.<br/><br/>Bryce Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) makes a surprising debut in the role of Ivy Walker, a blind girl who falls in love with Lucius. Her love for him is tested as she is forced to put her fears aside and go where no one has gone before. <br/><br/>M. Knight Shyamalan has a wonderful way of building characters and a story and lead you right where he wants you, BUT does THE VILLAGE live up to Shyamalan's previous work? Do the revelations give you a worthy element of surprise?<br/><br/>I was not disappointed with his story. But I WAS disappointed in the fact that I was able to figure out the towns secret before the big revelation. I leaned over and told my wife what I THOUGHT was happening and it turned out...I was right.<br/><br/>But wait...there are TWO secrets to be revealed in THE VILLAGE, and I was VERY disappointed in the revelation of the other secret that COULD have been corrected by proper editing and a change in the order of scenes towards the end. How can I say this without giving anything away? Simple.<br/><br/>There are two scenes in the film towards the end...one with the purpose to place you on the edge of your seat, much like the nail-biting climax in SIGNS. And the other....to explain one of the BIGGEST secrets in the film.<br/><br/>Well, they explained the big secret BEFORE the most frightening scene in the film, which in my opinion...RUINED the element of SHOCK AND FEAR that he was going for. Shyamalan COULD have had me squirming on the edge of my seat in nervous fear during the big climax (which is what I was hoping for), and THEN exposed the secret, which would have made me go ""OMG, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.""<br/><br/>Instead, he gives the secret away TOO SOON and it actually RUINED it for me. Even my wife who normally believes that Hollywood NEVER makes a mistake, admitted that they should have waited another 10 minutes before revealing the BIG ONE.<br/><br/>Did it ruin the whole movie? No, the story is still well told, and enjoyable. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good suspenseful tale, but warn...don't expect to be scared too much, and don't be afraid to let Shyamalan take you on this journey, because he will WARN you with the truth before it gets too bad. <br/><br/>My grade: B+ Great attempt...almost had me."

The Village is NOT a horror movie or anything close to that.  The studio must have realised that had they advertised the movie for what it really was....pretentious, rambling, disjointed nonsense....no one would have wanted to see it.  Who would spend $10.50 a seat to see a drawn out Twilight Zone episode about an Amish-like village of reclusive pilgrims (very reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie) surrounded by a forest inhabited by *imagined* boogeymen all in the middle of Pennsylvania (of all places). NOT !<br/><br/>One must admit that the obvious premise of this film (which is revealed in the *twist* in the last 30 minutes) might have been turned into a classic film had it been done by a master writer and director the likes of Steven King and the late Stanley Kubrick (The Shining).

","Part 1:  Night's 4th film was probably his worst, but still an above average movie. First off all, the acting. The large cast was great, usually Night works with small cast. This time he has more people to direct. Good acting all across the board. His camera work was phenomenal. His trademark still shots, camera's do not move often in some shots, awkward angles, signature reflection off glass shots, remember young Samuel Jackson staring at a TV in Unbreakable? Or the Alien popping up on the Tv in signs? Shyamalan makes a brief appearance in this one too, except he is the one shown in the glass this time. I love how he uses that red color in most of his films. Notabably in the sixth sense. <br/><br/>Part 2:  This movie was suspensful of course. Not like Signs but a little more realistic and predictable. I predicted the surprise ending after 1 hour into viewing the film, and also predicted The sixth sense also. Unbreakable was Night's only film that shocked me in the end. Signs was a message movie, and more thought provoking. The funny thing is , I predicted the end of this movie but it was almost as if Night added something more suspenseful in this movie just incase the audience caught on. Not up to par with his previous films, but still an outstanding script, concept, and creation of suspense. An amazing filmmaker!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","6 August 2004"," Director Shyamalan's right choice (Spoiler  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE VILLAGE)
","Spoiler  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE VILLAGE <br/><br/>It hadn't occurred to me before seeing the movie how significant the title is. `The village' (or the retreat, the paradise, whatever you call it) is really all the movie is about. While there are many characters in the movie, it's the Village that is the real star.<br/><br/>Whether apparent or real, the twist is the main selling point of the movie. Any yet, in this department, The Village is very different from any of director Shyamalan's previous movies, which had either supernatural or extraterrestrial elements. In this one, the twist involves perfectly normal human activities.  <br/><br/>Quite a few people find the twist unsatisfying, and other offer explanations and analysis of why it is so. My view is that Sixth Sense is unique, and there is no point comparing The Village, or any other of director MNS's movies, to Sixth Sense. If we really think back, we DIDN'T EXPECT a twist in Sixth Sense. That is why the shock was so traumatic. Since then, with every MNS we movie EXPECT a twist. That's the difference.<br/><br/>In The Village, I see MNS playing god on two levels. First of all the director almost invariably plays god. In addition, he is also playing a character in the movie that plays god, and here I must explain a theory that is different from what many others proffer. In playing his Hitchcock-like cameo role at the end as the guy in charge of the reserve, he is actually overseeing the security, and in turn the very viability, of the village (e.g. ensuring that no airplanes fly overhead, telling the young guard not to talk too much with the girl). I know that convention wisdom has it that he is bribed, but I like to picture him as one of them, the one who has taken up the post in the `outside world' (whether volunteered or by drawing lots) so that the secret existence of The Village is ensured. A more romantic proposition, isn't it? <br/><br/>The meticulous care and attention to details is there. A good example is how Ivy, by recognizing (by touch) the strangely shaped tree trunk stub, is able to lead `the creature' into falling to his death.<br/><br/>The script surely has plot holes, but the concept is noble. The cast is excellent. Joaquin Phoenix, who played such a flamboyant rascal in Buffalo Soldiers, shows his versatility here by playing the introvert Lucius. Bryce Dallas Howard has general consensus as a bright new star. Not much need be said about the solid supporting cast of William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>Director Shyamalan had made the right choice of gradually steering away from the twist-heavy approach to offer more on characters and story."
"lochnessmummy","4","0","0","1 August 2004"," Once again, this is not a horror movie, it's a philosophy movie
","M. Night Shyamalan's major films are unique, (perhaps not so unique) in that Hollywood keeps marketing them as horror films when they are not.  The Village continues that pattern with a period piece along the lines of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.<br/><br/>If this film doesn't put you to sleep, it will annoy the heck out of you with it's inane ""secrets.""  It touches on some intriguing ideas but never resolves them, and it threatens to scare you but never does.  The only dope in the whole village who does anything is the character of Lucius, and he's a non-participant for the second half of the film.  What a waste.<br/><br/>One thing that must be stated:  Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was heartbreakingly wonderful.  I was almost crying for her character at the end.  I would've rated this film with a 1 out of 10, but because of her I put it four points higher."

Night's films have progressively gotten worse from Sixth Sense. It's too bad, because I think he tries hard. I really didn't care about any of the characters in The Village, because for the most part they weren't three dimensional. It's telling when the credits roll and a group of people walk past you, saying ""Man that sucked."" I don't completely concur, but I'm certainly not going to rate this film over 5 out of 10."

","(Keep in mind I am a HUGE M.KNight fan...)<br/><br/>I really think his work is brilliant. This film really reminds me of something that a 15 year old film kid would make with his friends if he was given a large budget and good actors. I say this as a very big compliment- it's a film that makes your heart race with the addition of some cheesy parts that scare you quickly and then make you laugh at yourself for being so scared. This combo makes going to the film extremely fun.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is not even what goes on during the film. It's what people are saying afterward. Everyone asks ""what is it about?"" and you can't say anything because it will give it all away. You can barely answer ANY questions about it because every question leads to comething else. People who have seen it feel as though they know and have seen something no one else has and it just makes you HAVE to go see it.<br/><br/>One element that makes his work so different is that he barely uses music. When most movies use music over every dialogue, this film uses silence to convey seriousness and to give an eerie and subtle hint of something terrible brewing.<br/><br/>I might be in the minority here but this film was awesome in so many ways. The actors in this film were absolutely fabulous and his character development is really great. There is something special and noticible about every one of his characters. The story might have been simple is something the audience will think aobut much longer after the final credits. I kept thinking about the concept of this movie and wondering ""what if....""

","The Village is by far the weakest of M. Night's last four films... but even with that, his latest tale is an engrossing, well acted picture.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a twist and no it is not that good of one, but to me, basing the whole film on the twist is a crime.  <br/><br/>This time M creates a LOVE STORY.  While love has been at the root of his previous four flicks as well, this understated romance is far more moving than it's predecessors.  Joaquin Phoenix, as the stoic Lucius Hunt and new comer Bryce Dallas Howard as the breathtaking Ivy Walker create such a powerful bond of young love that this movie becomes a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Add in the other great performances, the BEAUTIFUL camera work, some political questions and a few (and i do mean few) scares and you've got a movie that is far better than most.  So no, the village is not as good as i would have hoped... but it's still pretty damn good.<br/><br/>(for anyone who remembers the scene in Last of the Mohicans when the younger sister jumps off the cliff... it's that kind of love.

","I kept wanting to like this movie more than I did.  The problem, in my view, is the ""twist.""  Because Shyamalan is so known for surprise endings, it seems that he caves into the pressure to have one.  I won't reveal it here, though I think it is what does the film in.  Rather than have the ""big surprise"" (which I DID figure out--and I'm no supergenius) at the end, I found myself much more interested in that backstory.  How much better the film would be if the ""twist"" were actually the beginning of the movie, and not a surprise at all.  One is given only the surprise; what one needs is all the information to let you in on ALL the implications of that surprise. I saw the movie this morning and keep filling in all the blanks myself. Because what is quickly glossed over is actually a compelling story full of sacrifice, hard work, and guilt.  Now, THAT movie I would line up to see--without a surprise in view. Having said all this--and it probably makes no sense unless you have seen the film--I will add that Shyamalan remains a superb technician:  there are individual shots and sometimes entire scenes of such evocative beauty that I found myself holding my breath.  Specifically, the scene of Ivy standing in the doorway, with her hand held out, waiting--that was tense and lovely. And the long, static shot of Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard sitting on the porch and talking in profile was just gorgeous--it was also the best-acted sequence in the movie not involving Sigourney Weaver (who gives the single best performance in the film--maybe her best ever). The Village could have been astounding, had Shyamalan not felt it so necessary to tweak us.  Without relying on a big shock, he could have filled this film full-to-bursting with prodigious emotion."

A really strong cast but no meat in any of the roles except for Hurt and Howard. Bryce Howard has inherited her father's disturbed apple pie face and some of his talent.

"Pavel-8","7","0","0","1 August 2004"," Good Night, but not great.
","M. Night Shyamalan has directed himself into a quandary. His first three mainstream films were all widely viewed and somewhat similar. Therefore, fair or not, he is pigeon-holed as a creator of a certain genre of film, specifically deliberately-paced, suspense-filled movies with twists in the closing moments. To his credit however, now that he has finished his first trilogy of films, he is moving on. Not out of his cinematic country, but at least into a different...er...""Village"". <br/><br/>His latest work tells the story of a small community of people living in 1800s-era America. The villagers reside in a valley surrounded by a forest, where mysterious and dangerous creatures make their homes. The two species have reached a truce; the humans stay in the valley, and the animals remain in the woods. Violate those rules, and who knows what trouble may ensue. Once the worlds are established, certain situations potentially require help from the town beyond, which forces the humans to face their fear of the forest. <br/><br/>Although most don't realize this, Shyamalan shied away from the surprise endings of ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"" when he forged ""Signs"", choosing instead to make revelations in the closing minutes. ""The Village"" is the next progression, in which Shyamalan spreads the revelations throughout the film. A handful of such plot turns exist, some of which can be guessed, some of which can not. In the hands of a lesser director, that might be a problem. But Shyamalan is such a master at creating tension that even if you determine what is coming (as I did), he still entrances, turning your knuckles white as you cling to your seat. <br/><br/>He does it using an entire arsenal of cinematic weapons. Editing (or lack thereof), acting, music, and most importantly in this film, framing. ""The Village"" does not feature as many single-take scenes as his prior work, which actually causes the present ones to shine all the more (one between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Drew Howard in particular). Scenes like this give the audience a rare chances to see actors act, instead of watching numerous takes pieced together. As a solid veteran ensemble cast and with Howard an equally competent newcomer, the actors cruise through Shyamalan's Shakespeare-esque dialogue with a natural smoothness that overrides a script that could easily have felt stilted or pretentious. <br/><br/>""The Village"" is cut more traditionally than Shyamalan's other work, but even the typical scenes, his visual flair emerges via unique angles and camera movements, complemented by James Newton Howard's music, which takes a more active role this time, eliciting jumps and nervousness as much as emphasizing them. But the framing is where Shyamalan has kicked everything up a notch. Along with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Shawshank Redemption""), he time and again positions vital information just off-screen, thickening the tension by hesitating to reveal for an extra beat. That technique also parallels his story-telling strategy; Shyamalan unveils the premise of the movie over two hours, keeping you edgily involved as the visual and narrative anxiety drives the film forward in his trademark deliberate manner. <br/><br/>The high technical achievement and solid acting cover up the weak link of ""The Village"", which is the mildly compelling script. The words themselves, although old-fashioned, fully work in the colonial-esque setting. But the story simply is not as good or engaging as his prior writing. Due in part to a lack of the spiritual overtones that haunted his first three films, this one is not as intimate or personally absorbing. Also contributing to the deficiency is the larger cast. His earlier films concentrated on a handful of people; this one encompasses a wider swath of humans. Ergo, while the same (perhaps more) emotional intimacy exists, it is spread thinner, leaving the audience groping for whom to connect with. Without those themes and communion, the minimalistic acting that Shyamalan evokes from his thespians rings a tinge hollow, occasionally leaning toward vacant rather than pensive. <br/><br/>With ""The Village"", M. Night Shyamalan falls short of the very high bar he set for himself. Of course this is comparable to the New York Yankees having a bad season because they only reached the World Series. More well done than good, it is still an above average piece of filmmaking, and like his other pictures, one that is experienced rather than simply watched.<br/><br/>
Bottom Line: A solid effort that should be experienced, but not quite up to Shyamalan's own standards. 7 of 10."

","After seeing the very good THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS, I've come to regard M. Night Shyamalan as the ""Savior of Modern Horror"". He's a brilliant director who takes the offbeat material seriously and always maintains a quality approach to his films. It turns out that THE VILLAGE is not really a bonafide ""horror film,"" though, and it's perhaps best approached with that in mind. I liken it to an overlong TWILIGHT ZONE fantasy television episode that might have been more effective at 30 minutes opposed to its 120. <br/><br/>It's beautifully shot with a wholesome feel for the 1800s, and more than a few surprises (the shocking stabbing scene comes to mind). Bryce Howard gives a good performance as the lovestruck blind girl of the story, and William Hurt is strong, too. <br/><br/>THE VILLAGE is a flawed movie that isn't on par with THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS; it's not a ""great"" film by any means, nor even a ""very good one""... but it works well as a fairytale that plays on people's fears, and I liked that about it."

","*No Spoilers*<br/><br/>Seriously, I applaud Night for making such a movie.  I went with some friends and one of us knew the ending ahead of time - he did not like the film.  I started thinking of the guts it takes to make a movie that TOTALLY hinges on the twist near or at the end.  I believe that is the reason that alot of people will not like it.  If you know the end of the movie, it ruins it.  However, I did not know the end, and I really enjoyed it.  I figured out the twists right before there were revealed, and I now realize (for myself personally) that I don't mind being able to figure out the twists of a movie.  I really loved Night's movie ""Signs"", and interestingly enough, there really wasn't a twist.  I mean, from the beginning of the movie, it looks like the visitors are aliens, and that's what they ended up being. However, in ""Sixth Sense"" there was a twist, and it was brilliant.  I am looking forward to Night's next movie, and I don't care if he decides to put a twist in it or not.  He has proven to me that he can make a movie with or without a twist.  Pretty cool. 7/10"

","M. Night Shyamalan's makes a Covington that is a 19th-century Pennsylvania village. But this isn't a regular village. It has a ""gentle understanding"" with the mystical creatures of the surrounding woods: no villager steps into the forest and the creatures stay outside the village. Things start to unfold as secrets are reviled that there is more to these creatures than meets the eye.<br/><br/> It seems everyone was expecting so much going into this film and they were letdown for whatever reason. M. Night Shyamalan had the right idea: a unique plot, a talented cast, and the right atmosphere to match the movie, but the way he developed the film wasn't done well.<br/><br/> The performance by every single cast member was really stunning. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy Walker), Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius Hunt), Adrien Brody (Noah Percy) and the rest of the cast had a great chemistry together which worked out well in the end. The chemistry between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix stood out in my mind as an overwhelming love story that worked out well in the end. This was a huge plus for the film.<br/><br/> M. Night Shyamalan did an excellent job with the environment which really gave it the perfect mood. I also give him credit for delivering a twist that I highly doubt anyone suspected. Sure, there were flaws and plot holes, but with M. Night Shyamalan's style of directing you could look past these flaws and plot holes and still get a great film of it unless you like to rip apart films, which you could do to any film.<br/><br/>In the end, M. Night Shyamalan made a film that's making people have great discussion over as far as the story and idea goes. The cast, story, environment, and even the humor mixed together to give us an enjoyable movie. It surely wasn't his best work ever, but for what it was, it was a great film, and I was satisfied with the end result.<br/><br/>Story: A+ Acting: A- Visuals: B Cinematography: B Overall: B- (Not an average)"

","This movie is awesome. It is most comparable to The Sixth Sense as opposed to Signs or Unbreakable. It's not for those who want to see lots of action: blood, gore, chase scenes, etc. It is more of a thinking movie. You need to pay attention and appreciate the details. The twist really is a twist, completely unexpected and it will leave you plastered to your seat, mouth hanging open, just waiting to see where it will lead. Brice Dallas Howard is a quality actress, something I really was not expecting. I thought it was all hype because she's Ron Howard's daughter, but her performance proved me wrong. I can understand why there is talk of the film being an Oscar contender. My prediction is Adrien Brody for Best Supporting Actor. I highly recommend you see it."

","Alright, I am an absolute horror movie nut. I have never been closer to horror heaven than when Samara crawled out of that friggin' television at the end of ""The Ring"" and I get all orgasmic every time the next scary trailer hits the theater... So I have to admit, I had high hopes for a seriously scary movie when I went to see ""The Village"" this afternoon. And granted, it wasn't the sort of scary I had my clenched fists all set for, but it was something else altogether.<br/><br/>Now, I must preface my opinion of this film by saying that I am of the opinion that M. Night Shyamalan is absolutely the Hitchcock of my generation. His films are intricately detailed and expertly set prime specimens of perfect story telling. He is a movie-making legend in his own time. And while I waded through the comments of disappointed movie-goers on my way back to the parking lot, shuffled through the befuddled faces of everyone who came to the theater just looking for a cheap thrill and scream sequence or two, I began running the movie over again in my head as I always do of Shyamalan's films, and I realized something...<br/><br/>I LOVED this movie! I could not care less how many disillusioned know-it-alls claim to have had the twist figured out a half hour into the film and that the ending was not to their liking. Blah, blah, blah... The story was unique and original and provided every twist I could hope for in a Shyamalan movie, and made quite an interesting comment on society, to boot. The cast was wonderful. I spent many dialogue sequences in the beginning of the film wondering why the language seemed so forced, and when the twist hit at the end and I understood why the banter didn't seem genuine, I was all that much more impressed with the acting and set-up! I was very impressed with the performance of Bryce Howard and am eternally grateful to Kirsten Dunst for choosing not to complete the role of Ivy...(not a big fan.)<br/><br/>So, anyway, in summary, there were some genuinely scary scenes throughout the movie, but perhaps not as scream inducing as some might expect. Go see this film in search of classic Shyamalan talent and a spooky good time and you CANNOT be let down."

","Warning: Contains SPOILER comments.<br/><br/>How you react to this movie depends on your expectations. I liked that Shyamalan does not make scaring the audience and his usual plot twists the primary theme of the movie. They are the structure he uses to get you to see it and to make other points, more sophisticated than in his previous movies. To me, this movie is about love and the quest for innocence. Can we achieve innocence when we have ""secrets""? To Shyamalan, one must be strong to be innocent.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning and fully worth your risking possible disappointment in going (remember expectations?). The other actors are only fair in their parts, but they are not parts written to shine, with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix's role. He does an excellent job portraying moral strength and trusting innocence.<br/><br/>One concern I have: I counted 11 scenes showing a very obvious boom mike. After about the 4th one, the audience laughed, breaking the suspension of disbelief. Did Shyamalan do this on purpose? If yes, it is a gimmick that smells and fails. If no, it is incredibly sloppy.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding, I give it 7 out of 10."

While this movie did provide a handful of those moments it wasn't enough to keep me satisfied. What we were expecting to be a horror story seemed to be a forced love story. It left a lot of unanswered questions. If nothing else, we were expecting big payoff at the end, the trademark for Night. To quote my boyfriend, ""You are expecting a big twist at the end, the big payoff. But when the payoff comes, its not what you expect and is a major let down.

","The Village<br/><br/>M. Night has thrilled audiences with three very solid movies in Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. As a fan of M Night, and movies in general, the line between the two when reviewing his movies is very difficult. I will do my best.<br/><br/>In spite of Ebert's recent review that trashed this movie with a 1 star rating, I had to remain open minded. The first thing is, is Ebert reviewing the movie on the basis of other Night's movies, or is he reviewing based on movies as a whole? I have never felt comparing the other works of the director is effective, but Ebert as always seemed to do this. He gave Gangs of New York a not so positive review based on the fact that it did not reach the level of Goodfellas or Raging Bull. Do you think this is how you should review a movie? Now if he did review The Village as a movie on its own merit, than he rated the movie the same as White Chicks, Catwoman, and any other ridiculous movie. Does this seem fair? Was it really that bad? I watched the movie today....<br/><br/>This is not a 1 star movie, but by no means a masterpiece. I felt the dialogue was a bit too lax and dry, and at times the movie moved really slow. It was not a long movie, yet it felt like the movie should have been cut up a bit. The cinematography was great, score was also good. But let's get a little more in depth.<br/><br/>M Night's trademark twist has now left him with a label or brand. It's unfortunate that most people now watch his movies looking for that very twist. I prefer to look at his movies with conflict and swift climatic resolution. I believe that is true story telling and film making. In the Village, the resolution is visionary again, however I felt the execution was a bit off the mark. The audience was able to guess, or infer the end before the end. This wasn't a terrible thing; it was still fun to watch how it played out. I just think in this movie, they really could have gone with a planet of the apes (original) type resolution. That is, a bang at the end leaving audiences breathless. To do that though, you cannot give a lot away during the movie. The urgency to progress to the secret or ending seemed evident in the acting. While Brody played his character verywell, I didn't really seem to agree of him. He felt more like a plot tool than a character. And again, the urgency in Hurt, somewhat slanted the story.<br/><br/>The movie has a short story feel to it. And that is maybe because it plays off the political foreground of today. Many connections can be made, and I will refrain from doing so for the sake of people who haven't seen it. Is it scary? The audience should jump a bit. As trademark M Night, not for what you see, but how little or what you don't see.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, with a few problems and minor holes that who knows, may be fixed on 2nd viewing. But this is by no means a disaster. It is the weakest of his four major movies I feel, but no slouch either. A mediocre M. Night movie is still better than most. The best directors always make quality movies that are never atrocious. Scorsese, Spielberg, even Mann. Is M Night equivalent to Spielberg. Not yet, of course not. But my theory is that a director has to make at least 4 really good movies to be considered legendary. It's unfortunate that I cannot consider M night in this category at this point simply because The Village is not great, it's only above average. However, I ask viewers, since when is it a sin to make only a good movie? If anything, I hope it will allow fans and audiences to realize not to label and have preconceived notions of his movies, but instead to go with no expectations except for quality. I am also glad that his next movie is a book adaptation (Life of Pi) which should broaden him as a filmmaker. It would prove his uncanny storytelling ability by directing someone elses story.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 Stars (out of 4)<br/><br/>M Nights other movies<br/><br/>Signs: 3.5 stars Unbreakable: 3.5 stars Sixth Sense: 4 stars"

","I was really wondering if M Night could deliver after watching trailer after trailer on this flick. The buildup promised something one couldn't even begin to imagine going on...and as far as I'm concerned he DELIVERED.PERIOD.<br/><br/>I think anyone who thinks otherwise really didn't get the summarize and the GOTCHA BRILLIANCE of the whole thing. I did. And I was GOT and very entertained and even til almost the end also very creeped out. Which is what i expected from M. and what I got. I'm not sure why people have such mixed reactions on this. It seems to be fifty fifty of either being very stunned and pleased at the twists and turns or being very let down as if they were expecting a different twist. In making that point, it would be very wise to go and see the movie just to find out which side of the fence you'll end up on for yourself rather then trusting someone else's take to do that for you."

","The movie got terrible reviews, but I think that everyone (as has happened with his last three movies) really misses the point. I'll say this right now, if you're going in order to see a really scary movie, this isn't the one to see. But, if you want to see the genius of M. Night Shyamalan, then this is a must. The acting was excellent, as you'd expect from a cast of Phoenix, Brody, Hurt, and Weaver, the dialogue, though sometimes a little slow, makes plenty of sense when you see the whole thing, and the twist at the end will blow you away if you're not too disappointed about it not being scary enough.

I was generous and gave it a 7/10, mainly because of the superb acting and the aforementioned great moments.

","For those who attend Shyamalan films waiting to be wrenched around by the twist-as-closure, I anticipate disappointment. Although I quite liked the film, I enjoyed it more for its architecture than for the final reversal.<br/><br/>Like most Shyamalan films, the narrative sequencing is crafty and sharp. The use of voice-over becomes a bit intrusive in some scenes (I think the directorial intention was to offer seasonable reminders, but more often than not, the hovering narrative presence breaks the tension and immediacy of certain moments); the dialogue, in its attempt to simulate a rural, perhaps archaic dialect, is often clunky. The actors are game, delivering their lines with earnestness and commitment, but the voice is sufficiently uniform to make the whole seem rather contrived.<br/><br/>The cast ranges from solid to spectacular. Phoenix plays his Luciius with a quiet gravity. Although he has to deliver some leaden lines to account for his behavior, the behavior itself is winning. Adrien Brody plays Noah with a manic and tender grace that felt sufficiently authentic to me. Bryce Dallas Howard is spectacular, equal parts heart and backbone, with a winning charm that comes through over (and sometimes despite) the dialogue.<br/><br/>There are plenty of internal twists, and I found those more enjoyable than the big finish. As usual, Shyamalan provides the viewer with much to reflect on, and some of the pleasures of the movie will emerge in second and third viewings, as small narrative cues add up to significance. <br/><br/>I had hoped for more, but I left the film reflective and satisfied."

Excluding the story.<br/><br/>I expected for a film exceeding 'The Sixth Sense' which I did not find here. But, I did find some great acting. Bryce Dallas Howard was fabulous. Her raw talent just glows and she plays her character amazingly. Joaquin Phoenix was great though his speech can bug me at some points. He speaks quietly and scratchily. Yes, I know that this was required for the character but I have also noticed this in other movies. I found Adrien Brody playing his role frighteningly well.<br/><br/>I found two plot twists in the story- a little one and a very obvious large one. <br/><br/>The little twist was when Brody's character stabbed Lucius, Phoenix's role. The love story was my favorite part of the plot. Both Phoenix and Howard gave it so convincingly. <br/><br/>The big ""twist"" was very lame.

I didn't think it was scary what-so-ever. If anything, it was somewhat intense.<br/><br/>I didn't think it was an bad movie at all.

The ending is so totally ridiculous, I cannot figure out how Shyamalan came up with it. Was he tired of the dumb story line he was writing and just wanted it to end? Who knows? I guess M.

","I realize what a lot of people are saying is true; we usually expect more of the supernatural element in M.

I think M. Night did a great job with this film, and I admit that I was a little disappointed as I was leaving the theater that there was not more of a ""monster mania"" twist to this film, but as I was driving home, I realized that this was a great film and that its meaning was there and we had to think about it to bring it out.

A Powerful Love Story. And Those We Do Not Speak Of...<br/><br/>There will be NO spoilers in this review!<br/><br/>I was robbed today... Robbed of a once in a lifetime opportunity. I was robbed by an idiot projectionist. Only a handful of directors have earned my trust enough to merit an early morning Friday visit to the local multiplex. I decided to catch the very first showing of M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller, 'The Village'. Not only that, but the local AMC had a digital projection copy of the film. I was delighted and eager to see this long awaited movie.<br/><br/>I sat down in my chair, having decided to skip the popcorn stand because I am on a diet and because the line was too long. The screen was black... the lights were out... and a handful of other patrons showed up ten minutes early like me. Then, without warning, the screen lit up with a scene of some sort. I wasn't sure what I was watching until twenty or thirty seconds in. I recognized a familiar face. And then the realization slowly hit me... I was watching the very final moments of 'The Village'. The @#$!!)(@@ projectionist was messing around with the frame alignment and had accidentally begun playing the climax of the film. I was furious to say the least, and after explaining to the manager what had happened, I was promptly offered two free passes to any films of my choice in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>I was reasonably satisfied with the proposal, but I was utterly devastated to have my first viewing of this secretive film ruined by some pimple-popping moron. It is something that can never be regained unless you live in the world of Jim Carrey's 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.<br/><br/>All that being said... I find it even more remarkable that, with the big secret given away, M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' still managed to send shivers down my spine and give me a million goose bumps. It is his mastery of storytelling and mood and pace that has made him such a brilliant director in such a short amount of time. Very few directors have ever had their first four major films be this stellar. 'The Village' may be the best of the lot and is easily one of the best films you will see all year.<br/><br/>It is impossible to talk specifically about the plot without giving anything away. So if I talk in utter vagaries, please forgive me. In a village enclosed by mysterious woods, a group of a hundred or so people reside peacefully. They appear to be early American settlers, perhaps pilgrims or an Amish community. The film is very vague about those details.<br/><br/>William Hurt plays Edward Walker, the patriarch of this community. He is one of the elders, a group of adults who act as a council for the village. Joaquin Phoenix is Lucius Hunt, a quiet loner who is tempted to enter the forbidden woods. He is thwarted though by the elders who teach of creatures that live in the woods. The creatures are referred to as ""Those we do not speak of...""<br/><br/>Newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard is Lucius' love interest Ivy Walker. She is blind but seems to see and feel more than many of those around her. She is a feisty girl who recognizes Lucius' feelings without him ever expressing them verbally. She feels his presence and associates him with a color whenever he is near. There is a touching scene where he finally expresses to her that he only ever feels fear when he thinks she may be in danger. Theirs is a burgeoning relationship that grounds the film with real emotions.<br/><br/>I will not reveal the plot points in the final half of the film only to say that due to a terrible circumstance someone is forced to enter the woods and travel to get help. The storytelling techniques that Shyamalan uses in this film are simply brilliant. Unlike his other three films, the focus in 'The Village' is less on the final revelation and ""big twist"" than it is on the journey to get there. This film is a masterclass of screen writing and plot development.<br/><br/>If there is one quibble I have with the film, it is in the character development. The film could have been thirty minutes longer to give us more clarity in each of the lead characters. But this film is more about story and fable and suspense and mood than it is about individuals. Someday soon, Shyamalan will develop into a brilliant creator of characters... He is already a consummate artist when it comes to creating story and visuals.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good. Everyone plays their part with stoic aim. The one stunning standout is the revelation of Bryce Dallas Howard. The daughter of director, Ron Howard, delivers one of the best major film debuts in recent memory. She is the emotional anchor of this film and those emotions are played out exquisitely on her gorgeous face. Her portrayal of Ivy is one of the best performances of 2004. I think she should be Oscar nominated. It is clear to me that, if she chooses to follow the film path, we have found a new great actress for the coming generation. What a lovely and inspired find by M. Night!<br/><br/>I have read some early reviews from other major critics. Most notably a terribly misguided review from my favorite critic, Roger Ebert. There are other reviews out there who lament that they saw the twist too far in advance or that the film was too somber. I am dumbfounded by their remarks. Did they miss the glorious cinematography? Did they miss the lovely interwoven political message (Which I will leave you to decipher)? Did they miss the tremendous performance of Bryce Dallas Howard? Did they miss a carefully crafted story whose tension mounts patiently? Did they miss the gorgeous use of strings in the soundtrack? Did they miss the fact that this film is so much better than the routine schtick we get week in and week out. Were their expectations skewed by Shyamalan's previous outings?<br/><br/>I think that if this was Shyamalan's first film, the same mediocre reviews would be glowing recommendations. This is the classiest of his four great films and his least sensationalistic. He is maturing with each and every cinematic venture. If he keeps up this curve for another 20 years, M. Night will soon discussed in the same breath as Alfred Hitchcock. There are a handful of better filmmakers out there right now, but I can't think of a better storyteller than he.<br/><br/>'The Village' is a first rate film. I highly suggest that you avoid hearing details or rumors about this movie before seeing it. I wouldn't want your virgin viewing experience robbed. I think time will prove me right over the Roger Ebert's of this world. This film will stand the test of time and serves as yet another stepping stone to greatness for Mr. Shyamalan. 'The Village' will assuredly contend for a spot in my Top Ten Films of 2004."

","Regardless of what people think of M. Night's new movie (you love it, hate, are indifferent about it), there is one undeniably positive aspect of his new movie...he has people talking about movies (specifically his right now) with enthusiasm. I personally thought the story was lacking, but the storytelling was just astonishing. But regardless, It's very hard to get such an uncontrollable buzz nowadays. He has accomplished it, so I would go as far to say that M.Night deserves his added 15 minutes in the spotlight right now; though that cameo in the film was not needed. The experience of seeing the film, I think, is a must simply for the photography. The film is a perfect example to make up your own mind about on whether or not is was thrilling or boring."

I learned it in the first minute of the movie, but I wasn't aware before that, even seeing the trailers.<br/><br/>Going into a movie from this directory, you HAVE to think ""there will be a twist"", but you are just plain stupid if you are trying to guess it before the end, you want to spoil your experience, don't you?<br/><br/>I never saw it coming, but the worst part is, I didn't even notice that we were *WARNING SPOILERS* in actual time when she got on the road... it took me a minute... didn't had the same effect on me as the other twists in the other Shatamalan movies, but after thinking about the whole movie, it was a pretty good ending, you now know you have to watch it again to see all the clues you were stupid enough not to notice.<br/><br/>I must admit that when I saw the feast scene, I said to myself ""Funny, this could be in modern time, they don't look too old fashioned"", but it never clicked in my head that this was in modern time.<br/><br/>Plus, the more I read comments (good ones, not negative ones, I can understand why some people felt cheated due to the trailer, but nevertheless, it doesn't make the movie BAD), I now think the best one is the one that notices that the camera from the wood where people are scared, it looks exactly like if they were scared of us, watching them, through the screen...<br/><br/>I won't say it's M.

"FilmOtaku","7","0","0","1 August 2004"," Beautifully filmed, with an interesting story
","I sometimes wonder if M. Night Shymalan has directed himself into a corner after a strong start.  Since `The Sixth Sense', audiences have been expecting his films to all be of the same genre, and while his succeeding films have had an underlying theme of the supernatural, he seems to have lost the confidence of the general movie-going public.  I think that this is in part due to this nagging feeling I get that he has a lot of self-satisfaction with his work, essentially saying `Look how clever I can be see it? See it?'  But even more so, I firmly believe, with all due respect to said general movie-going public, that not every film of his is going to have a huge `twist' in the end, or `Boo!' moments that are going to scare us into nervous laughter  and most importantly, he doesn't purport to do this with all of his films; it is simply the vast chasm between audience expectation and director's intent.<br/><br/>`The Village', Shymalan's latest offering, is the tale of a small 19th century village whose residents live with the daily threat of the unknown creatures which dwell in the woods that border it.  There is a `truce' between the residents of these two areas; as long as the villagers don't breach their border, the creatures will leave them alone.  One day, however, after the death of a young boy, a young man from the village, Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix) after many pleas to the village elders to go through the woods to one of the surrounding towns in order to get medicine to prevent future loss of life.  The next day, red marks appear on the door, and the village's animals turn up dead and shorn; presumably, the creatures in the woods are not happy and are declaring `war' on the village. <br/><br/>
Shymalan favors a sullen, emotionally pained and quiet protagonist, and `The Village' follows this trend.  Phoenix is all large eyes, slightly stooped and silent, while maintaining a large amount of strength and character.  His love interest, Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the unofficial mayor of the village, (Bryce Dallas Howard) is probably the most heroic figure of the film, however, and is definitely the most compelling character.  Much has been said of Howard's performance, and the accolades are most definitely warranted.  Adrien Brody has a small but important role as Noah, basically the village idiot, and while he speaks very little, Brody's acting is once again unreal.  I have admired him since seeing `Summer of Sam' years ago, and he his talent has only strengthened.  I didn't even hate William Hurt, which I fully expected to do, just because I find him to be so unbelievably bland.  The films he appears in are generally good, but his lack of any kind of dynamic is disappointing.  As Edward Walker in `The Village', however, he is not horrid.    The production values and cinematography in `The Village' really are quite good  Roger Deakins, who I have greatly admired since his first collaboration with the Coen brothers on Barton Fink, really is a master in his field.  His lighting and photography are fantastic in this film, and, as a friend said to me on the drive home from the theater, `the film was really beautiful.'<br/><br/>I went into this film having seen some really bad reviews, but the ones that gave me pause were positive reviews by other critics that I highly respect. I noticed that several of the negative reviews disdainfully compared `The Village' to Shymalan's earlier film, `Unbreakable.'  I'm sure it was not the reviewers' intent, but this actually made me want to see this film more, because I think that `Unbreakable' was a fantastic film, but that it was a box office disappointment because it was not a clone of `The Sixth Sense'. Mainstream audiences were expecting another scare-fest, and they got Bruce Willis again, but this time as a sad, beaten-down superhero of some sorts. I found `Unbreakable' to be a very personal and endearing film, and I attribute a lesser degree of those adjectives to `The Village'.  It was not a phenomenal film, but it was certainly not a disappointment.  The story was solid and kind of left me with the `Hmmminteresting' sentiment that I take away from good episodes of `The Outer Limits' or `Twilight Zone'.  The now-expected `twist' was visible by about 2/3 into the film, but who cares? It was still a good story, and the film, while more of a drama than a thriller/horror offering is a solid movie that I feel deserves a lot more credit than it has been given.  I'm glad that I didn't let some bad reviews mar my viewing experience because I went into the film with an open mind and came out generally satisfied.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

"cchase","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," It Takes THE VILLAGE To Tell A Story...
","If you think you're going to get me to tell you what the ""twist"" is in M. Night Shyamalan's latest enigma wrapped inside a mystery folded into a conundrum, forget it. In fact, there's not just one twist, but several smaller ones and one REALLY BIG one. <br/><br/>The problem most moviegoers and critics are having is that it's an old-fashioned twist, one that most writers and directors don't believe in using anymore. Except for once in a very great while. THE USUAL SUSPECTS had that kind of twist. As did MALICE. But then THE SIXTH SENSE found a new and exciting way to do it, and there's the rub. Now we expect ""Night"" to deliver something that spectacular with every movie he makes. Which was about like asking Orson Welles to top CITIZEN KANE every time he stepped behind a camera.<br/><br/>What was important to me is how his artistry at filmmaking is holding up, and if THE VILLAGE is proof, then he's still every bit as good at storytelling as Spielberg, if not a tad better. The photography, music and (most of the) set design couldn't have been better, and those performances...!!!<br/><br/>Keep your eye on Bryce Dallas Howard after this. Ron's little girl has a big career ahead of her, showing that Night still has an uncanny eye for new talent. And William Hurt? He and Sigourney Weaver haven't been in a movie together since ""Eyewitness,"" and if anything, they make up for whatever shortcomings that experience had with their chemistry in this one.<br/><br/>Every single person kicked it up a notch, especially Joaquin, who is one of the most vulnerable yet masculine hunks to come along in a while as Lucius Hunt. But with all that said, and all the praise doled out, the big, standout performance you may be talking about belongs to one actor...Adrien Brody. The part seems so small at first, it makes you wonder why he would do this to follow up his spectacular work in THE PIANIST.<br/><br/>
You will understand soon enough, when you realize that it's not the size of the role, but what Adrien does with it, that counts. And even he can't upstage the real star of THE VILLAGE...the Pennsylvania woods themselves. There is more dread and ominous creepiness in one shot of the woods surrounding The Village, than in the first thirty minutes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. (They only WISH BWP had been this frightening.)<br/><br/>So without giving away a single detail, what can I tell you about how you'll like or hate this movie? Let me put it this way...don't go back and watch SIGNS or THE SIXTH SENSE or even UNBREAKABLE before seeing this.<br/><br/>Instead, go rent the original PLANET OF THE APES, and watch the whole thing, all the way to the ending we all know by now like the insides of our eyelids. If you are still knocked out by it, you will probably love THE VILLAGE. If you think it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen now, you may want to go see SPIDERMAN 2 or SHREK 2 instead"

","This movie was superb.  For anyone and everyone who liked this Sixth Sense, strap yourselve's in for another two hour mind bending experience.  Bryce Dallas Howard gives an electric performance, not allowing you one moment to look away.  The film is not a horror movie, as it may have been advertised, but rather a suspense.  On a deeper level the movie gives way to hours of thought on society (I'll stop there for fear of giving anything away.)  The camera work was pure genious, M. Night is truely one of the few remaining directors who appreciates the effect a simple camera move can have on the audience.  The story is delightfully sprinkled with bits of humor here and there, and features not only Howard's fantastic performance, but also a great job by Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  I would have no problem placing this in the top 3 movies so far this year, and would recommend this film to anyone who is looking to enjoy themselves.  Perhaps the film went over the heads of the general public, or perhaps it will just take some time, but this movie is gold, and eventaully all these nay sayers will realize that."
"jhs39","6","0","0","31 July 2004"," After more thought...
","I'm writing a follow up comment to one I left right after seeing the movie because the more I think about it, the more frustrated I become.  The Village really could have been so much better than it is and the problem is the ""surprise"" ending, the thing that so many people here are commenting on, but not actually for the reason people are saying.<br/><br/>I think M Night Shyamalan (as well as the people who saw The Village and actually thought the ending worked) would benefit greatly from watching an Atom Egoyan film like Exotica.  Egoyan is a truly brilliant filmmaker while Shyamalan is a filmmaker who thinks he's brilliant.  Egoyan delays information to keep the audience off-balance and so they don't immediately know what's going on, but he doesn't keep it for a big twist at the end--the delayed information is parceled out during the course of the movie to enhance dramatic impact.  The Village would have been much more powerful and affecting if Shyamalan had utilized a similar storytelling structure rather than relying so heavily on a rickety would-be surprise ending.  By keeping such a major plot revelation for the very end Shymalan screws up the movie because: a) people like myself who figure out the ending early get bored waiting for the obvious to be revealed and b) people who don't figure out the ending feel cheated because it invalidates what they thought the movie was.  <br/><br/>From a marketing standpoint the problem with eliminating the trick ending is that once you do The Village turns into what it really is, a romantic drama rather than a thriller.  The Village isn't a thriller.  The only way Shyamalan can even create the illusion that The Village is a thriller is to withhold crucial information until the very end.  But people who go to The Village expecting to see a thriller will feel duped (as the many angry comments here on the IMDB can attest), and people who actually enjoy the more thoughtful aspects of the story are likely to be frustrated that the structure with its gotcha ending prevents the romance and actual dramatic conflict from being developed to anywhere near the extent that it should have been.<br/><br/>As much as I liked parts of The Village, at this point I'm hoping that after the inevitable strong opening weekend it tanks.  Based on recent interviews it seems like M Night Shyamalan judges whether his movies work or not based on their ultimate box office take, so if The Village flops maybe it will force him to actually take a few chances and break free of his formula that is not only showing greatly diminishing returns from movie to movie but, in the case of The Village, turned what could have been a really first rate and thought provoking romantic drama into a mediocre and gimmicky thriller."
"shattenjager777","6","0","0","31 July 2004"," Shyamalan's New Voice
","Much of the charm and success of Shyamalan's last three films (""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs) was that he used a very realistic directoral style and a limited number of well-developed characters in a supernatural framework rather than designing a typical ghost story, superhero story, or alien story.  I find it incredibly interesting to see this and that was why I wanted to see ""The Village.""  I honestly hated ""The Sixth Sense,"" absolutely loved ""Unbreakable"" and only somewhat liked ""Signs;"" so I was probably the only person there who would call myself a Shyamalan fan and say I was hoping it wouldn't be ""The Sixth Sense.""<br/><br/>And it wasn't.  In fact, it was hardly Shyamalan.  While it did retain his films' beautiful look and still wasn't overly formalistic, ""The Village"" shows a much more formalistic bent than Shyamalan has shown before, employing much more camera manipulation than Shyamalan's last films had.  It was also different because the number of characters was greater (which is ironic, since ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" both take place in the metropolis of Philadelphia and even ""Signs"" is in a less isolated location) and their depth lesser.  The other elements that defined it from the other Shyamalan hits was that the story before the ending was full of twists where the others saved up their only twist for the end (""Signs"" excepted) and it did not have a twist at the end as all of the others did--which to me was a welcome sign of Shyamalan's narrative growth.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was very uneven, highlighted by excellent performances by Adrien Brody as Noah Percy and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt.  *SPOILERS AHEAD*  While for the most part Phoenix is not given much emotion to show, it is amazing to note the ferocious, intense look his face gets whenever Ivy is in danger--give him about five years and I'm sure Phoenix will have a well-deserved Oscar under his belt.  *SPOILERS OVER* Adrien Brody meanwhile also gave an excellent performance, giving his character a sympathetic quality that a lesser actor could easily not have given us.  Despite the actions of Noah Percy, I could not help but feel sorry for him when we saw his face--Brody is the youngest best actor winner in Oscar history for a reason, after all.  Meanwhile, Bryce Dallas Howard was awful as Ivy Walker.  While sometimes she had a lack of emotion that could be explained away by her blindness, at other times she did not keep the emotional lack in check, which made her unbelievable.  In small roles, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver were also weak and difficult to believe.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's script's major flaw was its forced dialogue.  There was no reason for these people to talk this way and it was obviously unnatural for the actors except for Adrien Brody, who did not have the type of ultra-formal, unflowing, ugly dialogue that the others did--instead his was often rather unintelligible, which was sensible.  Perhaps Shyamalan was just attempting to pull us deeper into this world, but I found it very distracting.  The characters also lack the depth of those in his previous films, but are still not terrible.  The plot was actually quite good--probably the second-best Shyamalan has come up with (only to ""Unbreakable"") and had a few unforseen twists along the way.<br/><br/>In summary, ""The Village"" either marks a new direction for Shyamalan's career--aiming in a more plot-driven way as a writer and leaning in a more formalistic direction as a director--or an anomaly that we will look back on in 20 years and say, ""That was M. Night Shyamalan?""  It doesn't feel or seem quite like a Shyamalan film, but it still has some strengths--a good plot, excellent performances by Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix, and general scenic beauty--and those strengths outweigh its weaknesses sufficiently to make a satisfying film overall.  It may not be what Shyamalan's fans want to see, but non-Shyamalan fans may want to give it a try."

As writer, producer and director of the latest Touchstone release,<br/><br/>""The Village,"" Shymalan does it again - big time. 	The plot has a group of small townspeople eeking out an<br/><br/>existence - almost Amish-style - in an isolated hamlet,<br/><br/>Coventington, Penn., bordered by dark and foreboding woods in<br/><br/>the late 19th Century. It seems this forest is inhabited by<br/><br/>mysterious, yet violent creatures who have made a pact with the<br/><br/>residents not to encroach on their territory - or vise versa. 	Town elder Edward Walker (William Hurt), and the other leaders,<br/><br/>have made sort of an uneasy truce with these entities, but when a<br/><br/>young boy dies from lack of medicine, one of the residents, Lucius<br/><br/>Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) offers to leave the woods and fetch<br/><br/>medicine from a nearby community. 	He is rebuffed, of course,  and the people go on with their drab,<br/><br/>dreary lives, wearing brown, gray or yellow colors and getting rid of<br/><br/>anything red, for fear of offending `Those Which They Do Not<br/><br/>Speak Of.' 	Lucius doesn't speak much, either but hides a curiosity and<br/><br/>fearlessness that makes the leaders a bit nervous. His mother,<br/><br/>Alice (Sigourney Weaver), who also harbors some skeletal<br/><br/>closets, is worried about her son, especially when he wanders<br/><br/>into the forbidden zone to pick berries. This causes the monsters<br/><br/>to go nuts, slaughtering animals while a wedding is going on in<br/><br/>the berg. 	In addition, Lucius turns down the love of Walker's older, flighty<br/><br/>daughter, Kitty (Judy Greer), for the hand of her blind younger<br/><br/>sister, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard - daughter of director Ron<br/><br/>Howard). Their scenes together are tender and genuine.

While the film certainly has it's frightening moments, it's more<br/><br/>thoughtful than scary; more dark than chilling; more atmospheric<br/><br/>than bloodcurdling. 	The acting, especially Hurt, Phoenix, Brodie and (surprisingly)<br/><br/>Howard, is first-rate. In fact, Howard, given the choicest role, runs<br/><br/>with it with grit and aplomb, giving a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>	Lensing by cinematographer Roger Deakens (""House of Sand<br/><br/>and Fog,"" ""The Ladykillers,"" ""A Beautiful Mind"") is appropriately<br/><br/>creepy, while set decorator Larry Diaz and costume designer Ann<br/><br/>Roth capture the late 1800s period detail to perfection. 	A lot of critics will probably blast this film, mainly because it drags<br/><br/>and rags. It's true, Shyamalan may have slowed things down a bit<br/><br/>(making the 1 hour, 45 minutes seem much longer), but for those<br/><br/>with patience, a decent result will be discovered."

","When M.Night  Shamaylan is at the helm!! This film reminds me of classic 80's promotion, where a movie is advertised as something which it is NOT!! During the hey-day of B-cinema many films came out that were marketed as horror and ultimately were not. This film used that technique to fill the seats. The film ""Funeral Home"" comes to mind, marketed as a zombie movie, when it was actually a ""Psycho"" inspired thriller. Only with this film the movie is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what is shown in previews. Maybe I would have appreciated it more, if I was not tricked into thinking it was horror. It is obvious by the marketing technique that horror is still a profitable genre, so why is Hollywood not releasing any horror movies in 2004? So far ""Dawn Of the Dead"" has been the ONLY horror release to date (August 1st) and the new ""Exorsist"" is on the way. Give the audience that went to see ""The Village"", what they really want, an authentic horror movie. Not a lame attempt at social commentary disguised as a monster movie. Technically the movie looks great, the acting is solid too, but the script and writing is awful, uninspiring and for the horror movie fan you will be inspired to say ""WHAT A WASTE OF TIME"". Sorry this director, can not hold a candle to any of the great genre film makers. The movie is not suspenseful at all, the big ""twist"" is a let down, and the social commentary is very elementary, and nothing slightly thought provoking.  If you actually think M.Night Shamaylan and the word brilliant belong in the same sentence, you have not seen too many quality films. After such a promising year (2003) of good horror movies such as ""Wrong Turn"", ""Identity"", ""Texas Chainsaw 2003"", ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and others; this year has been a huge letdown for the horror movie fan.

I thought this was a good premise for a film and it's the kind of story I like.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed because `The Village' turned out to be something very different.  The fact that they were NO creatures at all really disheartened me.    And then the film becomes some sort of social commentary of the perils of modern day life.<br/><br/>The use of the actors here is odd.  I thought Joaquin Phoenix was going to be a central character to follow throughout the film but he is only seen in the first half.   The William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver roles could have been played by anyonethey really didn't come alive for me in the story. Bryce Dallas Howard however, is really special in this film. <br/><br/>
I am somewhat confused as to what Adrien Brody's character was supposed to be about.  I felt that his actions happened without any specific purpose with regard to the plot.  It is never explained why he tries to kill Lucius or chases Ivy.  <br/><br/>Given what happens at the end, I found it very difficult to believe that a man would send his blind daughter out to the woods to fetch some medicine from a world she has no knowledge of.   Especially when Hurt's character simply could have done the job himself and created fewer problems for his friends and family.  This is a very weak plot element in the story.   <br/><br/>
Also towards the end of the film, when Ivy is being pursued by the `creature' I was wondering why this scene was shot in broad daylight.   It looked like she was being chased by a guy in a chicken outfit wearing a robe.  You could clearly see this was a man in a costume.   Had Shyamalan filmed this at night, it would have been much more effective.  I'm amazed that he made this oversight.  <br/><br/>The Village is a complex film and Shyamalan is certainly being ambitious with this one.   I think I will see it again to give it a second chance. Maybe I'll feel differently.   There are SO FEW good films coming out of Hollywood these days that even Shyamalan's worst films are going to be far better than your typical movie today.<br/><br/>The Village is not a bad film.  It's interesting with some good spooky moments but I had hoped for a different kind of film."

","Night's 4th movie isn' t the most original movie story-wise. Most of<br/><br/>his stories draw inspiration from past works of fiction. In fact, ""The<br/><br/>Village"" is probably a rip-off of at least 2 books and maybe a<br/><br/>Twilight Zone episode. But, it surprised me anyway and<br/><br/>impressed me. The 2 twists at the end were interesting. Night's<br/><br/>movies are so good to view for the first time, because you know<br/><br/>there will be a cool twist. Unfortunately, repeated viewings are<br/><br/>ruined because you already know the twist.  This movie is<br/><br/>definitely worth seeing. Night's direction is good and The Village is<br/><br/>a carefully crafted film. Bryce Dallas Howard  is excellent, she<br/><br/>should at least be nominated for something for this performance. I<br/><br/>like the way Night shocks you and has you wondering what to<br/><br/>expect next. His movies are also classy and not vulgar.

","I just finished watching THE VILLAGE and have to say... I was disappointed. Whether it was because of my expectations or the ungodly slow pace, I don't know, but I left the theater less than satisfied.<br/><br/>There are some cool, intense scenes but the film lacks the character and drive that drove his other films.  Before you jack me around and say that I didn't like it because I only like scary films and I'm unable to accept anything else from Shayamalam let me just say, I enjoyed Stuart Little.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the acting even seemed a little stiff- and from some calibre actors besides!  As I mentioned earlier, the pace was ridiculous.  At several points the theater was filled with the blue light of people checking the time on their cell phones.

","I saw the movie opening night, and again the next day.  Along with a lot of negative reviews I've heard, I also at the theater heard teenagers in particular saying they didn't like the movie.  Right off the bat, I expect very few teenagers to like this movie.  I also expect those adults with, shall we say, a lack of depth of experience, to not get this movie either. Just as ""Signs"" was not an alien invasion movie but rather a movie about faith wrapped in the summer crowd-pleasing guise of an alien-invasion movie, ""The Village"" is about so much more than what it appears--even more so than was ""Signs"".  ""The Village"" is neither a psychological thriller as was ""The Sixth Sense"", nor does it have the aliens angle of ""Signs"",  so it isn't going to appeal to people from either of those crowds.  I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten it as a teenager, and I likely wouldn't have appreciated it much without children.  Let's face it: it's a movie for adults, and I mean adults with real concerns about living in the world that exists today.  Anyone with an extraordinary concern for their children will get it.  Unfortunately for the box office, that segment might not be as large as M. Night Shyamalan would like.  But for my money, I agree with Shyamalan in feeling that this is his best work yet.  It's without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen."

I went to see it, believing that it was a horror movie with special effects. That is what I was led to believe. I dragged my poor husband , who promptly fell asleep in the middle of it. When the curtain came down and the movie was over, you would not believe the boos that emanated from the audience. The couple behind me were very mad and the husband said to the wife, ""Next time, I pick the movie"". This went on, all the way down the stairs to the exit. Not one person liked this move.

I was all excited. I formulated the ending in my mind. Perhaps they were taken from earth and deposited on another planet.

When people who like science fictin, or horror see the coming attractions of this movie, and the promos, and then when they pay their money and it turns out that there ARE NO CREATURES, that the whole story was made up because William Hurt and the elders all those years ago, lost somebody in their life to violence and William Hurt got an idea and lo and behold, he invented an Amish like village where they don't need money and everybody gets along, well, I can't tell you how mad I was at the end.

The only thing I felt was irritation.  First, none of the characters are likeable at all(I've read people raving about Brodie's village idiot and I suppose that makes him a good actor, but still an idiot and hardly likeable), then there's the dialogoue, which if it were in the era the movie wants you to think it is would at least be explicable, the plot itself with blind people traversing god knows how far through the woods and not getting lost, the Brotherhood of the Wolf ripoff, I can't even begin to list the things about this movie that made me dislike it.

"Booyah","8","0","0","31 July 2004"," The Village: Quality film - now get off Shyamalan's back.
","Unfortunately a good percentage of people are judging this film based on their view of writer/director Shyamalan, his previous films, and their expectations.<br/><br/>The problem with doing that is that it's nearly impossible for this film to please anyone with a strong preconception. If you're not a Shyamalan fan, you're going to be tired of twists. If you are a fan and expecting one, it's not going to have the same effect on you as The Sixth Sense. If you want a twist or DON'T want a twist, you're going to be hard to please.<br/><br/>So leave all that at the door and just enjoy the film, and base your impressions on how the film stands up on its own accord.<br/><br/>As in Signs and Unbreakable, Shyamalan leaves you guessing (you weren't really ""guessing"" in The Sixth Sense, unless you were forewarned the movie had an unexpecting twist). Those two previous films build up the suspense in a way such that you KNOW something dramatic has to come forward to explain things.<br/><br/>The ""twist"" here isn't really one thing but several, which I won't reveal. The cynicism you may view the village, its customs, its fears, and its elders is toyed with constantly.<br/><br/>In the end, this is another psychological thriller, but it operates on a different level than you may be expecting. That may disappoint or please you. If you stop setting expectations for this film, you'll probably see things as I have: this is a quality film that rewards your attention, fits together well, and makes you think.<br/><br/>I do feel the script may be a little light. It seems like the kind of story that could be told just fine in an X-Files, Twilight Zone, or Outer Limits episode in 23-42 minutes. The film is ""stretched"" to two hours. But it's understandably stretched. Beautiful scenery, music, performances by the cast, and tension...lots of tension, fill the space.<br/><br/>The cast is almost overstocked with award-winning actors and actresses. Out of this ""all-star"" line up, an unknown shines brightest. Bryce Howard really steals her scenes. One almost expects that Shyamalan fills time with half a paragraph in the script that basically says ""Bryce: Wow us for a few minutes."" William Hurt and Cherry Jones (you may remember her as the police officer in Signs) are also very effective. The rest of the cast is solid.<br/><br/>The music and visuals are great - a real pleasure to take in.<br/><br/>The unfortunate fact is people are rating this ""pass or fail."" The most popular rating for this film is a ""10."" The second-most popular is a ""1."" No one can justify either of these extreme scores. They either walked out pleased or disappointed, and let their emotion (and desire to influence the overall rating) take over.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate it an 8/10. It's a combination of a well-made film that entertains. It doesn't wow you like Spider-Man, nor is it the modern day equivalent of Citizen Kane. But it gets the job done, and does so on a level that far exceeds most garbage that Hollywood produces."

","There are many among you who will complain that this movie was not scary. In response to this, I ask you to examine Shyamalan's previous movies; none of them were really scary. His movies tend to consist of creepy plots with odd twists that sometimes have a tendency of falling off at the end. He seems to me to be a very talented and intelligent writer who suffers from disorganization. I work at a movie theatre and viewed this with fellow employees and out of all who viewed the movie, was the only one who liked it.

William Hurt delivers yet again another great performance along with Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and a very exciting surprise performance by Adrien Brody. Giving Credit where it is due, the story that Shyamalan spins is exciting and very alluring. The scar factor of this film is OK with some screams throughout the theatre and people jumping.

","Contains Spoiler!! Haha I don't see why people are being so harsh with this movie...I loved it. I mean yeah, it wasn't a shock horror movie such as (Texas Chainsaw or Scream or any teen slasher movie) ...it was a thinking, psychological thriller commenting on how fear and imagination co-exist and how imagination creates fear that is or is not really there. For example...the sounds from the woods...they were just regular forest activity...but when told of the horrors of the woods people make them out to automatically be produced by some demon or creature that lives there. It's all in our minds. And that's what M. Night is toying with. He is toying with our mind...creating tense tense and scary situations instead of having a masked murderer run out and chop peoples heads off. He pulls his punches and only uses the surprises jumpy scenes to further mess with the audience...leaving them feel like it could happen at any time. They way he filmed each scene too...many times panning back the camera a bit and filming from a distance so that something could run in front of the camera at any moment...brilliant. I've heard a lot of mixed opinions about the ending too...haha i really liked it a lot. I love twist endings and I love movies that do not always take the logical path. I've read some pretty absurd statements out there already that people claim they guessed the ending 15 minutes into the movie...impossible, unless you cheated or read hints online that made you guess. I wanted the twist to hit hard and i wanted to be completely shocked by what it could be...I made sure I didn't read anything or even check anything about this movie up online. The only hints I had were the previews I saw on TV. <br/><br/>How could you have honestly known (!SPOILER!, by this point though..if you're reading this..you probably already know) if you didn't have any outside help that it was set in the current times. I thought it was great. It basically switched genres in mid movie...going from a horror/thriller to, in a sense, an almost science fiction approach. (Note: Science Fiction is something that could possibly happen even if extremely implausible, Fantasy is something that could never ever happen) People need to expand their imaginations a bit more...think laterally. Sure you could sit through and eventually I'm sure you'll find some way that the situation their in could not have happened or that something hinted the twists, yeah, have fun with that. But, remember, movies are to entertain. <br/><br/>I must say one last thing though, if you didn't understand the ending you missed the whole entire point of the movie. This movie was about imagination creating fear that wasn't there to begin with...and that's exactly what M. Night conveyed by twisting the ending. He made you believe, such as the people of the village believed, that there were horrors out in the woods that we should be frightened and scared of and that we should fear...but in the end we had nothing to fear. There wasn't anything out there...it had all been in our minds. The only actual real fear was when Noah was trying to kill Ivy. That was actually happening, it wasn't a set up that time. And it was interesting, and perhaps the other main point of the movie, that a town created entirely for the soul purpose of keeping these children innocent and away from harm had evil within itself too. There are irrational people out there no matter where...you can't escape them. Evil can come within as well. Being a filmmaker myself...I would have loved to make a movie like this. I would have loved to toy with the audience this much, would have loved to have the guts to totally go out on a wing for the ending. I thought it was just plain brilliant."

Stilted but I think that was the nature of the Village demeanor.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard was very good as Ivy. M. Night Shyamalan's movies are very moody and atmospheric and this one is no exception."
"djfoster","Null","0","0","31 July 2004"," Victim of past success
","The problem here is M. Night Shyamalan is a victim of his own success. After the genre-transforming ""Sixth Sense,"" with its now famous twist ending, audiences expect Shyamalan to jolt us no matter how intrusive it is to the story.  And he's happily obliged by reworking the formula with ""Unbreakable"" (What makes Bruce Willis indestructible?) and ""Signs"" (Are the aliens real?).  <br/><br/>""The Village"" is ultimately one long waiting game.  While it envelopes us in its impeccable recreation of an agrarian society, the plot is hellbent on shattering our preconceptions.  And knowing that, we watch it waiting for the revelations, not engrossed in the tale, despite a star-making performance by Bryce Dallas Howard.<br/><br/>When the director finally reveals his hand, the ""twists"" are predictable and maddeningly unimaginative.  I expect audiences, who wanted to conceal the end of ""The Sixth Sense"" to insure their friends' enjoyment, will be anxious to reveal all to save their friends' $10 for a ticket.<br/><br/>It's not that Shyamalan doesn't have a point here. He's clearly making a statement about post-9/11 America.  But the moral is overshadowed by his obligation to shock us."

","Kids find things and places that scare them, and dare each other to press the limits. Dive off the high board. Walk the rickety bridge. Go into the abandoned house after sunset. Most people are born with a natural fear of the unknown, and face those fears in different ways. Until any fear is broken, people's limits are contained within them. The inhabitants of `The Village' have an extra dose of fear from the elusive creatures that offer them sanctuary if they stay in the limited domain of their woodland Pennsylvanian town. From that set-up, M. Night Syamalan's makes his latest film create frightening monster chills without ever resorting to slasher-film gore. <br/><br/>The movie opens with the funeral of a child. Other than the deceased being young, there is nothing suspicious about the event, and it clearly establishes the facts of life in late 19th century rural Pennsylvania. Sounds that come from the woods surrounding the town bring looks of fear and haunted pauses in conversation about `Those We Do Not Speak Of'. To make certain that the truce to keep the worlds of the woods and village separate, watch towers and torches are a long-standing part of town life. The people of the town talk about the creatures in the most reserved of ways as life goes on. The elders (two of whom are played by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver) help keep everything running as the young people fall in love and direct people to care for the mentally disabled Noah (Adrian Brody). Although it is Tabitha Walker (Jayne Atkinson) who declares the strength of her love for Lucius (Joaqin Phoenix), it is her blind sister, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who captures his attention. The appearance of skinned animals along the border renews people's worries about the creatures, and the night they come into town leaves everyone quivering in storm cellars as the clawed and porcupine-quilled creatures pound on doors in apparent anger. Although Lucius presses the elders for permission to cross the woods to find new medicine and aids for town life, it is Ivy who must ultimately face the unknowns of the forest when misfortune befalls Lucius. What lies in and beyond the woods is what the townsfolk truly fear, and what Shyamalan has come to challenge the audience with.<br/><br/>There is currently no worthier heir to Hitchcock than Shyamalan. Right down to the cameo appearance, he follows the Master of Suspense's tradition in toying with the audience's expectations and primal urges to create unique experiences within his movies. He also leaves plenty of clues to the film's secrets out in the open for those who are observant enough and who keep and open mind. Not every big name associated with the picture has a pivotal moment to play up, and it works to the benefit of the movie. The A-list heavies who are here have come to be a part of a story, and not to simply give easily anticipated one-liners. Roger Deakins continues his fine career of cinematography working to reveal only what is necessary. His images are beautiful, but also use light to increase the sense of a limited world. Things are never starkly sunny, and a haze is maintained over everything. The pre-dawn conversation between Lucius and Ivy is a scene of quiet intensity created by the symmetry of their subtly highlighted faces. Only at night are the shadows sharp and crisp by torchlight. The score is a Hollywood one to be certain, but it too is not overdone. And to achieve that, James Newton Howard pairs down the music to meet the size of the situation. When the music helps a scare, it only reinforces the moment. The music alone doesn't make you jump, your anticipation does.<br/><br/>Many Hollywood films approach the idea of horror with the intent of pure shock. They know that the audience has come expecting a particular kind of monster. Market research demands starting the scares early and bringing them often at the sacrifice of any real character beyond `jock', `nerd', `virgin' or `creep'. While `The Village' is largely accepted as a horror movie, it makes an attempt to challenge the notions of fear and courage while it scares. It is more of a drama with monsters than a traditional monster movie. This is more about the experience than the goal. Everyone went in droves to see kids get lost in the woods of `The Blair Witch Project' not because kids getting lost in the woods is an unusual occurrence, but because it was a film that successfully generated fear in the way campfire stories used to. Shyamalan is a storyteller who makes movies, and that is all he has set out to do here: tell a scary story, and do it intelligently.<br/><br/>A friend of mine who saw the film with me is betting on a dominating opening weekend with a massive drop-off in box office on the second weekend because the surprise at the end of the film doesn't mesh with exactly what audiences expect. M. Night Shyamalan will probably never again attain the hushed shock that swept over people at the end of `The Sixth Sense', which was a monumental achievement. He shouldn't need to repeat the exact feat with every one of his movies. He may be weaning us off of the need to be shocked in the same way with each progressive movie. <br/><br/>There are plenty of people already revealing the secret of the ending on message boards and chat rooms. The object of fear once it is revealed, much like an object of desire once it is attained, is never as great as what it appeared to be from a distance. The revealed truth, in fact, is cause for sadness. That does not make the challenge any less nor does it diminish the heroism of the people who faced the limits of what they thought they could do. The final fright is, could anyone in the audience have been any braver?<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This was a disappointing film from Shyamalan. The premise was indeed interesting, but could have been made much stronger with some relatively minor plot changes. His hallmark twist was there, but the viewer was eased into it; it did not shock as did the classic ending of The Sixth Sense. The acting appeared stilted with the exception for Bryce Howard, who turned in an excellent performance in her feature film debut, and the always steady Joaquin Phoenix. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver appeared to sleepwalk through their roles. The scares were there, but didn't have the same edge as in his other movies. Not one of Shyamalan's better movies.

That's why I watch Shyamalan, to get frightened. I feel that ""The Village"" will rank up there with... what most feel... ""Unbreakable"", as a good movie worth watching once.

","I am truly a huge movie buff and am pretty much open when it comes to all movie categories. ""As long as the story and acting are good and interesting""... is my personal motto. This movie was promoted as a suspense/horror film, and what we got was a suspense/love story, that was unfortunately more predictable than M Night's previous 3 movies. For this, i give this movie a 8 out of a possible 10. The previews and commercials deception was probably necessary to draw in a larger audience, but made the ending much more disappointing. The reason i gave it an 8 was because the acting for the most part was 'superb' for lack of a better word. There was indeed plenty of suspense throughout most of the film, and the sound effects and music added greatly to the nail biting effect. The story was also great in my opinion (at least down to the last 5 or so minutes of the film). The performance given by the leading lady was gripping, and i hope to see more of her in the future.

M Night's past movies made us think it would have a surprise ending that was interesting and made sense. It did not.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that the twist wasn't even really a twist, since it was so disgustingly apparent from the first frame that I didn't understand how anyone even considered it a surprise. Sad. Really, truly sad.<br/><br/>Up through a point (until I saw the creatures on-screen for the first time), it was a spooky movie. Anyone who saw both this and Dark Crystal will know where the problem lies.<br/><br/>Out of all of his movies, this was by far the worst. It was slow. It was plodding. And, for a movie that from the previews seemed intent on being a thriller, those two are instant death.  (And for those who say ""you just don't understand slow movies"", two of my favorite films are The Others and Braveheart, both of which are much slower than this one -- but MUCH better executed).<br/><br/>It wasn't a horrible movie, but it wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination. I did my best to give it a fair score (a '4') and not give it an instant '1' just to counterbalance the 10 that most people seem to be hurling at it (which is surprising since even the biggest fans of M Night's can't consider this a 'perfect' film). <br/><br/>The movie should have instilled fear, but what I got was a big steaming pile of ""That was IT?!?"""

","Like most of Shyamalan's movies, this is a drama/thriller, not a horror movie at all. The ads are totally off-the-mark and deceive people into thinking this is a horror movie. Fraudulent advertising? Well, not really. But they are encouraging the wrong audience. People who like ""Dawn of the Dead"" are showing up and being totally let down by this horror imposter. This movie would have much better reviews and a bigger audience if the ads were a little more realistic about what it is. I too was expecting a horror and was a little let down by it. But it was a great drama flick nevertheless.<br/><br/>I really liked Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt. These two actors pretty much carry the show. In fact, if it wasn't for them the movie would have been just so so. Bryce has only appeared in about 5 films and I walked away from this one wondering why? She simply has that star quality that few in hollywood possess. I'm sure we will see her in many more films to come!<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for a horror movie don't bother. But if you want a good drama/thriller then by all means enjoy the show. The acting is good, the direction is good, and the story has nice twists and turns. Just have the right attitude and don't be taken in by the ads for this movie. I will never trust an ad for one of Shyamalan's flicks again! Shyamalan is simply no George Romero or Wes Craven.

But Shyamalan has a little something extra all his own.  Most people that dislike his work simply do not understand it.  You have to put yourself in Shyamalan and walk around in his mind.  You have to pretend you're the one behind the lens of the camera. 'The Village' is a non-super natural thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.

The first hour of the movie is highly entertaining as the villagers attempt to cope with the threat of the creatures.  That in and of itself would have made an excellent movie.  From there, it begins to slide a bit as the twist becomes almost painfully obvious.  Fortunately, Night manages to salvage his reputation with an incredibly intense scene about an hour and a half into the film.  Almost everyone in the theater was freaking out at that point. From there it spirals into what you knew was happening all along and ends on a semi-sentimental, where-do-we-go-from-here note that will probably make you groan.

My only complaints are that the film should have been 90 minutes instead of two hours, and that it would have been more effective with a little less of the shock sound effects and eerie music.

The movie is fairly creepy up to that point but, unfortunately, once you figure out what's going on there's little suspense since, as a thriller, The Village is all smoke and mirrors.<br/><br/>On the plus side Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix have some nice moments together--The Village actually works much better as a romance than it does as a suspense movie.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the cast only William Hurt impresses, giving a strong and nuanced performance.  Adrien Brody seems to be channelling Dwight Frye's Renfield from the Bela Lugosi version of Dracula.  This was a peculiar part, to say the least, for an actor to take following up an Academy Award win. It's a complete waste of his talent and hopefully not a sign of things to come.   <br/><br/>On the whole The Village is an ok entertainment but I really think it's time for Shyamalan to rethink his reliance on gotcha endings--his movies have become nothing more than an excuse for the final twist that at this point everyone expects.  It doesn't really show much faith in his characters or in his ability to tell an story that will engage an audience without tricks.  I think the gimmick is wearing thin and that this is going to be his least successful film to date."

","***WARNING EXTREME SPOILERS LIE AHEAD***<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is a good director, no doubt about it. However his writing has always been somewhat... how should I put this... mundane. There has never been anything special to his scripts, the only reason his films stand out among a crowd of other equal films, is because of his incredible directing skills. Unfortunately there is an old saying in Hollywood: ""A great director can make a good script great! A bad director can make a great script good. But no director can make a bad script good.""<br/><br/>This is a perfect example for the quote in the above paragraph. The movie was dead before filming began. The premise seemed good at first. ""People in the 1800's surrounded by woods, filled with mythical and dangerous creatures."" But it was lost in it's twist. Twists have been Night's forte. This one however was not that exciting, it did not make your hair stand up like in ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"", and it did not give you great satisfaction like in ""Unbreakable"" the twist was the year was in fact around 1987 and the town elders were really modern day people from a ""traumatic experience clinic"" who decided to go and live inside a wild-life preserve to shield themselves and their children from the horrors of the modern world. The elders had lied about the creatures in order to keep everyone inside the town's borders and never stray into the modern world. Quite disappointing in my opinion. The film was not scary either, It is filled with overly blunt ""stingers"" (quick loud scary music playing as a dark shadow passes by the screen) Night has used many stingers before, but tastefully. He abused the stingers in this film as a method of last resort. There is ONLY ONE event in the film that will have you gasping. I will not ruin that for you if you have not yet seen the film, it is worth watching. And finally the film is predictable. You can guess it within an hour of when it starts.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate, and really saves the film from completely bombing.<br/><br/>The direction is very good, but as I said before it can not save poor writing.<br/><br/>

In the hands of lesser actors, this movie would have been overwhelmed by its weaknesses.  My overall score is 7/10."

","I liked this movie a lot. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I liked it. Definitely worth the $5.75. The plot was good, there was an amazing element of surprise... And I loved how this small, late 1800's(?) little village was set in the middle of the real, present day world. Amazingly thought out, I would definitely go and see it again. It's so amazing to think that he did other movies like Unbreakable, which was also an amazing movie. As well, The Village was a great name for it. Anything else would have been less fitting, and would probably have drove me not to want to see it. All in all a good movie, filled with thrill, drama, and suspense. I recommend it to all."

","While the premise for ""The Village"" is familiar, yet captivating...tried, but true...the twists and turns not only fail to deliver...they utterly undermine everything that could have made this a wonderful film. Fans looking for a suspenseful tale about monsters in the woods and a small town dealing with the color red are likely to be disappointed by M. Night Shyamalan's direction and writing. The story will satisfy until about a half hour into the film, when most viewers will begin to predict where M. Night's ""mind-twists"" are going to go, after being subjected to only a few very obvious clues. While Phoenix shines in his sadly small role (and Bryce Howard likewise turns in a performance that promises more good things to come), no amount of good acting can survive drowning in the sound of collective audiences slapping themselves on the forehead as the disappointments land home and then just keep on coming. M. Night...your gift is bringing magic back into theaters again (Signs and 6th Sense). Why oh why would you pull the magic from what could have been a very enchanting fairy tale?"

M. Night Shyamalan reminds me of someone who tried drugs once and got immediately addicted from one acid trip.  He tries to recreate that `high' and apparently hasn't been told about that thing that only happens once, movie virginity and beginner's luck.  He can't claim innocence because he keeps putting himself into his films and his cameos are weak, at best.  On the other hand, he's cast some wonderful actors in his film and the development of Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce, as a major player is an interesting thing to watch.  I'd put her in the same league with Alison Lohman.

"ObsessiveViewer","10","0","0","30 July 2004"," M. Night Shyamalan Does It AGAIN!!
","*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind Buy<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has built his career on a simple formula. First, set up the main plot and suspense. Second, have an event that changes the tone of the film and sets it in a new direction. Third, end with a twist that forces the audience to rethink everything they had just seen. This formula has been applied to Shyamalan's past three films and is the foundation of his storytelling. Of course, The Village is no different. The film follows the formula to a tee and is at the same time astounding and original.<br/><br/>The Village is about a small community in 1860's Pennsylvania whose citizens live in constant fear of mystical creatures that live in the woods surrounding them. The townspeople have a simple and longlasting agreement with the creatures 'do not to come to our village, we will not come to your woods.' However, when Lucius Hunt takes it upon himself to explore the village's boundaries the creatures decide to explore their own boundaries. The end result is a film that is hardly frightening but all the more shocking. Night adds more twists than in his previous work and even manages to blow all his other films out of the water. <br/><br/>As I said before, Night's formula consists of three parts. The second part of his formula, in which there is a shocking moment at the halfway point that changes the tone of the rest of the film, is more present in The Village than ever. The Sixth Sense had the famous, ""I see dead people"" scene. Unbreakable had the weight lifting sequence, and Signs had the Brazilian home video sequence. The moment in The Village that changed the direction of the film was brilliant. I won't elaborate for fear of saying too much but that particular moment had me in a state of shock for a good ten to fifteen minutes. The rest of the film is just as gripping and Shyamalan's signature twist is not quite as genius as The Sixth Sense but is still mind blowing.<br/><br/>Signs used the story of an alien invasion as a backdrop to tell the tale of a man regaining his faith in God. The Village is somewhat of a love story at heart, although the love story is not nearly as ""in your face"" as the faith story from Signs. Instead, the love story acts more like a subplot that drives the character's actions. This made the film much more enjoyable than the massively entertaining Signs. <br/><br/>Overall, The Village is the fourth consecutive reason why M. Night Shyamalan is one of the the most talented filmmakers around. Night has proved himself as a genius storyteller and I am looking forward to whatever he brings us next. I give it ***** as The Village is the very definition of a ""blind buy"". Undoubtedly, many people will hate it. It is, like his previous works, a love it or hate it kind of film and I happen to be one that loved it."

","""The Village"" is better than ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs,"" but still falls short of ""The Sixth Sense"" among the films of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. ""The Village"" is the movie that might have resulted had Nathaniel Hawthorne ever written for ""The Twilight Zone."" The puritanical village remains eerie even when they're not being stalked by monsters in red capes! The real story of this movie, aside from Shyamalan's return to a twist ending done right, is the young ingenue Bryce Dallas Howard. In her first starring role, Howard brings a sweetness and vulnerability while simultaneously exuding maturity and strength. It's a tour de force, layered performance that will likely make her Hollywood's new ""it"" girl. With the right vehicle, her fame and recognition could eclipse that of her father, Oscar-winning director and ""Andy Griffith Show/Happy Days"" star Ron Howard. I must brag a little and grouse that I figured out the ending, but it was only about half-way through that I realized the twist, and no one else in my group saw it coming. I'll confess that I did NOT see ""The Sixth Sense"" surprise coming, which increased my enjoyment of that film. In short, ""The Sixth Sense"" remains Shyamalan's apex, but ""The Village"" is a fun ride."

","This was actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The scriptwriter should be sent back to school - albeit for the fact that the community in which these people live is remote, the stiltedness of their language is so excruciating that it is either to the credit or shame of the actors who attempted to deliver it. I surmised that the writer/director Manoj Night Shyamalan was trying his best to make the lines meaningful and potent, however he forgot to make them readable with the resulting effect that they become flabby and laughably meaningless. <br/><br/>The actors were very patchy, and with such a strong cast, one would have thought that they were able to carry it off with more aplomb, and to be fair, in some cases this did happen. Particularly Joaquin Phoenix, who was gamely trying to make as much as he could of the script to be as naturalistic and as colloquial as possible. The rest of the actors seemed resigned to the fact that it was nearly impossible and gave in to the inevitability that this was one of the more turgid scripts committed to celluloid. <br/><br/>The plot was farcical and the cutesy homespun scenes were rather clichÃ©d. There were noticeable appearances of the furniture, all of Shaker design, or similar, rather telegraphing the fact that this was an Amish-like community but without the religion, oddly. <br/><br/>The only good point in this film was the scene in which the red-cowled creature first appeared, which would have been more chilling if the film had not thus far been ridiculous. The inexplicable leap from the apparent recent death of a child in 1897 to the appearance of a modern 4x4 was baffling - a directorial fault, or conceit. It rather reminded me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Except without humour.<br/><br/>Bunkum. And nothing else."

He also creates a terrific atmosphere of wonder and some tight suspense scenes. James Newton Howard returns to score this picture, he previously worked on Shyamalan's Signs (2002), and delivers another elegant piece here.<br/><br/>The cast is top-notch.

"Rob_Taylor","5","2","5","5 December 2005"," The Adventures of Super Blind Girl!
","Yeesh! What a dull and completely predictable movie this was! I'll admit, the opening fifteen minutes or so had promise, but it very quickly becomes apparent what is going on and what WILL happen at the end. The only real surprise moment was when the retard knifes the boyfriend of super blind girl. And, at that precise moment, any last vestiges of mystery evaporate like spilt petrol from a hot forecourt.<br/><br/>In essence, The Village tries to be a clever movie that will ""shock"" its audience with the revealed ""truths"". In reality, even Western Union would have trouble matching the telegraphing that goes on here! I mean, they don't just drop subtle clues, its bloody great sledgehammer-like obvious ones.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is the story...<br/><br/>A small community of (apparently) turn of the century/late 1800's folk live in mortal fear of ""Those we do not speak of"" (tm) who live beyond the boundaries of their community. As a result, they never leave the community. The Elders tell everyone that the world outside is wicked. However, when someone is hurt, everything begins to ""unravel"" and someone has to be sent for medical help.<br/><br/>So here's the thing. Nobody leaves the community, but apparently everyone knows there is a town nearby. Despite the fear of ""Those we do not speak of"" (tm) - of which they seem to do nothing but talk - it's difficult to imagine that someone wouldn't have tried by now and succeeded.<br/><br/>Because of the aforementioned ""subtle"" clues, it becomes apparent early on that the whole thing is a sham and that there are no real monsters. Likewise, it also is equally apparent that the ""wicked world"" outside is actually the modern day world. However, fear not, for the real surprise is actually that the supposed retard is a lunatic prepared to commit murder.<br/><br/>After about thirty minutes nothing really comes as much of a surprise anymore and you're left looking at your watch/DVD counter etc. and wondering how much longer it can be dragged out for. The answer is another hour, during which we are treated to the ridiculous concept of a blind girl being sent out to fetch medicines for her sick boyfriend whom the retard stabbed. Of course, she succeeds, along the way handily dispatching the retard to his doom at the bottom of a pit. The end.<br/><br/>Things that insulted me about this movie: <br/><br/>The blind girl who acted like she was not blind and could handily navigate through a forest she'd never been in before and then back again. Blind people are capable at getting around, but I doubt orienteering is high on their list of ""must do"" activities. Gah!<br/><br/>The conceit behind the victims who set up the community. How ironic, intentional or otherwise, that those who had been the victims of crime should choose to persecute their own children and force them to live away from modern society, medicines and services. To such an extreme that they would be willing to let people die rather than go the few miles to fetch help. Bah! <br/><br/>M Night Shyamalan.... it's becoming rapidly apparent to me that Mr Night wants us to think he's a cool, cutting-edge kind of director. A Spielberg or Cameron, or even a Burton. The reality is, he's mediocre at best and good upon occasion. The top-notch director class that he wants us to think he belongs in is as believable as most of his movies. In other words, a complete fantasy, a conceit of his own mind. He can make some effective films, but frequently ignores that which makes a movie entertaining in favour of ""clever"" plot twists which the audience has foreseen long before. As a result, his movies are never shocking or surprising, just formulaic and dull.<br/><br/>Summary: This would make a good episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but instead is drawn out into a movie that should never have been.<br/><br/>EDIT: It was gratifying to see Robot Chicken mock Mr. Shyamalan. Thanks Seth Green!"

","When you consider the enormous number of people involved in the production of a film, from studio execs, to proof readers, to gaffers and grips, it is simply staggering to think that so many things could go so far wrong all in the same film. M. Night was given a pretty high credit limit after the Sixth Sense, and deservedly so, but he's gone way over his limit with this one and hasn't made a payment in months.<br/><br/>To start, the story is atrocious and predictable. I won't say too much for fear of spoiling the non-surprises for anyone else who wants to guess along, but the plot, such as it is, is simply dreadful. I don't think it gives away too much to say that towards the end of the movie, it becomes necessary for someone to venture into the dangerous, uncharted, forbidden woods to seek medicine from another town. So who gets sent, you ask? A blind girl. Yeah, a blind girl. They send a girl without the gift of sight to wander through a forest to find medicine in ""the towns."" I guess every sighted person, including her father, was too busy fighting with their agents to go.<br/><br/>The acting was unusually wretched. Adrian Brody didn't even phone in this performance, he texted it. Not that he was given much to do. Watching Sigourney Weaver try to choke out this vile dialogue was simply painful. She sounded like she was constantly working off cue cards, and who could blame her? The worst of all, by far, was Bryce Howard as the occasionally blind girl. I say occasionally because her blindness seemed to come and go depending on the scene. When used as a plot point, she's blind as a bat and can barely find her front door from her own porch; when the ""story"" lies elsewhere, she maintains perfect eye contact with everyone she speaks to, moves casually around strange people in strange places, and races through fields like a gazelle. What? In all fairness, the actors may not have been at fault. The direction in this film was some of the worst I've ever seen. Bryce should be a smart enough actress to know that blind people generally don't stare eye-to-eye with people, but in the end, wasn't it Night's job to catch problems and correct them? When he saw an otherwise dignified cast tripping over his clumsy, awkward dialogue, couldn't he have changed it? I guess that's expecting an awful lot from the same man who served up this flaming dog turd of a story in the first place. Even in the realm of films about boys who see dead people, super heroes, and aliens, this story is HIGHLY implausible. HIGHLY.<br/><br/>This movie is an affront to good films everywhere. Since most movie-watchers are not avid fans of craft and art, however, seeking only another excuse to stare at a TV and eat popcorn for two hours, films like this will continue to be made, and the viewers will continue to surf to IMDb to give them 7's. Hay carumba...<br/><br/>***SPOILER WARNING*** For those of you who have seen it; come on! Talking to dead people I bought; super powers, I bought; alien invasion? Absolutely. But you mean to tell me that in 2005, with GPS satellites that can instantly photograph any address you want and the ever-present threat of terrorism, NO ONE has discovered that a bunch of idiots have erected a giant village in the middle of a protected reserve? NO ONE? When three dozen people from the same town all disappeared at the same time to go start this village, no one went looking for them? Give me a break."

I would have liked to have given it a higher rating, but when after watching it, you feel like you have wasted your time, it's hard to say anything good about that.<br/><br/>What I found most amazing was the high ratings in the votes.

I do like films and as i sat down to watch this one i was expecting a lot more something like thie sixth sense something that made you want to watch it again to try and piece the puzzle together or little clues to totally en-expected ending.

","It is a mystery to me how some people manage to fund and direct movies. There is no denying that ""The Sixth Sense"" is an intelligent and ingenious film. But then came ""Signs"" - one of the most over-rated movies of 2002 and now our once promising writer/director has come up with ""The Village"". On paper, this must have looked like complete hogwash, but somehow the studio thought that it had wings and would transcend the vapid scribblings that called itself a movie script. Sadly they were horribly wrong. In spite of some seriously talented actors, the writer/director managed to produce a profoundly empty and immensely boring movie where almost nothing happens. A movie where you cared little about any of the characters; a movie with about as much tension as grandmas old discarded knickers. I won't try and bore you with an outline of the plot, because it barely exists. You will come to the end of this movie, turn to your friend/partner/lover and say,""What was that all about?"". If you feel a primeval need to watch this drivel, then see it on DVD. That way, after 10 minutes, when the urge to gnaw off your own limbs sets in, you can fast forward the film and get the turgid thing back to Blockbuster before they close at 10p.m."

I DID think that the Sixth Sense was one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. Well directed, well acted... A totally beautiful, moving and sometimes frightening film.<br/><br/>But what is happening here... I think... Is some kind of Director's Ego Syndrome...<br/><br/>Shyamalans other films, including this one, have been crap... Let's face it. Perhaps his name pulls in the crowds... A bit like what a Spielberg film or a Woody Allen film would do (notice how Shyamalans' name is portrayed on the film's title). A desperate measure methinks, 'cos this movie is bad... Really bad.<br/><br/>Now... I don't mind being tricked... Shyamalan tricked me with the Sixth Sense... It's cool... It was a damn good movie and I enjoyed the twist at the end.<br/><br/>But now he seems obsessed with tricking us at EVERY opportunity!!! To the point of ridiculousness.<br/><br/>I'm sorry... I don't mind having plots twisted on me but I don't like being tricked just for the sake of being tricked.<br/><br/>I would NOT be complaining if the film was any good... But it ain't. It's bad... Slow... Laborious... AND finally... Ultimately... Ridiculous!!!<br/><br/>This film is for Shyamalan fans only... Perhaps he knows his fans go to his movies NOT to enjoy them as such, but to try and work out the FINAL TWIST at the end...

All the people are living in harmony, but there is also some terror.<br/><br/>During the film I started already having the feeling that this terror was created by the older people themselves. After a long time watching, which became very very boring, one of the young people goes to the city for a medicine. This appears to be the late 20th century (I had this feeling already).

","This movie was too bad to merit any other comments, except to say that some good talent was put to poor use. However, since I am obligated to submit 10 lines, I will attempt to point out specifics. It seemed to me that the movie was trying too hard to make an unworkable project work. Perhaps if a director of the caliber of Ron Howard or Clint Eastwood had undertaken the task, it might have succeeded. I found the portrayals to be strained and unconvincing. It seemed that it was too obvious that the performers were acting - as if they were just sleepwalking through their parts. As far as the writing, actors probably need to believe in a project to offer up an inspired performance. I got the feeling that the actors felt just as I about this vehicle."

There's nothing new about the plot... even in Big Fish we can find something allusive to the idea of people isolated from the rest of the society, expecting to get the perfect life.. The love story is not intense... there isn't any reason to get scared... But worst of all... really predictable... On opposite to the 3 other movies from this director, we can easily and very soon predict, what's supposed to be the great mystery of the story. By the way, i think these director's movies are decreasing in quality. Sixth sense was great, one of the best movies i've ever seen, with a huge impact. Unbreakable was also good... but not the same thing... These last two, Signs and now Village... but mainly village... are bad movies in my point of view. Well that's all i have to say... Bye all!"

","Other than one or two half-hearted performances, nothing about this film worked. It was utterly predictable (who didn't see that end coming a good hour or more before it arrived???), lacking the surprise twist of even one of the lesser ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. The dialogue was as hokey as I've ever seen in a film in the past five years. The ""scary"" scenes lacked any genuine suspense or sense of dread. Did you get a load of those monsters? Goodness, they made the Tree Monster in ""From Hell It Came"" look downright frightening by comparison. Adrien Brody, one of the greatest living actors, was utterly wasted as an unbelievable mentally challenged character. Poor Bryce Dallas Howard--who I'm sure is an outstanding actress if given a decent role--was as flat here as a bottle of Sprite that has been open for five days. Good old William Hurt was so over the top he was almost unbearable! All in all, this dull turkey has little going for it. Too bad, because ""Sixth Sense"" was such a gripping and emotional film."

I'd managed to avoid the spoilers before going to see this and so went in with few preconceived expectations as to what sort of film I was going to see.<br/><br/>So what type of film is it? Without spoilers, it's hard to describe. It's definitely odd, with an otherworldly feel to it at times. It's the sort of film that would seem perfectly natural with a Rod Serling voice-over before the closing credits roll.<br/><br/>It's not the best film I've seen this year, but it's hardly the worst, either. It did, however, pass one important test - my wife stayed awake through it. That may not seem like a big deal, but it is. If any movie drags for more than a couple of minutes, she's out.<br/><br/>Some of the developments are easily guessed and some actually sneak up on you, yet it still maintains a good level of tension and audience involvement. With the right frame of mind going in, it can be an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The bottom line: Like most Shaymalan films, I really didn't like it too much (some, I actively despise!)

It turns out the village is NOT a human zoo aboard a spaceship. Maybe that would have made the film more interesting.<br/><br/>You can tell from the opening scene that the cemetery looks old. The fence is skewiff and has not been painted for awhile. This seems very uncharacteristic for such fastidious people. <br/><br/>The village seemed far too prosperous for being a backwoods type of place. In that era even glass windows were a luxury, so to see a widow living alone with her son in a huge rambling house seemed very unlikely.<br/><br/>Their stories of 'the towns' seemed horribly over the top. Those boxes of secrets in their homes were casually left in full view. And does this village never get anyone passing by, or any hunters or trappers going through their woods?<br/><br/>So we have a bunch of emotionally scarred people playing at being Victorian re-enactors thanks to a billionaire's fortunes. How did these city folk take to living off the land so easily? Wouldn't the killing of their livestock mean a huge threat to their livelihood (who WAS killing the livestock and WHY?). And just how many children did these handful of people manage to have?<br/><br/>You can see why I found it so unsatisfying with all these questions. Plus the leaden dialogue.

The year is 1897 and I thought I saw a television and then I decided it was just my imagination because they didn't have TV's back then. Then I see a photograph a guy is holding and I see the picture is more modern just by looking at the clothes the people in the picture are wearing and you see a end of a car too in front of a building where the people are standing. When Ivy climbs the fence, she is on a road that is from our time and then a cop pulls up and you can see the car is from our time we're living in now. I totally did not get this movie. What was with the cars and the paved road and they never explain it and the movie ends poorly in my opinion and because of those two things, I give this movie one star.

The actors looked embarrassed to be in such a mess. All the camera tricks were contrived, too. The script is awful. Read Roger Ebert's review; he says it all. Some of the critics liked it because of supposedly hidden messages, but that's not enough to save this turkey. When the audience laughs during the serious parts, you know you're in trouble. I'd like to see the director do a film without a twist. Just tell a good story. Don't keep trying to make The Sixth Sense over and over. I hope this doesn't end his career.

The only redeeming factor of the movie is the great acting by Bryce Dallas Howard, although I was confused on whether her character was blind or not until later in the picture.

"annaily","6","1","2","26 August 2018"," A missed opportunity
","I like this movie but it is flawed.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is fairly boring and nothing happens. Thats the biggest problem. Its just so...... boring...... I didnt want a horror movie, or even a thriller really, but i did expect it to be at least somewhat tense. This movie did not build tension for me. It did not bring out the performance from the actors that it could have.<br/><br/>There are also some problems with the logical consistencies. <br/><br/>For one, It's revealed that the monsters are the adults dressing up as them. This is despite the fact that they make extremely non-human monster noises. I mean the gurgling and clicking and snarling and growling is not a noise a human could make, and even the mentally disabled boy makes it when he dresses up as the monster. I suppose its possible the adults are using secret modern technology to make the noises, but the mentally disabled boy doesnt seem to be capable of doing any of that due to what we have already seen and known about him.<br/><br/>Also about the mentally disabled boy... At multiple points throughout the film, Noah's freedom from rationality is used as an excuse for twists that have no underlying logic of their own. <br/><br/>Second, the big reveal that it is modern day world isnt shocking in the slightest. Its not even creative or original. It just makes you annoyed. The parents (none of them notably religious, mind you) would let their children go blind and die rather than just take a day trip to get some medicine. They could even keep it secret so it cant be explained by them not wanting to reveal the truth to their children. If the point is that they left modern society to protect their children, it makes no sense that they let the boy die in the beginning instead of letting Lucius (or an adult) go get medicine. Thats not very protective, now, is it?<br/><br/>Third, what would happen when the elders die and theres no more monsters?<br/><br/>Fourth, theres no reason for them to speak in the old-timely dialect and idioms. Being hidden away from society, the elders could talk like normal people, its not like the kids could ever know that the way of speaking is that of a modern technologically advanced society as opposed to a historical one. Why would modern people bother to speak in the village's peculiar, archaic idiom? Because if they spoke like modern people it would tip us off. Modern words are not deleted for the kids' benefits, as there is not real benefit to it, but instead deleted for the audience.<br/><br/>Its things like this that make this movie annoying. Shyamalan's need to set up his twists deforms almost everything else in the film. The characters are not speaking to each other, but to us. They are not existing in a logical universe, but one that would deceive an audience. <br/><br/>Fifth, If this is the real world, which it is very much implied it is, what is up with blind Ivy's ability to ""see"" auras and to make her way through dense woods unaccompanied? These arent things that exist or could happen in the real world. <br/><br/>Its not a bad movie. Its a pretty good movie. But its not NEARLY as good as it could or should have been. It is a missed opportunity. And that makes it infuriating, which really takes a decently good movie and just makes it not worth watching."

I enjoyed it and my only complaint would be that the story moved pretty slowly, but it was a good way to spend two hours. The acting, plot and soundtrack were all excellent. One thing I enjoy about M. Night's films is that there practically no explanation of what the movie is really about - you watch it and the story and all its mysteries unfold. 'The Village' is a perfect example of this. The film opens with a small community living their normal lives, except for that there's monsters in the woods. The plot centers on a girl that must go through the woods to the towns to get supplies. My favorite part of this movie is how it deals with disabilities and mental disorders. The main character is blind, and another character has a mental disorder. The theme of the movie was also thought-provoking. Is it right to run away from your own mistakes?

Where there are humans, there isn't any innocence...or is there? I have to say, this movie wasn't the best of all movies, but it wasn't the worst.

Shyamalan does deliver his typical twist, that I found a bit predictable here, but I leave that part for you to decide.<br/><br/>A village in the late 1800s/early 1900s lives in isolation from the other villages. It looks like a Quaker village, simple lives, no electricity, basic water, simple clothes. They don't allow the color red, there's some sort of aversion to it. No one is allowed to wander into the woods because there are creatures there who may attack you. The villagers stay in the village and they are safe. Or are they?<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix delivers a powerful performance as Lucius, a young man who doesn't say much, but what he does exhibit is extreme courage. He is attracted to Ivy, a not-quite-totally blind girl, brilliantly acted by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, the famous actor/director from Happy Days and Apollo 13. Their attraction is one of the key story lines. <br/><br/>Other key story lines are Adrien Brody as Noah, somewhat of a village idiot. Something not right upstairs. This craziness borders on obsession, and that is a key part of his personality and the film.<br/><br/>Finally, a wonderful performance from Sigourney Weaver as a single, middle-aged woman with an unobtainable attraction to William Hurt, who plays pretty much the leader of the village, Edward Walker. There is a core group of elders, who meet to discuss the direction of the village, and that is the final key storyline. Why do they meet? What do they discuss? what are these boxes they all seem to have? Intriguing.<br/><br/>Events happen that drive action, and if you paid attention during the movie, you have an inkling of the ending. It's a collision of hearts and minds with no clear resolution, except it gives you hope that, somehow, all will work out well for the village and its people.<br/><br/>See The Village.

There are couple of twists in this movie, and watching this movie back in 2004 in cinema (i was a huge fan of M.

The whole cast is great in here, and although not everyone received opportunity to shine, they all did a pretty good job in my opinion. Direting is good, but movie drags a bit there and there mainly because of script - it is good but inconsistent.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is in its atmosphere, which is created beautifully here (superb sound design (picture has to be seen with the best possible sound system) and good cinematography). There are some great suspenseful scenes as well - kudos to great direction in those scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Village"" has problems with pacing, but overall experience is very positive. It's best parts are not in conversations (which drags a bit due to script), but in overall mood and some great suspenseful scenes as well as feeling that something isn't right in here and question ""who or what is behind this all"". When all questions will be answered, some of them are very disappointing, but most of them will force you re-think and probably re-watch this movie twice - and it is worth seeing it more than once (but two times will be definitely enough)."

","Sorry if this review took a while to come out, just been busy with school.<br/><br/>Anyways we continue on with Shyamalan Month as we go onto his 4th film, The Village. Now this isn't the point in his career where I felt like he went into complete insanity (thats for next time), but this isn't his high point either. But lets get started on this.<br/><br/>First lets start out with the positives. I feel like from a technical stand point it actually isn't all that bad. The cinematography is nice, some the acting is good, it has cool scenery, it has an AMAZING score,and is generally good. Its mostly with the story that the movie falls apart.<br/><br/>While the story isn't as bad as Shyamalan's later movies, it still has a lot of problems with it. I won't really go into much detail, mostly because most of the problems are technically spoilers, but I will talk about the acting. Some of the acting is actually not that bad like Adrien Brody's character and Joaquin did pretty good, but some of the others actors seemed really bored and uninterested, also some of the dialogue was pretty hokey.<br/><br/>Anyways the movie was just alright in my mind. I probably would have liked it more if there was better acting and a more well structured story.<br/><br/>Also, for those who have seen the movie, you are probably wondering what I think of the ending. Well here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>https://40.media.tumblr.com/cb5ec065dc2ae5ffd0f5b9d53440f312/tumblr_ inline_nt3jtin9Jt1rximkx_540.jpg<br/><br/>That is all.<br/><br/>Final Score: 5/10"
"skybrick736","7","1","2","7 June 2015"," The Village 7/10
","As good as The Village is as a film, it's pretty apparent to see here that M. Night Shyamalan started to stray away from his strong suit, the supernatural, and go towards different story lines. The Village is extraordinary just from a casting standpoint; bring the likes of Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. Each character had to be precise and some highly articulate in order for their roles to be pulled off perfectly. It's not often to say that I felt Phoenix's character lacked while Bryce Dallas Howard portrayal of Ivy Walker was terrific. Shyamalan was lucky to get such a great group of actors and actresses for his film, along with his consistent partner and great composer, James Newton Howard. Howard's score for The Village is just as good as it was in Sings and it really sets the tone and mood for the story. Shyamalan tried to pull off a twist like The Sixth Sense with many clues, and short cut-off scenes to the past, but it just didn't get the hype he hoped for. It's not a horror film which many people thought because of what the trailer represented but an unsettling drama with only a couple intense moments. I'd still recommend The Village to anyone but I also see why so many people were disappointed because it isn't the typical Shyamalan film by any means."
"DomNickson843","Null","1","2","15 May 2015"," Good Until The 2 half
","Spoiler Alert!!! This film does have a lot of interesting build up and great suspense. I liked the idea of the villagers being afraid of leaving the village because a monster is said to appear and slaughter you. That whole part of the storyline was the most interesting part of the movie, I thought. The acting isn't very well done but hey it's a shyamalan movie and most of his movies have not so great acting. The only good movies I thought he made were The Sixth Sense and Signs anything after that was pretty much what the village is. It's pretty much a boring film that could have been good if he only put a little bit more creativity and action in the films. Overall this film is pretty boring and the 2nd half I thought stunk. I give this film a 4 out of 10. I'm really sad to say because it seemed like it had a lot going for it and the 2nd half just ruins it."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","2","16 April 2015"," great moody light horror but horribly weak ending
","Covington is an odd isolated village. There are mysterious creatures ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" lurking in the woods. They are supposedly attracted to specific colors and the villagers wear the safe yellow when they are close to the woods. The villagers have a truce with the creatures. However suspicious animal carcasses suggest that the truce has been broken. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to other towns to get medical supplies. He is denied by the town elders and his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver). Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the blind daughter of the chief Elder Edward Walker (William Hurt). She is kind to village idiot Noah Percy (Adrien Brody). When Ivy and Lucius get engaged, a jealous Noah stabs Lucius. In desperation, Ivy goes out to get medicine with the help of her father.<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie for about 2/3 of the time. It has a nice moody vibe. At time, it borders on horror. It's a really fascinating movie. I wish Bryce Dallas Howard is better at playing blind. I also wish William Hurt's character doesn't reveal so much. It deflates the movie. Her odyssey loses much of the tension. Instead of fearing some mysterious boogeymen, the audience is left with nothing more than the random falling into a hole. It tries to recover with a strange mysterious thing. I wish it stayed with the surreal turn. It would work infinitely better if William Hurt would shut up. None of it could really saved this from a truly weak ending. People really hate it when their TV show ends with these kinds of reveal. I think Shyamalan got a taste of the reaction."
"XweAponX","10","1","2","13 April 2015"," Lots of great things here
","This is not just some film about some kind of Amish colony, or any group of religious society shut-outs. If there is any religion proffered by this ""Village"", it is not mentioned. It is not important.<br/><br/>It's also not any kind of ""Horror"" film, which is what it was promoted as. Although it has it's suspenseful moments. These people are basically normal, except for a few things: They will not ever return to ""The Towns"" which is what they call the outside world, and they won't wear Red, or go into ""The Woods"".<br/><br/>Or else, ""Those we must not speak of"" will come. Whoever or whatever they are, becomes something we in fact focus on, but in true M Night fashion, this is not what the film is about.<br/><br/>What we have is a basically idyllic home for a group of people. The Elders have their secrets, and the young people are being given a set of ""Traditions"". But one kid, Noah (Adrien Brody) is a little different. He is referred to as ""An Innocent"" but it is clear even before we start seeing what is happening, he is not an innocent. He rocks back and forth in his chair as if Autistic, but he has speech. So, this character may have his own world in his mind which he lives in. We don't know much about that at first, but it is clear that Noah is a more complex individual than he lets on, and he is more intelligent than he is given credit for.<br/><br/>The bright light in this film is mainly Bryce Dallas Howard, this was the first time I saw her in a film. She pulls off the Blind girl fairly believably, except her eye movement don't track a blind person's. A Blind person would not focus on anything- But that is a hard thing to duplicate if in fact you can see. Actually, Lili Taylor does a believable Blind girl in the 5th Season X-Files episode ""Minds Eye"", the closest portrayal I have ever seen - Her eyes wander off camera, never looking directly at who she is speaking to.<br/><br/>The elder characters talk about people in their lives who had suffered violence, people who had been killed in various violent ways. There is more to this talk than just remembrance, it is an important point.<br/><br/>In their artificial idyllic village, these people live as if in the 1800s, sans any modern medical technology. This is a point brought up a couple of times, by the character played by Joaquin Phoenix ""Lucius"" (Which may or may not be a reference to the film Gladiator where he had a nephew by that name) - He wants to go to ""The Towns"" to get Medicines. But the Elders give him all kinds of reasons why he can't do it.<br/><br/>So we think this film is about these kids being raised to not depend on modern gadgetry and to avoid offending those that can't be spoken of, who live in the woods, so that is another taboo place. The entire younger generation of the village has been raised to believe in a set of Absolutes, you can't wear Red, you can't speak of the things that will come, and you can't go into the Woods. And, things happen that appear to validate these restrictions. So this false facade is upheld by a thin veneer of what Elder Walker (William Hurt) calls ""A farce"".<br/><br/>A farce that if the kids knew about, it would destroy whatever sociological experiment is being conducted in The Village.<br/><br/>And we think this film is about Lucius, who wants to marry Howard's character ""Ivy""- Until M Night's famous ""Reversal"" happens.<br/><br/>It's at that point, Night slides in the reasons why the village exists, who the elders really are, and who the unspeakable creatures really are. But mainly, it's how a young blind girl can save the life of the one she loves, without the elders breaking any previous oaths they had taken. It's ""Yellow Riding Hood vs the Big Bad Wolf"" all over again, and ""Nothing is as it Seems"" as usual in Night's films.<br/><br/>There are things Night likes to do as a Director, characters being shown in reflections in an object, which he does at the beginning of ""Unbreakable"", many other little trademarks, they are all here. Mainly there is wonderful imagery and rich character development, but the Village itself and the lifestyle of the people therein is the focal point of the film, it paid off that the whole cast was actually trained how to live in such an environment. You believe that they made all of their own clothes, they husband their own animals, they grew all of their vegetables, they made their own homes. If you can believe that, then the rest of the film falls into place."
"taylor-chicklin","9","1","2","5 April 2015"," Very misjudged and under appreciated
","""The Village"" may not be as high up there as Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", but I still see it as being one of his best. That being said, don't let the trailers fool you. The miss marketing of the film is one of the biggest reasons this film did so poorly. The trailers make The Village out be be horror/monster movie, so naturally people went into the theatres expecting a scary thriller of some kind. What nobody realized was that it was actually romantic drama piece in hiding. There are dark psychological elements which drive the story along however, but it's only a frame as the main focus is on the relationship of the characters, as well as the enigmatic mystery that lies just beyond the borders of the village. Granted the twist at the end isn't the most jaw dropping, but it's still intriguing and adds another layer to the story. The acting is incredible! Bryce Howard Dallas as Ivy Walker is still one of my favorite performances today, as well as Adrien Brody as Noah. The visuals are as well hauntingly beautiful. Over all, this is a very under appreciated film, but if you're going in expecting a horror/thriller be prepared to be disappointed. The Village is a romantic drama piece with elements of dark psychological themes. It's a film I recommend to check out!"

","Better than the 6th sense. I know people are going to disagree, but Idc, this film is a true masterpiece by M. Night Shamalyn. Bruce Dallas Howard kills it in the role, and so does Adrien Brody, and Joaquin Phoenix. I luv the twist ending, I didn't see it coming at all, I adore twist endings, so that was pleasing to see! I'm not going to reveal the surprise ending, you'll just have to tune in for yourself!! Sigourney weaver was also very appealing in the role, it's always pleasing to see her in ANYTHING, she's one of my favorites! I felt that the costumes and sets were great also! The film kept an eerie tone and mood to it all the way through till the end, which was integral to the movie itself, because of the subject matter it deals with."
"doc-ahmad-almaiman","10","1","2","15 March 2015"," My Opinion
","I believe this is one of the most underrated films of all time. This is a film that people just did not get right at the moment of release, and it is quite unfair to say that things started to go down hill for Shyamalan from this point onwards. It still had that beautiful dramatic complexion that all his previous films had, especially SIGNS whereby you weren't sure what exactly was going on. I'm just saying that I love this film. The cinematography is immaculate, JNH's score is as breathtaking as it ever can be. The dialog is very unique and noteworthy. I can't really see why people are so ticked off with the ending. It's a fair ending. It makes sense, it's totally bizarre in the sense of 'wow' 'WTH' or 'unexpected', because that's the kind of ending people enjoy. I'm just glad that this film managed to get a cult following even after all these years, because it really is a misunderstood film."

It reminds me of some of those sombre Chinese films that were popular back in the 1990. My girlfriends and I were so excited to see this movie, thinking it was going to be a fun movie. Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies. I decide to give it 7 out of 10, higher than it deserves but still somewhat warranted."

","I'm spoilering right from the start here, so get over it.<br/><br/>There's this village, see, and you're supposed to think it's late 19th century - they all talk old fashioned and don't have any technology. Oh, and they are apparently isolated by Things We Don't Talk About which live in the woods, with whom they have an uneasy truce. Taciturn Lucius wants to visit the towns for medicines. He gets engaged to blind Ivy, only to be stabbed by nutjob Noah. Ivy is deputed to set off through the woods to get medicine.<br/><br/>The big shock moment - this is M Night Shyamalan, remember - is when Ivy nearly gets run down by a truck: this is actually present day, and the isolation is because the Elders decided to keep their loved ones safe by creating this remote community. And the menacey things are to scare everyone into staying put.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this is moderately atmospheric, has a mild sense of menace, the shock moment works fairly well the first time you see it, and there are some very good performances (notably Adrien Brody as mad idiot Noah).<br/><br/>On the negative side, it takes an age to get moving, the shock moment doesn't stand up to repeat viewings, and one wonders too often about things like where they get the oil for lamps from.<br/><br/>I find myself wondering if I would have made the same comments following a first viewing, and if I hadn't been exposed to the diminishing returns from Shyamalan's movies in the meantime."
"davydteather","6","1","2","30 November 2011"," One of M. Night Shyamalan's better films.
","I saw this movie with the expectation that it was going to be so boring, depressing, atrociously slow paced, poorly acted and downright deplorable. It is a little slow paced and a little scary in some scenes, but the acting was executed just brilliantly. Joaquin Phoenix really came a long way in this movie unlike in signs, which was absolutely horrible. He did a decent job in that movie. But I felt he did a better job in this movie. I felt this movie could have been a little more scary and a little more faster paced. The ending was a bit of a disappointment. You find out it is set in the modern time and not in the time of the 18th or 19th century. I give The Village a 6 out 10. Like I said, it could have been more scary, faster paced and not set in the modern time. It is not a great movie, but it does have some good moments. It is much better than Signs and The Sixth Sense."
"kdnor2011","7","1","2","1 September 2011"," Not Great, but looks great
","The Village is that one M. Night Shymalan movie that splits people right down the middle, some like it, some don't, but not many people love it or hate it. When the trailer was first released for this film, it made the movie look like some kind of supernatural thriller, and it looked really cool. Unfortunately the trailer lied to people, the movie is actually more of a romance. Sure there are a few thriller elements in there, but people went in expecting a thriller and got a romance, and were very disappointed. Personally I like this movie, but it does have some flaws.<br/><br/>For one, this movie can get extremely boring in a few places. And I mean almost fall asleep boring. Also, most of the characters are extremely forgettable. The two leads are fine, Sigorney Weaver is a little memorable, and you got a feel a little sorry for Noah, but the rest are just forgotten once you stop watching the movie. It gets way too overly dramatic at times, and it's a little pretensious.<br/><br/>But the film looks fantastic, can someone please explain why Shymalan is a terrible director, every single one of his films I've seen (everyone except Praying with Anger) looks great. The lighting is great, the use of color, and every shot is done well. The acting is good for the most part. And I actually really like the twists, a lot of people, even fans of the movie don't like them, but personally I thought they were pretty good. And I like how you can analyze the film. I won't spoil anything, but the last twist brings up some questions that are worthy of being analyzed.<br/><br/>I like the Village about as much as I liked Drive, both have great things about them, but they are dragged down by being too much about the style and getting really boring at times. So if you loved Drive, you should love this movie. Personally I like it, it isn't as good as Signs or Sixth Sense, but it is better than Lady in the Water and Unbreakable (bring on the hate.)"
"jlt86","7","1","2","9 March 2011"," Suffered for Being Advertised Wrong
","I just watched this movie the other day when it was on TV. I saw it in the theater when it came out but I didn't really remember it too well. After watching it for a second time, I realized that it was a pretty good movie with a genuinely interesting plot. In fact, all of M. Night's movies are good (except for The Happening...which is the movie we will not speak of). The problem with all of his films including The Village is that they are advertised wrong. The Village was advertised as a horror movie when in actuality, it's not. Ever since The Sixth Sense, everyone has been expecting M. Night to scare them...but this is not what he does. Most of his movies are fantasy-dramas with engaging stories and characters you come to care about. Although scary, even The Sixth Sense wasn't a horror movie. The Village succeeds on so many levels such as in the set design, atmosphere, characters and twist ending. Everyone needs to give M. Night some credit as a master storyteller and quit criticizing him for not being scary enough. His films are enjoyable when you're willing to enjoy them for what they are."
"gregg_burns","9","1","2","15 February 2011"," His last good movie as of 2011
","Why does every movie have to be about 'figuring it out'. This movie was about that, but it was also about creating an interesting story that filled your sense of wonder with a really odd world you cant quite grasp. Good characters, good plot, and its just original.<br/><br/>I liked Signs for similar reasons. I think MNS's strength was putting a realistic spin on sci-fi and fantasy. He had a unique way of introducing you in to those realms from the point of view of a realistic, non-fiction character. The Village is another example, and it succeeded.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand the Lady in the Water and The Happening. Those movies started out interesting, but then they turn in to clichÃ©, pop culture, gimmicky movies. The Village manages to keep the intrigue all the way through. Its unique and worth seeing."
"neenahhh","7","1","2","3 February 2011"," Creepy, but not so much
","Before actually watching this movie, I did some research. I saw tons of people complaining about the twist ending, so I was wondering what in the world happened that made people hate it so much. The hate made me even more curious to actually watch the film, so I did!<br/><br/>I can say that I found this movie to be quite good, but then again, I don't think it's for everyone. If you enjoy thrillers that sort of play with your mind a little, then you should give this a try. Don't be swayed by the negative comments!<br/><br/>All the actors in this film were perfect. Their performance was simply splendid. Every last one of them. Especially ""Ivy"". Bryce Dallas Howard was brilliant! Her acting was amazing. Words cannot describe how good she was. But seriously, she was great.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) I found the idea of the ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" to be great. It creeped me out, though. I had to lower the volume every time the scenes seemed to turn scary. But it was good. I never would have thought that they were just the Elders. I think it would have been better if there were really creatures like them. The whole idea of them, made up the creepy factor for me. Until now, I keep on glancing towards the door, half fearing that one of them will show up.<br/><br/>I loved the relationships between people. All the characters had their own little quirks. Ivy's blind. I liked the parts where she was talking about people's colors. It reminded me of synesthesia, which I find very interesting and hope to learn more about it. Lucius is a very quiet and reserved man. But he does have feelings. He tries to keep it bottled up inside, but it gets out eventually. I never would have expected that he would stop being the main character halfway throughout the film. I mean, who kills off the main character? Unexpected twist, but very welcome. It reminded me of Death Note where that antagonist dies. Noah, a grown man who has some sort of developmental problem, likes Ivy. When he finds out Lucius and Ivy are getting married, he gets crazy. I was not expecting that at all. And the Elders? Well, they have their own messed up story. To sum it up, everyone's got their own little thing going on. It was what made this movie what it was. Great character development! Even the minor characters were great! I loved the ranger guy. His kindness and compassion- trying to help Ivy, even if meant losing his job.. Great. Gives me hope for the world. (/SPOILERS)<br/><br/>This movie gave me a Shutter Island feel. It's like, you think you know something, but you really don't. The ending was just like Shutter Island's also. An open ending. You ask what happened? Well, it's up to your imagination, my dear. To sum it up, it was a great movie! M. Night Shyamalan needs to make more movies like this."

","How can this movie be soo good? It's been years since my first watch, and I didn't find this movie was all that good, but now I do.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is a beautiful story about a group of people that lived outside the civilization in a small village and only some of the older guys knew there was life out there, just like Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"". It's interesting to notice how the love between father and son/daughter is unconditional in this film as it is (or should be) in real life. Edward Walker risked everything in that village to pursuit the real happiness of his daughter, even thought nobody supported his decision. <br/><br/>The fear from the unknown is another thing that this movie portrays like in real life. Put yourselves in the place of them. If you were born there, and everyone told you that there was no life out there, would you not believe? How would you know if you don't have opportunity to leave? And some people here are criticizing the fact that there would be incest. If you watch this movie carefully you'll see that it's THE MOST insignificant detail. This isn't part of the message the movie is trying to show.<br/><br/>The best movie I've watched this year undoubtedly (yes I know we just began, but anyways)"
"antetomasov","8","1","2","22 November 2010"," A story about love and courage (and some other stuff)
","This movie is an another great work from the master director Shaymalan and his partner music composer J.N.Howard who wrote a beautiful music background for this movie. Actors did a great work and the stand out is the female lead Bryce Dallas Howard who plays a beautiful and courageous blind girl. There is a lot of going on in this movie, I liked how you are able to feel the love between Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix). Lucius is the bravest boy in the village and his heart is big, he cares deeply about his friends but more than so he loves Ivy. Ivy is a blind girl, but her spirits are high and she is very kind and beautiful, with a courage that matches that of Lucius. Those two are most likely the brightest stars of the village. Well, the emotions are there for you to feel in this film, there is a tragic mad character that also loves Ivy and he out of selfishness attacks Lucius because he wants Ivy all for himself. This shows the thin line between love and hate, at the end the madman is all alone and instead of getting Ivy all for himself, she of course leaves him forever and he is left in his own personal hell. The one thing I would change is, when Ivy is in the forest she encounters one of the monsters and tricks the monster to fall into a pit. Owned by a blind girl, oh yeah! But I would keep that to be the actual monster because in the movie, the monster turns out to be the tragic madman that wanted Ivy for himself dressed as a monster. I would keep it a mystery because there is a legend that the strange creatures inhabit the forest after all. That would make Ivy's victory more complete in my eyes. That is the only thing I would change. This leaves the question of - what about the retard that stabbed Lucius then? Well he would most likely be kept locked inside his home for the rest of his life, so I don't know, it is f... up to kill him, but also it is f... up to support this asshole for the rest of your life. I guess an accidental death is a good solution for this character. And finally near the end of the movie, Ivy encounters a kind young man form the ""towns"". He is more of an exception to the rule because an average guy probably wouldn't be eager to help Ivy as this guy was. We see the average type guy a moment later, he is played by Shaymalan himself, that guy advises the kind guy not to talk with people while they are on the job. For a moment I was afraid the kind guy will listen to the asshole guy and not help Ivy. Thankfully that doesn't happen. So the message of the movie is? In our modern world we lack the connection between people that people have in the village, but we have technology to make our lives better (medicine). So maybe that kind guy was an example of how we need to be in our modern world, have some humanity and innocence and technology at the same time. Also, Ivy's younger sister was funny, she wanted to be with Lucius also but that was probably just a child like infatuation. Or was it? Childhood lasts for as long as you follow your dreams."

","I've liked a lot of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, (""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" jump to my mind immediately) but to me at least ""The Village"" didn't quite live up to expectations. The mystery supposedly hidden in this movie about this village faced with mysterious creatures living in the woods surrounding it isn't particularly well-hidden. I figured that out about half way through when I realized that one of the men was wearing a very modern-looking suit, whereas the movie sets you up to think of this as being set somewhere in the past. I realized at that point that what we were dealing with here wasn't really a horror movie; it was more of a psychological study of what was essentially cult-like behaviour: a group of people who have chosen to isolate themselves from society, and who use fear as a method of mind-control to prevent people from leaving. In that, it didn't really provide anything of earth-shaking importance - it simply painted a portrait of life in this ""village,"" and it did so with a number of problems hanging over it. To me, it was inconceivable that such a village could be kept totally isolated, given the need for people in the ""real world"" to guard it (as the ending of the movie makes clear.) That bit of unreality aside, the predictability of the story took a lot of enjoyment away from it, as did the strange decision to have the characters speak in that stilted manner of speech that they used. That seemed to have no logical purpose other than to help to create an atmosphere that convinces you that you're dealing with a community that existed generations ago. Why would they adopt that manner of speech? What difference would it make to them? It really didn't make sense, and frankly it became quite annoying after a while. With the words used and the way the lines were being delivered, it was kind of like watching a movie that starred a cast of emotionless and over-proper Vulcans (if you get the Star Trek analogy.) I have to say that I was disappointed. Shyamalan can do (and has done) a lot better than this."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","4","1","2","21 September 2008"," Yawn
","I seem to be the only person who recognizes how poorly written M. Night Shyamalan's films are. Is it because I'm a Hitchcock aficionado? No. I just have an ability to read narrative arcs and see where things are going. It was obvious that Bruce Willis was dead in The Sixth Sense, that Samuel L. Jackson was the bad guy in Unbreakable, and that, well, Signs sucked altogether. Perhaps I demand too much, ot perhaps it's because I see in MNS a burgeoning Spike Lee or Steven Spielberg- i.e.- someone with a great eye but no knack for storytelling. My advice: become a cinematographer, or write better tales! This, especially, goes out to MNS, since he writes his films, and all are 'twist ' films- dependent upon that final reveal.<br/><br/>This film had potential to be as great a work of art as that other great fictive The Village- from the 1967 TV show The Prisoner, but it fails miserably on all levels. MNS wouldn't know a well-written script if you beat him with it. Am I repeating myself? Let me range a little more- I am tired of mere cinematographers posing as auteurs. Learn narrative arcs. Perhaps I do expect too much- like character development, plausible plots, etc. and tales not based on a twist, but situations that logically and/or organically grow out of situation.<br/><br/>Yet, a quick review of professional critics' reviews was astounding, for most seemed to miss that this was a film not set in the 19th Century- instead believing that some time tripping had occurred. As for the extras? There's no commentary, thankfully, for the featurettes are fellatric enough- including a heinous diary by Bryce Howard, and an execrable bit of another of MNS's bad home movies from childhood. He seems to put far more care into his childhood films selected for the DVDs than he does his actual grown up films. In short, MNS delivers another film with a good premise, but lousy execution in all aspects. I've given up on him as a film director, but I'm sure he's got his next twist film already in the works. (Sigh!)"

I don't understand what people don't like about it. There's a great message to it, and people just don't see it.

","During a recent discussion of horror movies, this was one of the groups' favorites. I've not seen it, so I asked what it was about, and they told me the plot. It sounded like a book I read recently, and I came to IMDb to see if it was adapted from that book: Running Out of Time, by Margaret Peterson Haddix. I found that the only references to influence were to Wuthering Heights and King Kong. From the plot summary and description of the movie here on IMDb, the plot seems to be taken from Running Out of Time, with a few changes here and there to make the movie scarier. Perhaps Shamalyan read the book as a youngster and doesn't remember; I prefer not to think that he actually stole the basic plot."

The acting was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this movie, to anyone. Very disappointing. But not terrible! Sometimes the movie could be interesting but ultimately didn't really have me scared or spooked or freaked out. The monster's looked almost comical at parts, with their big red capes and bony structure. This movie just give's people a reason to spoof it. Not terrible, just not great.

","Yes, there were some fine elements of drama and romance, the cinematography was well done throughout, and the acting was, for the most part, very good. I was very into the movie all throughout until the end. The end, to me, was like ""Signs"" in which the aliens that were supposed to be threatening mankind and really scary turn out to be rather wimpy, killed by water (they invade a planet that is 70% water and hello, it is going to rain at some point)and can't even get out of the pantry. I had hoped for better from ""The Village"" but the big, scary monsters ""of whom we do not speak"", turn out to be created by the leaders of the community. If the monsters were just faked by the leaders, how did they accomplish the deep, booming sounds that shook the community when the monster(s) entered the village? If you watch that scene again, knowing that the monsters are not real, it doesn't make sense. I am hoping that in future projects, M. Night will be able to do better with his twist endings that have been expected of him after the brilliant ""Sixth Sense""."

","**********SPOLIER INFO *************** I have too say that I was disappointed in this film. I went in anticipating a scary story about a legend. One that according to advertising and publicity would scare and inspire. It did neither for me. Don't get me wrong, I loved the concept but felt that it was poorly delivered. To me, this movie sent the message to hide from your fears, to run and to lie. The so-called victims in this movie turn out to be nothing but a group of scared individuals who run from their lives because they can't deal with society. Not a real scary twist of events. Overall, the acting was terrific, very good performances and the shooting locations were beautiful. Just not a mind blowing plot and I felt that it had sent out a poor message."

The laughing guy(can't remember his name) really creeped me out in a cool way. The story was good for a good part of the time, but what ruined it for me was the ending. Shyamalan, sir? What were you thinking or should I ask ""What weren't you thinking?"" The twist at the end was so weak and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so. Usually blah endings don't bother me so much, but you expect a good twist at the end or at least a decent ending, but to have the twist as lame as ""omg, this isn't set in the time frame we thought."" Come on. You can do better. I've seen ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" and I know he's capable of better than this twist. ""Signs"" obviously doesn't count, because has no real twist exactly and most of the film was great and nothing was ruined. As far as I'm concerned this is Shyamalan's first mistake in the movie making business. I know he's capable of better. Let's hope he doesn't repeat the same mistake again like he did with this one.

","A cross between Jane Austen and Stephen King, and this is not meant as a compliment. I have no idea why Shyamalan chose to make this movie so drawn out and dull in the first hour. For most of the movie this is almost your standard TV soap fare with just a bit of horror thrown in; so very dull and pointless. The chemistry between would-be lovers Phoenix and Howard is practically non-existent. (Not surprising; both of them stem from Hollywood's inexhaustible supply of talentless, nepotist youth.) What saves the movie from total failure is the clever twist ending, typical of this director. So it ends up being like a clever ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Clever twist, but why all the protracted tedium in the first two-thirds? Do we really care to watch the overrated Phoenix and the ineffectual Howard talk and flirt for hours? ""Twilight Zone"" episodes would never have been so effective (the good ones) had they lasted 90 minutes. That's the main problem with this film."

The emotional impact was astounding. We can all relate to virtually any character in the novel, which only makes the film that much better.<br/><br/>THis was a great story from beginning to end. I never knew what would happen. Strangely enough, the neo-classical score was fantastic. WIthout the music the movie would not have been the same. I'll admit, i even bought the soundtrack! While this is one of my favorites i can see why some people didn't like it at all. It wasn't a conventional film by any means. No standard plot or obvious themes. You really have to dig deep to appreciate it (something many aren't willing to do). It takes awhile for the plot to get moving so many people will loose interest before it gets exciting.<br/><br/>This film is a testament to M. Night's flexibility as a filmmaker.

","A while ago, i watched ""The sixth sense"" on TV. It was the first time that i ever watched an m. night shyamalan movie, and, being a pansy, i turned it off after i saw the people hanging in the hallway. And yet, i was still intrigued. I loved the masterful storytelling, intricate plot, and great acting. Then, i watched signs on TV. Once again, i loved it!!! Signs has a great plot with a neat twist ending, and i also loved how everything had a purpose and came together in the end. By then, i had fallen in love with Mr. Shyamalan and rented ""Unbreakable"". Not as good as the last two, but still Extremeley enjoyable!!<br/><br/>Then i rented the village. From the first scene (which happens to be of a funeral), i could tell that this was not going to be great. Adrean Brody and Joaquin Pheonix's parts are both dull and boring. Hell, i couldn't even tell that the blind girl was blind for about the first 15 minutes Then there was the ""monsters"" who lived in the woods. When i saw the marks on the doors, i felt that those could be used for something really creepy, but, alas, i was wrong. The monster costumes were so garish i felt like i was watching scooby-doo. I basically had lost all hope for the movie by then.Then, Joaquin Pheonix's character is Horribly injured, for no reason other then to get the plot (or lack there of) moving. Bryce Dallas Howard's character then goes off into the woods, where she is chased around by adrean brody (in a full body monster suit) until she kills him. She also meets with some really weird things (a gaping hole in the ground, a tree with bottles attached), and yet nothing much happens. Bryce Dallas Howard basically walks by them.<br/><br/>Then, we meet the twist ending, and herein lies the spoilers.<br/><br/>So, we return to the village, where they bring back up the concept of the ""Forbidden Box"" Which they BARELEY mentioned at all before, and we learn the truth. The village is actually just a group of people who suffered trauma who wanted to escape from modern life. Wow. So scary isn't it? And then, We expect the movie the movie to have about 5 more minutes. But noooo, we then watch intently for another 20 minutes as boring people get medicine (boringly) and Bryce Dallas Howard makes her long trip home. <br/><br/>Some stuff i forgot to mention was M. Night's Trademark use of color, but unfortunately, one of the colors was a grotesque yellow. Bleh.<br/><br/>By the end, this movie had CRAPPY acting, A CRAPPY plot, CRAPPY writing and a CRAPPY twist.<br/><br/>I hope that ""Lady in the water"" will redeem M. Night Shyamalan, and even though it has Bryce Dallas Howard (who i hope is a lot better now), it also has paul giamatti, who is a GREAT actor who i LOVED in American Splendor and Cinderrella man. And there you have it folks, a blow by blow of the worst M. Night Shyamalan so far. But, i always give people second chances, and i still love his other movies, so, i still respect him.

","This is not about how good or bad the movie is. This is about reviewer after reviewer effectively blaming M. Night Shyamalan for not providing the ""scariest movie evah"" promised by the advertising campaign.<br/><br/>People, do try to wise up. Films get made first, and then they get promoted, invariably by entirely different people. MNS made the film he wanted to make. It had elements of suspense and horror, and mystery, and historical drama. Some of those elements were excessively played up in the advertising campaign, but that advertising campaign did not even exist until the whole movie was already in the can.<br/><br/>I'm not going to pass judgment here on how well MNS achieved what he set out to do, but it's patently obvious, if you sit and watch the movie with an open mind, that The Village is not a horror movie, it is a love story. Just because a movie isn't quite what you were led to believe it to have been, does not make it ""the worst movie ever made"". Comments like that are unjustly denigratory to a studiedly unemotional yet seething with undercurrents performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the absolutely revelatory acting of Bryce Dallas Howard, who made Ivy Walker an unforgettably luminescent character."

","This review contains mild SPOILERS. If you want to know all the plot twists, don't read on. I'm not going to reveal the big secret, which I'm sure you can find in the message boards here. But it would almost be impossible to talk about this movie without revealing anything...<br/><br/>******************* This movie is not great. In fact, it's pretty bad. The characters are flat and one-dimensional. And they don't really say much that isn't intended only to move the plot along. The style of dialogue is old-fashioned and contrived; which I'm sure is on purpose, but nevertheless very annoying to listen to.<br/><br/>The plot centers around a quaker-ish looking community, set in a time and place we are unsure of at the outset. The villagers live in a meadow surrounded by forests, in which lives ""Of Those We Do Not Speak."" What a strange title. Whichever villager came up with that one surely failed Creative Writing 101. We catch fleeting glimpses ""Of Those"", which I must say are pretty creepy looking creatures with long red robes, big scary heads and long skeletal ""fingers."" They don't really do anything that we can discern, they just walk around looking creepy. The deal is, as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, ""Of Those"" will leave them alone.<br/><br/>However, one villager, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to ""the towns"" to get medicine for the sick people. This requires a romp through the forest. He is forbidden by the town leaders. But when Lucius himself is injured, his would be fiancée Ivy (Bryce Howard) pleads with her father to go get the meds. Her father (William Hurt) happens to be the town's leader, and after some pondering, decides to let her go into the forest that harbors the monsters. Alone.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that she is blind? So before sending his blind daughter into the forest by herself to find a road some miles away, her father reveals a big secret to Ivy so that she can manage herself better while alone and blind in the forest. He gives her instructions about how to reach the road and sends her on her way. Something happens in the forest which is maybe a bit unnecessary and left unresolved. And thats about it without revealing whether or not she makes it, gets back to Lucius, etc.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great actors in this film that weren't given a lot to work with. It is a flat movie with a few tense moments, but many more that are melodramatic and simply plot driven. I like Shayamalan, but this one was a ""miss"" for me. On the other hand, I would categorize it as one of those movies thats almost so bad it's GOOD. I kind of had fun watching this bad bad movie and moaning and groaning through it. Ignatius J. Reilly would understand. And if you don't know who that is, go read ""A Confederacy of Dunces."" It will be a much more entertaining use of your time than watching this film."

It's amazing that she played the part of a blind girl, and Bryce isn't blind herself.<br/><br/>What really bugs me is the ending. It's so . . . . . dull.

","My wife and I somehow endured the whole boring movie The Village. We feel that the previews misrepresented the end result and that viewers should be warned. We had seen the previews and had rented the movie expecting to see a horror movie. Instead we got a character study where nothing really happens. Besides that there are too many occurrences that ask the viewer to accept unreasonable possibilities.We are expected to believe that the blind heroine Ivy would be able to make her way through a forest, climb a barrier and then luck into finding a sympathetic ranger on the other side. Not just a sympathetic one but one who just happens to have access to the drugs that she needs. He gets them without question? Come on, how real is that? Of course, the hero, played by a sullen Joaquin Phoenixis is somehow able to survive the multiple stab wounds and resulting infection incurred from Adrian Brody until she returns. Amazingly the blind Ivy has no problem finding her way back to the village that no other person has found in years. I was willing to concede that a town could have been like this eons ago but with the SUV/TV scenes, we all know that such a town could not happen in this day and age. I guess the village was in a no fly zone as well. The fact that there really are no monsters in the woods and the town elders continue the facade at the end of the movie is mind numbing as well. The other shame of this movie is that former Oscar winners are wasted in such a boring misleading movie."

The creatures are called Those We Don't Speak Of, if memory serves correctly. One day a young male villager goes into the woods and comes back. That basically ticks off Those We Don't Speak Of and from there on things start to get ugly. The plot really is kinda genius if you take the time to think it over after the movie ends.

","Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" plays like a good old-fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between ""The Crucible"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby. These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone. However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods. It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life. The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value. ""The Village"" requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion. In this respect, the movie works quite well.<br/><br/>Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances. But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense. That ""The Village"" is the weakest of those films thus far (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience."

","There are many reasons why people see this movie as a disappointment. The most common one is that they were expecting it to be a horror movie, and it turned out to be something entirely different than what it seemed to be. This is also the reason why I was disappointed, but not necessarily because I was tricked into watching it, while I wanted to see a horror movie. It's more because it had a lot of potential be a great horror movie. I liked the idea of the 'fake' plot about the creatures from the woods, and the truce being over. I really liked it. Durring the time when it still seems that the creatures are real, when they start invading the village, I found it pretty scary. It had a great atmosphere. Then the drama came, with all the boring dialogue, and I started to realize how much potential this movie wasted. That's why I am disappointed. Not because of all the drama, dull dialogue and the fact that I was tricked into watching it, but because it could've been something special."
"Poseidon-3","Null","1","2","9 August 2005"," Unusual to say the least, but interesting to those who aren't expecting blood 'n guts horror.
","Rarely do viewers agree completely on the merits of a film, but there is a relatively small collection of movies that place viewers into camps that either actively like or dislike them, sometimes rabidly, and this is one of them. Marketed (incorrectly) as a horror film, it is actually a mystery/character study. Viewers with preconceived expectations are nearly always let down. Those with very low levels of anticipation tend to enjoy it more. The story concerns a rather remote, rustic settlement that is surrounded by thick woods. The villagers live by an almost Amish or Quaker-like code and speak in old-style English. Despite their peaceful and almost Utopian existence, there is always the constant threat of invasion from or destruction by a group of forest-dwellers referred to as ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". These creatures are occasionally glimpsed in the night, often by those young men who are assigned to watch the border of the village from a tall tower amidst a perimeter of glowing torches. Meanwhile, the youths in the village find themselves exploring the first blush of romance as they begin to pair up with one another while the Elders advise and counsel the settlement. Eventually, the tenuous relationship between the villagers and the creatures is sorely tested and one member of the settlement must attempt to reach a nearby town in order to save a beloved fellow villager's life. Ultimately, several twisty and (possibly) shocking plot elements are revealed which place the movie into a whole other category. This area tends to cause the most controversy among viewers. A remarkable cast was assembled and most of them do a very nice job. Howard, who emerged out of near total obscurity, performs admirably as a blind girl who winds up having at least as much strength as anyone else in the village. Her actual playing of blindness is, at times, unconvincing, but her acting abilities and her presence before the cameras are startlingly fresh and engrossing. Phoenix is excellent as the young man who has feelings for her. Unfortunately, he doesn't have quite as much screen time as one might like, but he is exceedingly good when he's on. Brody's performance is a matter of taste. He plays (literally!) the village idiot and at times seems to really over-play it. He and Phoenix, however, have one face-to-face encounter that is a stunner and Brody's role starts to make more sense upon a second viewing. Some very solid seasoned actors turn up as the Elders. Hurt and Weaver (who co-starred years before in ""Eyewitness"") share a sort of tormented, unfulfilled romance and both give thoughtful, well-modulated performances. Other nice work comes from Gleeson, Jones and Weston as fellow Elders. One thing that director Shyamalan excels at is the setting of a mood. The film has a beautiful, yet haunting, pastoral look and feel to it. The audience is lulled into a warm and serene environment, but one that is tinged with dread since it's always clear that something it not right in the woods. Alert viewers will likely be able to guess the major plot twist near the end long before it is revealed, but that doesn't mean there aren't still a few surprises and jolts along the way. There is also an almost surreal scene between one villager and one creature that is harrowing in the extreme. If nothing else, the film is thought-provoking and a conversation piece, but for those in the right mood, it is also a fascinating and endearingly strange cinematic experience."

","When I rented the movie I was expecting a horror movie and I was wrong. It was high drama, intense, a thriller, a beautiful love story, a story about life and about change. Visually it was beautiful - some images were like a piece of art. I particularly liked the images of the sisters sweeping and dancing on the porch. The music was incredible. I kept playing credits over and over just to hear the music. I then went out and bought the soundtrack. The acting was like more of a stage play then an everyday movie. There was an unexpected twist and the end of the movie that really made it extra special. I would highly recommend this movie."

","what I don't get is if Ivy finds out that the story of "" Those who we do not speak of"" is a lie then why does she get so terrified when that mental dude comes and tries to scare her? I mean she's blind in the first place so how does she even know that he's dressed up like that? She didn't even make contact with him, what if it was just a human, after all the footsteps should have sounded like human ones.<br/><br/>Also, I thought that the ending was really lame like, so she went out to get medicine and came back. So what. Is she gonna continue living in a village full of lies? It's just back to the beginning isn't it? I mean now she knows about the lie but nothing changed in the movie. Is she gonna tell everyone? Are they gonna get discovered? Like what was the point of the movie. IMO it was a complete waste of time."

","This was easily one of the finest films of 2004. When I saw it in the theater, I didn't guess the twist until it was right before my eyes. But with that aside, this film has a very powerful social message, which M. Night was going for. Its disappointing to hear people hated this film because it wasn't scary enough for them or the twist was too easy to guess. Those people are ignorant and bypassed one of the most powerful films of the year. And besides, the acting was magnificent. Bryce Dallas Howard, I must say, gave an Oscar- worthy performance. She is extremely talented and turned her role of Ivy into someone you can sympathize with and cry for. She gave enough to her character that nobody would leave the theater saying ""Ivy was obnoxious"", she was simply amazing. Each scene was so beautifully crafted and photographed that every one seemed like a Vermeer painting, if this film had come out closer to Oscar time, it would have probably nabbed nods for Art Direction, Cinematography and Costume Design. Overall, The Village is a powerful work of art that should not be ignorantly overlooked. I bought it on DVD the day it came out."

I suggest watching it as soon after the first viewing as possible. This movie is not ""The Sixth Sense"", it is deeper than that. However, it does share something very important with ""The Sixth Sense"". It shows that a good quality movie can be made without loads of profanity and such. ""The Village"" is a thinker mover and I highly recommend it for those of you who enjoy a movie that you can chew on a while after the credits roll.

","Terrible movie. I have to say, Shaymalan has a talent for interesting story lines, but absolutely fails when it comes to finishing. Sixth Sense was the only movie I've seen where Shaymalan has been able to finish what he started. Signs, Unbreakable, and The Village all fall far short of the mark.<br/><br/>As always, you can expect a story twist from Shaymalan in this movie, so you are already looking for it. However, this story twist descends so far into fantasy that Shaymalan spends five minutes of the movie spelling out the twist to you... because you'd never get it otherwise. Shaymalan does the equivalent of explaining a joke to someone who doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Other than that, there are some interesting plots that are never followed through on, and some amazing shots and colors.

","This film started out very creepy. the setup was great, but then they broke the #1 rule of scary: If you show the monster in broad-day-light it is no longer scary. Fury monsters are not scary to start with, let alone when we have already seen it in the sunshine. So from then on I didn't care about the characters or story at all. It just became annoying as it was all so obvious what was going to happen. Oh and my god why would they keep the costume under the floor in the room where they put the naughty people? Is that the safest place they could think of in a whole village? By the end we were all just groaning at the lame plot and hoped it would all end quickly. the twist in sixth sense worked because it was a surprise, this one did not work because they spoiled the surprise by showing the sesame street monster. <br/><br/>So to sum up: Great start, Bad middle and Disgusting pointless end.<br/><br/>I do feel for M.

'those we don't speak of' are just not scary-looking enough. some testosterone-pumped young men would try attacking them with pitchforks or something. <br/><br/>5. haven't any of the young people noticed that when those we don't speak of' visit uncle fred and auntie mary always seem to be missing?<br/><br/>6. what about the rest of America? we are supposed to believe that some official has been paid to redirect air traffic. so, what about the FBI and other law enforcement agencies? wouldn't they wonder what is going on in this community? are the kids being educated properly? are they being abused? are people (noah) getting away with murder? to say nothing of the fact that the tabloid TV channels would have reporters crawling all over the place.<br/><br/>7. this community could not be viable unless it was huge. there would simply be too much inbreeding. but a big community would make the 'secret' impossible to keep.<br/><br/>8. the continual restatement of how much ivy and lucius love each other destroyed the love story that the writer/director had developed.<br/><br/>9. hurt's performance was the most wooden i've seen since pinocchio (or hurt's last performance).<br/><br/>bottomline: lazy writing. the basic premise was okay but it could not be sustained and shyamalan didn't face up to that."

What Night is trying to say here, in case you are dense, is that we are the village and the elders use fear to control our actions and thoughts. Which is probably why the movie got so much negative word of mouth, Americans tend to dis-like it when they contemplate what could be the true nature of our existence. Reference Plato's ""The Cave"" for further information, if you dare! Ms. Howard was in particular very excellent in what could very well be the leading role.

Well done sets and costumes place the village at the beginnings of early America, surprised to say when a SUV pulls up to help her get medicine for her boyfriend is a little but depressing. the monster being a guy in a suit is depressing, the fact that the village is in the middle of a game preserve owned by Hurt with a private security force to keep the 20th century out if depressing, it was good movie that keep me on edge but the ending was so cheesy that I was truly laughing . This would have been a great movie but like with Idenity (a J Cusak film) the ending kills the entire story. The acting in the movie including the sexual tension between Hurt and Weaver and over all make it a good movie to see just the last 10-15 min of the film are bad.

"rainking_es","8","1","2","19 March 2005"," Shyamalan blooms again
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of those privileged minds, like Alejandro Amenábar, which have learned their lesson about how to tell stories, how to thrill, how to frighten us, how to attract people to the cinemas. Maybe they're not renovating the Seventh Art, but they sure can defend that sentence that says ""the movies are meant to entertain and make fun"". They're the first ones in the class when is time to tell disturbing plots, those who will keep your attention till the very end, and then will knock you out with a final twist. That's just and old trick with a big disadvantage: the second time you watch ""The 6th Sense"" or ""The Others"" you will feel a 99% less of excitement but I think that's a risk that is worth taking.<br/><br/>After the delusion of ""Signs"", Shyamalan reborns with ""The Village"", a precious moral fable about a group of villagers that are besieged by some creatures who live in the adjacent woods. Shyamalan demonstrates that he knows how to go beyond that spectacular-final-twist-of-the-story from ""6th Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"", that he can move us with innocence, and tenderness, even with a nice love story. He shows us only the things we need to see, he guides us, he handles us and his camera as he pleases, and he's good! His actors direction is just splendid, because it's not enough to have a bunch of great actors (Weaver, Hurt, Gleeson, Brody) no, you have to lead them with wisdom and talent, and M. Night never neglect his actors.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is just like a fairy tale, one of those that our grandfathers used to tell us, one of those we listened with our ears wide open one of those you wouldn't want to end.<br/><br/>Yeah, we need Greg Aronofsky, Michael Haneke, or Takeshi Kitano; but we also need directors like M. Night Shyamalan, we need some escape, some fantasy, we need mystery. And he is quite capable of giving that to us every 2 or 3 years.<br/><br/>PD: Pay attention to Bryce Dallas Howard. Pay attention to that red hair, those blue eyes, and that enigmatic beauty, 'cause she's gonna set tongues wagging. And if you don't trust me just take a look at the credits of Lars Von Trier's next work: ""Manderlay"". Get prepared, Nicole Kidman! *My rate: 7.5/10"
"ListenBucko","4","1","2","15 March 2005"," Style over substance yields disappointment
","I saw the ending coming within the first five minutes of the film, which is unfortunate, but is the result of M. Night Shamalyan's heavy handed role as writer, director and producer. Having no one else to answer to, nor creative partners in the major shaping of the film. He had no one to point out that an astute movie viewer can very easily discern the ""hints"" given in various ways, and know nearly everything. The problem seems to be that Shamalyan is determined to duplicate the success of ""The Sixth Sense;"" clearly the backers of this film were hoping so, too. However, it's another ""Signs"" (also extremely predictable); a 'creepy' premise and the dressings of a suspense film, but with none of the satisfaction. In ""The Sixth Sense,"" I didn't see the end coming. However, if I'd seen ""The Village"" and ""Signs"" first, I probably would. I don't like being ""gimmicked"" and expected to buy into something contrived. No, in spite of having collected a fine cast and crew, the movie fails because it doesn't tell a good story. Shamlayan seems to have aspirations towards ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits"" and other stylized movies and programs of their ilk. However, he's missed the point: they weren't good because they had an angle or a style, it was because they were GOOD. but it was the storytelling that did the job. Here, we have a flimsy construction of a story. However, even if you start getting caught up in what you suspect is happening, don't be surprised to find it losing steam on you. So we go down another level, and see if it's the people & the relationships that are the golden key. Nope. A fine cast, who worked well together, and some scenes did work nicely. But they worked nicely in spite of the movie; when people really clicked and connected each other, there sere sparks. But they couldn't carry the film, as it wasn't designed that way.<br/><br/>William Hurt seems very well cast, and plays his character with great honesty and compassion, but there are only a few moments in the whole film that bring the best out of him. What's Sigourney Weaver even DOING in this movie? The character showed some promise earlier on, but it fizzled out and the she became one of the crowd. Joaquin Phoenix did a creditable job with his character, but it seemed more natural to him, and as the actor, he wasn't having to try to fight through the material. If Adrien Brody hadn't been playing Noah, I doubt I've have been interested at all. Brody makes it work because it's HIM. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty effective. Bryce Dallas Howard shows a lot of potential, but this was over her head under the direction of Shamalyan. She was not believable as a blind person; however, she clearly has the talent to be able to do so, IF the director had given her the coaching needed. She was very committed, but I doubt that the director ever told exactly what he was after. I'm not sure HE'S sure. All of the character moments seemed to come from the actors' own efforts, and kudos to them. Shamalyan just doesn't seem to direct scenes well. No surprise, if he's sitting in his trailer at night thinking about the concept and how he can tweak it even more to force us into paying good money to see this movie. The music (featuring a wonderful violinist)is also manipulative. Yes, every suspense/horror film works better with a good score, but the passion of the music at the ""critical scenes"" far outweighed what we were getting from the screen. So they seemed loud and out of place.<br/><br/>A lot of the technical work is commendable. The music was good, but not used well. The cinematographer had many wonderful shots all throughout the film.... except that, in places, you could tell where Shamalyan MADE him take a self-consciously ""gimmick"" shot that didn't fit in with the rest of the camera technique. Scenic design was good, VERY good, and it provides important clues about what's going on. That's by intelligent design, but the lack of involvement in the characters lets the eye wander too much, and you are given more to know than you should at points. The costuming was effective in the same way, and leads you to some conclusions.<br/><br/>All over, it's not a BAD film; it's watchable, and you'll like most all of the characters. However, if you've seen ""Signs,"" then you've pretty much seen this one and vice versa. My recommendation is to see ""The Sixth Sense,"" skip these other two, and wait until Shmalyan comes out with some material with depth. Perhaps the people who were signing the checks this time, looking at their returns, may indeed themselves consider to tell Shamlyan that there'll be no more of this. He's a very talented director, but his writing isn't on the same level, and directing your own work might seem egotistical to some. He'd be much better off concentrating on direction, take on a co-writer, and working with a producer who'll twist his arm at the right times. Movie making is a COLLABORATIVE art, and it's high time that Shamalyan learns this for himself and learns how to trust other people to do theirs. I will not go see his next offering until some of my more trustworthy fans scope it out first."

","I'd expect higher production values of a summer blockbuster styled movie. Everything from the costuming to the sets to the dreadful monster costumes could easily have come from - and fit the budget of - a typical high school production. Literally, there is nothing in this movie that could not be easily replicated on a stage, especially if you had a trapdoor.<br/><br/>As for the actual plot, it's like a slumber party scare. Although I didn't know the ending before I saw the movie, I figured it out the instant I saw a secretive tribe of elders meeting.<br/><br/>This movie is really meant to be a morality play. It's meant to pose a question about utopias and whether we should retreat from the modern world, and furthermore how do we keep out the influence of the modern world after that retreat. Some people criticized Signs as a religious themed morality play instead of a sci-fi movie; I'm wondering if this movie is arguing for atheism instead of religion. It shows how religion and superstition keep people in line and keep people from wandering off the path, like the expression that religion is the opiate of the masses.<br/><br/>At any rate, whether you're actually looking for a morality play or whether you're seduced by the false belief that this is a thrill a minute horror movie, it is to be assiduously avoided."

","I have been a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's movies since ""Praying With Anger"". Although I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, he is, in fact, a neighbor of mine. ""The Village"" is his first colossal disappointment. It falls short on many levels, in many ways. Firstly, the dialog is painful and often inane. It is hard to fathom how such a poor script got by even the most basic editing. The musical score is too loud, too jolting and not 'in tune' with what is occurring on screen. The story is a boring mess. William Hurt is a strain to watch as he speaks with painfully and inappropriately long pauses in a monotone that baffles. Signoury Weaver is wooden and plastic. Her presence detracts from the film. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquim Phoenix are the only actors to perform with depth and feeling. They are the only saving grace of the movie and are a pleasure to watch. The gifted Adrien Brody stuck with the role of village idiot is a non-factor. The movie isn't a complete waste as Night delivers some intriguing footage from time to time, enough to keep it from being a total bore. But the tale itself is so absurd and pointless if not unjust and the 'twists' so lame that I give the film only a 4 out of 10."

"Cpartak","8","1","2","11 March 2005"," See this film, and draw your own conclusions
","I want to start of by saying that I've never had a more difficult time of rating a film than I did for ""The Village"". The reason for this being that it's not simply a movie which you love or hate, it's one that you think about after you're done watching it. Perhaps this wasn't the case for everyone who saw it, but it certainly was the case for me. I went into the theatre with certain expectations knowing that this was an M. Night Shyamalan film. After his three previous films you come to expect a certain essence that you wouldn't find in any other director's work. Shyamalan's films have their own style, look, and to a certain extent their own feel. I personally could not mistake any of his films for those of another director. With that having been said, ""The Village"" doesn't disappoint as far as acting and especially cinematography are concerned. As with his previous films, Shyamalan does a great job of extracting superb performances from his cast. This is especially true for Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers a first-rate performance as a blind girl who has the ability to see perhaps more than those without her affliction. Adrien Brody is also very good as the village idiot (no pun intended) who has more below the surface than meets the eye. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the cinematography and camera work in this film are excellent as well. The views of the village, especially at night, are perfect for setting the dark and sinister tone of the film. Shyamalan also does a great job of setting up the film's frightening moments by carefully and gradually bringing the audience in with his superb use of the camera lens. We're not scared of what's on the screen, we're scared of what what might be lurking behind it. This is one of the reasons that I enjoy Shyamalan's films, he never goes for the cheap thrill and instead chooses to create an atmosphere that will keep the audience guessing until the very end. <br/><br/>The final thing that I want to touch on regarding this film is of course the screenplay. It's difficult for me to label it simply as good or bad. I feel that it goes beyond those simple definitions. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Shyamalan is an extremely talented director and writer, and more importantly an absolute original. However, with ""The Village"" I feel that he wanted to express his opinion and at the same time send a message about today's society and the fear that people live in. It is this message that I feel may be the one downfall of this film. I believe that many people didn't get it, while others who did simply didn't agree with it. And there are of course those that didn't want to watch a film with a message and simply wanted to be entertained. Either way I think that the one thing all those people had in common is that they talked about the film after it was over, just as I'm talking about it now. (I strongly doubt that ""Freddy Got Fingered"" received 23,000 votes on this website). The point here is that ""The Village"" is the type of film that makes you think and want to talk to someone who's also seen it. I recommend it to anybody who enjoys films that are beyond the norm, but my advice is to watch it without any preconceived notions which can be established by reading reviews, including this one."
"J. Spurlin","Null","1","2","4 March 2005"," A silly ""Twilight Zone""-like plot chokes off the affecting love story in its subplot, for a very disappointing Shyamalan effort
","This is a bad half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode padded to 108 minutes. Except the padding itself is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The people of an isolated village are cut off from the rest of the world by their fear of the strange creatures that surround them in the woods. But the creatures seem to break their years-old alliance with the villagers when they breach the barrier between them and mutilate animals to show their displeasure.<br/><br/>The director M. Night Shyamalan and his photographer Roger Deakins have given us yet another beautiful-looking movie, which also boasts a fine score by James Newton Howard. The ensemble cast, which includes William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver among the village elders, is fine. I didn't much care for Adrien Brody as a quirky simpleton. It's a shallow performance, though competent enough to do no major damage.<br/><br/>What kills the movie is Shyamalan's godawful script. It includes not one but two twist endings. The first twist is so predictable that he'd have been better off just revealing it to us from the beginning. Shyamalan would have had an easier time making it all plausible if he weren't so taxed with the effort of concealing his surprise. As it is, there are far too many things that don't make sense.<br/><br/>The second twist ending is so ludicrous, he should have jettisoned it in the first rewrite. Shyamalan makes the whole movie feel like amateur night with this silly stunt-ending and by picking the worst possible moment to make his cameo appearance. He comes off like a self-satisfied magician winking at his audience as he reveals his trick and cocks his ear for the applause; all we're doing is groaning and rolling our eyes.<br/><br/>When I said the padding is actually good, I'm talking about the love story between Joaquin Phoenix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard. Their story is warm and affecting. Too bad it's choked off by a lot of dumb gimmicks."
"vfrickey","7","1","2","3 March 2005"," Shymalan swings, he hits, he... puts one in left field.
","M. Night Shymalan is making a name for himself not only as an auteur in the psychological thriller genre but as a moralist. So my ""7"" score is partly due to the fact that ""The Village"" fails to live up to its hype, or to the rest of Shymalan's work, for that matter. Of course, Shymalan is a money maker these days, so the producers probably felt pressured by the money men to make us see ""Village"" commercials in our sleep prior to release.<br/><br/>The problem with the media blitz, of course, is that almost NO movie can live up to a full-on 21st century movie ad campaign. The nice sense of schadenfreude when something like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" goes flat can be satisfying, but it should never happen to one of Shymalan's films.<br/><br/>""The Village"" just plods along most of the time. I've spent a lot of time in woodland clearings at night, because a lot of my relatives lived in the woods or close to the woods or between the bayou and the marsh on a levee, and he captured that ambiance very well... but I didn't feel as though the movie was going much of anywhere until halfway through it, because the pace just lagged.<br/><br/>The pace of the film does pick up about halfway through the film, which is good because I was about to duck out for a lined notepad and pencil to start writing the foreshadowing down so I'd remember it in the second half of the film - or out for a nice meal, something.<br/><br/>And that's as close as I'm going to get to spoiling the film, except to say that the Shymalan twists at the end of the film were predictable - unlike ""Signs,"" which starts off making you sure you're watching a psychological thriller despite the spooky 50's sci-fi setup, then makes you sure that everyone in the house, especially the Mel Gibson character, is a head case - and the next day, guess what - you're in a modern science-fiction movie which then morphs into a play all about faith... and there you are leaving finger indentations in your hardwood coffee table or the plastic armrests of your theater seat.<br/><br/>""The Village"" is, unfortunately, nowhere near as unpredictable as ""Signs."" The final, chilling plot twist occurred to me a third of the way through the film, and halfway through, I was certain of it. And I was right. Ditto with the second-to-last chilling plot twist.<br/><br/>I can't decide whether it's the actors' fault or Shymalan's that the characters all seemed to have gotten into a private stash of quaaludes before every scene until halfway through the film (of course, William Hurt acts like that all the time, so was it type casting in his case?) I mean, I was appropriately moved when I should have been, but not moved in the way I'd come to expect of Shymalan's work. It's just not fair being M. Night Shymalan, you know?

","Despite its other shortcomings, I did enjoy the fine craftsmanship evident in this interesting film. The score, cinematography and sets were beautiful, creating a unique and engaging atmosphere. In a market that's over-stylized and CG'd-to-death, it's a rare pleasure to find a scary film that gets its chills from the environment. Bryce Dallas Howard's acting was very good, as was that of the distinguished actors relegated to small parts. The story was interesting, with the added bonus that it dealt with one of the most topical subjects of our time: fear and its effect on societies.<br/><br/>That said, I was never fully emotionally or intellectually invested in The Village. I found the plot to be overly complex and unfocused, with too many characters spread too thin. The romance wasn't convincingly moving, the horror convincingly scary, nor the mystery convincingly engaging. The script was littered with a combination of patches for the logical holes in the story and misdirecting details. Undue attention was drawn to elements which had little to do with the story, while significant items were treated so lightly I almost missed them. If not intentional, this could only be the result of a director who was too close to the production to see the overall picture. Whatever the reason, much of the emotional impact of the story was bled away by these distractions. The over-casting of the smaller roles was another distraction. When Brendan Gleeson, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are on the screen, one expects them be a significant part of the story.<br/><br/>According to M. Night Shyamalan's comments in the Extras section of the DVD, the plot of the film changed significantly quite late in the production. This would certainly help to explain the meandering storyline. But the problem here runs deeper than that. I'm left to wonder if NIght himself wasn't spread too thin writing, directing and producing this film. The Village contains a great deal of creative energy which never seems properly directed."

","I found this movie to have many layers of meaning - more, even, than referenced by the writer/director himself in the interviews/commentaries. It was a thriller of the even, slow-paced, old-fashioned kind. It was a romance. But, beyond that, I found not-so-hidden messages about society and religion.<br/><br/>Is the ""evil"" that they tried to escape from inherent in all of us - i.e., physical and mental illness - and impossible to escape from? Is the ritual and symbolism imposed by the elders a metaphor for established religion? The creatures metaphors for the devil? Does the youngster taunting the creature strike a decidedly Calvary-esque pose? Seems like there is more behind the movie than even the write-director speaks about."

","I thought that The Village was great. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. M. Night Shaymalan did a great job at making the film and i thought the acting was tremendous. I hope that they make part 2 because there still is a lot in the movie that isn't explained. Example, who the other elder was that was a ""those We Don't Speak Of"" and it didn't say if Lucius Hunt got better and if he got married to Ivy Walker. Also if there Village is ever discovered by the outsiders. Kids aged under 12 might get a bit scared when Ivy is in the forest on her journey so make sure there is parental supervision. Anyone older than 12 would probably be able to see it unless they hate suspense."
"Dilophosaurus","Null","1","2","7 February 2005"," Some questions...
","THE VILLAGE is well shot and has the kind of tone that one would expect from this director.<br/><br/>As with SIGNS, however, after the film has finished you begin to find flaws and unanswered questions coming to mind...<br/><br/>*SPOILERS!*<br/><br/>The scenario to this film is that a group of intellectuals have decided to create a Utopian, seemingly ancient village that is cut-off from the modern world. To stop villagers leaving they have created a legend that claims scary creatures lurk in the surrounding woods.<br/><br/>Okay, here are the questions that came to mind as I ejected the DVD from my player...<br/><br/>1) Why do the elders (who're the only ones who know the truth) need to speak/act/dress like they're from the past? Surely a Utopian village with modern language but no modern appliances/peaceful atmosphere would suffice - after all, the youngsters born in the village would simply assume that this is how the world should be.<br/><br/>2) The elders know about modern medicines. Why don't they keep a cache hidden away in case of deadly illnesses/accidents?<br/><br/>3) Why did Noah dress up as the creature when he stalked Ivy in the woods? She's blind! He could dress up like a clown and she'd be none the wiser!<br/><br/>4) Towards the end of the film it's explained (in an expository conversation) that someone with power has redirected planes away from the skies above the village. WHY? All the elders had to do was add scary 'flying-things-that-cannot-be-named' into their legends and the younger villagers would buy it... but, of course, we viewers would then know what the twist is going to be (I guessed it anyhow.)<br/><br/>5) Why don't the elders simply come up with a legend about the 'mysterious-energy-that- comes-through-wires-that-cannot-be-named'? They'd be able to have electric lights then and, you guessed it, the younger villagers would be none the wiser.<br/><br/>6) Are we meant to believe that NOBODY EVER trespassed into those woods? In all these years?<br/><br/>There you go."
"bvdp","9","1","2","6 February 2005"," thriller and love story
","I was shocked that this film only received a 6.5 out of ten. It is an extremely good movie, well made, beautifully shot and extremely scary and creepy when you watch it for the first time. You just don't know what's wrong in the woods or better behind the woods. The village seems a very pleasant and peaceful place to live in. It is hard telling what the story is about without revealing the plot. What I like most in this film, is that it is a rather slow movie, long shots, well acted, good conversation. The best conversation takes place when Ivy and Lucius sit on the porch and she asks why he doesn't speak of what's going on in his head. His reply is great. So are the costumes. The costume of Those We don't Speak Of is marvelous. The ""bad color"" is well chosen. You should watch the film twice: once to get the whole story and be shaken in your boots and the second time to watch the acting, the settings and the way the movie is shot. Great soundtrack by the way. This film makes you think about modern society and how we should deal with it. Is it possible to walk away from it and build your own? I can't say more without spoiling the plot."
"J_R_Cash","Null","1","2","4 February 2005"," Great Movie... Great Commentary On Our Society...
","I feel that this film reflects that of our society. We live in a world filled with suffering, hatred, violence, and the like that it is easy to wonder if we will ever get through this whole ordeal alive and well. With the conflicts with the Middle East and Africa are a prime example. What will happen if our children grow up in a world filled with turmoil and pain everyday for years. I understand that war and conflict have happened all throughout history and that it most likely, will keep happening. It will never change.<br/><br/>The fact that the Elders wanted to form their own town set in a simpler time (1800's) where they could choose what era/century they lived in is quite remarkable. The Elders had one thing in common. Death. All of them had a loved one that died in a horrible way. One's sister was raped and murdered and left in an alley. Another's father had been stabbed by his business partner. They felt that living in such a world with children wasn't suitable. They were tired of this world in which people killed and hated because of nothing.<br/><br/>That indeed is what happens everyday in our world. People die, people get raped, people get HIV/AIDS. And what to others do? They look away. I suppose that is what the Elders did in a sense. They wanted to get away from this nonsense. They fear what happens in the world around them. And who wouldn't? Everyday, we take a chance to go out and go places. We take a chance on going to the movie theaters, a restaurant, a park. We as a society choose to go out and risk our lives. We do not know what the day holds for us. If we did then we would be locked in our houses everyday, afraid to go out.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is a true reflection of our society. We need to look around and find what innocence is left in the world. We need to teach the nest generation to love and not hate. If we did, the world would be a better place. We would not breed such hate towards one another. And if we can do that, well, let's just hope that we can."
"giomanombre","10","1","2","3 February 2005"," One of the best films I ever watched...
","I think this director has true skill, a well crafted movie. Basically a medieval romance is made out of a 'Mennonite' community who makes a sheltered utopian society and create a 19th century community. In order to protect this community - creatures are invented to scare the people from venturing out. The beginning of the movie draws you into the characters and attempts to bring you into their world. As other posts have suggested, it is like a Twilight Zone flick, or an ""Outer Limits' episode on film.<br/><br/>The medieval elements of romantic literature are all there, mythical creatures, magic potions, wooded forests, costumes, love triangles, and I think the director has done remarkably well taking a Twilight Zone movie and climaxing it with a romantic twist - like a Medivil romantic folk tale.<br/><br/>I rate his movie highly because it has kept my attention straight from beginning to end. At the start, you know about the community, and you are drawn into the fable of the mythical creatures, and you are in suspense to find out who they are, and what their role is going to be on the movie. The love triangle and romantic elements start playing out on the movie - and love wins in the end.<br/><br/>The theme of being in the 'woods' is something that is also present in another movie: 'the house of flying daggers', where love triangles, and a conflict of characters involving romance is occurring in a wooded forest."

","After some of the negative reviews and word of mouth that I've read and heard about this film, I was pleased at how interesting and coherent it actually was. I was reminded, as in most of M. Night's films, of a good Twilight Zone episode. The casting was extraordinary, full of Academy Award winners and nominees, all turning in appropriate performances. The sets and costumes looked authentic and practical also. The plot was a stretch but, skillfully, barely within the bounds of plausibility. I really liked it. The realistic 19th century rural village life was interesting and I thought the characters were appealing. The Village successfully conveyed a feeling of menace and mysterious creepiness (like the way Signs did). I guess I am glad that I did not pay 10 bucks at the theatre, but it is certainly worth a rental."
"chezr","9","1","2","30 January 2005"," A brilliant film, you really have to get the meaning behind it, to appreciate it
","Firstly I would like to say I really enjoyed this film. I did not see it as a thriller or horror, like the trailer suggests and many expected, however I saw it as a beautifully crafted piece of work. It is all about fear mongering (which is around a lot in the governments of America and Britain these days, even though they are half responsible for the stuff we are fearing!) and how the unknown and unexplainable is a lot more terrifying than something that is known. We are afraid of being afraid, when something is happening we are no longer afraid. Luscious has the courage to venture, and a blind woman in love has the courage to venture through a forest for him. I think that is an amazing thing for her to do!! The real evil, are the elders, trying to control their fears by controlling others. The catalyst for their wrongings is Noah, as he (mentally challenged, simple) can not be controlled under the environment they have enforced on everyone.<br/><br/>The bleakness of the film highlights the bleakness of the world they are living in, and the red costume stands out as they do not see it everyday. I believe it represents blood and fear within the villagers. Luscious colour is perhaps red (as Ivy goes on about) suggesting his stabbing later on, and also how is not afraid of the colour red and the monsters. As Ivy says to him: No one can beat your time (referring to them standing with their back to the forest to see how long they can stay without getting scared). The bleakness makes a strong point, like in Shindler's List where it is black and white apart from the girl's red dress.<br/><br/>So overall i do appreciate this film, I can understand why others may see it's faults, however you have to take it as not a horror or thriller, and do not try to work out the twist at the end, you will only be disappointed. It still made me jump and feel tense as i saw the vulnerability of all the villagers. I believe this is a social message and we should take something from it. Is it better to live without technology and financial worries, but live in fear and have lack of freedom? Are we always being controlled however hard we try to stop it? Oh one last thing..... Did the guard's company name being Walker, have reference to the fact that they were protecting the boundaries for Papa Walker??"
"Poe-17","10","1","2","24 January 2005"," Way Misunderstood
","I was so ""prepared"" for this movie by all of the reviews by known critics, friends and the social chat. References unerringly cast themselves to the ""Holy Cow"" reveal of ""The Sixth Sense"". Audiences, in general, and in box office receipts, tend to encourage the frustratingly successful strategy of franchise horror films of ""Wow, do that again!"". So, we get a repeat of the original, often the same score, more inventive mayhem but, reduced to twenty five words or less, something one can't differentiate between Part II and Part VI.<br/><br/>There was so much made, even by one of my (and much of the free world's) favorite critic's, of the failed twist ending seen coming from miles away and providing a ""you've got to be kidding"" that is a sinking disappointment rather than a skull exploder.<br/><br/>By the time I watched the film (I waited for DVD), I knew the elder's secrets and, as all my exposure to the film had warned, the twist was barely a noticeable kink in the plot. But I had he DVD for a five day rental and there was something squirming about my impression, something that wasn't comfortable.<br/><br/>I thought about the director's previous; ""The Sixth Sense"" (more than a few of us ""got it"" when the boy explained that sometimes the dead don't know they're dead - but it spoiled nothing), ""Unbreakable"" in which the ""twist ending"" was merely ending, not intended to be twisted and ""Signs"" where all the twists happened during, not at the end where all the ""twists"" merged. It occurred to me that ""Unbreakable"" was not ""The Sixth Sense II"", nor was ""Signs"" ""The Sixth Sense III"", so why should ""The Village"" be ""The Sixth Sense IV""? I thought I might want to watch it again.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan, in my opinion, didn't build this film around a twist ending (as well as ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""), that the twist ending franchise is a figment of the viewers imagination or ""do again"" wishes.<br/><br/>Pure and simple, this is a multi-layered love story. Not a chick flick romance but one that addresses the very real fears of parents because they love their children, of heroism because ""I fear for you before all others"", and of a forest full of monsters of unexpected kinds that must be crossed ... for love.<br/><br/>Shyamalan likes to tell his stories with a tapestry of strange, vexing and magical images and back drops. But strange, vexing and magical are the tapestry, not the stories he tells.<br/><br/>The tale told in ""The Village"" could not have been told without ""The Village"". Joaquin Phoenix's character (Lucius Hunt) could not exist anywhere but in the Village. None of the plot elements would have worked anywhere but in a Village. I don't know what came first to Shyamalan, but I imagine it evolved in senses and chunks and emotions and sort of oozed from the creative extrusion ports. And nowhere in the world could Ivy Walker (Bryce Howard in an incredible delivery) exist and launch the love-driven quest she made except from a Village.<br/><br/>On repeated viewings, my vote is this is Shyamalan at the top of his voyage, to date. There are incredibly powerful scenes, positively dazzling deliveries by non-name brand actors (Adrien Brody as Noah Percy is, hands down, Oscar worthy; magnificent), heart, spirit, that moody thing that Shyamalan does so very well, emotional rewards, dead on score, mysteries only unearthed by a second viewing and did I mention Bryce Howard in an absolutely, kick your legs out from under you delivery? Second and Third viewings let you see all the details come together, watch the ending embrace the beginning. This is a cohesive tale, told with color and lack of color, one of courage and yielding to that which requires bravery and courage because ""I don't worry about what might happen, only what must be done"".<br/><br/>There is, within the plot, the world's best marriage proposal.<br/><br/>Here again, as in ""Signs"", Joaquin Phoenix builds a believable character (though pertinent only for 2/3s of the movie).<br/><br/>Sorry, nothing misses. This film is dead on, solid perfect. The ""Twist"" didn't work because it wasn't meant to. Everything else worked because that's what the director wanted to happen.<br/><br/>Best to date for Shyamalan ."
"StevenPlaymountain","10","1","2","23 January 2005"," A moving love story starring the incredible Bryce Dallas Howard
","First of all, let me tel you I'm a believer when it comes to 'the Shyamalan-concept', a mix of weird, surreal, almost illogical plot elements, shown in such a way that the viewer is constantly mislead. Only by the end of the film, the viewer experiences some sort of 'katharsis', by means of a spectacular surprising plot twist. Within a few minutes, a secret story-element is revealed, and the viewer sees the story he has just witnessed in a whole new (logical) light. This trademark of M. Night Shyamalan made me view his masterpieces ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" (which strangely has got a lot of negative reviews) over and over again.<br/><br/>The main question is now, how does ""the Village"" incorporate this specific concept, and how well does it work in the movie? When I first had seen the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Shyamalan was 'reluctantly' giving the critics and the audience what it craved for, namely a huge, surprising plot element which would blow the viewers away at the end of the movie. Why reluctantly? Because, to my humble opinion, the 'Shyamalan-concept' is totally superfluous within the story of ""The Village"". And this story is, above all, a love story. It's about two young people in an isolated, gloomy, 19th century village trying to connect emotionally and spiritually with each other.<br/><br/>Shyamalan did not deliver what I expected. He delivered far beyond my expectations. Instead of rattling off the same old thriller he's famous for, he comes up with a moving, picturesque film backed up by an incredible cast. Surprisingly imposing is dÃ©butante Bryce Dallas Howard (the charming daughter of director Ron Howard) who plays Ivy. She easily holds ground among all those great actors (Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody). The charming serenity and honesty by which she portrays her character Ivy, reveals a great talent. Every single scene she's in stunned me. The DVD even got an extra feature called 'Bryce's diary', and even there she left me in awe. She's a really, really promising actress, I can't stress that enough. Her performance is simply radiant and carries the whole movie. And herein lies the strength of ""The Village"": a simple, touching love story, performed in an inspired manner by a wonderful group of actors. And the 'Shyamalan-concept'? It's there, but there's plenty more to look for in ""The Village""."
"jstanleywsc","4","1","2","22 January 2005"," Don't Believe The Hype
","If M. Night Shyamalan's cinematic style were a dance, it would have to be The Twist. He loves to give us that unexpected, Rod Serling-style revelation that turns everything on its head and has us replaying the movie in our minds, filing cogent clues and red herrings in the appropriate mental folders. But it may be that after The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs this popular writer/director has us so conditioned to look for a shocking twist that we go in with heightened, even unrealistic expectations.<br/><br/>This film's producer, Scott Rudin, told Entertainment Weekly, the thing he was wrestling with is that the audience is waiting for (the twist). You can ask, could he make The Sixth Sense now? The minute the kid says ""I see dead people"" would you immediately go to 'Bruce Willis is dead?' Every one of these movies raises the bar higher and makes it harder to deliver any kind of sleight of hand. He's right. Which may explain why the theater audience I spent the evening with filed out of The Village looking like kids at an amusement park who had just stood in an hour-long line for a roller coaster that never left the platform. The prevailing reaction was disappointment. Instead of a supercharged adventure, what they got was a soberly paced, feature-length thriller that might have worked better as a half-hour Twilight Zone episode. At least then the payoff would have been proportionate to our investment. Some members of the crowd even seemed ticked. I can understand why. Disney's marketing department set them up to see a certain kind of movie (the tag line reads, ""Run. The Truce Is Ending""). It didn't deliver and they felt conned. But let's face it, in Shyamalan's world, it's all about setting the audience up for the twist, right? If only his final revelation was a whiz-bang wonder worthy of water-cooler conversation. (Most people will see it coming a mile away.) What is worth talking about besides the emergence of Ron Howard's daughter in her first screen role is the film's interesting subtext. The Village works very well as a metaphor infused with socially significant ideas and transcendent themes. Of course, most viewers will be too busy trying to track Shyamalan's cinematic sleight of hand to follow it on that level. That's too bad. Given the chance to be more than mood-altering summer eye candy, The Village contains subtle, intellectual challenges for mature audiences with very little troubling content. That may be small consolation for action-hungry horror fans trying to predict the twist and avoid falling asleep in their popcorn. What does it take for a manipulative director to lose his credibility with a mass audience? It takes a Village."
"dsmgdesign","9","1","2","22 January 2005"," Another classic makes history!
","M. Night Shyamalan is a true genius. He defies today's bloody, slasher or bang-em-up flics for classic offerings only dared by such movie makers as Rod Sterling and Alfred Hitchcock. Some may say he lives in the shadows of ""The Six Sense"". I happen to think he is only getting started in developing a true craft that no one else in Hollywood today can master. <br/><br/>What is also forgotten in many reviews that you may read here is the signature ""everything-is-not-as it-seems"" factor that is masterfully created in The Village. Within this controlled environment lies a secret pact held by elders to protect their young from the sins of the world. A promise to create a community where innocence can prosper. Keeping them there are mysterious creatures...boogie-men of sorts....who liive in the woods that surround them. This story is about protecting love ones from harm (whether it be a parent to a child, or a young man and young woman), from protecting the weak from evil. Yet it is the ""weak"" who surprise us. And innocence lives on. A well-thought and well-executed tale that can only be told by this master of suspense. <br/><br/>Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", there are frights and chills. Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", there is a twist in the plot. Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", I loved the characters and loved the ride for which I was taken. The twist may not be as powerful as The Six Sense, the chills may not be as fresh, but the story is just as meaningful and awe-inspiring. And the ""everything is not as it seems"" factor is just as developed. That is what makes M. Night Shyamalan is a true genius.<br/><br/>Brilliant! Can't wait for the next M. Night Shyamalan film."

I guess that's my trademark or one of them anyway!"". It's as precise and intelligent a comment as his films: he knows exactly what he is doing. ""The Village"" is an entertaining version (a ""B-film"") of Lars Von Trier ""Dogville"" (an ""A-film""), but no less an insight in great depth of American society and the manipulative powers that shape its phobias.

The trailers for the movie (and I know the old argument about judging a movie by its trailer) paint the film out to be a thriller. And there were at least two times in the movie where I was frightened. But come on...I expected much more.<br/><br/>The movie can be seen as an allegory of isolationism and its effects on people. The idea of isolation to except the pressures of a world gone mad are as old as time. But what is particularly horrific in this case is that the adults in the village have misled their own children into thinking that they have been born into a different time. They have, in effect, robbed their children of the freedom to make their own decision and to track their own course in life. Maybe the children would be stronger for having to endure the grief their parents ran from. But, because of the justified dishonesty that the parents practice, we (and they) will never know.<br/><br/>When I have told friends about the movie, I am asked the same question: why was it promoted as a horror film? Because if people knew the real story of the film, they wouldn't care to see it. I guess I can't fault Shyamalan...like me, he has bills to pay."

","I avoided seeing this movie in the theater due to bad reviews and word of mouth. I think I'm glad I did because I, too, probably would have had my impression of the film colored by its false advertising as a horror movie.<br/><br/>This movie is not horror -- at all.<br/><br/>That being said, my wait for it to come to video was free of any misconceptions about what it was. Distanced from the advertising hype and the bad press, I rented it with little or no expectations about what I was going to see.<br/><br/>To my utter delight, what I got to watch was a splendid movie that is a wonderful study of character, mood, suspense, and neat twists that would have made Rod Serling proud. This movie is quintessential ""Twilight Zone"" material only so much more richer for the excellent performances by virtually every cast member and the script which fleshes out a delicate, multi-layered world. All of this would be very difficult to accomplish in a standard 30-minute TZ episode.<br/><br/>This movie is a wonderful treat that is quite unusual for standard Hollywood fare. One can only hope that in the future, Hollywood will learn how to develop advertising for films so that it can find its proper audience instead of misleading people into thinking they are going to see something completely different."

","This may seem like a strange analogy, but humor me. When I was a child I was (okay, I still am) a huge fan of the Beatles. As each record came out I was constantly blown away by the progress of their ideas and music. I remember when the album ""Revolver"" came out, I invited some kids from my neighborhood to listen to it with me for the first time. I was the only one in the room who enjoyed it. Some of my friends disappeared before the album was over, muttering things like, ""I liked 'A Hard Day's Night' better...why have they become so weird?""<br/><br/>I think this may be the plight of M. Night Shyamalan. Many want him to do ""The Sixth Sense"" over and over again, or at least something that resembles it. ""The Village"" is a movie that if (1) it had not been marketed the way it was and (2) did not reveal the director (yeah, I know, it could never happen), would have more likely been embraced for what it was - a remarkable movie.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard plays the unlikely heroine, Ivy. Unlikely because she is blind, yet shows the greatest bravery among a village of people who live in constant fear. Howard's performance blew me away. The characters, all brilliantly portrayed, display a common thread of fear and emotional restraint, and acceptance of remaining in this state. All but Lucius (played by Joaquin Phoenix, so often typecast as an unlikable character; he shattered that in this role) and Ivy, as is established as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>I don't want to give any more away than I have. See this movie.<br/><br/>I am guilty of almost not seeing is BECAUSE of the trailer, but I'm glad I did. This is one of the best, most thought-provoking movies I have seen in recent times.<br/><br/>Forget what you've read, and who directed it (though the direction is excellent) and give it a chance. As I once anticipated Beatles' records without expecting a repeat of past efforts, I will likewise anticipate future movies by this gifted and talented storyteller."

","Without a doubt this is one of the best movies produced by M. Night. The cinematography with its vast arrays of light and dark, depending upon the message to be sent to the audience, and especially the heart-felt and touching music throughout is absolutely wonderful! The Village set is of itself fantastic! By the time the movie ends it almost beacons for one to return to its location. Especially in today's world many of us would pay dearly for such a haven of simplicity and isolation from what appear to be the evils of the world.<br/><br/>The actors are first class. There seems to be such a unique bonding between the characters that one is left with the feeling of having known them as personal friends and confidants. By the films end, one almost feels himself to be a member of the village.<br/><br/>What a lovely story brought to life! From quietness, to distress, to fear, to triumph, M. Night brings to each of his viewers the feeling that nothing is impossible to overcome - whether it be through an individual or a group striving for its own survival. One is left with the thought that clearly, one generation must of necessity let the next find its own way whether it be blindly, or with clear vision.<br/><br/>Don't miss this one!"
"dgeer80","8","1","2","14 January 2005"," A great film...if you're not looking for something scary.
","If you walk into this film thinking it's a thriller (which I don't blame anyone for except the people who marketed this film), you may just walk out disappointed. There aren't really that many scary things about this film. However, if you walk into it expecting quality drama, acting and storytelling, you might just find something likable about it.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyalmalan (director of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"") brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear.<br/><br/>An ""Amish"" type community resides in an isolated village surrounded by a forest with a dark history. They fear ""those they do not speak of"" who dwell in the woods, and dare not cross their path. But when a dire need of medicine from the towns beyond the woods emerges, one blind woman dares to face the dark in order to bring back the light.<br/><br/>The film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it - a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish. One particular shot that comes to mind is between the two main characters, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind woman Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), when they're talking on the porch. It's a close-up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a gray fog covering the vast field in front of them - making the audience wonder what's out there watching them. It really symbolizes that not everything may be as it seems.<br/><br/>The performances given by William Hurt(AI: Artificial Intelligence), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix really make this film stand on firm ground. But perhaps the most interesting character is that of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody (The Pianist). He plays a mentally-challenged, and sometimes unstable man who happens to be in love with Ivy Walker. When he finds out that she's in love with Lucius Hunt, his unstable characteristics really start to take hold of him (as well as creep out the audience).<br/><br/>If this were the first film from Shyamalan, it would be critically acclaimed. But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second-guess everything they observe. So many people would probably figure out the twist long before the film ends because they're already looking for it. Either that, or they spend the whole film waiting in anticipation for it, only to be let down because they built it up to be the Second Coming. They remember how cool it was to discover what really happened to Bruce Willis' character in ""The Sixth Sense."" But they forget that, at that time, they had never seen a film quite like it before. They had no preconceived notions or expectations.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed ""The Village,"" I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories. And he should not hype it up by advertising it as ""An M. Night Shyalmalan Film."" That name is now immediately connected with plot twists and thrillers whenever someone sees it. Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as ""M. Night Shyamalamadingdong."""

","I have to say upfront that I LOVED this movie and I didn't expect to. But it is different from any other movie I've ever seen and different from this director's other films.<br/><br/>The Village feels like a John Steinbeck novel (think Of Mice and Men) presented in the style of an opera (without music) with dialogue presented in verse . Actually, I would love the thought of a modern composer making an opera out of this movie.<br/><br/>The DVD notes compare this movie to Hitchcock. I have no idea why. This movie is very spiritual. It is about feeling, emotion, human suffering and human experience. It is about emotional pain and the attempt to free one from pain.<br/><br/>I've read some comments that compare The Village to the Truman Show. I really don't think there is a comparison. The difference is that The Truman show is affected by an external situation while the Village is internal.<br/><br/>The Village is a wonderful movie."
"BlueHarvest1983","8","1","2","13 January 2005"," One of, if not the, best film of the year.
","After watching ""The Village"" with a few friends not only did I enjoy it more than the first time, I saw the reason why many did not like it. Throughout the movie, one of my friends, who isn't as familiar with film as the rest of us, constantly asked questions about where the plot was moving. He's used to the films that spell everything out, and practically tell you what's going to happen before it does. I'm not saying this to slight him one bit, because he is in good company. America's viewing interests have been reduced to seeing the entire film before it happens. For example, in a cop drama, the plot may be laid down, drawn out in front of you, before anything actually happens. In a romance, you meet two characters and they fall in love. In comedies... well in comedies, actors say ""balls"" a lot. Gone are the days where you watched every move, listened to every line of dialogue, and kept track of each character in your head, and in the end, everything was resolved in your mind, rather than on camera.<br/><br/>Many people went to this movie, because it was going to live up to the ""Sixth Sense"", and though contrary to popular belief, it surpassed what ""Sixth Sense"" did. It was a multi-layered trip through the human psyche-that asked you the questions. Some of my most trusted closest friends went into this movie, ""knowing"" they wouldn't like it, and then criticized Shyalaman because the know I love the film. From comments like ""He shot too many trees."" to ""I didn't relate to the characters."", I've heard it all. But when you sit down, look at the way Shyalaman uses shots, angles, sound, music, and positioning, and amazing performances you'll have to agree, he's a pretty darn good director.<br/><br/>In using a blind girl, Shyalaman opened up a door that would seal the fate of his movie in the minds of many true film and literature fans. He could create one of the greatest characters on screen. One who could not see, happened to have the greatest ""vision"" of the whole village, and was able to conquer her fears, and also give something extra to the ""towns"". Joaquin Pheonix is brilliant, and says so much by saying so little, and Adrien Brody is downright frightening.<br/><br/>Those of you who were ""dissapointed"" in the twist ending, or ""saw it coming"" congratulations, you're you've completely missed the entire point of this film. It's not supposed to be a surprise, or a shocker, but the real shock are the events surrounding it. Those of you who didn't think the creatures were ""scary"", maybe use your minds a little bit, and you'll figure out just how horrifying they really were. Those of you who ""didn't like the trees"", I think Harold and Kumar is more your speed.<br/><br/>This film is probably the best of 2004, and one of the best of it's genre ever made, though no ""big shot"" movie critic will say this. It's sad what's happened to us as a people, and I truly believe, if many of the amazing movies of the past were released tomorrow, they'd completely ""flop"" like this beautiful film."
"dg3-1","9","1","2","12 January 2005"," Forget the twist; this movie holds its own regardless
","I won't comment on the predictability of the twist in the end, for that has been done to death. The problem many people have with this movie is that they always expect a knock-your-socks-off twist from M. Night to the exclusion of being able to appreciate anything else about his films. This film holds its own, both because of and in spite of the twist at the end.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is not a horror film, mildly a suspense film, but mostly a drama about the extent to which people will go to protect those they love from the world outside and how, ultimately, such protection is hopeless and life must be lived. That is a message each of us grapples with whether explicitly or implicitly, and one that's brought to beautiful life by Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Other comments: perfect cinematography, as usual, by Roger Deakins. Bryce Dallas Howard will be big--her performance here was really the only one that stood out in what was mostly a wasted cast (for example, Michael Pitt, who did a great job as the lead in ""The Dreamers,"" has one or two lines in the whole movie, and Sigourney Weaver...well, she's just left out to dry). Because of those flaws, I'm giving this movie a 9/10, but its message is so pure and well-meaning that even without the twist it made me smile."
"sweetmidnight_dreams","9","1","2","11 January 2005"," The Village
","The Village is a great movie for those that understand suffering. The thing that makes this movie spooky is the fact that this happened because of suffering and that they suffered more for it. Or did they? If feel or know suffering you can relate to this move and the reasons why it came about. The plot is needing as well as some other things, but the acting and emotions that are used in The Village are profound. They are ones that we can relate to. The need to escape from reality and find a place of innocence. Love, understanding, and determination are taught in this movie. I believe that M. Night Shyamalan knew what he was doing when he created The Village and that it is awesome work."

","I don't know what is wrong all the reviewers. I also do not know what is wrong with Mr. Night. It seemed that he just gone from great with his Sixth Sense to bad to worst. Writing your own scripts and directing it is an excellent move, however, it does not mean it will always work out. In the later cases of Night's movies, it appeared that he rushed his scripts and did not take any care at all on examining his plot or characters. When you have characters explaining things near the end of the film to the audience and when the dialogs are said purely to explain something to us, we know there is something wrong. And when the plot had to be twisted so much in order to fit everything in and rendered it so twisted it became disfigured and disjointed, it is another bad sign.<br/><br/>Mr. Night used to be compared with Mr. Hitchcock, I would dare say this comparison is getting a little too absurd. Intelligent scripts are not easy to come by and intelligent scripts with symbolic meanings are even harder to come by. If one is to argue the fact that this movie is also about the supression of a community through the usage of fear etc...I would have to conclude that you had watched very little old films of the great eras of Hithcocks and other great directors."

","I'd like to very warmly redirect everyone to dog_bites_back's comment. He says most of what is essential, namely about the misleading marketing THE VILLAGE has badly suffered from.<br/><br/>From the viewing of 'The sixth sense' on, I can recall how deeply grateful I was for the feeling there was finally someone who had that genuine love for movies AND the talent/ability to use the means of a big production in a way that, in the end, you have an impression of INTIMACY.<br/><br/>This I found again in THE VILLAGE. Walking out of it, there surely were questions, irritations, feelings that the movie wasn't well balanced in some ways...<br/><br/>But there is so much to find in it that the movie still gives me more, by far, than it frustrates me. It is generous, it is sincere (in my opinion at least), it tells a story and puts you in a state that are VERY unexpected. That's the highest of what I expect from a movie.<br/><br/>The ambiance, the mysterious uneasiness between the inhabitants, the numerous secrets most of which remain basically unanswered (not typically Hollywood, now, is it?): all those points make it something precious. Something leaving space for you to travel into the story with your own life, your feelings, your memories.<br/><br/>I still can imagine very well that you'll be totally puzzled, or even unnerved, if you're not in the right mood for it.<br/><br/>The trailers, as dog_bites_back points out, are so completely WRONG that it's a joke. And a suicidal one at that: they surely HAVE done the film and its career some terrible damage, as you could only be very disappointed when, after being promised some ""BLAIRWITCH PROJECT meets THE HOWLING meets SEVEN meets Lars van Trier"" product, you discover something that has more to do with Ingmar Bergman.<br/><br/>Oh yes, it does. The rural setting of the action, the village and the woods, supernatural elements, the depth of the characters and the intensity of the acting, all this can be related to the Master from Sweden.<br/><br/>I almost forgot, because it is so obvious, but the film is so beautifully photographed it takes your breath away (and always serves the story, my opinion again...).<br/><br/>After taking good notice that you WILL NOT see a horror-flick with the clever Shyamalan touch, you should ABSOLUTELY see this movie, one of the most original works on the big screen for a long time."

","I spent much time reading reviews of this movie (after having seen it), and I'm very surprised that most of them see it as an awful picture. When I saw the movie, there were 4 people with me, 2 of them hated it, 1 said it was so-so, and only one of them loved it. I was not surprised at all by their reaction 'cause those two who hated it love full-action movies (Alien Vs Predator, gone in 60 secs, etc.) and the other is a romantic-comedy lover. Maybe it's got nothing to do with it, but these 3 persons aren't/weren't good students at all. I understand that the movie has lots of details to be considered, but I don't find the plot ""hard to get"", not at all! When I saw it, I didn't even know what I was going for, I hadn't seen the trailer, or red anything about it (didn't even know it was a Shyamalan's movie.. :) ), so I was expecting nothing of it. Maybe if I had seen a trailer, or read that it would be a suspense/horror movie, maybe then I would get disappointed, 'cause the movie isn't nothing of that at all... I see it as a touching love story, with a complex, but valid plot (yes, I have now seen the movie more than 4/5 times, no real mistakes on it), with outstanding acting (specialy from Bryce Howard and quite remarkable performances also from William Hurt, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix), a movie that, opposing from the other M. Night films, the more you see it, the more you love it. I think that if you see this movie without expecting a ""woah""-twisting-ending, or a suspense/horror thing, you might just like it as well as I did. IMHO, by far, the best picture in 2004!

","M. Night's ""The Village"" is certainly not a horror film. It's not even really much of a thriller. The film is, at its core, a love story. Played out against a Quaker-esquire rural community, the story revolves around a young blind woman, her boyfriend, and her mentally-challenged and very jealous admirer. Through a sordid series of misguided actions, the three are thrown into a somewhat twisted tale of courage, love, and revenge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was not the film that was advertised. The trailers and movie posters offered us a sort of psychologically driven monster movie-- and that's not what we got. Many fans of M. Night and critics in general felt slighted. This was not the movie that they paid to see.<br/><br/>While it's certainly not a brilliant piece of film-making and, aside from a great performance from Howard in the lead, offers just mediocre acting, it's not nearly as bad a film as many are saying. An open mind and fewer expectations (of genre, not of quality) on behalf of the viewers could have made this a bigger success.<br/><br/>Alas, however, the marketing people did what they did, the viewers expected what they expected, and the critics wrote what they wrote, and this is what we got: A decent movie that was treated like a horrible movie. 7/10"

While M. Night has a good eye and directs it quite well, it's obvious from the start that there is little or no plot here. The brilliant cast is wasted (Adrien Brody, what WERE you thinking???), staggering through this mess of 'events' and 'dialogue' (I shall not use the 'story' here) to get to THE SURPRISE ENDING!!! Who would've expected that on an M. Night Shyamalan movie? This guy's gimmick has worn out it's welcome with me. After Signs I hoped he wouldn't do this to audiences anymore but it seems the man just can't help himself. I can't believe the movie-going public is still forking out $$ for this predictable garbage. I can't wait for the day that they catch on and this guy vanishes as quickly as he appeared.<br/><br/>In his defense (so you don't think I'm just here to bash him) The Sixth Sense was brilliant.

","Have you had one of those moments where you're watching a movie you're just so uninterested with what's going on that you actually question puncturing your eyes out? That pretty much sums up what most audiences may experience when viewing, 'The Village'.errthat is 'M. Night Shymalan's: The Village.' From the self-proclaimed present day Alfred Hitchcock that brought us 'Unbreakable,' 'Signs,' and that only good Haley Joel Osment movie about the kid who sees dead people, 'The Village,' introduces us to a small colony of entirely white actors including Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver (she's the lady from 'Aliens,' kids!), and newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard. <br/><br/>The 'village people' live their Amish-like lives that, while seemingly innocent and peaceful, a feeling of dread and fear tears at their lives caused by scary monsters lurking in the woods (also known as Brian Magerhurth- the sound recordist). While this all may seem to be a very creepy concept, the story soon falls apart with the most predictable ending ever, which, unlike Shymalan's previous movies, comes dead smack in the middle of the movie, leaving me with nothing (though you'll probably have guessed the ending within five minutes into the film). Also if you've seen his past films, you probably know how Shymalan orgasms over the use of color references. While this may have been a cute tactic in 'The Sixth Sense,' three films laterwe get the point. Move on!<br/><br/>On a positive note (and I'm really looking here folks), Bryce Howard, daughter of television and film legend, Ron Howard, gives a worthy performance as 'Ivy,' our blind protagonist who must conquer her fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Strangely, the most annoying part of this entire movie wasn't the slow paced story telling, the lacking in truly scary moments, the script, but the way the movie was ruined by the role of the director, who successfully achieves his attempt at professional suicide. Starting off with placing his name at the top of every movie poster, at the end of every trailer, copying Hitchcock's film techniques (along with everything else), featuring himself in every one of his films as a minor role (why couldn't he have settled for just a walk on role?), and ditching one of the lead characters in the middle of the movie, only to reveal the identity of the real 'star' of the film, (strangely just like the character of Marion Crane in 'Psycho') Shymalan shows his true color in this movie. While he may be able to make pretty pictures in the sense of cinematography, other than that he contributes nothing to his films other than a monstrous ego and techniques entirely copied by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>I was bored to tears seeing this movie. For your sake don't go see this film. Do something more interesting like trimming your nasal hair, writing your congressman/ woman, read the 9/11 commission report, or just beat the crowds that did go to see 'The Village' and go to your local cemetery and go pick out your own grave spot. <br/><br/>I gave this film a D-<br/><br/>David A.

I went to see this movie thinking it was a horror/thriller much like the Sixth Sense and Signs, until I figured out there was nothing supernatural about it. It turns out the town ""elders"" circulated the rumor to scare the towns people into thinking there really was evil in the forest, when in fact, after the forest was a contemporary town with cars, rangers and radios. I have to say I was very surprised when I saw a car in a film originally set so long ago and thought it was absurd.<br/><br/>I usually never think badly of movies in general, but the ending was very abrupt and disappointed me. In a nutshell, it's not worth your time or money and you're better off spending it on something else.<br/><br/>3.5/10"
"uds3","Null","1","2","13 September 2004"," A film for the disciplined mind only!
","TNight_1 so far as I can see is the only reviewer got it right. This IS Shyamalan's best film to date. Shame only one in 200,000 people have the mental resources to tap into it.<br/><br/>This never was a horror-film, any more than SIGNS was about aliens. (I have incidentally received over 300 emails worldwide asking me to explain what really DID happen in SIGNS)<br/><br/>Shyamalan is evolving as a precocious talent in all facets of film-making and if he continues at the rate he is...he may even have fifty fans by the end of 2005. I don't know why he bothers. To collar the collective lame-brain reviews that his films do, is merely evidence of how far down the intellectually-appreciative time-line the average viewer is!<br/><br/>The relevance and success of this film is in the WORDS my friends, the superb characterisations that Shyamalan is able to draw out of his cast. Despite her limited screen-time this was one of Sigourney Weaver's greatest performance. LOOK at her, watch her mannerisms...she IS gentle but aware Alice Hunt. Ripley was another time, another place. Similarly, Hurt delivers a powerful and credible performance as the leader of the Amish-inspired community. Phoenix too gives a marvelous, controlled, yet understated reverence to his role as Weaver's son Lucius. As he so pointedly comments at one stage. ""This Village has too many secrets.""<br/><br/>For all the above though, it is Bryce Dallas Howard that is nothing short of stunning in her debut role. Little wonder Shyamalan knew he had found the right girl when he met her. Headstrong, courageous, so very attractive to anyone who knows quality when they see it, she just elicits sympathy yet admiration for the way in which she handles her disability. Feminine to the last curl yet vulnerable given her youth and inexperience - this was a first-up role of a life-time and she carried it off with the professional flair of any A-list actress. Besides her, Kidman should be re-enrolling at acting school!<br/><br/>As for the one-dimensional viewer seated there, ingesting handfuls of stale popcorn between his Diet Coke, waiting to be scared witless by the forest-creatures.....I have little sympathy for your ultimate disappointment. You had no clue about SIGNS either....what were you thinking? maybe you got intelligent overnight?<br/><br/>Despite those who claim to have seen the 'twist' in THE SIXTH SENSE coming a mile off, (yeah right!) the MENSA graduates who 'figured out' UNBREAKABLE during the first quarter, and now the hordes of cerebrally-challenged patrons who see in THE VILLAGE a 'boring,' 'wooden' film with a 'cop-out' ending, there is thankfully a minority group who grasp what they see. That doesn't include the reviewer so interminably stupid, he even writes he 'didn't know' what the end meant!<br/><br/>William Hurt's character makes it crystal clear for all to understand, when he tells the other elders, 'We have to protect the children's innocence.'<br/><br/>Most of us would be far better off never entering those woods either  look what's on the other side  mainstream humanity! <br/><br/>Sumptuous from a cinematographic viewpoint also, the film shares much common ground with SIGNS. A group seemingly at the mercy of the unknown. A central character dealing with his own emotional overload. Young people in harm's way and the values inherent in communal strength and decency.<br/><br/>Far from the laughable perception that Shyamalan is running on empty with his last couple of films, he is metamorphisising into a Director par excellence. His is the big picture, most critics it would seem, can't even agree on the suitability of the frame!"
"SamHammer","Null","1","2","11 September 2004"," I see... Village People!
","Dear Mr. Shyamalan, I really need to ask You to please, please, stop writing these twist endings for Your movies. <br/><br/>The reason: You are a very talented artist, You masterfully handle actors, pacing and Your movies have a distinct look to them. But as You obviously also try to make Your stories meaningful (and allegorical), I am afraid that I, the viewer, can't seem to see the forest from the trees anymore, as I spend my time trying to outguess Your twists from one movie to the next.<br/><br/>Even The Village, this great tale of love, courage and post 9/11 USA, would have been an even greater delight for me if I only hadn't tried to find hidden meanings and clues in every scene.<br/><br/>Sincerely Yours, and waiting for the next one.."

I found the trailer more 'edge of the seat' than the film!It starts quite well and pushes all the right buttons for suspense at the start but there's just not enough in the film to keep you enthralled. You can work out the plot and ending quite easily so the element of tension is blown away. The language used in the film is somewhat annoying, especially when you realize what's actually going on.

"agent_starling_1999","4","1","2","3 September 2004"," Disappointing *and* presumptuous
","How many more crappy movies will it take to convince me that M. Night Shyalaman cannot write a decent screenplay to save his life? Even after Unbreakable I was making excuses for him, because you know, there's some pretty decent ideas amidst the rubbish and visually his storytelling is quite interesting...<br/><br/>Enough. I don't think I am spoiling everyone when I said that The Village was absurd and laughably BAD. <br/><br/>First the good (there's very little of it, though): the actress who plays the blind girl is wonderful and very expressive. The look of the movie is for the most part lovely. Not brilliant, occasionally corny and ridiculous, but good for the most part. Shyalaman is still good at scaring us half to death when he wants to. The music is quite pretty. <br/><br/>But when you have a ridiculous plot, a screenplay that takes itself far too seriously and a director that appears to construct a whole movie based on his OMGSOCOOL cameo you end up wanting to throw things at the screen.<br/><br/>Mind you, I had no problems with the pacing. Or with the lack of gore and blood and creepiness. And yes, I did get the Oh So Deep And Meaningful Metaphors Shyalaman so kindly spelled out for me a dozen times (how some people can call this ""subtlety"" I don't know, and will never understand, all I know is that the apparently intelligent political reading was far too obvious) - it was still complete crap, and all the more crappy because in other hands, it might have worked. Because the concept was not at all bad, even if it seems laughably bad after watching it. But people, if you want to see about people running from the evils and the scariness of the real world only to find it in their little idyllic community... well just rent Dogville already, don't watch this stupid thing, made by a man that not only has no sense of humor but fancies himself the most insightful film-maker in Hollywood. Please.<br/><br/>In short? Some interesting images and a few good ideas completely ruined. Oh, and the plot twist that was apparently The Coolest and Most Surprising Thing Ever? I totally saw that one coming. And I have to say it's a pity to watch Shyalaman completely waste his talent as a director and his skill for suspense by making this sort of senseless rubbish that is nowhere as good as the stuff he could, and should be making. And good god, please force him to work with a decent screenwriter for a change. PLEASE."

","The acting in this film is the only thing that makes it tolerable. William Hurt delivers one of his most compelling performances, even when hobbled with such stilted, cumbersome lines. Bryce Dallas Howard is nothing less than remarkable, a true discovery. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, as well.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody, however, ought to return his Oscar.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's writing is abysmally turgid and laughably solemn. There's a whole lotta nothing going on here. The ending is straight out of weak Twilight Zone episode. I also found Shyamalan's obligatory, yet wholly gratuitous cameo to be oddly offensive. In the context of the film, his bit role struck me that this may be the way he sees himself with regard to this movie, whether he realizes it or not."

"macboy","Null","1","2","22 August 2004"," Too bad people's IQ are not displayed along with the comments
","SPOILERS !!<br/><br/>First I have to say that English is not my primarily language.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews are made by people who did not understand the deeper meaning. Too bad.<br/><br/>Such as questions why the Elder people did not go for medicine, but they send a blind girl. Who would be better capable of such a task not being able to see the outside world? And did you forget that Walker wanted to go, but it was not possible because of the strong oath (what else can you rely upon in such a society?).<br/><br/>Interesting to see that people thought it was predictable, especially after reading all the comments. It's not about the surprise, but the deeper meaning. Congratulations on the fact that you guessed it right, but sorry to read that you are not that smart.<br/><br/>There was a lot of democratic criticism (9/11) in the movie. Surely not only the colors, but the name Walker is known (George W. Bush).<br/><br/>Somebody said: ""America hates to look in the mirror. We like to watch, but we hate when the image is turned back on us. The truth is ugly and The Village is a masterpiece.""<br/><br/>The name Lucius is not a coincidence, although I doubt that most of you will know what kind of an important Roman name that was. Ceasar and Verus might I add.<br/><br/>Too bad that the trailer and preview made it look as a horror-suspense movie. This movie should not be presented as a block buster, but as a movie for those special-movie houses where the show 'intellectual' movies.<br/><br/>There is a lot of philosophy in the movie. If a child was born only being able to see shadows, that is all the world exists of. This part of the plot is not strange or unrealistic as many have stated.<br/><br/>The blind woman obviously represents the blind Americans, not seeing what the government sometimes is doing. She of course saw the color red within Lucius, not of the monsters, but the color of blood (and for all the historians: you know what Lucius has to do with that color).<br/><br/>The color red reminds the elders of the killing (you can see at the picture at the end that they are a group of traumatized people being treated but think they have found the ultimate cure -> nice paradox).<br/><br/>The microphone in the movie that was shown could be a mistake, but could also be a hint to the Truman-Show.<br/><br/>And nobody is mentioning the fact that it is the ONLY movie from M. Night Shyamalan that is in fact realistic: <br/><br/>Signs: not possible in this way (maybe there are in fact aliens in space, why not, but sure they cannot be hurt by water and wood) Unbreakable: don't believe there are people like that amongst ourselves Sixth Sense: don't think many believe in ghosts<br/><br/>The Village: pure realistic idea and probably also happening in our world somewhere (sect-leaders, Amish in positive meaning). <br/><br/>And for those once who did not know: when an audience is laughing (especially big muscular guys!) at a suspense scene, it means they are afraid. Laughing is a natural reaction to fear.<br/><br/>Of course there are negative things. M. Night Shyamalan is not a God and the producers are a problem, money, time-lines when movie has to be ready etc. There could be a lot of things better, but hey, like i said people have to open their mind watching the idea behind this movie, not looking to find mistakes and holes and twists. Go see Twister for that sake.<br/><br/>So I understand a lot of questions from peoples (why explaining Ivy a lot of things, but not about 'the wall' and a lot more other things).<br/><br/>The creature part as far as I am concerned could be kept more alive and suspense when the scenes with Noah falling in the hole were cut out and the part where Ivy finds out what is going on without showing to the audience (just screaming). The movie would be more balanced.<br/><br/>But over all: I am disappointed in the reviewers intelligence above all, but maybe that is the fault of the trailers and previews expecting a horror movie.<br/><br/>Very very interesting movie that will prove to be more interesting when I watch it for the second time (I will be looking for the link between the newspaper and the dead body and other hints for the time-line)."

","Shyamalan's best? That's like being the tallest man in Tokyo. Yet another beautiful piece of crap from a fifth rate Hitchcock. (and at fifth I am being generous) Just like his other films, the cinematography is excellent. Unfortunately, just like his other films, there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through! Shyamalan treats his audience like idiots who haven't the capacity to reason. (and judging from many of the comments they do suffer from this) I thought the stupidity reached a high point in Signs. (Think people-aliens to whom water is poisonous invade a planet that's 80% water?!!! Not to mention that star spanning aliens can easily be kept at bay with a sack or two of seeds??!!!) The Village follows in Shyamalan's typical dark foreboding style, and like the others creates so many incredibly dumb moments, that you are so busy going over the sheer idiocy of events and characters in your head, that you fail to notice much when the movie fizzles out. Please, don't let him write or direct again!!!!"

","The correct title of this film should be The Commune. <br/><br/>
It's telling that two of the main actors in this movie are William Hurt and Sigorney Weaver --two aging hippies performing characters who live out the flower power ideal.  The Village isn't centered around a turn-of-the-century village, but a contemporary hippie commune, filled with frustrated whimps who are too afraid of death to deal with life.  The main point of the film is that you can't run away from tragedy, yet these spineless folk tune themselves out completely, bringing their clueless children with them.  As a result, they end up with kids who live in mortal fear of ketchup, but seem strangely comforted by mustard.  --and none of this nonsense is scary. Crosby, Stills, and Nash once sang, ""Teach your parents well.""  These grown-ups should be whacked with a paddle.<br/><br/>One more thing:  there are no ""monsters"" in this movie.  It's all a lie (in more ways than one).  I thought hollywood had gotten past the stage of resolving the story with, ""it was all a dream.""  Apparently not.  The Village teases us with glimpses of something supernatural, before it totally deflates us with something maddeningly mundane.  What a cop-out.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard though, is this film's saving grace.

","""The Village"" is a beautiful looking, but slow, long extended ""Twilight Zone"" episode or Ruth Rendell-type mystery with a twist.<br/><br/>
Not only does the camera move slowly, but the characters speak very slowly, especially William Hurt as the Village Elder, to emphasize their non-modern context.  <br/><br/>So Bryce Dallas Howard lights up the screen almost by default because she gets showier action and lines (though she looks so much like Judy Greer playing her screen sister that I was confused at first about Joaquin Phoenix's subtly quietly different reactions to each).<br/><br/>
And there isn't much else that Phoenix gets to do, other than look like he could be the object of desire of two young women which he doesn't have to do much to be for any woman, even a blind one, while Adrien Brody just has to laugh a lot as the Village Idiot.  <br/><br/>The very slow build-up does finally have an ironic pay off, but we've gotten pretty restless by then."

","Although M. Night Shyamalan prides himself on his ability to multitask (writing, producing, directing, inserting himself into all of his films), The Village makes me wonder if perhaps he ought not share some of these responsibilities with someone less prone to egomania and the over-calculation that went into this film. Although there are shining moments in the movie (Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning) the majority of this film is full of overwrought emotion and overly thought out scenes. Shyamalan's depiction of the importance of color is striking, as is the music that takes a prominent place in the overall feeling of the movie. The music of the film is top notch. In the end, though, Shyamalan takes himself-and his ability to outdo his previous twists and turns-much too seriously."

Which would be OK as long as it were better then what they expected. This was by no was better then what I expected. This story line has been use to many times. The movie was slow to develop and then when it did it took off so fast that if you had left to go get something to drink by the time you got back the movie would have been over.

The plot is apparent way too soon, and the twists are more like slow turns. Insignificant characters are developed while key players are left for us to guess about their objectives and personalities. The secrets that are withheld from the viewers are mostly insignificant. The plot is released too soon and there is a feeble attempt to cloud it with trivial information. The Village is very slow moving. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up. If it did, I must have blinked.

There are moments of great photography, and there is a color quality that speaks for itself.  The eerie music is wasted on a bad film.  There is little to enjoy.  Bryce Dallas Howard remains remarkably good as the blind Ivy Walker, Hurt's daughter.  She is true to form, but another waste of a good performer.  Joaquin Phoenix also gives a good performance, but the stilted peculiar stage business is boring to say the least.  Don't waste your time or money on this cinema.

His movies are brand name titles that bring in millions of people.  However, The Village represents a brave piece of work from a now fearless filmmaker.  <br/><br/>People have been complaining about the not so ""surprise ending"", however this is not the point of the film.

In the scene where the ""creature"" breaks the barrier, the entire movie theater viewers take a jump towards anticipation, similar to Shyamalan's first creature sightings in ""Signs"". Then the theater started to snooze. The story line was so weak, I couldn't wait for a commercial break. At least the Twilight Zone could have wrapped this up in under 30 minutes (with commercials!) I sure am glad of the one line script to keep the ""airplanes and jets"" from flying over the movie! I guess Shyamalan didn't want a bomb to drop on this film. It didn't need one."

Night Shyamalan is trading on his Sixth Sense credentials, which admittedly are impressive, but he needs to work a lot harder than this to maintain a passionate fan base. It seems like the studios are letting him do whatever he wants in order to attach his name to a project. He wrote, produced and directed this movie.

""Signs"" was pleasant in that it had you on the edge of your seat, even if there was no surprise ending. All of these films were unique and poignant, with their own style and plot. ""The Village"" gives nothing new to the viewer except a bad taste in the back of the mouth.

"jubanoballa","Null","1","2","2 August 2004"," The Village Review; WARNING: SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT
","One more time. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br/><br/>OK, this is my first review on this site, so bear with me. I have found a way to appreciate every movie I see, including King Arthur and I loved the the last two Matrices. But, back to the Village. I saw this movie the opening night. I walked out and said: ""Oh my God, that was a s*** movie."" However, as I said, I have found ways to appreciate all movies, and, looking back on it, this movie was spectacular right up until the twist. SPOILER:<br/><br/>Twist 1: The creatures don't exist. They are created by the village elders to keep the other villagers from asking questions about the ""towns,"" the world outside of Covington Woods. Which leads me to twist 2.<br/><br/>Twist 2: Not as bad as the first. I was kinda thinking this throughout the whole movie and before it came out. The people moved into Covington Woods, cut off from society, to escape their pain. SPOILERS CONTINUED<br/><br/>OK, readers may think that those twists sucked. About twist 1. There are certain scenes throughout the film that don't fit in with this. Events that even the elders cannot explain. This leads me to believe that the creatures are, in fact, real. This makes me appreciate the film a whole lot more. It makes it seem as though the elders made a true choice by moving into the woods. That they risked so much just to escape their pain.<br/><br/>Concerning Twist 2. I saw this coming when I watched the making of it on Starz. It seems silly at first. Almost as though there is no real plot of the movie, it seems like it was all for nothing. However, the twist, when mulled over a bit, is quite powerful. The elders attempt to hide their past lives and their grief in black boxes. It was really quite (sounds hokey) moving. They tried so hard to escape their past lives.

"lanzman","Null","1","2","2 August 2004"," Desperate Screams for a Story Editor
","As we've come to expect from Shyamalan, the film excels at building a mood of low-key creepiness.  There's weirdness afoot in the village of Covington Woods, with big scary porcupine-boar creatures roaming the woods where the townsfolk dare not tread.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Shyamalan gets so caught up in mood that he forgets to build a logical story.  The plot-holes in this one are big enough to drive the USS Nimitz and its whole freakin' battle group thru.<br/><br/>Shyamalan could have taken this movie two ways: the way he did with a couple minor tweaks to make it flow a whole lot better, or a slightly different way with one or two fewer twists but a story that hung together better.  Too bad for him, and us, that he seems to have simply thrown a bunch of individually interesting and spooky ideas into a mish-mash of confusion.<br/><br/>I'm serious. A few minor changes would make this movie vastly more effective.  As it is, you see the ""big surprise"" coming a mile away.<br/><br/>Kudos for some good acting and camera work, tho.  It avoids the now-cliched ""Blair Witch"" rubbish of shaky hand-held camera work (tho it could easily have gone that way a couple time) and delivers splendid visuals.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's weakest effort so far.  The guy is crying for a story editor who can smooth out his ideas and fill in the plot holes."
"cwfultz","Null","1","2","2 August 2004"," Ouch! M. Night Shyamalan's career just took a hit.
","***SPOILER WARNING*** Do not read unless you have seen The Village, have no interest in seeing it, or do not care if any of the movie's secrets are revealed to you before viewing it.<br/><br/>The Village (5/10) stars Bryce Dallas Howard, William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and Sigourney Weaver. The film's plot, based on the plot given on the IMDb and the previews, is an 1800s colony who are going to be attacked by monsters that live in the woods around them.<br/><br/>I was so psyched! First of all, it was M. Night Shyamalan! How could it get any better? He brought us Signs and The Sixth Sense! Second of all, MONSTERS!!!!! YAYAYAYAY! Ever since seeing The Mothman Prophecies (9/10) I've been seriously intrigued by the Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster-type stuff. Of course, I didn't expect the monsters to be anything like Bigfoot because of, need I say it again, M. Night Shyamalan!! <br/><br/>Where did it go wrong?<br/><br/>First of all, The Village was suspenseful for the first hour (It's over two hours long) or at least until one of the ""twists"" or whatever was revealed to Ivy Walker (Howard). These were the times when we thought there was really something to fear. Everything went downhill from there.<br/><br/>
I was so disappointed in it. Maybe if they hadn't hyped it up to be about monsters, it wouldn't have been such a let-down. At my school, about twenty or so people have seen it. I'd say about 97% of them did NOT like The Village. <br/><br/>Why does M. Night Shyamalan have to use a twist? I think it's because people expect it of him, and if he didn't he would really be ridiculed. (Even though there was no real twist in Signs.) I think he took the whole twist thing to far. <br/><br/>But let me say this: I was speechless, though disappointed. This movie made me wonder if there were places like that. (I'm referring to the secret revealed when Ivy Walker jumps that wall at the end of the movie.)<br/><br/>Now, I think most people will be expecting less of M. Night Shyamalan."

It's slow, unsuspenseful, predictable, and worst of all, boring. I can forgive many things in a film, but being un-entertaining is not one of them. I don't know what's more of a mystery to me, why the studio OKed the film to be made, or that they actually went ahead and released it. The only reason I didn't rate it a 1 is because there is some good acting in it. My advice is to AVOID THE FILM ENTIRELY. Don't see it at the theater. Don't watch it on video, or cable.

","This movie had potential. A lot of it. Unfortunately, all the building in the first twenty minutes leads to... a dramatic... nothing.<br/><br/>This movie is really a predictable love story with two very predictable scary moments. Every other ""tense"" moment -- and the eons between them -- would be perfect fodder for Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. As the girl next to me screamed at the ""scary"" monsters, I couldn't help but laugh. (I hope Ann Roth can get some reuse value on her monster costumes -- they would be kinda cool Halloween costume rentals for a college party.)<br/><br/>*** BEGIN SPOILER REVIEW ***<br/><br/>The evil monsters are revealed for their true colors way to early, and the voice overs from previous scenes only insult the viewers who are always one step ahead of the story.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that this 1700s New England settlement is not what it appears. Unfortunately, the mystery is not preserved very long and there are not enough twists in the story. As the heroine seeks to embark on a mission to save the life of her husband-to-be, the outcome is too obviously foreshadowed by means of revealing the settlement's dirty secrets. Viewer confusion sets in as this foreshadowing begins to appear in flashbacks. (Yes, the past is in the future is in the past... got that?)<br/><br/>Thankfully, normal time flow soon resumes, but all pretense of scariness has been eliminated for the remaining fifty minutes of the film. The film's finale is straightforward and lacks any remote attempt at playing with the viewers' minds.<br/><br/>In the final scene, as the girl returns from her mission, the only question remaining is whether her efforts would actually save her fiancé. We'll never know, because the scene fades to black and the credits roll (with cheesy stage bill titles) before we learn the outcome of her (and our) lackluster journey.<br/><br/>Basically, by the time you are thirty minutes into the film, you will believe you know the ending... and you'll be exactly right. <br/><br/>I can think of more exciting ways to burn six dollars... light them up with a match. Better yet, rent a couple MST3k flicks from the local video store and enjoy them with friends in the comfort of home!<br/><br/>(By the way, the damp mood of this film was in no way enhanced by Showplace 7's poor theater conditions... the A/C was running on low and one could cut the humidity with a butter knife.)"

And like all celebrity drunks, he's hoping, in a boozy fog, that people won't notice the precipitous decline in artistic inspiration. It was truly a challenge to sit there and watch the starlit cast groping along with really crappy dialog. You know a film is in trouble when the actors are projecting visible boredom right there on the screen. William Hurt had one moment where he managed to wrench some emotive tension from his character....but at the end of the scene, it all blew over like a dry fart in the midst of the listless wasteland of a screenplay. <br/><br/>The premise was a dead dog to begin with. Like other reviewers I was desperately clinging to the hope of some last moment spark of genius which would unify the film or, at the very least, breathe a single moment of vitality into the plot. Not even a wheeze! At each ""plot twist"" I was groaning audibly and kneading my temples. I shudder to think of what the screening tests atmosphere was like.

","I am sad to say that my expectations have, in no way, been met. It seems that M. Night Shyamalan has finally gone out of his mind, thinking that this movie, with its thin plot line, terrible dialogue, and pathetic twist ending, for which he has become so famous, could pass as a decent addition to the ""suspense thriller"" genre. <br/><br/>There is, however, a silver lining to this soggy feature, and that is the performances of Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brodie. Howard, with this performance, has proven herself a more-than-capable actress, and really carried the film. She seemed to be the only one who was able to take the bland dialogue and convert it into something a bit more real. We can surely expect to see her in some great roles after this film, and maybe even around Oscar time. Brodie, as the seemingly gentle mentally handicapped person in the village, gives his best performance since ""The Pianist,"" which isn't saying much given ""The Singing Detective"" and ""Dummy."" William Hurt, as one of the village elders, gave a less-than-stellar performance, speaking as if he were in an episode of Star Trek. Joaquin Phoenix, one of my favorite actors, is underused and is given a very flat character. Finally, the great indie God that is Michael Pitt hardly has a part, and the one he does have is not worth his time. He should pick better roles than this, especially if he wants to become mainstream. <br/><br/>As for the plot of ""The Village,"" M. Night needs to be dragged out back and shot. It lacked completely in character and creativity. He needs to learn that he cannot base all of his movies on a decent plot twist or, in this case, a terrible plot twist that you saw coming at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps the great Shyamalan needs to take a creative writing class and get some of those juices flowing again.<br/><br/>All-in-all, ""The Village ranks as M. Night's worst venture into the genre thus far. Let's hope he can make a recovery back to the golden days of ""The Sixth Sense"" and the widely under-appreciated ""Unbreakable."" At least he has the sense to surround himself with good actors. 2 out of 10, and that is being generous."
"evilmatt-3","3","1","2","1 August 2004"," Are you serious?
","I'm feeling generous today.  M. Night Shyamalan gets a 3/10 from me because this movie had some decent visuals and a neat beginning concept. Everything- EVERYTHING- else about this movie is terrible.<br/><br/>The story has been beaten to death so many times elsewhere that for me to do it yet again here would just be cruelty.  Suffice to it say that the plot of this film is neither suspenseful nor well-written.  Unlike M. Night's earlier transgressions, this one is almost devoid of ALL interesting moments including the patented M. Night Shyamalan Cheap Sound Effects Scare (tm). As I sat there for what seemed like eternity, I was practically bored to tears on several occasions.<br/><br/>The acting.  The acting.  The acting.  I have the idea that M. Night thinks it's funny to collect a superb cast and then give them all a terrible script and worse stage direction so that everybody not only turns in the worst performance of their careers, but sound like they are rehearsing a high school play.  I honestly thought for the first half of the movie, ""No, surely the acting cannot be *this* bad by default.  He must be doing it on purpose.""  However, the jilted line delivery, wooden acting, and transparent facades of emotion from such cinematic greats as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt (and promising newcomers such as Bryce Dallas Howard) continued unabated throughout the entire film.  This is the most painful part of the film, and perhaps M. Night's worst offense yet to American cinema.<br/><br/>Because the acting is so terrible, any emotional effect whatsoever that would have been present in the movie is drained.  I simply didn't care whether anyone lived or died, and frankly thought the ""creatures"" were the most interesting thing to look at (if one can properly say that- I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that if you go to this movie expecting an in depth exploration of the supernatural, you are going to be angry.)<br/><br/>M. Night's latest trend is to include at least one thing in his movie so idiotic that he completely insults even the most basic audience member's intelligence.  Here, he manages to offend through the character of Ivy (to say she was played ineptly by Howard is to be luxuriously kind to both Howard and Shyamalan), who although blind, manages to run though field, woods, and houses without much trouble, can instantly locate any item she needs, looks people in the eyes when talking to them, and can ""see colors"" despite he blindness.  In some scenes, Howard even appear to have forgotten that her character is blind.<br/><br/>Shyamalan: Are you serious?  Am I actually to believe that this was a serious attempt at an adult film (let alone a thriller?)  after Signs, I simply called you a bad film maker.  Now, I'm beginning to wonder whether you might actually be mildly retarded.  I hope you're not serious."
"jdesando","Null","1","2","31 July 2004"," A less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one
","The very noun `village' connotes a closed community often out of time in an outer world grown increasingly forbidding.  M. Night Shyamalan's (`Sixth Sense,' `Signs') `The Village' incorporates those notions and more modern isolationism and xenophobia stemming from ultraconservative politics and `9/11' to create a less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one.<br/><br/>A late nineteenth-century hamlet in rural America is plagued by threats from monsters in its forest to the extent that the town fortifies itself with encircling high torches and a watchtower along with animals sacrificed and tossed to the woods as supplication. The fortified Utopia has the simple architecture of a Shaker Village and speech patterns in a stilted English often associated in depictions of Puritan life. There is a similarity to Arthur Miller's `Crucible' and the attendant problems of dealing with the unknown, in that case witchcraft and in this one, vague outside forces only briefly sited looking like red-cloaked college football celebrants with Howard Hughes nails and guttural speech like theirs after being over served.<br/><br/>Associated with the frustrating search for a perfect existence as chronicled from Thomas More to Hawthorne and now Shyamalan is the constant need to adjust for imperfection especially in the human body.  So medicine from the city is frequently the catalyst for facing the developed world; `The Village' is no different.  Rather than facing the disrupting intruder, the recluses must become intruders themselves to survive. In this film a striking parallel occurs with a `Twilight Zone' episode, in which Cliff Robertson's settler wagon train must send a member over the hill for medicine. Facing the outside world means endangering all that you have guarded from it but possibly saving your life.<br/><br/>A sub theme of the power of love nicely parallels the isolation one. Each character seems to struggle with embracing and exposing love not without dire consequences. William Hurt is believably torn by his and the other elders' decision to live and love apart.  His blind daughter, played disarmingly by Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, expectedly sees more clearly than anyone else, and Joaquin Phoenix creates the right mood of ambivalence about the whole isolation. Only Adrian Brody as a disturbed troublemaker is underdeveloped as a character.  Yet he does point out the obvious corollary that the enemy may be within.<br/><br/>The teens in my audience were restless for at least the first hour because the solemn tone and stilted conversation seemed as old as the village.  They were certainly not ready to forsake a good scare for lofty idealism, a good Shyamalan plot twist for an existential exploration of life's purpose for the social being.<br/><br/>`The Village' has Shyamalan's patented twist but not as shocking as those in `Signs' and `Sixth Sense.' The writer/director here reinforces the notion that `these days isolationism is not a good policy,' as the fat Ferrari warned Rick in `Casablanca.'"

","The Village is where it all started to go downhill from M Night Shyamalan. OK, so it was perhaps mismarkted as a flat out horror movie and it's not as bad as The Happening or The Last Airbender, but it's certainly not a good movie. An isolated 19th century village is being disturbed by the creatures in the surrounding forest. Part horror film, part love story, this is, in a nutshell, the Sunshine of horror films. Sunshine had a good first two thirds, before a misjudged twist sent it down the toilet. The difference here is that before the twist, the film wasn't good. Actors doing their best stoner impressions and speaking awkwardly bad dialogue isn't my definition of good. The story is sort of interesting, but it's too slow and creaks along at an overly leisurely pace. 2 dumb twists bombard audiences and undo what little tension there was before hand. This film suffered from misleading marketing, but it's Shyamalan's fault at well. He can do so much better than that lame script! <br/><br/>People forget that none of Shyamalan's twists make sense. Bruce Willis would have realized something was up since no-one ever spoke to him, the way Samuel L Jackson found Bruce Willis didn't make any sense, and why would intelligent aliens who are susceptible to water go to a planet which is 75% water? However, the twist that the village is set in the present day is just ridiculous. How has no-one found the village? Surely a plane will have passed over at some point? The plot in general is nonsensical. I knew the twist already, but it was still a jarring tonal shift. The Village benefits from some interesting social commentary and Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography, as well as a couple of the subtle, clever thrills which are the reason I like Shyamalan's earlier films. Still, TV never takes off, and from its opening it's just annoying and poorly written. This one is just silly, and in terms of logic there's no saving it.<br/><br/>4/10"

They could have afforded to get the best psychotherapy instead. <br/><br/>They move to the woods where somehow they gain knowledge of how people lived, farmed, dressed, and spoke 200 years ago, and they start living and speaking like that everyday, being very talented actors and essentially becoming the character they play, for the purpose of fooling their OWN CHILDREN that this is the only reality? What kind of parents are these? They want to protect their children, yet they create new monsters and terrorize their own children and grandchildren to hide in the basement? Mutilate animals?

Wouldn't there be a fire on a windy day? It gets windy there. Who supplies the gas for the street lights? Do women there just have 15-20 kids in their life time or does someone go to town to buy contraception? And what's even more dumb is the guard at the end of the movie. He is a subordinate and apparently he is not in on the scam, yet he allows a blind girl back in the preserve, even gets her a ladder, (it is his job to keep people out), where he knows someone else is seriously injured, and he doesn't tell his boss or the police.

The story is very deep and it draws the watcher into understanding the situations and care for the characters.<br/><br/>The relatively low IMDb rating is probably due to the fact that the film promotion misses its target audience, on one hand and draws fans of other genres, that fall short on their expectations, on another.<br/><br/>If you are looking for intelligent, beautifully looking movies, you cannot miss this one."
"Wuchakk","7","1","3","6 April 2013"," A Unique Film of Beauty and Mystery
","Released in 2004, ""The Village"" is not a horror film; it's a romantic mystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but rather all-around mysterious. It's a ""What if...?"" tale. The set-up presents the viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in the final act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out the answers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason to appreciate it.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surrounded by foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers are pretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts a young blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to find medicines in another town.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blind protagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent loved one. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also on hand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who know more about the situation than they let on.<br/><br/>Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with an aura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittingly haunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears.<br/><br/>There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near the end, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns. The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider is well captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl but ultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene -- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like the mysterious Native American bar sequence in ""Wolfen"").<br/><br/>Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" was outstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", I personally prefer ""The Village"" overall. Bottom Line: If you have a taste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on ""The Village."" It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ or A- <br/><br/>***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in the woods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the ""creatures"" may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed, but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's good at predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no way a viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that the story takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacket indicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by considering the possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and I never considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) and so were unable to discern the truth.<br/><br/>Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegorical slam against socialism in general and, in particular, that humanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title is a riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic ""It takes a village (to raise a child)."" Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrusting the care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens with the village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with the death of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, craven murderer.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage to survive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope for a better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimately seduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaders where she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the community and chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and execute the useless. Her love interest, the obedient Lucius, is unfit for the inner circle but will be useful as a goon-enforcer for the village as he carries on the Elders' practice of terrorizing its own citizenry in the guise of forest monsters.<br/><br/>As with Sweden, the village is dependant on Western capital. Its appearance of self-sufficiency is a facade. It was built with, survives on and is protected by the wealth of capitalists. This can't last forever, of course. As Margaret Thatcher put it, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."

","I saw this movie recently (2013). Was a big fan of The Sixth Sense, and thought this film is a horror movie. Didn't like Signs much, found Unbreakable an average movie. But the trailer of The Village got me interested. Believe me friends, The Village isn't what you are expecting it to be.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie thinking its a horror movie, don't bother. The first 20 minutes have too many characters and is boring, but after that there is a nice setting up of story. The village is based on a 1900's era. The villagers in the film have a pact with creatures in the woods that they would respect each others boundary and won't harm each other till they cross it. Red colour is the bad colour which is not supposed to be taken inside the village as it attracts the creature. I would say both Joaquin Phoenix and Ivy Walker have acted brilliantly in their respective roles. They are in love, and Joaquin gets injured by a person who loves Ivy. Ivy has been shown as a blind girl. Now she must go to the Town through the woods to bring medicine for Joaquin.<br/><br/>As all MNS movies there are a few brilliant twists before Ivy is supposed to go to The town, while in the woods and after she reaches the town. I would say it is a well made movie. And a very under-rated suspense movie."

","For this movie, M. Night seems to have taken Ingmar Bergman and added a touch of horror, but The Village does not work as a Bergman film or as a horror film. In fact, it does not work as a film, period. <br/><br/>The Elders in the Village have decided to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Although they were all formerly living and working in modern cities (i.e. the year 2000), for some reason they all speak in a stilted, formal manner that must be M. Night's idea of how people spoke 150 years ago. For example, ""What manner of woman was she?"" Nearly all of the actors have problems with this pseudo-dialect, especially William Hurt, and they come off as sounding somewhat idiotic and very artificial. <br/><br/>The director makes a point of showing shot after shot of barren trees, leafless and black against the cloudy sky. It must be November at least, yet we have a garden full of bright green cabbages. Our heroine, Ivy, is blind, but in the tradition of all lousy movies, she can ""sense"" things--in Ivy's case, people's ""color"". In order to get medicine for her boyfriend, who has been stabbed, Ivy decides to go through the woods where the ""monsters"" live and make her way to a town. Her father lets her go...he lets his blind daughter travel through the woods and to a town while he stays home. Her escorts, two young men, chicken out, and let her go on alone. But hey, it's okay! Before she leaves, Ivy's father tells her that the monsters are a myth created by the Elders to keep people in the Village. But wait! There is a real monster, whom Ivy manages to kill, clever blind girl that she is. But back in the village, we find out that the monster is actually the Village's village idiot who found a monster costume the Elders cleverly hid under the floorboards of the room they locked him in (brilliant move by the Elders and how convenient for the director). He goes after Ivy dressed as a monster. Blind as she is, she manages to lure him into a pit she encountered before, and he dies in it (why, we don't know).<br/><br/>This movie could be seen as a parable, but it would only apply to North Korea. I recently saw another M. Night offering, The Happening, and I cannot decide which one is worse. I wish I had three arms so I could give both movies three thumbs down."

But he's often misunderstood in today's flashy, immediate gratification society. Shame.<br/><br/>I think this movie is well worth the watch. Just good storytelling and good direction.

","The Village, Shyamalan's sixth film, is about people who live in a small, close knit utopian community, which resembles the Amish. They are surrounded by a forest that is inhabited by mysterious creatures. A truce exists between the creatures and the villagers that says that neither one shall enter the other's territory. However, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to go into the woods, and he asks the Elders if he can do so. He is turned down, but mysterious creatures enter the village, leaving red marks on the doors.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Shyamalan and the marketing team at Touchstone use this to get asses in the seats (on a side note he is very good at creating stories with a commercial backdrop - not many filmmakers can write intimate stories that offer commercial appeal at the same time), but that's not really what the movie is about. The Village is really a love story that personifies what love truly is, and not just some superficial word people throw around. A love triangle exists in the film, which is very reminiscent of many of Shakespeare's plays.<br/><br/>One of the best and most touching scenes in the movie takes place between Lucius and the divine Bryce Dallas Howard's (daughter of director Ron Howard, who gives a tour de force debut performance by the way) character, Ivy, in a conversation where Lucius confesses his love for her. Another of Night's strengths is creating a very subtle and resonant mood and dialogue without seeming pretentious or melodramatic. Ultimately, this movie explores how love gives us courage and makes us do things we are otherwise afraid to do."

Night Shyamalan, when he was praised for the most part for his past movies. He really started to push the twist thing a bit too far in a dull and negative way in this, and after finding out the twist I really wished I didn't know the twist. Even the characters in this movie is really awkward at times, but I guess it has a purpose. I really disliked the twist in this and personally I could tell what was going on a mile away, it was pretty obvious and nothing about it was really shocking or gripping. It wasn't even that suspenseful or scary at all what so ever. Overall it isn't a terrible movie, but if your looking for a good twist or suspense this one just isn't it.<br/><br/>5.3/10"
"kluseba","1","1","3","5 April 2010"," Interesting intentions destroyed by a superficial story and conclusion, weak acting, silly atmosphere and a wrong preview and publicity
","When I saw the preview of the film, I thought that I would watch a horror movie with a dark atmosphere, in an interesting place where many weird characters live isolated from the modern way of life. Well, I know that it was Shyamalan's intention to do a superficial preview and then to surprise those who expected a slasher movie. He wanted to cheat and laugh about us and to present his critical story about the society of the village to a larger public. Many viewer talk about the philosophic intention of the film which should make it more interesting, intellectual and profound than an ordinary horror movie.<br/><br/>Okay, I understand all of those viewers... but when I go to watch what is announced and presented as a horror movie, I don't want to see a slow paced portrait of an isolated village that is manipulating population. Another thing is that the story is very low, has a very weak development, but normally, Shyamalan surprises us with an interesting ending like he did in ""The sixth sense"", but here, he fails, because the ending is not only quite disappointing to me, but was also very clear after I've had seen half of the movie. You expect something else than and in the end you have to realise: ""Oh no, he really made it end like this!"" A part of this wrong publicity and quite unspectacular ending, the actors are not touching the viewer and do almost all a quite poor job, the atmosphere is too forced, too exaggerated so that it isn't a menacing, dark atmosphere any more, but a quite silly one after a while, especially while the girl is walking through the forest in the end. And concerning the critical or philosophic element of the movie, Shyamalan just touches the topic, but doesn't go deep or intellectual enough to underline his thoughts and intentions with which I would mostly agree. This element could have been very interesting and open-minded, but the explanation in the end seems just to be a weak excuse for a slow and boring movie without any shocking element. It,s quite interesting to discuss about those intentions, but it isn't sadly worth watching this movie.<br/><br/>If you'd like a horror movie taking place in an isolated old school village, check out a movie like ""Population 436""."

So where does all the wood come from? Also the blacksmith uses iron with no mine, The clothes are cotton with no cotton fields, and there does not appear to be sufficient cropland to feed the village. If this was it real 19th century village it would trade with other villages. So there MUST be regular deliveries of supplies to the village to keep it alive. So they CHOSE to let their children DIE and have childhood diseases rather than include antibiotics in their delivery runs. If they do not have delivery runs then they have a HUGE stockpile hidden somewhere which none of the children have found (or noticed). And why aren't some of the 'elders' injured. 18 year old boys KNOW they are immortal and at least ONE of them would have attacked 'those who we do not speak of' with a pitchfork.<br/><br/>Now ignoring all these holes (and many more stated in other posts), one of the points seems to be about using fear to control people. Many posters have taken this to represent their own country saying that the government creates fear to keep their people in line. Well I say bullshit. The fear in 'The Village' is unverifiable. That is, the children need to trust their elders about the danger and are not allowed to test it or fight it. In the real world the citizens are free to leave their country and check out the governments word. To see if their really is something to fear. They are also free to join a military and FIGHT the objects of fear. There is though a real-world group that uses fear to control their people. Does not allow their people to question or investigate the objects of fear. And relies on complete trust. I am speaking of religion. If 'The Village' is a parable, then it is about the evils of organized religion."
"Tweekums","7","1","3","23 May 2009"," Atmospheric drama
","I'd heard some fairly mixed reviews for The Village but decided to give it a go when it was on television as I'd enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's earlier film The Sixth Sense. While I didn't think it was as good as that film it was still fairly good.<br/><br/>Set in what appears to be a nineteenth century village the locals live in fear of the strange creatures that live in the surrounding woods, this fear is so great that none of the younger generation have ventured through the woods to the towns they know are beyond them. Since the village elders have had bad experiences in the towns the younger villages aren't that keen to risk going through to woods to go to them any way. This changes when Lucius asks permission to venture through the woods to get medicine from the town that he thinks may help his friend Noah who has learning difficulties. While he isn't given permission to go, Ivy the blind girl who loves him, has to make the journey when Lucius's life is in danger.<br/><br/>I've tried to avoid as many spoilers as possible as hinting at plot twists could spoil the film. I suspected the final twist fairly early in the film but right up until the reveal I wasn't certain about it so it still worked. The acting was good, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy and William Hurt as her father Edward Walker. While there are a few scares and there is a fairly creepy atmosphere there is very little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for most ages. If this is on television it is worth watching and perhaps worth picking up on DVD if you spot it in the bargain section; I've only seen it once but suspect it would be enjoyable even when one knows how it ends."

"elshikh4","1","1","3","25 May 2008"," Weak & Alleged !
","OH MY GOD! They told me that this was an excellent movie from Hollywood. They told me that this was (M. Night Shyamalan)'s masterpiece. They told me that it was a hit. Well, they never told me that they, themselves, were so dumb!<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the worst of (Shyamalan)'s suspenseful pieces yet. (The Sixth Sense - 1999) was good but for one watching, (Unbreakable - 2000) was breakable but artistically, (Signs - 2002) despite its fine meaning it was a (The War of The World)'s rip-off, then (The Village - 2004) is the most alleged and the less entertaining.<br/><br/>At first, some stupid detached scenes like it's a French New Wave film. Then a childish horror movie. Then a thought-provoking twist to see how there is some idea about fear which delays or retards a community. Then (Shyamalan) thinks the unthinkable, to make what's very new, so let's give them another twist; it's not happening in the old times, it's our own days, and the seniors are nothing but a bunch of university graduates or professors who wanted once to build Utopia. So, at the end, it's the beginning of the revolution to make this community maybe more utopian. The way of making this manufactured a real icon among all the celebrated nonsense in the commercial American movies lately. At least (Mystic River - 2003) was highly overrated already though not nonsense, and (Spiderman - 2002) was the top of silliness, however it didn't allege anything!<br/><br/>You may strive strong feelings of boredom by saying ""HEY, it's unusual. Give it a chance. It's some oddity. Novelty. Different"". BUT when it grows on, you would hate it, its makers, and yourself also for respecting such a work. It didn't deserve it, for instance: (Shyamalan) irritatingly makes the first 40 minutes as quiet as possible, in the lowest tone, to surprise us with the sudden appearance of the monsters. In fact, it could've been masterly done if this horror sequence was effective enough, or that the previous sequence was deeply enough, such as its like in (Alfred Hitchcock)'s (The Birds - 1963). However, the whole trick, rather the whole movie, sunk!<br/><br/>All the thrilling moments were primitive. There was no good acting, since there were no good roles. It didn't have convincing catchy characters, brilliant hot conflict, or dexterous profound meanings. This script just incapacitated its idea and its atmosphere into foolish treatment to turn out to be boring, assuming, and idiotically made. In one word, there is no horror, or else!<br/><br/>Moreover: How those people managed to separate this village from the whole world? How did they build it in the first place? How they got all of that old costumes, sets, and equipments? Why the father left his own blind daughter into the forest alone? Why he didn't go with her as long as there was no ghost but himself?? And that last sequence.. OHHH when Mr. (Shyamalan) himself plays the big sheriff who warns his deputy, as if the writer, director, producer gives us a bonus: a symbolically political satire! As he refers maybe to how the bigger society could be ruled by authority that owns the knowledge for itself, and makes all the people busy with fake ghosts, for achieving a hidden agenda. Remember bombing Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan after one week of Monica-gate, or claiming the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq for controlling it and its petroleum,.. etc. It can be well-meaning movie, but in the worst way ever!<br/><br/>I didn't find anything here to enjoy. Maybe (Bryce Dallas Howard)'s wonderful smile. I liked only the sound of her laughter since I don't deem any performance as something useful in this movie. What's the use of great machines in a deactivated factory? Not to mention, how honorable actors like (Brendan Gleeson) or (Sigourney Weaver) looked so naive or deceived in a dead drama like this? (William Hurt) seemed so imbecile, particularly at his last 4 scenes; like he was doing a Shakespearean play in a nursery school's stage!<br/><br/>So in this kind of work, you'd never notice why the progeny of this fear was whether a mentally-handicapped, or blind, or teenager anyway, because (M. Night Shyamalan), its very much creator, was its very much killer. To be all eventually a comedy, like the scene of the blind girl and the patrol, or a black comedy indeed about killing your own idea, making an idiot movie, and to be loved by millions of idiots in the same time as well!<br/><br/>Sorry, I hate to watch a bad movie, I hate it more when it got promising idea, and I hate it to the utmost when it alleges high meanings ridiculously."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","4 November 2007"," A Film that tests the viewers attention and forces them to think for themselves about the probability of something being believable or not. Clever and engaging.
","The Village is one of those films that comes very close to perhaps being one of the greatest ever made, it also comes close to being one of the biggest cheats ever put across in film and thus; comes closer still to being one of the worst ever made. I was undecided after viewing it very recently and I'm still undecided now  maybe time will clear my mind and maybe my opinion will change somewhat. I'm sure there are people that hate The Village because people like to be shown things that they recognise and like to be told what's what; but not here as here, you have to exercise your mind.<br/><br/>I'm all for 'twist' endings. I think the twist, when used correctly can be the one reason for a films greatness. Sometimes it's used well with The Usual Suspects being an excellent example as clues and hidden messages in something so immaterial as someone's eyes focusing on a certain thing can be the difference between knowing and not knowing. Other times, such as in De Palma's 2002 film Femme Fatale, the whole thing falls flat on its face leaving us cheated, angry and sad. The Village's twist works and if you watch it with no knowledge of it and without having seen any trailers or clips prior to the film; it really, really works.<br/><br/>I didn't quite know what to think at the end of The Village. On one had, it's a very clever film that has you believe one thing, leads you down a path and then pulls out the path from under you but on another hand, it's a complete waste of time  a mere exercise in 1890s mise-en-scene, cinematography and dialogue that is shot, edited and then has a silly revelation attached to the end. Shyamalan is no fool when it comes to hinting at his story. The film was marketed as a horror film but I think this was deliberate to throw you off. I was surprised at the different genres The Village seemed to fall into: there was the horror, of course but then there was the element of fantasy, look at it logically: It's 1890s America and all these people are living in fear of monsters that live in a nearby wood with no other community around for miles except beyond the dreaded wood. The people also seem too submissive to the monsters since they encroach and kill livestock and yet just like in Signs and Lady in the Water, people would rather run and hide than face them and fight  similarly to what I said about Lady in the Water: the problem is nothing a 12 gauge wouldn't solve (or a similar firearm given it's the 1890s) <br/><br/>The film also contains elements of the fantasy genre. When a character stated that she had her ""memories locked up in that box"", I thought ""how the hell do you lock a memory in a box?"" Given the what the film has us believe up until this point, I expected it to be this big, glowing ball of energy that rises up out of whatever it's in: how else is a 'memory' supposed to look in a physical form? From here, The Village becomes a love story very briefly with murder and heartache playing a large role. The film changes direction again: you don't get love stories in horror films as in depth and crisp as this one; another tick in the film's 'negative' column. But wow, was I wrong. The reason I mention all these things is that there is a logical explanation for it all and I knew there would be. The film isn't set in another dimension or another world, why would it be? It hasn't been established like it was in Lord of the Rings so you have to assume its here and now on Planet Earth. The Village looks like it has so many things wrong with it from frame one and yet thinking back after you know the ending, everything makes sense. Even if it seems bad and incorrect at the time, does it make it bad and incorrect if there's a reason for it? One example of what I'm saying can be seen in the character of Ivy Walker (Howard). A village elder sends her to the next town through the haunted woods but she's blind  great idea, huh? Not only this but she doesn't set off at dawn to beat the dark and she and her accomplice stop when it rains instead of keeping going to avoid illness or the monsters. All of these things sound suicidal and at the time, I was wondering what the hell they were all thinking; and yet it all makes sense when you look back following the revelation: why would someone send a blind person on a dangerous mission involving cannibalistic monsters, shortly before it gets dark? The answer is not as difficult as you think.<br/><br/>The Village is a criss-cross of genres; ranging from horror, thriller, fantasy, romance and possibly science fiction but it's not what you think since the film actually changes genre towards the end to something else that probably doesn't even exist  that itself is an achievement. Despite the lingering shots of empty rocking chairs and bare trees blowing in the wind adding an avant-garde feel (but keeping you alert as you try and work out why they're there, pointlessly), The Village maintains concentration and attention throughout without being too un-obvious."

","Less is more. I had to watch twice, over a long passage of time, to realize the REAL reason I loved this movie so much.<br/><br/>The plot had some very fulfilling and original contours to it, yes, that's what I thought made it great at first. But the real core of the movie is a series of gentle interactions. Each one is about drawing meaning from what does *not* happen. Less is more. Ivy to Lucius: ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them."" She's not telling him she loves him, only how she knows he loves her, which amounts to the same thing. But you don't really know she's right until you hear Lucius tell the same principle to his mom, to explain how he knows his mom is loved by Edward. Later her test of the principle, and her sliver of a smile, gives her secret away too.<br/><br/>Less-is-more is also part of the primary plot. The fear that grips the village, particularly the children, is amplified by the scarcity and subtlety of interaction with ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". Ha, even that name attempts to say more with less. But the REAL moral of this story, and the whole purpose of the village, is to provide a space for moments like Ivy-Lucius-Alice-Edward to happen. For less-is-more to distill the human spirit to purest essence. Every great movie is made great by a few moments. Seconds out of hours, opening up human vastness. To say Shyamalan crafts them masterfully is saying too much. I wish I could say less."
"DonutLover","6","1","3","25 February 2007"," Too big a Clue, Too Soon, but liked it anyway.
","I liked The Village. But, I have to say that I encountered a logistical problem, about five minutes into the movie. It was when the village folk sat down to their long tables, for their meal, or feast. They had some vague ""blessing"". There was no mention of their God, in an exact form, ie. ""Lord"", ""Jesus Christ"", ""Jehovah"", whatever. And, they were all dressed like Amish, so that lead one to believe that these were religious folk. Well, religious folk from long ago, had a specific God, and still do (Amish). They have some kind of semi-formal ritual, or custom, at the table, not just some California free for all approach. So, the question that came to me was: would this director be so negligent as to think that some liberal ""universal force"" would pass as religion to his audience? Of people dressed like this? I suspected that M. Night was a pretty smart guy, so NO he would not try to pull that off with his audience, as it would be too lame and obvious. So, then, that lead me to think: if the director is not trying to pull that off, and he WANTS us to see that these folk are DRESSED like pilgrims, but are actually NOT pilgrims (and I did assume it was earth), then that means that these folks are not who they are pretending to be, and I bet that this is modern day. It was as obvious as some banana sitting there with ""Dole"" marked on it.<br/><br/>Then, I was proved right. And, I was disappointed because I had figured out a main clue of the movie, and it was because of something simple thing like that. <br/><br/>I think the movie was marketed all wrong. So early in the movie, when the ""truth"" is revealed, that it is modern day and it's all a scheme to fool the kids, I felt the audience, collectively, sigh in disappointment. Too bad!! Because a) the story was cool, and b) the scenery was beautiful! and c) the characters were great, and J. Phoenix is very sexy, and the love story was good. I liked the movie overall, but the marketing of it, as some horror movie, destroyed it for many people. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite films, and I also loved ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs""! This movie would have been good, if it had been marketed as a drama, not a scary movie. It did have it's scary parts! And the monsters were very cool. <br/><br/>It also had me thinking that, these people had a bit of balls. I mean, to leave society and lie to your children, BIG time. All for the sake of making a better world for yourself, and your children. If these people had that kind of chutzpah, couldn't they have done something a little bit more reasonable, such as some vigilante thing, in their old world? Maybe killed the killers, or banded together to build some urban trap, to kill murderers and child molesters and rapists? Why did they just give up, and 86 their world? I liked the premise of the movie, though. And, I liked how the wife of William Hurt, reminds him very strongly of his oath, stressing ""oath"", actually reminding him of his oath to something more than just the village.

","Without a doubt this is the worst film I have ever seen. The storyline was ruined by bad script writing, acting was truly awful, and I was just glad I got a promotional DVD of a different film for going to watch it.<br/><br/>For me, a big offence was the acting of IVY, a blind girl. She sauntered around with her eyes open, and it wasn't until over half way through I realised that she was supposed to be blind. As several members of my family and close friends are blind, I thought this was a disgraceful portrayal of blind people, as it looked to me that she was faking it and any minute it was going to unfold that she could actually see the whole time and the blindness was just a ploy to con the other villagers, but no twist arose at all.<br/><br/>By the time the credits came on and I got up to leave, I noticed the viewing theatre which was crowded when I entered was now down to 6 other people excluding my companions.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch this film, take my advice and don't waste your time."
"megan-234","1","1","3","21 December 2006"," Worst movie I have ever seen
","The trailer for this movie was so exciting. I love horror movies and this seemed perfect. I planned on going to the movie the day it came out but a series of unfortunate events led me to having to wait almost 2 years before finally a friend and I watched it around 3 AM. Even at this hour I realized it was terrible. I hated how the camera zoomed up on the most random things, for instance the chair at some point, taking away the very little real drama there actually was. The acting was horrible, the characters seemed to be too detached. The blind girl falling in love, killing a mentally disabled guy in a lizard suit, and saving her boyfriend was way too much for me. And when the mentally challenged guy was locked away but some how found the lizard suit was just pathetic. I thought that the story was a good idea, but the creator (can't spell the name) made it seemed jumbled, like it wasn't proofread or a child's story. He had 3 different stories started at once. The horror part, the love interest, and the weird ending could have been 3 separate movies in varieties characters. I don't think the writer spent enough time on fixing some of the goofs and went too much into the dramatically unnecessary area. I am a teenager and I'm pretty sure I could have done a better job than he did on this. The only part I liked was when she found out they made the town to be a safe heaven for those who did not like the way the world was becoming, but I think that part was very weak."

","This film kept my interest from beginning to the very end and I must say it was a big surprise how this film made an about face and went into other directions. The story starts out which looks like an Amish community in Illinois or Pennsylvania, with lots of farm land and the people dressing way back in the dark ages of time. These people were instructed to never enter the woods that surrounded their village and there were very strict rules about doing practically everything. The Village was controlled by a group of men, namely, William Hurt who had a great ability to lead the people into doing just what he wanted, like puppets on a string. Problems seem to face the village and then the dark secrets of the past come into light and a young girl has to face the bitter truth. This is an entertaining film and good for Halloween night."

","I cant believed I wasted any of my life watching this film. It was awful. The director's love of 'clever twists' in his films make this as predictable as an episode of Scooby Doo. It must be said that The Village is awful in a special way. A film like Showgirls or Sidekicks is so bad that it's funny, but this was so bad it was just very depressing. Phoenix isn't a bad actor but this must rank as one of his worst films (yes, that includes Signs!). At the end of this film I was left feeling that nothing had happened. And come on, who doesn't find the thought of a blind girl navigating the forests alone utterly stupid? She would have starved and died in that hole not climbed out. Also, how could the monster being a disabled kid in fancy dress not be construed as anything less than hilarious? M Night Shyamalan films: They're not big and not clever."
"amamistyed","10","1","3","23 July 2006"," A work of art from beginning to end
","I have been so surprised at the negative comments and reviews for this movie. I think it is because it is a movie based on dialog and relationships with quiet and deep felt emotion rather than explosive acting...I don't know. But for me it is a masterpiece by a genius. The acting is superb by each member of a wonderful and obviously close cast. The mystical, moving music alone could cause me to watch it over and over. Many people comment on ""camera angles being good."" Misses the mark a bit. Every single frame of this movie COULD be framed...even the shot of Noah dead at the bottom of the pit. The enormous care that goes into the details of every scene of this and all of Shyamalan's movies is a gift to the movie goer.<br/><br/>Night's attention to individual characters is a wonderful change from the superficiality of most movies. The gentleness, honesty, humor and beauty of each personality is delightful. You get to know these people...they have quirks and fears and desires...and he causes you to care deeply about them. Mercy inhabits all of his films...and tolerance and understanding. He is able to take the most simple things and create depth and breadth and make each moment of a film memorable for some small reason or another. I don't think anyone has made a more beautiful love scene than the one of Brice and Joaquine sitting on the porch as he expresses his love for her.<br/><br/>The thing about this film, and I believe all of Shyamalan's films. is that you have to let yourself FEEL them. You have to slow down a bit and enter into the world he has created and become part of it for a while. But, then, isn't that why we watch movies? He gives us real people, able to be heroic with almost no one ever knowing...he give hope for the human condition...he brings beauty for the eyes and ears and uniqueness at every turn. <br/><br/>The Village for me was like a master's painting and I believe all of this particular master's paintings will become classics."

What remains from the works of Mr MNS is THE ATMOSPHERE. He can build the atmosphere of fear and apprehension perfectly in ALL his works. Watch ""The village"" alone at 2 am and U will admit that. The jungle surrounded by torch flames, the kids playing courage games, the apprehension and the anticipation. This s fun.. This s real cinema. MNS is a genius, and I daresay he outdid Hitchcok in creation of suspense. Anyway, the curse of Sixth Sense will haunt him forever. He started from the summit .. Nowhere else to go but down..

","When I first saw this film I already knew what the 'twist' was thanks to a friend of mine telling me all about it. However,I still enjoyed the film. The story is good but not amazing. What made this film great for me was the whole visual experience, this is what I watch films for. The cinematography was beautiful, every shot incredibly rich and textured. Admittedly, Shyamalan's direction draws on Spielberg and Hitchcock but he does what he does very well. The performances he gets from the actors are brilliantly subtle and a joy to watch. Finally I found the music by James Newton Howard so moving that I went and bought the CD as soon as I could. I know opinions are split on Shyamalan's films but after this I cant wait for 'Lady in the Water'. Go see this film but don't expect the scary monster movie it was promoted as at the time of release."

","People either love or hate movies by M. Night Shymalan. Herb and I loved The Village. I had read two Associated Press reviews, in the local paper and in the St. Louis paper. One hated it and the other gave it four stars out of four. Gene Shalit and Roger Ebert hated it. Richard Roper loved it. It seems there is no middle ground.<br/><br/>It is difficult to try to explain The Village without giving away the famous ""Shymalan Twist"" at the end. A tiny community of people lives serenely in a secluded valley, far away from the violence of ""the towns."" Creatures known only as ""those we don't speak of"" exist in the forbidden woods nearby. Villagers placate the creatures with ritual offerings of meat, and keep watch just in case of attack.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix has a leading role as Lucius Hunt, but Bryce Dallas Howard is the real star of this movie. It is hard to believe that her role as blind Ivy Walker is a debut performance. Oscar winner Adrien Brody has a pivotal role, and Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt also star. Of course, Night has a speaking role in the movie, as always, but you won't see him until near the end, and then really only the back of his head.<br/><br/>The lack of ""the bad color"" in the daily life of the villagers lends almost a sepia-tone feel to the film, although they use plenty of golds, light blues and greens. I wondered on the ride home if the illnesses that killed a child and caused Ivy's blindness could be due to a dietary deficiency. After all, they have no tomatoes, cherries, strawberries, or any other red foods.<br/><br/>I feel that the film raised issues about the lengths to which people will go for protection. Who hasn't daydreamed about a peaceful existence in lush countryside, far away from the noise, dirt and violence of the cities we really live in? On the other hand, Sherlock Holmes pointed out that secluded places have higher levels of dark, secret deeds. That is also true of The Village. To find out more, go see the film. You'll either love it or hate it."

THE VILLAGE is basically flawless on a technical level. Those who say the story sucked and the monsters weren't scary and the twist was terrible would probably rather enjoy watching that new mind-blowing Polson film HIDE AND SEEK or scream their heads off watching a girl roller-skate backwards in BOOGEYMAN. What a bunch of morons. Disliking THE VILLAGE is okay, since everybody has their own tastes, and although I know several people who love it all I hear is how ""horrible"" it was and how everyone was suspecting something greater. Well, if the ending was so disappointing then why didn't anyone guess the main twist, WHICH WASN'T REVEALED UNTIL BASICALLY THE VERY END. I guessed the twist for HIDE AND SEEK after watching one trailer. C'mon people, whatever happened to a little appreciation for effort. At least Shyamalan's trying to push the envelope a bit; THE VILLAGE had no CGI in it and dealt with deeply reflective themes of human nature. At the same time, it WAS scary, and WAS entertaining, contrary to what many people are saying. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out, but keep an open mind and please, relax."

","This movie is not what you expect it to be. First of all this is not a horror movie. So if you are looking for simple scares go watch another movie.

But if you've seen some of M. Night Shyamalan's movies you know how good his plots are and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>The great soundtrack, relying on a piano and a single violin, excellently matches the tone of the movie. I cannot think of a better way to strengthen the feelings of the audience.<br/><br/>The acting is just wonderful. Bryce Dallas Howard as blind Ivy Walker is very believable and so is Joaquin Phoenix as the shy Lucius Hunt. The chemistry between those two actors is simply right. The rest of the cast also does a great job. This helps a great deal to make the movie believable.<br/><br/>A must-see if you ask me. Just don't expect a horror film. 9/10 Stars"

","I'm so glad I didn't waste money seeing this in the theaters and waited until it came to satellite. I can't think of a much worse way to spend $7.50 then to see this silly little movie.<br/><br/>First, let me say that I did enjoy the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs immensely. They all were moving, well done films that knew how to keep your suspense heightened. Suspenseful films are some of my favorite films to watch and Shyamalan is normally a master at it.<br/><br/>The ""suspense"" in this film revolves around eerie creatures in woods outside a nineteenth century village. The people in the village fear the creatures but are safe as long as they don't venture out into the woods. Of course, you know some of the villagers, being naturally curious, will eventually wander out in the woods. So the creatures do some things to make sure the villagers don't do it again. Are there some hidden meanings and secrets involved with the creatures and the villagers? Of course there are...after all, it's a Shyamalan movie.<br/><br/>But there is no reason for me to even discuss the ""secrets"" involved with the creatures, the village, or any other part of this movie, because they are just so unbelievably silly. Let's just say that some secrets are not worth $7.50 nor an hour and a half of your life to find out. The difference with the other 3 Shyamalan movies I mentioned above is that the secrets involved with them were at least somewhat believable and so did not ruin the stories.<br/><br/>I really hope Shyamalan learns from this meager effort and puts a little more thought into his next movie."

There isn't really even an implied horror. Some of the decent horror films at least implied there would be something about to happen. But this movie managed to lack even the slightest amount of suspense. This was a period piece where a bunch of obviously bored looking actors spoke ad nauseum about the possibility of the potential that something might happen if one ventured into the woods...One really couldn't care about the characters.

The story is also too transparent, i think it took me about ten minutes to figure out the plot. The acting was OK, but not anything special considering the cast. especially Sigourney weaver got little or no possibilities to show of her talents. I would also like to note that the trailers for the movie was misleading in terms of what kind of atmosphere and genre this movie is in.

They are definitely scary, modeled almost exactly like the devil's henchmen in Time Bandits, those tall cloaked creatures with the cows skull heads and hook hands if you have any idea at all what I'm talking about. Gilliam was definitely onto something, because as goofy as they sound, for some reason they scare the crap out of you. Shamalyan has a gift for getting the absolute scary most in a situation, and in this film he exercises the talent generously. Here's the trouble, if you find the fright ineffective, I can almost guarantee you will hate this film, because not a whole lot else happens in it. There isn't a plot as such, its more of an examination on the way of life and the attendant troubles of a closed off society. The trouble of the creatures becomes the overriding drama, and the Twilight Zone style resolution isn't bad. Its not great however, and there's unquestionably too much ineffective dead time. Fans of this director will no doubt overlook the shortcomings and repeated themes, and enjoy one of his scarier efforts. For the average guy on the street, it might not satisfy."

","The best way to judge this film IMO is just see it. Don't read the reviews or see the trailers. I didn't even bother to read the comments in IMDb. Being blanked, I see good casting and very good acting (especially by Ms. Bryce Howard). A very well shot scenery with its appropriate soundtrack. Then the story. If you are not expecting a copy of the Sixth Sense, then you will find a original plot; a mixed of romance, a sophisticate (thus, not cheap) thriller and original storyline. I think everybody know that there is something wrong with the notion of the ""ceature"", but nobody knows WHAT and WHY. It makes me very curious and here lies the originality IMHO. Some ppl said it is predictable. I bet they just want to look smarter than they are. Slowly at the climax of the film, in a flashback, Shymalan revealed the mystery piece by piece. A masterwork. 9/10."

","I think that there was an ulterior motive to this production : it was designed so that it could not be critiqued, with out 'spoiling' the film for the reader. But I will try.<br/><br/>First the dialog : for those reasons, of which I cannot speak of, was awful. It was as if the cast (which included William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquim Phoenix , Brendon Gleeson and Bryce Howard) had to be untrained to act. It reminded me of a high school Shakespeare production.<br/><br/>Why? Why do they speak as though this takes place not here and now but in an unknown time and place not of the choosing of mortal men and of mortal women?<br/><br/>Then there was costume and props. They didn't just span decades. They spanned centuries! For those unmentionable things, of which I can not speak, I couldn't figure why this had to be this way. It look as though the village was furnished by PBS's 'Antique Road Show'. Had the costumes and props been consistent, the entire story would have been much more believable. But I will speak no more of this for it is not to be spoken of.<br/><br/>And then, everything creaks! Everything. Every step, every door, every box, everything! There are no sounds in the forrest except twigs snapping. No birds, no crickets, no other noises excpt for that swarm of invisible flys .... of which, my sense of sight does not perceive.<br/><br/>Then there is the story itself. It seemed to purposely imitate the Stephan King style.Of course there is a 'moral to this story', and it's totally 'retro'. The film missed the point, and the audience by about twenty years.<br/><br/>I would not doubt that the imaginative M. Night Shamalan will one day come up with a winner, but ""The Village"" certainly is not it."

","You did it again Shayamalan. I was hoping Signs was just a fluke in how bad it was, but you managed to almost just as bad with the Village.<br/><br/>I still love your cinematography. Very beautiful art direction, very much draws the viewer into the ""period"" world that you have created. Your direction and the actors also perform very well and are the last good things about this movie.<br/><br/>The fault with this movie, as it was with Signs, is in the screenplay/plot. Now maybe you could just blame high expectations because I would agree that with both movies (after loving both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) I had very high expectations and couldn't wait to go and see them. But truthfully, in both cases I was expecting to get a Ferrari and all I got was a Tercel. You walk into the Village hoping for at least a scary movie, but I gotta say this movie isn't at all frightful! The creatures when you finally see them are such a major let down! All I will say is that I kept thinking of the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>And the plot twist I saw coming a mile away! Almost from the beginning when William Hurt is telling the school children in class about ""Those we do not speak of"" I suspected it but I was like nah, Shaymalan can't be that silly with his plot lines. But about 20mins before it was finally revealed I knew for sure, how the rest of the movie was gonna play out and was begging God that I was wrong.

"helleberg","1","1","3","2 August 2004"," One of the worst-written flicks I've ever seen
","M. Night holds true to his pattern of following a hit with a stinker (see ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"") with this gem. The dialogue was stilted and dead, like a bad parody of Hawthorne or Austen; the characters were caricatures; and the trademark twist was obvious a mile off and rather unsatisfying when it arrived. This movie fails as a thriller, fails as a romance, and isn't all that strenuous as an intellectual exercise.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>I get that the ""period"" dialogue was meant to help sell the set-up, but at times it gets so bad that even the most generous viewer won't be able to help but think, ""These folks sound like they learned how to talk by reading Regency romances."" If anything, the movie would have been more convincing if the actors spoke contemporary English. This is a common liberty taken in film, where a movie is understood to be historical through setting and costume, even if language is contemporary. As a parallel, think about movies where foreign-speaking characters either 1) speak with an atrocious accent throughout to demonstrate that they're not speaking English or 2) speak in their native tongue with subtitles for a few lines, then in unaccented English throughout. However, if the filmmakers are dead-set on the period dialogue, at least it could have been done halfway decent.<br/><br/>I get that the knifing of Lucius is ""another dang Hitchcock homage"" (henceforth, ""adHh""). A little tip of the cap to the master in the form of a little stolen slice of Psycho. Why is it that so filmmakers today think that cribbing is the best lesson that can be learned from their predecessors? The take-home lesson from Hitchcock ought to be ""innovate and surprise,"" not that ""wounding/killing the main character and focusing on a new main character is a good plot device because it worked in Psycho."" And this brings up another issue: After Ivy is becomes the new main character, why oh why would her father send his *blind* daughter into the woods, with or without guides? If the guides remain with her, then the secret of the village would be compromised as they would see the truth. If the guides turn tail, then you've got a blind girl stumbling around alone in the forest. And this for the sake of saving lives in the village?<br/><br/>To consider the movie as an intellectual exercise, it seemed to me that the more you think about the thing, the more it unravels. For example, why on earth would these people adopt wholesale the style of the 19th century except to fool the viewing audience? Yes, as far as being a closed environment, the villagers would have to produce everything themselves which, while very ""Frontier House,"" gives absolutely no reason why they'd adopt the period speech. Aside from the Elders, everyone in the village would have been born there. The elders wouldn't have to adopt ridiculous speech patterns to fool their kids as their kids would have no real idea about the outside world, let alone the history of the outside world. Aside from Hurt, none of the other characters have any background in history. Maybe this is why we're to believe the dialogue is so bad: because everyone is trying to talk in the manner of ""Masterpiece Theater."" This leads a viewer to believe that the great farce is staged not for the youth of the village, who have no notion of nineteenth-century vs. twentieth-century idiom, but rather for the audience in the theater.<br/><br/>To pick a final nit, why on earth was the guard shack so well equipped with first aid supplies? Most fire stations aren't so well stocked. The ""for animal bites"" explanation seems so contrived that, well, I guess the assumption was that if the viewer is still buying this, they'd swallow anything.<br/><br/>So what's left to take home from this movie? Are we to assume that the social commentary is that Heightened Terror Threat Levels are bad? That manipulating a community through fear is detestable? If so, then why does the village carry on? Why do we get a strangely hopeful end for this isolationist village? Because protecting innocence is worth a little fear and deception? Whatever. Bad, bad, bad."

","""I've seen this movie, it's rubbish! The big twist at the end is, they all live in the present"" is what The Annoying Devil in Channel 4's Balls of Steel said about this film, maybe I should have listened to him, because it is pretty random, and boring. Basically there is an isolated 19th Century village surrounded by woods, the village people have seen creatures dressed in red hooded cloaks (like Jedis), so they are afraid to go in the woods, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is injured (I can't remember how), and the pretty blind Ivy Walker (Spider-Man 3's Bryce Dallas Howard) goes into the woods to find medicine, and this is how we the audience find out that they are living in the present day. They must have been bloody scared by those creatures to stay in that village and not go out for a whole Century. Also starring Adrien Brody as Noah Percy (is he supposed to be handicapped, or is he just an idiot?), Lost in Space's William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, 28 Days Later's Brendan Gleeson as August Nicholson, Cherry Jones as Mrs. Clack, Jayne Atkinson as Mrs. Tabitha Walker and Judy Greer as Kitty Walker. I'd rather watch the spoof done in Scary Movie 4 than this again, only that ending sticks out in my mind, director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) has let himself down. This is purely from the fact that it bored the pants off me, didn't have enough (pretty much any) great thrills or jumps, and it isn't a real horror film. Pretty poor!"
"solonjohnson","9","1","4","5 March 2017"," An amazing movie of Love and what love will make you do.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Village starts out with a father sadly lying beside the coffin of his young boy. The village after the death of this young boy goes back to the routine of life with a simple yet peaceful way of life. You can tell that this village has many sorrows but is very peaceful. Events then unfold to show that this village has many queer things about it, such as red being a bad color as well as the citizens never leave the village. People of the village fear that once you go out of the village monsters of red will attack you in the movie these monsters are called ""those who we do not speak of"". So, the people of the village make sure to never leave the village for fear of ""those who we do not speak of."" Through the movie ""those who we do not speak of"" leave marks and warnings not to leave the village. Another tragedy occurs should the main character leave the village for help? Throughout the movie, M. Night Shyamalan uses unique ways to create suspense which hooks the watcher in. M. Night Shyamalan uses long shots as well as reflections. When you cannot see the thing of importance and you can only see the character's reaction you badly wish for the camera angle to change so that you can see what the characters see, in this way long shots are very well used. Another characteristic of suspense created from the cinematography was reflection of water, showing ""those who we do not speak of"" in pursuit of the main character, this effect creates much suspense and desire to change the angle to see the monster's physic. This effect keeps the audience questioning the appearance of these monsters. Another ingredient of suspense in The Village was the amazing music that enraptured you putting you in the shoes of the character. In conclusion, I find that The Village is an amazing enrapturing movie. M. Night Shyamalan skillfully uses reflections and long shots to create suspense, as well as using extremely suspenseful music to match the amazing cinematography. I would recommend this movie to a friend if you are into a suspenseful deep thinking sort of movie."

","This was a film with a lot of potential, but it was just bogged down with problems. The music was a mixed bag because some of it was actually quite nice while other parts of the soundtrack were just cringe worthy. The acting is just bad even from some of the amazing actors this film received. It just felt like the film makers went with the first take and the actors weren't given enough time to get used to the style of speaking that was used in this film, although towards the end it seemed like some actors began to settle into their roles. The camera work was very competent and I really liked the look of the village. The characters had potential, but they weren't really given enough time to develop and they didn't really work off of each other very well. Nothing really scared me in the film because we never saw anyone actually get hurt, so the creatures never gave the illusion of being a threat. The motives of the elders and the way the society in the film works do bring up some interesting questions, but it just doesn't warrant an entire film being mad, and other films have touched on similar themes."

","I have to admit, the first time I watched The Village"", I quiet liked it. For some reason it reminded me of Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"", had this fairy-tale-ish quality that's very rare among Hollywood movies; I thought that Adrien Brody did a good job.<br/><br/>I have to admit, the first time I watched ""The Village"" I had a little too much wine that evening.<br/><br/>Then I watched it a second time – sober – thinking to myself, ""What the hell am I watching here? And why am I watching this?"" A storyline that is so hackneyed, you might suspect that it has been written by a 3rd grader and a finishing twist that seems to have been pulled out of an orifice that IMDb won't allow me to name here. No, I'm not going to count up the plot-holes – look, there's already more than 1,000 reviews on this page, most of them talking about the plot-holes and inconsistencies (the handful of positive reviews are probably written by Manoj Nelliyattu himself or people suffering from delusions).<br/><br/>Generally we have a cast of able actors but, as is the case in almost all film productions, the director is the boss and if the director tells the actor, ""act weird"" or ""recite these lines, whether they make sense or not"", well, the actor hasn't got much of a choice. So don't blame those poor sods; the blatant nonsense you'll be watching has grown on the manure pile of director Shyamalan.<br/><br/>See, Shyamalan used to be an able director – not brilliant but good, who knew how to make an average-to-good film. Unfortunately, at one point in time the young director begun to believe in his own hype and began directing film despite better knowledge and common sense. Megalomania is actually a real psychological disorder that's clinically treatable – but throwing a million dollar budget at somebody afflicted and confirming his mania, that's called enabling, and that is what Hollywood's soulless executives are essentially guilty of. ""The Village"" was just the beginning and the final result (until this point in time) can be seen in ""The Last Airbender"".<br/><br/>You, dear reader, may have come under the impression that I harbor a certain animosity toward the director. I assure you, that is not the case. I wish M. Night Shyamala nothing but the best, that he may one day recover and find his spot in the industry where he belongs and where his work will be appreciated – in Bollywood cinema.<br/><br/>Years later I would watch a spoof-scene in one of the ""Scary Movies"" films – pretty much summons up that train-wreck of a movie that is ""The Village"".<br/><br/>I have to give a mandatory one point, so I try to console myself by saying that I give it to Brody, who has to play ""The Village"" idiot – out of pity."

I had to keep checking how long until this train-wreck of a movie was over. The acting isn't that wonderful, either. And then there's that scene towards the end, when you find out that the villagers have been living in modern times the whole time. Seriously....?

"captain-balrog","1","1","4","30 April 2009"," Its not big and its not clever
","This chap has made a career out of what in modern times is considered a poor plot device that is indicative of a lack of writing skill, the deus ex machina or god from the machine. For those who aren't familiar with this it comes from Greek tragedy where a god character would be lowered onto the stage via a crane and would then solve a given plot line. Deus ex machina's meaning has expanded to include out of the blue resolutions to plot lines in modern fiction; this is what I tend to think of as a 'Dan dan Dahhhhhh' moment. It is a cheep trick and once you know that a particular writer/director is prone to it their work becomes very predictable. <br/><br/>In addition to using the same trick as many of shyamalan's other movies the village is also an excruciatingly dull, plodding affair filled with bland characters and incredibly silly plot holes but I think others have said all that needs to be said about that. What i really want to know is why everyone in the village talks like Yoda.<br/><br/>I don't comment here often but it really annoys me when this kind of thing gets a reputation for being clever. The Fountain is a clever movie that works on many different levels and is also extraordinarily beautiful in both story and look. Those of you who think the village has something to offer as a love story might want to take a look at The Fountain as an example of a movie that has real emotional depth.<br/><br/>In closing I would like to say that I think the deus ex machina can be a fun device in a popcorn movie like the statue of liberty appearing at the end of planet of the apes but it is not clever by any stretch. It's the kind of thing a bunch of stoned teenagers might come up with sitting around in a bedroom having one of those wouldn't it be cool if conversations.<br/><br/>P.S. The comparisons with Spielberg are not unfair in my view, a plot that takes place as a backdrop to a seen it all before family drama? Awfully familiar."
"baumer","3","1","4","25 June 2008"," Almost as bad as Lady in the Water
","There have been a plethora of opinions espoused about The Village. Some positive, some negative, and some very ambivalent. There are those that love this film and others call it the antithesis to what made Shyamalan famous revered by critics and film lovers. <br/><br/>The difficulty in reviewing a film like The Village is that there is an incredibly fine line between reviewing the film in terms of how well it was made and reviewing the film in terms of how utterly contemptible it is towards it's target audience. The first question you have to ask yourself is if this is a well-made film? Sure, it is competently made, it is well acted and it is scored nicely. If you look at it that way, then The Village is a well-made film. But if what you are looking for in a film is something more sophisticated and shrewd from a man like Shyamalan, then The Village is an abomination. It is nothing but a charlatan that when viewing the film I thought I mistakenly heard Shyamalan was the man behind this film. To cut to the chase, this is one of the worst films of 2004 only being surpassed thus far by the universally accepted fetidness of Catwoman. The Village in some ways is worse than Catwoman because it tricks you into believing that you are about to see one movie when you are really in store for another. The Village goes into new depths of purgatory from a marketing standpoint. When filmmakers and studios can lie to you about what you are to see, then we have reached a new low in the art and business of film. I didn't go into Alien vs. Predator expecting to see a story about aristocracy of Old England and I didn't go into The Village expecting to see nothing but a nostrum of monumental proportions. While Catwoman is a poorly made film by a man with one name, The Village is almost worse because Shyamalan is synonymous with the pinnacle of the craft. Regrettably, The Village is nowhere near brilliant. Sadly, it's almost at the other end of the axis. The Village is terrible.<br/><br/>The Village begins with the townsfolk attending a funeral of one of the young boys of The Village. He was seven years old and by the engraving on his gravestone, we can see that the film takes place in the very late 1800's. The Villagers are a very simple and peaceful people and they keep to themselves. They refute any outside influence and have chosen to live in seclusion. This seems to work for them and the nearest town is miles away. They farm, they dance, and they live in a harmonious concord . But of course there is one problem; the uneasy truce they have with the entities in the woods. There has been an ostensible truce between the villagers and the entities in the woods for years and their kinds do not mix. The villagers stay out of the woods and the entities stay out of the village. There are certain precautions that must be taken by the villagers that include a watchtower that is occupied at night and the color red must never be seen by the entities in the woods as it apparently attracts and angers the woodsmen. <br/><br/>Harmony is omnipotent in the village until suddenly animals are found skinned and when one of the villagers has gone into the woods. The village's remuneration for their pretentious and defying act is a midnight visit by the beasts. Everyone runs for cover and this is the one and only moment of laconic tension. By this point in the film, it has crawled along at a snail's pace and we are ripe for some Carpenteresque type of tension. When this finally transpires, we think that the film is ready to take us into the realm of ambiguity that consistently graces Shyamalan's films. But what transpires next is a mendaciously misleading series of events that can do nothing to disguise the machination that Shyamalan set out with in the first place. We thought were walking into a horror film that would make the hair stand on the back of your neck, the way Sixth Sense did and the way that Signs did sporadically. But what we get instead is nothing but a quack job that cons us out of our money. <br/><br/>Shyamalan is synonymous with ""twist endings"". To borrow a line from Spiderman, that is his gift to us and also his curse. With great power comes great responsibility and Night has abused that power. He might have had noble intentions when he wrote this film as many have discussed the symbolism of the red flags and bad colors and the implied danger inherent in this film, and if that is what you enjoy, a subliminal film that lectures us and works as a parable, then by all means, pay your ten bucks and go see this film. But if you were hoping to be enthralled by an ostensible master of modern suspense and horror, then you are going to be disappointed. Shyamalan has given us nothing but an amateurish picture so engrossed in sanctimonious and implied admonitions that he forgot to make the film entertaining and suspenseful. The Village is one of the most absurd films loaded with esoterica and it is ultimately a colossal failure. The ""twist"" in the film produced gales of laughter from the theater I was in and it carried over as the audience left the theater. For a sheer waste of money, see The Village. For a film that had such pedigree to it, it is one of the all time disappointments. The Village takes several steps back for a man of Shyamalan's stature and reputation. Let's hope the next M. Night Shyamalan film is better than the last two because his statute of limitations on creating disappointing films just dropped significantly.<br/><br/>3/10"
"ShootingShark","7","1","4","24 January 2008"," Exceptional, Chilling, Suspenseful, Romantic Fable Of Isolated Village Haunted By Monsters
","The inhabitants of an isolated village live in constant fear of monsters which inhabit the surrounding woods and never leave. Ivy, a young blind woman, is in love with Lucius. But when he is stabbed by a rival for her affections, she requests that she leave the village to find medicines in the towns. Can she survive this perilous quest and save Lucius ?<br/><br/>I love the timeless quality of Shyamalan's movies; he completely ignores current fashions and as a result his work is the polar opposite of everybody else stylistically. He makes horror movies so they should be full of screaming teens, CGI effects and rock music, but thankfully they're not. This film was made in 2004, but it could have been made in 1954 and it will still be as good in 2054. It eschews cheap thrills and overblown visuals for subtlety, understatement and atmosphere, and is simply brilliant. The scene where Lucius walks a few feet into the woods to pick a berry typifies Shyamalan's genius; it's riveting, scary and exciting, but is all done with one shot, suggestion, sound effects and music. Did we see a monster there ? What happened ? Delicious. The movie takes its time to build the characters so that we know the people and the place intimately when the tension starts to crank up, but at the same time it's constantly teasing us with diversions and hidden meanings, leaving us nervously unsure what to believe. The protagonists of the movie may be archetypes - star-crossed lovers, Village Elder and Village Idiot - but the plot and the people are never conventional; the heroine is blind, the hero gets laid low halfway through, we're never really sure (until the end) whether or not the monsters exist and we make incorrect assumptions about when it's set. The four leads are excellent, notably young Howard in the physically demanding and emotionally complex role of Ivy, with a first-rate larger ensemble. As always in a good horror film, photography and music are crucially important, and this is an exercise in how to do it right. Roger Deakins uses classic techniques to both show and hide the creatures and the whole movie somehow looks as if it was lit naturally (imperative to the story), while James Newton Howard's music quietly growls and scares the pants off us. Shot in lovely lonely locations in rural Pennsylvania, it also features fine costumes by veteran designer Ann Roth. Exceptionally well written, produced and directed by the gifted Shyamalan (who plays the security guard reading a paper), one of the few young directors working who brings real depth, storytelling prowess and classical style to his work and isn't just the usual MTV airhead. Long may he continue to make such breathtaking and entertaining films."

","""The Village"" is one of the few films that will, later in history, become a classic. If it does not, then we have lost sight of what makes a moving and essential film. It is both terrifying and beautiful, or put more simply as M. Night did in describing the work of Andrew Wyeth: ""Creepy beautiful.""<br/><br/>There are several critics who have done all they can to cripple any power or mystique the film has into some cheap attempt to revolve a plot around a single twist, spelling out all of the details along the way. However, I feel that all of this critical smearing is incredibly unwarranted, and that despite M. Night Shyalaman's power and weight with the likes of the executives at Disney, he has established himself as one of the most talented and important filmmakers of all time with this very film.<br/><br/>Needles to say, ""The Village"" is my favorite of his films. I cannot watch Ivy hold Lucius Hunt's hand in the final scene and say, ""I'm back, Lucius"" without feeling the heavy burden of tears welling behind my eyes. Even now I feel them as I think of the film. I think much of this has to do with not only stellar acting, directing, and cinematography, but also the music. James Newton Howard's score for this film is absolutely incredible, and I feel that even though he could have accomplished most of the film's brilliant atmospheric sound without her, Hilary Hahn is nonetheless an indispensable component to the music. Her single, arpeggio-filled violin pierces the madness and restores a needed sense of simple, minimalistic beauty, which is often equated with the love between Ivy and Lucius.<br/><br/>There is much more I could write about this magnificent film, but there are simply too many points for discussion. This leads me to my final argument: ""The Village"" is worthy of deep critical analysis. Had I the time and patience to do it, I would prove it to the world. The film seems so simply executed, so perfectly and easily constructed. However, there are several levels of symbolism and repetition that could be worthy of something like what Robin Wood contributed to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, not to mention more broad universals like foreign relations amongst people.<br/><br/>In matters of my personal opinion, I don't care what nay-sayers and bored critics say, because no matter what films he goes on to create, this one will always resonate in my mind, both conscious and subconscious. I think that it truly brings out that very human subconscious fear of ""The Other"", which, despite what we may assert on the surface level, we can all understand."

","What is up with this movie? Honestly? I did like the plot and the sudden twists in the tale, but Shyamalan's movie's are a bit too over the twists and tingles. I liked The Sixth Sense because they had REAL ghosts and I also liked Signs because there was REAL aliens but fake things like ""Mythical Creatures"" in The Village just doesn't please me, so I ask myself, what if the creatures were real? Here is some pointers of what would've happened: ~Creatures are too stupid to own there own property. I mean, do you see Bambi fighting over the woods? Know what I mean...<br/><br/>~The Elders would've known about it and had never moved into the village.<br/><br/>~There would be attacks every night or day because when you get hungry, you have to eat like every two or three times a day but the people only feed them once a day. Many people would be dying if they were real.<br/><br/>~'Those We Don't Speak Of' would be a darn rumor in the village because c'Mon, If I had creepy creatures staying outside my neighborhood I would definitely talk about it, right? I can't just keep quiet and go on with my life with the fact that blood-thirsty, jaw breaking, terribly frightening creatures being my neighbor.<br/><br/>~Creatures or animals aren't attracted to any color unless retarded or mentally ill.<br/><br/>~Finally, The Government would've done something about it already if someone was attacked or hurt by the creatures. But like Shyamalan said at the end, all planes were band from flying over the reserve. If it was just made up, then why the hell would someone want to protect something that isn't there?"
"JimD73","2","1","4","3 February 2005"," Don't Avoid the Village Because You Think It Might Scare You. Avoid Because it Sucks.
","The Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable was OK. Signs was OK. The Village, well, it looked bad. I'm sorry, but Shymalamadingdong was not making a great impression with this one. I did want to see it, if just to say I saw it. So is the Village worth anything at all? Plot: 5/25: Basically, we have a village (shocking, huh). It is apparently the 1800s or so. This village is residence to a very small number of people. There is a group of elders, who have meetings only they are privy to. Oh, and the forests around the village are off-limits because they are surrounded by monsters, called 'Those We Do Not Speak Of', which is an oxymoron in itself (apparently, Shyamalamadingdong was too lazy to name them). Anyway, the villagers and the creatures made a truce. The villagers stay out of the forest, the creatures stay out of the village. This means that the villagers are isolated from the outside world. So when a child dies due to illness, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks to go to the town across the forest to retrieve medicine for future purposes. He, of course, gets a no, but curiosity gets the best of him and he takes a few steps past the boundary before getting scared off by a noise. That night, the creatures visit and leave warnings. Stay out.<br/><br/>There is also a love plot that involves Lucius and the blind Ivy Walker (Howard), daughter of the leader of the elders Edward Walker (Hurt). Lucius has a love for Ivy, and they get engaged once he saves her from the creatures. But this gets Ivy's friend Noah Percy (Brody) jealous, and Noah is, well, retarded.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the Shyamalanic twist, but unlike that in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, this one is painfully obvious. There are actually two, one I knew right away and another that is just fill in the blanks work after all the holes you poke through it earlier. The twists are disappointing, to say the least. The actual plot is actually pretty dumb once you sit through it once. It is fairly original, I'll give it that, but nothing more.<br/><br/>Horror: 6/25: To say this movie provided no thrills isn't true. It provides a couple. Mostly cheap ones at that. Shyamalan is a master at the type of camera tricks that make something scary, and this is no exception. It just never seems really horrifying. It's not a scary concept, but some cheap camera tricks make it a little scarier than it should be. Without Shyamalan behind the camera, this wouldn't be scary, it'd just be dumb.<br/><br/>Acting: 8/25: The acting here is much like other movies when I say they took some good talent and ruined it with one of the worst scripts I have ever seen. Everyone talks like they're in the company of the Queen of England, so we get long, drawn out sentence and words that haven't been casually used since Shakespeare was shat out of his mother's womb. This pretty much ruins Phoenix and Weaver here. They are both good actors, but the script hurts them. Adrien Brody, despite an Oscar under his belt, is not right for this role. William Hurt gets his share of crappy lines, but he makes the best of it and isn't half bad. Bryce Dallas Howard, despite this being her first real role, is the only one here who is impressive in the least. If this is what she can do with a bad script Entertainment: 0/25: This is one of those movies that feels like it never ends despite being only a bit over 1 ½ hours. The whole dialogue problem really makes this much worse than it should have been. I really couldn't wait for this to be over.<br/><br/>Total: 19%: Shyamalamadingdong made a poopie. That's basically the best way to put it. The Village is boring, stupid movie that really is guaranteed to disappoint anyone who even remotely liked the other three. Enough said."

","Up until this movie, I had been impressed by Shymalan's work and thought each of his films was an improvement over the last. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable', and 'Signs' were intelligent movies, intriguing and original, the sort of intricate movies that demand to be watched a second time so that audiences can catch what they might have missed. <br/><br/>I was very disappointed with 'The Village'. It had potential, but the few good, suspenseful moments were never enough to save the film, only enough to make me wish there had been a few major rewrites. The cast should have been brilliant, yet those of us watching were laughing so much during the first half at the horribly silly dialogue (coyotes, indeed) that it was difficult to take the characters seriously when the story took a darker turn.<br/><br/>This was a movie full of itself, trying to pass for atmospheric and clever and chilling. Give it a miss and go back to 'Signs'; remember that Shymalan has given us good entertainment before, and have hope that he will do so again with his next film."

When I found out there were no ""Creatures"", which takes about half an hour into the movie, I was ready to leave the theater. When the blind girl travels through the woods alone and defeats the creature, please. Her companions must have made it back home and her father must have found out but never went in the woods to get her. Then to place himself in the movie...ENOUGH. The sixth sense, awesome movie!!

"plutokennedy","2","1","4","12 December 2004"," Awful
","This movie tells a boring and extremely far-fetched story. The plot does not really lend itself to the 'twist ending' approach that is a unfortunate trademark of the director. I like Shyamalan's style, but here it simply doesn't work. His earlier 'Signs' also suffered from a weak script, but at least the movie was well directed. Here, he is simply overconfident bordering on arrogant with his direction, complete with a vanity cameo. The figures simply don't hold enough interest, and the somber mood of the villagers simply does not make any sense in the context of the story as it is revealed in the end. The only standout is Bryce Dallas Howard, who may not yet be a great actress, but possesses a great screen presence full of dignity and grace. <br/><br/>I hope that Shyamalan will take his time and find a script that is more suitable to his style for his next feature. 'The Village' can only be considered to be complete failure."

","I was amazed there were actually any positive reviews for this film. It's disappointing in many ways, but the worst of it all was probably the script (apparently written by the director himself). Practically all of the characters except for the blind girl came off as so unrealistic that it was impossible to develop any feelings for them (and the murder scene was just laughable). The film had some good acting though, and the music was beautiful, but not spectacular. As for the ""political message"" of this film, it could have been expressed much more efficiently in ten words or so. But it's certainly not worth a film, and the film is certainly not worth your time."

"MovieManChuck","Null","1","5","24 May 2018"," M. Night Shyamalan's rock bottom
","1/4<br/><br/>When I saw Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable for the first time, I knew that M. Night Shyamalan's direction is what took the cake right off the bat. He makes very intelligent, character building, paced flicks that usually include a pretty revolutionary plot twist at the end. I thought that he wasn't responsible for any really bad movies... Then I saw The Village, and I was so far from entertained, enthralled, or astonished that I could barely understand it. In all of my time spent watching movies, this is one of the worst let downs, especially considering its Shyamalan's work.<br/><br/>This movie (and your enjoyment of it) is completely reliant on that which you (as the audience) don't know. The minute you know anything about this movie, it spoils. That being said, I was fortunate enough to go into this movie blind and without bias. My analysis of this movie will not contain any spoilers (if you insist on seeing it) but will cover the plot.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a village fully surrounded by a forest. The village features a lush landscape and is presented to us with a very fluid, slow cinematography (perhaps the best element of the film is Deakins' skillful use of the camera). This is a quaint little village, complete with its own customs and politics (thriving is no word to describe it). No one leaves the village for fear of ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"", the mysterious ""predators""of the forest. <br/><br/>As far as character science goes, the denizens of our village are classified by age groups. Your generic young adult is full of curiosity about the world that lies beyond the forest, and the elders are all the hardened, emotionless yet caring lawmakers. <br/><br/>First, you have Lucius Hunt, a reserved studious young man, and our lead male. This character is wooden in expression, manner, and life. Joaquin Phoenix brings no charisma to this character whatsoever, and thankfully for the second half of the movie he gets ""benched"".<br/><br/>Ivy is our lead female, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, and definitely the movies standout preformance. She is a half-burnt our light in a rusty old cellar, and as movie-goers, our only day of hope that the tide will turn for the better. She has a crush on the very dull Lucius.<br/><br/>Another misplaced character takes the form of a mentally ill adult. His character, played by Adrien Brody, comes off as very annoying and it's never quite clear what his purpose was. He kept a playful backdrop (albeit see-through) while Lucius and Ivy were trying to create the impression of a suspenseful drama. He really clashed the theme of the movie in my opinion. The directing directly corresponds to the acting here. Take charge, Shyamalan. You can do way better.<br/><br/>Ivy makes the pivotal, groundbreaking discovery about her village at the end of the movie. That's when it hits you. It was a very lame secret. Did I really have to sit here for 2 whole hours to get here? Shyamalan packages this as one of his famous plot twists, hoping you don't see just how unsatisfying of a conclusion it is and unravel the whole movie like dropping a yarn ball down stairs."
"poolandrews","6","1","5","28 November 2009"," Good film with a great twist.
","The Village is set during the 19th Century where a small village exists in total seclusion surrounded by woods that are filled with strange monsters that the elders say will not let anyone from the village enter the woods or leave the area.Some of the younger members of the village are not totally convinced & seek permission to leave the village & travel to towns beyond the woods but the elders are insistent that they do not leave. When a blind girl named Ivy Walker (Bryca Dallas Howard) & Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) announce their intentions to marry village simpleton Noah (Adrein Brody) who has a crush on Ivy stabs Lucius forcing Ivy to leave the village in search of medicines but will the vicious monsters within the woods let her pass & what vengeance will they take on the village & those who live there...<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan this was his fourth major film after the success he had with The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000) & Signs (2002) all of which I rather like for their horror mystery aspects & killer twist endings which has sort of become his trademark, The Village is probably the last really good film he has made & while it will undoubtedly divide audiences I did like it overall. The film is fairly slow going at times but it does build up really well with a certain sense of dread & anticipation on the part of the viewer, the twist ending is good & it's one of those ones where everything sort of falls into place nicely & everything that has gone before makes sense in context. The character's are alright if a little cold at times, the dialogue is sparse but meaningful & I felt like I was rewarded for sticking with it & following it properly. The lack of any sort of action might put some off & disappoint other's but I think if you give it a chance it's a satisfying experience. The film tries to be quite deep with the likes of fate & sticking with what you believe touched upon. However The Village is not perfect & the biggest problem I had with it was that while the ending depicts a community set-up to shun modern society & it's horrors for a more simpler & wholesome life surely creating the village's entire existence on horrible killer monsters lurking in the woods around it who may kill anyone at any point doesn't seem that great of an existence either as surely everyone would be living in constant fear?<br/><br/>The film looks great with impressive period detail & the cold naturalistic colour scheme suits the oppressive nature of the film, there's a lack of close-ups with plenty of shots where the camera is fixed & character's are quite far away with rams home the feel of isolation even more. There's some well crafted scenes like the fist attack on the village by the monsters & the scene where Lucius is stabbed as the scene starts out to innocuously but suddenly shifts into something much darker. There's very little horror here, there's no real gore or violence either. Originally called The Woods but there was another horror film called The Woods (2006) the same year so the title of this was changed to the Village.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $70 odd million this is very well made with big budget Hollywood production values, filmed mainly in Pennsylvania in a couple of large fields where an entire town was built & then taken down again after filming had finished. The acting is very good too from a decent cast none of whom really stand out but are believable including Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt & Brendan Gleeseon while Kirsten Dunst was replaced by Bryca Dallas Howard after she dropped out to make Elizabeth town (2005).<br/><br/>The Village is a film that may not appeal to everyone & it being advertised as a straight horror doesn't help but if you are prepared to stick with it & follow it through then it is pretty rewarding with a twist that I liked & thought worked well."

What a waste of screen and a biproduct of today's public education. For those of you who have not seen this movie I can sum it up for you here: 1700's village just on the edge of a woods. People are terrified of these creatures and the color red which supposedly attracts them. The village elders are the creatures who dress up in these ridiculous costumes they made to continue a hoax on the village for control of peoples minds and actions using fear. When Lucius (character in movie) is stabbed by a lunitic mental in the village named Noah, a blind girl goes to the town on the other side of the woods for help. Turns out these villagers have been living for years in a private wildlife preserve because someone in each of their families died and they can't handle the grief so they isolate themselves from society to live in the 1700's style and use these creatures to symbolize their fear of death and harm, thus controlling the fears and behavior of others. <br/><br/>This is the STUPIDEST most unimaginative piece of cinema I have ever seen.

Going back with a fresh mind, and watching this again, I was given even more hope for a decent film during the opening credits. This film boasts an all-star cast, but it also has Roger Deakins, one of the best cinematographers alive today.

He is so legendary that he puts a 3 minute film of himself in the extra segments on each DVD; films from his childhood showing how brilliant he was even then as an actor and director.<br/><br/>The fact is he is very over rated.

Apparently none of his actors - and there are some good ones (William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson) - bothered to point out the script's weak construction and incredible banality.<br/><br/>I don't mind Shyamalan taking an hour or so to set up his story. But did that hour have to be so tedious and not contain anything truly unnerving? He's a one-trick pony and proves it, yet again. Everyone knows his movies have a major twist at the end. That's all there is to his work and he lacks the courage to change. Then again, why should he if audiences keep admiring his work not realizing it's the same, stale formula over and over again?<br/><br/>He aims to prey on our fear of the unknown, to evoke eeriness much in the vein of Hitchcock or Henri-Georges Clouzot. Great idea. But Shyamalan's become so obvious, there's little point in our investing anything in his characters. Why should we? We know what's coming. Hitchcock and Clouzot toyed with our feelings and emotions; they gave us stories and monsters to believe in and we bought into their premises. Their films were genuinely creepy and suspenseful.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's found a formula that worked in ""The Sixth Sense"" - I wasn't a huge fan of the film, but it showed promise - and now simply retreads the same tired blueprint that essentially destroys any suspense in his stories.<br/><br/>Here, he telegraphs the twist so early, you'd be hard-pressed not to figure it out. Even if you don't, it's so terribly ho-hum you're astonished he's that shallow and unoriginal a writer. There's his customary cameo, a la Hitchcock, and Shyamalan even gives himself a line of dialogue to justify his story's horrendously hokey premise.<br/><br/>Young Bryce Dallas Howard brings an honesty to her performance that, frankly, is unwarranted and wasted in this movie. Don't spend much time thinking about Brody's character. He completely defies logic.<br/><br/>The true mystery here is what possessed Hurt, Weaver and Gleeson to star in this film. Hurt does his best somnambulist impression, while Weaver and Gleeson get to do nothing substantial. Extras could have played their roles without diminishing the film any.<br/><br/>""The Village"" contains nothing spine-chilling or suspenseful anywhere. There's one honestly surprising moment - not frightening, but dramatic and well executed. Another scene promised much, but Shyamalan doesn't have faith in his actors to let it to linger a few seconds longer. It's a shame because Howard's vulnerability hooked us. Shyamalan deflates the moment by cutting away too early, promptly pumping up the overwrought violin score and resorting to pretentious slow-motion photography.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's teetering on being tagged a hack. I don't doubt he's a talented chap. But if he wants to prove he's a good suspense filmmaker, not someone who simply recycles a hackneyed formula, he'll have to make a scary film that doesn't rely on humdrum storytelling techniques and cheap tricks that have long since worn out their novelty."

","Having seen almost all of M. Night Shyamalan's films but not seeing The Village, but hearing much praise (mainly from fans claiming how underrated and underappreciated the film is). The film offers several good ideas, but at times doesn't exactly live up to the expectations one had thought. Up until this point in his career, Shyamalan had directed the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. All of which one would consider to be better than The Village. Although the Village is most definitely better than both his next two films of the decade (Lady in the Water & The Happening). This isn't exactly a good sign as it showed he regressed.<br/><br/>The concept seems relatively interesting but given it's little twists it wasn't nearly as great or grande of a twists as expected. It was relatively simple when thinking about it. Also somewhat silly and confusing. For instance, within part of the plot. Why would they allow Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard)- being blind to be the one find medicine to heal Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix) in the woods herself? Also the supposed twist involving Noah (Adrien Brody)- playing a mentally challenged character disguising himself with the costume of the ""woods creature"" attacking Ivy in the woods was rather bizarre and questionable. What his intent of hurting her? If so why?<br/><br/>The Village is most definitely more of character drama than a horror film, which many seem to despise as it was marketed as a horror. There are some creepy jump scares elevated with its horror tone and tense music. But as a whole, this film was at most times somewhat boring and rather lifeless.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard was the highlight of the film as she was essentially the lead here, carrying the film for most of the second half. Which in a way is disappointing as Joaquin Phoenix's character is non-existent within the final forty-five minutes or so. Once his character gets stabbed by Adrien Brody, he is put aside and doesn't have any more speaking lines as we see him in about one or two more scenes ""healing"".<br/><br/>Overall, the film had good ideas but it wasn't exactly handled well. Nothing completely amazing and once the supposed ""twist"" is over, it wares off. Meaning this film possibly wouldn't be as good on a second and later viewings."

","Firstly, 'The Village' isn't a horror film and I'm not sure why it was marketed as such. There's no scares, no gore, nothing at all that resembles horror. Describing it as a thriller is a bit of a stretch too as the 'thrills' are virtually non-existent. This is a drama film and a boring one at that. It's painfully slow and uneventful with a dull bunch of characters and a rather forgettable storyline.<br/><br/>After sitting through such a drab 60 minutes or so, you at least expect an ending that packs a punch and makes the rest of the film feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, for me at least, the 'twist' ending was a big let-down. It was unexpected, but just because I didn't see it coming didn't make it any less of a disappointment. 'The Village' is just about watchable, but there's not much point when there are far more effective thrillers out there to watch instead."

","The Village is a drama masquerading as a horror/suspense movie. The premise is simple: A village in mid XVIII century is being terrorized by supernatural agents that surround the village...<br/><br/>(spoilers)<br/><br/>... except that, of course not. At this time, we all know the drill. The whole thing really is set in modern times, when a group of people used some incredible contrived means to isolate themselves completely from the outside world. Indeed, it sound really forced, and somewhat ridiculous.<br/><br/>But, I think reducing the whole thing at a bad twist is making a disservice to the movie. When I watched The Village, the movie felt less like a horror movie, and more like a love and human drama. The relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is really well crafted in the movie, and it feels real, and even beautiful. When tragedy struck in the middle of the movie, I was worried less about the whole monster schtick, and more about the plight of the characters. Those were the moments that really carried the movie.<br/><br/>But alas, here comes the flaw of the movie. Being this an M. Night Shyamalan movie in midst 2000s, the movie couldn't just be a drama: it needed a ""suspense"" and ""horror"" theme, which is the weakest angle of the movie, and completely ruined by the ""reveal"" I mentioned, which makes everything regarding that angle, completely pointless. It's the same flaw that ""Signs"" has: a contrived and unbelievable plot device that belittles and ruins all the suspense.<br/><br/>But, I think this movie is superior to Signs, because although The Village plays with the suspense angle, it's far less accentuated than in Signs. I think the same resolution could have been kept, but making the movie less about the ""mystery of the monsters"" and more about the personal drama. I think the movie works in the end, but this flaw severly damages it.<br/><br/>6/10"

THAT ROGER DEAKINS CINEMATOGRAPHY GOODNESS! WOW, WOW, WOW!
Shyamalan writes just the dandiest of characters. Blind Dallas Howard for the win.
Joaquin Phoenix is a god who can save any mess of a film. That is if, theoretically, this mess of a film has him present throughout the entire movie...
Directing of the camera is miraculous. Shows you Shyamalan isn't vacant in terms of his magical talents quite yet.
Costumes, props, etc. are spruce.
Neat twist!
Even neater second twist!<br/><br/>The Shyamabull:
Most of the dialogue and delivery from the actors/actresses are awkwardly ATROCIOUS.
A ton of character actions/decisions make zero sense. Many ""whys?"" were spoken that day in my TV room.
Transitions are seriously spontaneous.
The police officer's acting and just his character in general is a sin on its own.
Plot. Hole. Galore.
Last scene is an ""eh"" way to end the movie.<br/><br/>The Kajillion Shyamalanian Twists (Spoiler Warning):
Joaquin Phoenix is not actually dead... after getting stabbed...multiple times.... somehow....
Red = Blood. Symbolism. Boom.
The monsters aren't real and are just the Elders playing ""Trick or Treat""! Cute!
The magical rocks aren't actually magical rocks and are just used to trick gullible villagers who don't know the ""secret"". Thank golly.
Adrien Brody is actually the monster hunting down Ivy. Shyamalan tried to ploy us into thinking he was a real monster even though the film literally just revealed that the monsters (who all wear the same exact costume designs) aren't real, only in history books. Cheap move man. Cheap move.
The villagers were unconsciously Amish the whole time and the Elders were just some traumatized hippies who meet in therapy camp! Now that's a truly clever Shyamatwist!
Simple medicine is all you need to save a person's life-even for anyone who gets stabbed a billion times.<br/><br/>The Village is ethically one of the most difficult films I've ever had to rate. The film is frankly, ingenious within-some-of it's plot, but has too much brainless, unsystematic garbage in it for it to pound anywhere near Shyamalan at his height. So with that said, this is the fairest grade I could come up with for M. Night's, The Village: (Verdict: C+)"

The Village is a study in psychology, sociology, family, grief, love and the endless possibilities opened up when people put themselves toward a common goal. In all reality I would categorize this as a romance film. This film, which is underrated and over-criticized by the vast populous, is a brilliant piece of social commentary on many levels.

","This film tells of a small village where people live as they did a hundred years ago and totally isolated from the rest of the world, fearing nameless creatures that live in the surrounding forest. This idea seems something worthy of a horror movie and it could have been taken of that way, but no. Night Shyamalan decided to play with one thing: the idea that cities are the source of society's corruption. The whole movie revolves around this, which is to say that you have almost no story. It starts well, manages to create a good atmosphere and I quickly realized that there is something rotten in that village. But the absence of a strong main plot, capable of sustaining the film, causes it to lose its rhythm and crawl through uninteresting subplots, created to ""fill the sausage"" with anything that would justify it to the end. And even the ending was disappointing, as I expected something stronger and more dramatic, something that would make everything worth it.<br/><br/>Positive things? Yes! The actors did a good job, as far as they were allowed. Few stood out because there was little to do and little to work with. Adrien Brody managed to do it, although his character is poor and Bryce Dallas Howard was the actress who appeared and shone, but was not always the most positive. There are moments when her performance is quite forced. The scenarios were well made, the use of the forest was intelligent, cinematography was good as was the use of colors. But is anyone going to see a movie just for that? Of course not. Anyone who wants a good story will not like this movie."
"classicsoncall","7","0","1","13 April 2014"," ""There are secrets in every corner of this village.""
","Following the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", both of which I liked a lot, M. Night Shyamalan had a bit of a clunker with ""The Village"". The trailers for the film had you hungering for a supernatural movie excursion, but the resolution of the story blew the whole thing right out of the water. Given that the Amish people live in the same state as the location for 'The Village', it's impossible to my mind for some community to live as if they're the only one on the planet. Even the Amish have contact with the outside world, while maintaining their own beliefs and traditions. The idea that the community elders would willfully keep their members from learning or even knowing anything of the outside world seemed absolutely perverse to me. So all that talk of 'those we do not speak of', the 'bad' color and magic rocks, which might have been intriguing in another venue, were simply wasted here once the truth of The Village was revealed with the death of Noah (Adrien Brody) and Ivy's (Bryce Dallas Howard) contact with the modern world. There may have been secrets in every corner of this village, but a little intellectual curiosity by any one of it's residents would have made the story unnecessary."

Commendable tale about the virtue of preserving and cherishing innocence is well-made and acted, with a most thoughtful story, though it came perilously close to imploding when you consider the revelation at the end, which viewer may see coming a mile away.

You could argue that no one saw that coming, sure and you'd be right. The reason why people couldn't see that ending coming? Cause its out of place and stupid. I know he is a good director and a good writer but this has to be him laziest work ever. (I take that back because he has out done himself with Happening and Last Airbender) It doesn't help that there are no scary moments and the actors are dreadfully boring.<br/><br/>Not a single scary thing happened during this entire movie.

If the story is set in the present time why the hell did they go and make their village ye-olde times? Wouldn't a nuclear war that killed every part of the world except for their village be better? Or a virus swept across the world and they were immune? You could wear normal clothes and have normal tools just don't bring any cell phones or computers to the village. Anyone who isn't an elder doesn't know a damn thing, kids only know the world they live in by what they are told from parents.... if the kid doesn't find out on their own. You don't even mention phones to them and they will never know that technology existed. Or hell pretend your Omish at least, that way you can have the helpful tools for crops and farming but no technology for them to ever find out what happened. Going outside the village? Anything would of been better than dumb people in costumes! Tell them there isn't anything out there but barren wastelands and dangerous mutated animals. Poison gas, radiation or the scariest thing of all... people. Tell them there are groups of dangerous murdering psychos who all have their own villages or something. Anything would have been better than ""we live in ye-olde times"" cause there a tons of things that could ruin their cover up.<br/><br/>I'm not writer I'm just a movie go-er but I was not at all shocked or scared by this movie.

"PlugInYourBrain","5","0","2","22 September 2012"," Not as bad as I thought
","I had heard a lot of bad things about The Village, capped off by the fact someone blurted out the 'twist ending' to me shortly after it was released . I blame Shyamalan for that as much as the person who did the blurting: People talk, and too many (all!) of Shyamalan's movies depend on a 'twist at the end.'<br/><br/>So when I finally saw The Village I had very low expectations indeed. The good news is: I wasn't disappointed. It was better than expected.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's master plan seems to be to make each one of his movies half as good as the one before but even when he makes a bad movie (which is often these days), it's hard to notice because the cinematography, the acting, the scenery, the music are so good you don't notice. ('The Happening' however was 'A Bridge too Far'. :-)<br/><br/>As usual, two things bring Shyamalan down: Gaping holes in the plot, and his own cameo performances.<br/><br/>The plot holes are a major problem. I liked the idea that the main character was a blind girl. She was interesting and I thought she was well played, but why send a blind girl into the woods? I get lost in the woods and I'm fully sighted! Too often Shyamalan rushes off and shoots a movie without first filling in the plot holes. The last minute retro-fixes he adds by narration (by no less than his cameo) are unconvincing.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is a lousy actor, and the cameos destroy the suspension of disbelief the audience is trying so hard to maintain by overlooking his glaring plot holes. Besides ego, why does he keep ruining his movies by doing this? The film has good production qualities. William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard turn in good performances, but other actors are underused. Sigourney Weaver barely opens her mouth.<br/><br/>Moral dilemmas are poorly explored: There are many, many children in this movie. Surely one of them needed a pediatrician by now? Why does Joaquin Phoenix's character merit an exception when the sick children didn't? Shyamalan has a line of dialog that suggests he was the victim of a crime where as the children died because it was 'their time'. You're kidding me?<br/><br/>When will movie studios understand that mis-marketing a movie is a recipe for disaster? Fight Club was mis-marketed to the WWF crowd, and The Village was mis-marketed as a Horror Film. This attracted and then alienated the wrong audience. There is some suspense, but it's subdued: We never get a sense of fear for the creatures, and even when we meet the guard he's too damned nice too fast. Gosh I like nice people too, but it just wasn't convincing.<br/><br/>The Village is more like an episode of the Twilight Zone. I wasn't bored, so would give it six out of ten. But I'm deducting a point for the plot holes and the cameo. That's a bit harsh, but this is Shyamalan's fourth major movie so he really should know better by now."
"mica_wrensong","6","0","2","8 July 2012"," A truly chilling horror film -- but not how you think
","******* SPOILER ALERT ******* If you have not seen the film, do NOT read this review, as it WILL ruin the signature Shyamalan surprises for you, but I hope you will come back and read my review after you've seen the movie. Thanks!<br/><br/>It is no surprise that this movie, like all Shyamalan films, is well-crafted -- beautifully directed, cast, and filmed -- and thought-provoking. However, I give this movie a 6 because of the ending and its underlying message. Based on the lackadaisical, ""we'll-just-continue-as-we've-gone-before"" ending he gives it, Shyamalan does not seem to realize the true horror that he has created, namely, a fictitious utopian community with well-intentioned elders that have achieved their ends through deceit and terrorism. Yes, terrorism, folks. Does no one, even Shyamalan, see the chilling implications of the social engineering in this story? From what I can tell, no one else reviewing this movie here, nor anyone I know who has seen it, seem to get that point. <br/><br/>People compare the Village to the Amish, but aside from a seemingly idyllic, simple life, the similarities stop there. People living in Amish communities know full well what the real world around them is like. Certainly, they view the rest of the world through the tinted glasses of their own beliefs, upbringing, and experiences, but at least they know that they live in the modern era and have a pretty good idea of what's out there. In fact, the Amish encourage their young adults to go out into the real world for a short time, experience it, and decide where they want to be, although most end up returning to the fold. Does the Village do that, allow their young people to make their own decisions about which world they want to live in? No. They don't tell them much about that other world at all.<br/><br/>Donning monstrous costumes to scare the living daylights out of your own families and weaving intricate lies meant to keep them where you want them is terrorism, plain and simple, and this is a small-scale totalitarian situation. People living in the Village are not allowed to leave if they want to, and to be independent and brave enough to attempt it, like Lucius Hunt, is to court trouble. Granted, Lucius is not beaten. He is not thrown into prison. The elders listen to him. They even sympathize with him. But nevertheless, they use underhanded tactics and threats to keep him and the rest of the village in ignorance and fear. Forget that they live in an idyllic world, based on the simple life -- this is a prison, and they don't even know it. Is that idyllic, simple life, really worth so much? There are countries on this planet that use the same tactics on their own citizens, and other, reasonable, liberty-loving people seem to have no problem despising those governments. The Village is no different -- just on a smaller scale -- and yet people just don't seem to get it, including Shyamalan himself.<br/><br/>So, rather than rewarding Lucius and Ivy for their courage and independence, Shyamalan draws them right back into the lies, along with everyone else. Ivy now thinks that the beasts really do exist because she encountered and killed one. The elders agree with each other that they will uphold the lie and continue with what they have built -- continue keeping their people in the dark. In the end, nothing has changed at all, except that maybe they won't have to wear those scary costumes as much as before. M. Night Shyamalan's message here seems to be that the ends justify the means, that the collective is more important than the individual, and that deception, terrorism, and ignorance are acceptable means of keeping individuals in line, making this a chilling horror story indeed."

It does look great with beautiful scenery and brooding cinematography and the score is very haunting, eerie quality about it. There are also some genuine jolts and poignancy in the first half, and The Village with a great concept does start off intriguingly.<br/><br/>The best thing about it though is the cast. William Hurt is nuanced and intelligent and Joaquin Pheonix is wonderfully stoic, but the biggest surprise was Bryce Dallas Howard, who was fantastic and quite moving here. There were however a few disappointments, and I say this as I consider these actors the most accomplished generally of the cast. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are great actors but underused and Adrien Brody comes across as wasted in a rather nothing role.<br/><br/>What let The Village down and from stopping it from being more than it had potential to be was that while M Night Shyamalan can have films where he is a master-storyteller(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) or where he is sloppy(2nd half of Signs, The Happening), he comes across as rather over-ambitious here. The story is so interesting at first, but the second half is let down by too many ideas, and some of them are wonderful ideas but underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Consequently the pace becomes more drawn out, the dialogue becomes clunky and apart from Howard I found myself indifferent to the characters by the end. And to top it all, the ending is ridiculous. All in all, not that bad but has a lot wrong with it in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","Instead of dragging it out with paragraphs, I'll just list off PLENTY of the things that made this film a complete turd.<br/><br/>-So a guy manages to (somehow) get a forest preserve, and (somehow) prevents planes from flying over it. Because it would be out of place in making the kids believe that they live in an 1800s time period. Really, Night??? <br/><br/>-I have the most brilliant idea!!!! Let's send the blind girl to get the medicine! She's SO gonna know where she's going!!! <br/><br/>-Somehow the blind girl manages to take down the ""thing they don't mention"" or whatever they call it. And she's so sharp she knows where it is!!!! She even heads towards it in a straight line in some bits of the showdown!!! <br/><br/>-Let's also mention that she's SOOOOO blind, she runs at breakneck speed in the forest and manages to avoid falling into a LARGE HOLE and bumping into all the trees around her!!! And then of course, she manages to get out of the village which is protected by a huge fence!!! <br/><br/>-So the little society of theirs is supposed to be free of violence and/or crime. Yet they set up this little scheme to scare the kids, and set up this retarded ""Red is the forbidden colour"" rule??? Excuse me for a moment, I may be a little while on this one.<br/><br/>-On the topic of the ""red"" rule, major plot hole. For one, let's mention that the film is set in the Autumn. The leaves are red clearly, that's a problem. What about red berries on the trees? Or the CLEARLY RED CURTAINS in one of the scenes. EPIC FAIL!!!! <br/><br/>-Basically, if these adults were as smart as they thought they were, they'd have realized their whole ""society"" didn't work, with all the death and killing around them (and not to mention the slaughter of the animals to make the monster suits) <br/><br/>-The whole ""scaring the kids with pig suits"" thing doesn't work either. For one, Noah is the mentally insane dude, and at the end when the twist was revealed (major cop-out too), he was one of them. And they'd be dumb enough to hide a suit under the floorboards in the village loonie bin????? <br/><br/>-Also, with nothing in the loonie bin, how on earth did Noah break the floorboards to get the suit and then escape??? <br/><br/>I'd list more, but it'd be too long for the page."

","Obviously, there was a lot of hype surrounding this film. The trailer made it out to be some kind of terrifying film, more like the Sixth Sense than anything else. Many people expecting a horror were disappointed, and for good reason. The film is not a horror film. It's more like a period drama with elements of horror.<br/><br/>I had already heard about how horror fans were disappointed with it, and how the twist let some people down. I tried to watch it with an eye for what it's really about, but, in some ways, the fact that it never really had any climax of sorts to do with the horror aspect of it, or the relationship aspect of it, kind of let me down. That was the film's one problem: It didn't really make it's mind up about whether it wanted to turn scary or stick with it's original story.<br/><br/>Other than that, there are many redeeming qualities to it. The story is, on the whole, well written, and the acting is brilliant, just look at the cast list and see why. The cinematography is superb, plus the lighting, which will make you fear the colour red throughout the whole film. But I won't say any more about that. Plus, James Newton Howard's score was incredible, perhaps one of his best.<br/><br/>So, on the whole, it was a good film, but towards the end, it seems to go down the wrong path, and is a little disappointing. But still, 7 stars for a well captured and slightly spooky atmosphere, despite everything that I have said."

"Alfredo_Griselda","8","0","1","10 September 2009"," Those of Whom We Do Not Speak
","The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film and it's a hard one to review without giving too much away. Shyamalan has made a niche for himself delivering movies (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense) that pack a surprise punch at the end, and The Village is no different. The film takes place in a village set in a valley ringed with a forest. The time is indeterminate, although the clothes are old fashioned, as are the houses and furniture. There is a shot of a tombstone in the cemetery early on in the film that shows a date of 1897, and the village certainly wouldn't be out of place in the 19th century. The form of speech of the village citizens is also somewhat archaic. As the story unfolds we learn that the village exists in a state of uneasy truce with the creatures living in the forest around them. The creatures, whom the villagers refer to as Those of Whom We Do Not Speak, apparently are attracted by the color red, as the villagers shun that color, even going so far to uproot and bury wildflowers of that color. The villagers maintain a ring of poles with yellow flags by day, and torches by night to keep the creatures out of the village. They also maintain a watch tower, where a sentry watches through the night. About all the sentry can do, though, is ring a bell to alert the villagers to hide in their cellars when the creatures decide to enter the town. The village elders, who are the town's governing body, are also concerned about the repeated occurrence of skinned animal carcasses showing up in the valley. That's the background and the starting point of the movie, which is basically about the love between the quiet, soft-spoken Luscious Hunt, well played by Joaquin Phoenix and the independent, but blind, Ivy Walker, wonderfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Both Phoenix and Howard are marvellous in their roles, and are surrounded by a great cast including William Hurt as Ivy's father Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Luscious's mother Alice Hunt and especially Adrien Brody as the mildly retarded Noah Percy. One of the real treats of this movie is watching how these strong characters interact with each other. Shyamalan did an outstanding job directing the cast, and a phenomenal job of filming. Every shot is well thought out, and only shows you what he wants you to see. Especially powerful are the shots of the creatures, for the most part mere suggestions of figures in red, Shyamalan lets your imagination fill in the rest. The brooding autumnal forest around the valley makes for especially powerful images. The green and austere village fits in perfectly with it's surroundings. Shyamalan's use of strange angles really help to create the mood and bring out the best in his storytelling. Above all Shyamalan is a craftsmen, and The Village is a well-crafted film. Some may guess the secret before the end, but no one can doubt that this is a powerful story of love, well acted, and well filmed."
"Craig87-1","9","0","1","10 September 2009"," A mystical journey
","Last night I was watching the M. Night Shyamalan film ""The Village"" (2004) and found it to be a mystical parable. St John of the Cross, in his poems and commentaries ""The Dark Night"" and ""The Ascent of Mt Carmel"" and even in the ""Living Flame of Love"" speaks of darkness and blindness as states in which one proves the love for the Beloved. In the film, the blind young girl is the only one able to save her beloved, wounded for love of her. The Spiritual Canticle emphasizes the ""wound of love."" ""Why, since you wounded this heart, don't you heal it?"" The soul must not fear the ""wild beasts"" while going through the ""woods and thickets"" to find healing for the Beloved, just like the girl trying to avoid the ""monsters"" in the woods. In the film, the lovers pledged themselves ""in the serene night,"" ""the tranquil night."" In ""The Village"" the maidens must ""stay away"" from the ""outskirts."" The emphasis on solitude in the poems of St John, especially in ""The Dark Night"" where it says ""in a place where no one else appeared"" was similar to the scene in the film where the young maiden realizes she must make the journey alone. Only pure love and self-sacrifice in the blindness of faith can save the one she loves. On another level, I find ""The Village"" interesting for the portrayal of flight from the world. It has long been a Christian practice to withdraw into the desert to find God and peace. However, as the Desert Fathers discovered, we can never escape the our own human nature and the wounds of original sin. In the pristine refuge of Covington Wood, people fall in love with the wrong people, there is jealousy, and even hatred. The elders must keep the youngsters in line through the terrifying story of monsters in the woods, so that even in the safety of the wilderness the children are afraid. While we are in the flesh, there is no escape and the only true refuge is the Lord."

It's all about suspense, and story-telling, and the story he tells here is a love story.<br/><br/>I am always mesmerized by that powerful speech that William Hurt (who plays Ivy Walker's father) delivers about love, near the middle of the film. To me, that signifies the theme of the movie. It's the motivation for the characters' actions.<br/><br/>And brilliant music!! James Newton Howard deserved more attention for that mystical, gorgeous score. Hilary Hahn is amazing; her haunting violin solos make the soundtrack a must as well as the DVD.

"trevski2001","9","0","2","5 January 2008"," Well crafted period psychological drama
","Like most people I thought 'Sixth Sense' was brilliant and went along to see 'Signs' partly on the strength of it. Was I disappointed - apart from the well documented plot shortcomings the film seemed to be shot as a 50's budget flick with none of the period charm. I left the cinema thinking 'what was the point of that?' Similarly I saw 'Unbreakable' on TV and found it to be very ordinary.<br/><br/>'The Village' had it's premiere on BBC2 this evening. The synopsis in the Radio Times interested me but I was half expecting to be disappointed. I was actually pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>A group of people disaffected with city life set up an Amish-like village in a remote spot. To prevent the younger villagers straying, they invent a legend of monsters in the surrounding woods. Legend has it that, years ago, a truce was agreed whereby the villagers didn't stray into the woods or the monsters into the village. When one of their number is seriously injured, it is decided to break the truce and venture through the woods to the nearest town in order to get medical supplies.<br/><br/>So, there aren't actually any monsters, but the film is shot from the perspective of villagers who think that they do exist, thus creating several very atmospheric and scary scenes.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised the integrity of the plot but I think it holds together and could just about be believable. You could read between the lines and draw parallels with our leaders warnings about the 'axis of evil'.<br/><br/>For me, this film is everything that 'Signs' wasn't - everything comes together to form a very memorable experience - cinematography, script, lighting, soundtrack, sets, acting and direction are all first class. I'm glad to say that I've been able to revise my personal opinion that MNS was a one-hit wonder."

"film_riot","9","0","1","2 January 2008"," The Village
","This is M. Night Shyamalan at the height of his game. ""The Village"" works on both important levels. Firstly, as a genre movie it is frightening. Shyamalan once again determines his reputation of being a master of suspense. But this time, unlike for example in ""Signs"", the film also works as a character drama. A very well told story hides behind all the scares. And a study about superstition, (religious) fundamentalism and courage. This was one of the worst reviewed movies in Shyamalan's career. I can't see any other reason for this than wrong expectations. I get the impression that many people disliked the movie, because they ""knew"" early that the monsters weren't real. But that's exactly my point, the film doesn't rely on the twist, because it's digging much deeper. Overall, I love the acting in this movie. But the standout in ""The Village"" has to be Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Walker. I also love the music by John Newton Howard."

"Panterken","9","0","3","12 December 2007"," One of Shyamalan's great 3
","I've seen The Village three times already and I'll probably see it many times more in the future. What makes this film so strong is the incredible music, photography and the acting. As mentioned by many people before me, the young Bryce Dallas Howard is sensational. Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt are good as always while the rest of the cast is appropriately bleach. The stars are given the room to shine and shine they do.<br/><br/>As for the score, I think it's one of the finest ones ever to not win the Academy Award. Intense where it has to and subtle where it has to, James Newton-Howard does a tremendous job. Some of the strongest scenes however are silent ones. It's M.Night's credit that he doesn't feel forced to fill every second of the movie with music and effects. This is a mistake that is made in a great deal of movies, The Hours to name just one example.<br/><br/>There's more than a score required to create an atmosphere. The cinematography and photography has to be top notch as well and in The Village, it is. The locations are beautiful and even though one can argue that woods already have a certain atmosphere, that it's not the Directors credit's...I believe they really made the most of the available locations. It's a fine art to do so.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the plot a little bit. It's a fairly simple premise but the story takes many twists and turns further on the road and in the end it satisfies. Semi-open endings are often the most powerful and intelligent ones, and I think this one is a prime example. If they would have tied all the lose ends then this movie wouldn't have been half as memorable. M.Night gets his audience thinking and leaves him feeling confused, excited, happy and sad at the same time. What more can you ask of an ending? Many people feel the Twist (even though there are actually 3 twists, there's only one with a capital T) came too early. While I can understand this impulse to think so, I feel the revelation early in the movie made the rest of the movie more interesting. The suspension wasn't gone, but merely replaced with a different kind of suspension. If the revelation would've been made in the end, like it could've been, it would have been too similar to The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and as it is now...it's something special. Too bad not many people realize just how good this movie is. I hope it'll later be remembered as a misunderstood work of fine art, instead of a failed horror movie. It isn't a horror movie, it never tries to be, and the trailer is misleading. It's a well-made trailer, it got many people drawn to the theater, so from a business perspective it serves it's purpose. From an artistic point of view, the trailer is shamefully bad. Please don't go see the movie expecting it to be just another suspense horror movie. It's so much more.<br/><br/>Everyone should see it at least once. You may hate it, but you should give it 1 try because you just might find yourself moved by this fine film. And that's about the highest thing that 'just a movie' can achieve."

","When this movie came out I went in cinema to watch it, and I didn't find it very interesting at first view. Then I watched it again on TV and it really intrigued me. Shyamalan is great director and people cannot expect of him to make movie like ""The Sixth Sense"" every time. ""The Village"" isn't definitely his best movie but this also isn't his worst movie. ""The Village"" has its positive attributes, like great entering and solid story but maybe poor finishing. Slow rhythm of the movie is great cause we really need to be drawn into the story on this way. I also want to say that this is no horror, it is more drama of people who live in one community on traditional way. Study of characters is great just like actors are (especially Bryce Dallas Howard). Shyamalan wanted to show the thoughts of the whole community we're talking about. They gave up from real world so they can create their perfect world. Even when someone gets hurt, he's only making a sacrifice for future of the society. The question that director puts in front of us is this: Would Lucius stay alive if Ivy wasn't blind or would elders let Ivy out for medicine if she wasn't blind? And that is the point of this movie.I recommend to watch this Shyamalan movie and then judge it. In my case after second view a whole new perspective was opened to me. To all second viewers: look deeper."

","I heard how horrible this movie was over and over again and finally decided to rent it for myself.Well first off let me say I found the twist and turns to be not scary but shocking I liked the idea that it points out how corrupt and evil the world has become. I also thought it was great that it had a great cast and the director M. Night Shyamalan is a talented and creative man. However, the ending caught me off guard she shows up with the medicine and then it cuts off. We don't know if he lives or if he dies that kind of ticked me off.I thought it should have at least showed him living.Come on after the crap this girl went through that is the least they could have done. But other than that I would have to say over all great movie."

","I first thought the village would be a frightening horror movie but after i saw it i thought it was a total crap fest, although some scenes did give me shivers like towards the end where Noah dresses up in the monster costume and chases ivy. After about 2 years i saw on TV again and for some reason i liked more then the first time i viewed it. I thought the plot was good and the ending was good. For some reason i had a change of heart. I guess when i first viewed it with my friends who were watching with me gave me the impression it was a bad movie. I enjoyed the suspense where ivy was in the woods trying to avoid the ""creatures"". I liked the drama with all the elders and there past ordeals. I do agree that some of it was boring but I really enjoyed the movie after viewing it a few more times.<br/><br/>Give it a chance people."

","I just saw this movie, even though 3 years late. I enjoyed the movie but not the ending. I'm not a fan of today's horror movies, but I found this one to be well made - in the style of the old Dracula and Frankenstein movies. The suspense, acting, and scenery were all superb throughout the movie. The last 15-20 minutes of the movie plot was not as well done as in the first part of the movie. If another 30 minutes had been added to the movie to develop the plot finale as well the buildup to the ending was developed, I would have considered this movie to be in the same outstanding category as the movies of old. I will watch this movie again."

","THE VILLAGE 2004 (BRYCE HOWARD, JOAQUIN PHOENIX, WILLIAM HURT) DIRECTED BY: M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN ~ THE RUNDOWN: Shyamalan stays true to form in 2004, giving audiences around the world another stunning piece of style and originality. ~ First off, let me offer an oxymoron when looking at my rating and make clear the film is far from perfect. It's true, one could find several plot holes if looked for hard enough, but, then again, it IS just a movie. Also, the pacing is definitely off as the movie winds down too slowly. And, lastly, if you're a smartass just looking for a reason to blast this film to pieces from the start, you will find much of the dialogue laughable and may be monstrously harsh on a plot that isn't always sound. ~ But, my God, there's so much style to be found here. The detail and innovation of Shyamalan's craft is reminiscent of Kubrick's. M. Night creates a world within a world, a unique and completely captivating tale that has the ability to swamp those with imaginations as lively as his. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is pure art, and the Oscar nominated sound-score by James Newton Howard is eerily alluring, crawling deep inside of you and lingering far after the film is done. With only four major films in under five years under his belt, all of them widely successful, M. Night Shyamalan was able to achieve something the immensely overrated and under-talented Spielberg never did: an identifiable mark on each and every one of his movies, something I truly respect about the man. (Shyamalan that is) He goes against the grain and you can tell that he's more concerned about making movies with passion instead of Oscars in mind like Spielberg did with MUNICH~ Of course, THE VILLAGE is not just a case of style over substance. There's great entertainment to be found here, entertainment that may not be all that entertaining to today's more youthful audiences whose minds are constantly yearning for sex, excessive violence and Hollywood clichés, but rather a touching love story and some suspense that may just catch you off guard. I'll admit, the big twist at the end is something some people just won't go for, but for some, like myself and many others I know, it will cash in big time and may leave you breathless if you keep yourself vulnerable to it. And (forgive me if I'm being long-winded) but this movie has brains and deserves several viewings for those who will want to find out what Shyamalan's trying to say about human nature."

","I thought the movie was good.But it had the chance to be great. During the movie i was thinking wow it is thrilling and beautiful at the same time. I have never seen a movie do that before. But of coarse he had to make the end grab everyones attention. It would have been so much better if the monsters stayed real, and it was NOT set in modern times. For me the end ruined the movie because you couldn't watch it again the same way. Overall he had a great idea that went wrong all because he wanted people to talk about the ending. I hope in his upcoming movies he doesn't try this again. I have not yet seen Lady in the water but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. And no matter what people say about him he is a good director that has a chance to be great."
"Gloryous","8","0","1","14 August 2006"," The Village lacked momentum- this movie gives new meaning to the blind leading the blind!!
","When I saw the teasers on TV for this movie, it looked like it might be good, even the review of it made it sound like I might like it. I hoped it would be suspenseful and a bit scary.<br/><br/>It started out slow, and seemed to continue to be slow to get to the point, I felt at some point I was caught in an Amish town, and the story continued to focus on just everyday things. The town was afraid of something in the woods. The people were scared out of their wits. Sure they were scared of something. I thought I saw Sigmond and the one of the Seamonsters in the forest wearing a Little Red Riding Hood cape. Or maybe something from H.R. Puffnstuff. This movie dragged so badly, and the actors while many are well known, even they could not make this story go any faster. I felt the story was over done, and the plot was so vague, the main character is wounded too soon in the movie, then it became ludicrous that the people sent a sightless person to go get help. I am sure the person who wrote it believed it was a very interesting plot, but for me being able to run it ahead made my day, because if I had had to sit through the entire movie at the show, I would have had to be tied to the chair to keep from getting up and leaving half way through. Make sure when you see this movie that there is a clear pathway to the nearest exit!!<br/><br/>I had been superficial in my opinion above, then I slept on the ideas in the movie and the truth of the movie came through to me. There really is a deeper meaning to the story and I did not find it till after I turned it off and thought about it. It is all about people keeping others under control with Fear. The Bible says Fear hath Torment. It is sad to say there are so many people in families and in countries, and businesses that control everyone with Fear. How terrible that these people feel it is the right thing to do. This is what I realized this movie was really about. Maybe the way it was presented was draggy and the movie did not move along as fast as it should have, but the writer of it was trying to set the scene and make people think. I have to admit I laughed at how it was presented, I was wrong, it was a good story, about real things that people do to each other. I just hope others will let the story really sink in, because if it will wake someone one to stop trying to control someone, it will be all worth it. It has a Message. I finally Heard it. I am so glad I did."
"Noodle1031","Null","0","1","26 July 2006"," This is a review/rant. Just hear me out.
","First I want to say: This movie is one of my favorites. M. Night Shyamalan is a magnificent storyteller, who delivers original movies to a world of movies full of unoriginal clichés (with exceptions of course). Most people, critics and viewers alike, have trashed this film, torn it apart, chewed it up and spat it back out. I don't see why. *Spoilers begin here* There are two reasons people have said this movie ""sucked"": 1) ""It wasn't a horror movie, like it said it was, and that it was a 'sappy love story'"". My Response: When did it say it was a horror movie? It never did! We're on IMDb. Go on. Look it up. I did. It says that this movie is classified as "" Drama / Mystery / Thriller"". And another thing, it wasn't a ""love story"". Yes, there is an UNDERLYING love story, but that is not the main story, and not much emphasis is put on it. 2) ""The monsters aren't real."" My Response: Why do they have to be? The movie takes place in the real world, and here in the real world, WE DON'T HAVE MONSTERS! Why do man-eating, evil creatures have to make a good movie? <br/><br/>Overall, this movie offers mystery, thriller, a little love, and a great story. If you haven't seen it yet, go see it. It's worth it, no matter what everyone says. People today have been sucked into movies that consist of unreal stories with no depth or real meaning behind them. Movies that you watch enjoy, and then forget about (not that they are all bad, don't get me wrong). Movies like this make you think; Are we living in a fake community? Are there truths that we don't know about? Lies we believe are true? If it doesn't make you think, then at least you'll go away with a feeling of having seen a great movie."
"physman","8","0","1","17 July 2006"," Another fine suspense movie from Shyamalan
","The powerful human element in The Village makes this so much more than a good Twilight Zone episode. Shyamalan and his terrific cast make you care about the residents of the village -- not just their fear of the menace surrounding them, but also the tragedies, heartache, and joys they experience in their everyday lives. Especially compelling are the younger generation of villagers, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody. (The village ""elders"", led by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, are a little less developed.) Add these powerful characters to the expected Shyamalan elements -- intriguing plot twists (plural), gripping cinematography, and a haunting musical score -- and you have another hit by the best maker of suspense films working today."
"guinnberger-1","9","0","1","11 July 2006"," *May Contain Spoilers*
","Very enjoyable film, which surprised me because I had heard a fair bit of negative comment about it, and already knew the ""punch-line"" prior to viewing. The whole thing sounded silly and pointless, before I'd actually seen the story.<br/><br/>But it isn't just a ""Shock Theater"" episode, and it isn't about the ending. It's a very thoughtful study of human nature. The language is stiffly formal for most of the film, but that's a deliberate thing, part of what the community of the Village was founded to accomplish.<br/><br/>Every performance in the film is beautiful and compelling, especially Bryce Dallas Howard's much-talked about luminous portrayal of the blind - but very perceptive - Ivy. Adrien Brody as Noah is equally amazing, and aside from those two, it's hard to say anything but ""WOW"" about the cast. There was nothing but good acting throughout, and every contributor to the ensemble grabbed my attention whenever he or she had a line or a bit of ""business."" It truly can be described as an all-star cast.<br/><br/>What struck me most about the film, though, was how it portrayed the mechanics of fear, and how that emotion is used to control people, in the ""Towns"" - the outside world the villagers shun with such dread - and in the Village itself. There are indeed monsters, and the people of the Village try heroically to escape them, but there is no escape. There's a quote from the comic strip ""Pogo"": ""We has seen the enemy, and they is us."" (I think that's how it goes.) Human beings can never escape the monsters that threaten and terrify us, because we carry them with us wherever we go: they are us. That's the message I got, and it was delivered in an evocative, subtle way that made the film quite a treat for me."

But there's something that they know that the villagers don't know.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes are very slow. It took awhile for some real suspense to happen. Up to an OK start, but it really stank at the end.<br/><br/>If you seen it you'll be confused and questioned at the same time.<br/><br/>In my opion i could of had done a better job with the story.

"dollybloodsmiles","9","0","1","1 July 2006"," Surprisingly perfect in its own right
","This film was visually beautiful. It's emotion was deep and provoking. The score by Ottman was fitting. The storyline was full of subtle twists, and also direct. I liked Night's technique in this film, and i'm glad i watched this film. I can see why people would dislike this film. Example one: You go into the video store or movie theater expecting a ""horror"" movie, full of monsters and/or gore violence etc. In this film, you will not be getting that. This is storytelling, with a dark atmosphere. I've encouraged others to see this film, reminding them to go into it expecting not a ""thriller"", ""horror"", ""fantasy"", or any other label you want to tack onto it. In general people could do themselves a great favor by looking at films, art, and music, with a clear mind, and taking it in slowly. This is an updated modern fairytale, and fairy tales have no boundaries. Sometimes, you need to shut off the logical side of your brain. Give it a chance."
"josejrp","9","0","1","23 June 2006"," Pretty Good, M. Night!
","Let me start off by saying I liked this movie. To me, The Village was all about atmosphere, and it had plenty of it. The cinematography was more lush than in all the other M. Night's film's combined, and the color contrasts made for a rich viewing experience. Those contrasts along with the interesting shot compositions and long takes with tracking shots made for an fascinating movie from a purely visual perspective. The soundtrack was also another home run, wonderfully evocative. I would see the movie again just to enjoy some of the shots...<br/><br/>The weak link is, of course, the story. Most of what happens is a bit implausible, but I bought it based on the strenghts of M.Night's techniques. I must admit that although I guessed the first twist (the one that dealt with the outside world), I did not guess the twist with the final creature... for a while there, I thought M. was going to have a real creature in the film. Based on that alone, the film worked for me.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the acting by most of the named stars did not impress me too much, but Bryce Dallas Howard had an outstanding performance. Unfortunately, I thought Adrian Brody went way over the top with his performance. I can see why he was pushed to act so goofy (so that the audience would not realize how dangerous he was), but it struck a wrong note for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I would rank this movie as either on par with The Sixth Sense, or even superior to it. I did not feel cheated like I did on the first viewing of The Sixth Sense, and thought the movie was just awesome to look and listen to."

I actually watched it twice within two days, once on my own and once with my wife to get her reaction. Lots of twists, somewhat predictable ending, because clues were given throughout the film. Howard's portrayal of a blind person was a bit thin, I had trouble resolving some of the physical acts she performed. That may have had more to do with the demands of the script, than her acting ability. The photography was extremely well done, the film's strongest asset for me, and I wouldn't mind owning the sound track."

I don't think the rating should be a 12. Although, it was a very very clever plot and very good acting, especially from Ivy Walker (don't know the actors name) I thought the plot was brilliant, not normally something you'd see in a scary movie, though the film was not all it promised.

Joaquin Phoenix made the film come alive, he is a sensational actor and was fantastic in this movie. The interaction between the characters and the innocent way in which they all spoke to each other was very endearing. Some parts of this film were scary even though it isn't meant to be a horror film, so watch out for jumpy bits. Overall I'd say this film is a voyage of discovery and an unconventional love story thrown in! The reason that I enjoyed this movie so much was because as the film got further and further in Joaquin got more and more good looking,haha so it's definitely a film for the ladies.

I usually find that I agree with such behemoths of film critics as Eburt and Robert, but they made a big mistake downgrading this movie. This is a great film, but a film that has more in common with ""Donnie Darko"" than ""The 6th sense"". This film is a great allegory; my hat goes of for Mr.Shamyalan for having shot this film, which is so much bigger and more beautiful, than the 6th sense. If I may compare movies to food, 6th sense is like McDonalds fajitas, fast food easy to consume, yet spicy, new and satisfying. The Village I would compare to a glass of good wine.

I watched this film out of the goodness of my heart and my love for the director. I ignored reviews and synopsis, my ticket was bought based on M Knight's past accomplishments with films like Signs and The sixth sense. Needless to say, I love the way his films make me think and not to mention that ever present scare factor. <br/><br/>But enough about my praises for MKS. The Village, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody among others is two stories in one. The story of life one some know it and life as they have made it known to others. That's the basis of the movie, everything else is an explanation of why certain things happened the way they did etc. etc. When you see the film or if you have already seen it, my afore statements will make a lot of sense to you. Anyhow, the story takes place in the dark ages and we come to know the characters are terrified by creatures that live in a nearby forest that come in to town to terrorise and kill once their territory has been breached. Within all this chaos, two major love stories manage to exist; one between Phoenix's character and a blind childhood friend whose sister he had to rebuff, and the other (however unrequited) between Sigourney Weaver's character and the blind girl's father. Something horrific happens that forces Phoenix's lady love to venture into uncharted and unwelcome territory and the result of her journey reveals the shocking plot twist that will knock your socks off!"

","What can I say about M. Night Shyamalam. The twist happy director who has brought us many interesting features such as 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. All with unexpected endings, these films make us look at the director and think ""What will he do next?"" So when I heard about another Shyamalan film that involves mythical creatures I was thrilled. Until I saw it. What started out as a good thriller/drama was just ruined by its unexpected but disappointing ending. All viewers who are sick of spoilers, please look away. The fact that the creatures aren't even real just angered me mainly due to the fact that I have wasted over an hour just to see what was hidden under those red cloaks. However the film was interesting with good performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard as well as a change from the director's original thriller template. So in conclusion: watch it if you're a fan of Shyamalan's work but don't expect too much."

","The Village was a strange experience for me. I came out of it having genuinely enjoyed the film, but a little part of me wanted to slap M. Night Shyamalan for changing gears so often in the movie. The nightmare with reviewing this movie is that if I reveal why it's a bittersweet victory of a film, I'll ruin the last act and negate anybody's reason for watching the film.<br/><br/>So instead, I'll concentrate on why it's good. Most of it's charm comes from the sheer visual richness of the movie, and the rest comes from the central performances of William Hurt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquim Phoenix. All of them hand in warm, emotive turns that elevate the movie.<br/><br/>The story is quite moving too. It's part human drama, part Twilight Zone episode, and it works very well. I thought it was much more moving than it was scary, in fact, certain things occur in the movie that present a large obstacle to it continuing to be as creepy as it starts out, and it's this moving nature that made me enjoy it. It has some lovely, wonderful scenes, especially a quiet, restrained and beautiful scene between Phoenix and Howard.<br/><br/>Still, while I recommend The Village, it has it's flaws. There's a slight awkwardness to the script that makes it seem that it's trying too hard, and some of the last act twists are both frustrating and make it really hard to emphasize with some characters in hindsight. Despite this, it's an emotional and heart-warming couple of hours, twists or no twists, thanks largely to Howard and Hurt's barnstorming central performances."
"wnterstar","8","0","2","6 April 2006"," Sublimely Creepy
","This is a hard movie to review, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.<br/><br/>It is a subtle, slow-paced movie, with standout cinematography, and a fairly decent twist at the end. The cast is amazing, bu the standout for me was Bryce Dallas Howard, who proves that talent does run in families (her father is Ron Howard). The rest of the cast brings with them formidable resumes, and they live up to expectations.<br/><br/>The critics panned this movie, and I can see why, but I also think that they were a bit hard on it because they have come to expect more of M. Night Shyamalan (who, as usual, has a small part in the movie!) I think if it had been made by anyone else, they wouldn't have been quite as hard on it.<br/><br/>I will say that I did see the twist coming, but knowing didn't lessen any of the enjoyment for me."

","With star performances throughout, I'd recommend this excellent movie -one that works on a number of levels. The film explores how one community isolates itself from the townships in order to preserve a simple lifestyle, maintain its innocence and avoid suffering. <br/><br/>In practice, as the film evolves, it becomes apparent that suffering and pain cannot be avoided and difficulties arise as the deception on which the community is founded begins to be uncovered. The film has a number of poignant scenes where the performances of the two central characters adds great warmth to the film.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this film."

","This movie is fantastic. Completely smart, very scary, beautifully shot. Gorgeous on every level. It's the kind of movie I wish I hadn't seen, so I could see it again for the first time. I liked it better than all of M. Night Shamalayanadahan's movies put together, including The Sixth Sense counted twice. Husband and I kept looking at each other and saying, ""This movie is so cool."" And when it was over, we watched *all* the bonus features, including a ten minute thing on, like, EDITING it or something. We haven't responded to a movie like this since... maybe _Sleepy Hollow_.<br/><br/>It got *awful* reviews.<br/><br/>I think that when the movie came out (I didn't notice, I had a new baby) there was a lot of hype surrounding the plot twists. Kind of like Sixth Sense, where there's this huge thing at the end. So people were too focused on that, and analyzed the whole movie through that filter. We were fortunate enough NOT to know that, or read any reviews, or hear any hype before watching it. Yah, there are twists. But who cares? If you haven't seen it, don't think about any of the media surrounding it, if you can. Just watch it, and don't anticipate anything while you watch. I know, that's impossible.<br/><br/>I cannot express how much I liked this movie. It was... totally perfect. Every moment considered. Every line important, everything in every shot adding value, nothing wasted. A masterpiece."

Night Shyamalan's classics- The Sixth Sense and Signs, it went a little down hill with The Village. Now, the reason is because it was another one of those mysterious/weird films. You see these very Amish-like people lived simple lives in a small and creepy village. Of course, I thought this story took place in the 1800s since there were no cars or electricity, but later in the movie you will find out what happens. Meanwhile, back at the village, they are trying to hide from this monster that has a red cape covering it. They send this blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) into the woods to find medicine for a person that had gotten stabbed in the movie. Then while she was in the woods, she sensed someone there. Of course, she couldn't see the person because she was blind. But what it was, was a suspicious creature that was chasing her down for who knows how long and why The rest and other parts of this movie are secret and cannot be told. But I do want to point out that this was an okay movie and you should see it and tell me what you thought of it. This paper will self-destruct in 5 secondskidding, haa! Movie directed by M.

"nerny01","7","0","1","20 March 2006"," Another one of M. Night Shyamalan's suspenseful twists
","The Village is not the scary movie that it was advertised to be. It is a suspenseful yet intellectually stimulating film that explores the use of fear and deceit as a means of control. Each twist in the film will reveal another key to unlocking the mysteries of the little town of Covington. Shyamalan will inevitably conclude with a similar upbeat ending to that of his earlier film Signs.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, a funeral for a young boy, Daniel Nicholson, tells that the setting of the film is in the nineteenth-century. The small village of Covington is isolated in the middle of a Pennsylvanian valley which has established its own customs and rituals. The village is run by a council of Elders, much like that of an Amish or Mennonite community. Oddly enough, the forest surrounding the village is plagued by a mysterious group of alien-looking creatures, reminiscent to that of Star Wars or the Beast Master. In order to keep the peace, the villagers make animal sacrifices and never venture into the forest. The color red is deemed forbidden, while yellow is considered a protective color in this film. The peace between the creatures and the villagers begins to waver. As a result, many animals are found skinned and red marks are found on the doors of homes.<br/><br/>A struggle of confinement begins to surface within the characters. Lucius Hunt played by Joaquin Phoenix struggles to show his love for Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Edward Walker played by William Hurt and Alice Hunt played by Sigourney Weaver struggle over their love for their children and vow with the other village Elders to breach the forest boundary. William Hurt must make his decision after the jealous, heart broken, and mentally disturbed Noah Percy played by Adrien Brody mortally wounds Joaquin Phoenix and desperately needs medicine. In order to save Joaquin Phoenix's life, Bryce Howard convinces William Hurt to break his vow and let her travel through the woods for help. With the Elders' vow now broken, their control of the village is now compromised. The Elders are now forced to consider revealing their reasons for settling in Covington.<br/><br/>Much like how some of the town's men tried to use the fear of the headless horseman to scare Ichabod Crane into leaving in the film Sleepy Hollow, the village Elders used the fear of the creatures to control the other villagers. However, as the Elders find out, staying isolated from the rest of the world is not good.<br/><br/>Overall, the photography of the village was amazing. The Village is shot with crisp and clear shots displaying the beautiful foliage and architecture. Shyamalan uses a variety of high and low key lighting to highlight his characters faces in many of the night time settings.<br/><br/>Others have described The Village as a parable about the US government using fear to control its citizens as well other countries. The controlling rules of society can make one feel trapped or imprisoned. However, like many childhood nightmares, these fears will pass and can be overcome."

","As some of you might know, critics had been hard with that movie. I think Shayamalan's name was one of the reason. Everyone is expecting a lot from him since his awesome movie : the 6th sense. Shayamalan has a lot of good ideas. Many people judge without knowing how complex writing can be. From movie to another, he manages to find different concepts which are really good.<br/><br/>I agree there is a lot of cheesy things. The terms ""those we don't speak of"", ""magical rocks"", some 5 years old love scenes and many predictable parts. But overall, I think this movie is a must. It's good and different.

","This movie was made by M. Night Shyamalan, and is a most ""particularly"" good movie. Its about a village based in about pioneer ages, and their pretty happy out in their forest surrounded neighborhood. But there's only one problem, there there's mythical beasts out in the woods, their very intelligent but do not come into the village if you don't come into there forest. The people have always lived like this and always will. Sometimes, strong people have to guard the entrance of the woods just in case, they also wear yellow because it drives the monsters awaybut, to your horror, the monsters are attracted by the color red. No one must ever wear red, if you find a red berry or flower or just something red, bury it. Of course, people normally get ill, and rare brave people ask the ""elders"" if they can go to the other ""villages"" across the forest to get medicine to stop sicknesses & even death sense it's a poor village because it might happen a lot. The Stars are Lucius Hunt (played by Joaquin Phoenix) & the main Star heroine, Ivy Walker (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, she's new). Lucius hardly talks to anyone and Ivy is blind. I better stop here so that I wont go telling the end of the story and spoil it all J. but, I really absolutely positively recommend seeing this movie because its one of the best movies ever, best music (I can say that again! No kidding!), best acting (wow!! Yeah!), well, best everything! Its really THAT good, Mr. Shyamalan is really & truly a wonderful film maker for beauty & scariness!! Thank you, M.

The acting is excellent--Bryce Howard is mesmerizing at times--and the soundtrack is one of the beautiful and sad I've ever heard. I bought the soundtrack and I listened to it constantly for the first month or so afterwards.

","The premise of The Village may seem at first to be completely ridiculous. But if you choose not to look at it literally, practically- if the village and its people are taken as a grouping of mentally unstable people (as the photos show them to be) shielding themselves emotionally from the outside world... Then the practical faults of the movie fall aside. The brilliantly spooky, non-special camera effects and the singular ""eye"" of M. Might Shyamalan can then be enjoyed. In fact, the unique, sparse cinematic techniques work to great effect and, along with his unwavering aim on the jugular (so to speak) make him a genius of sorts in my mind.

"fairy_princess1126","8","0","1","16 December 2005"," The Sense of Symbolism in The Sixth Sense (spoilers)
","The Sense of Symbolism In The Sixth Sense, the color red represents sanctuary and a sense of feeling safe, as well as a sign of fear because the use of red with Cole signifies his wanting to be safe from the ghosts, and because the red also shows the first signs of ghosts and fear. Furthermore, the use of red throughout the movie gives certain hints to the fact that something happened.<br/><br/>Being a young boy who sees ghosts can be terrifying. The sense of feeling safe could be extremely hard to find, especially if the ghosts appear at anytime. Cole, the boy, is left with only his mother after his parent's divorce. This seems to be the main problem, but later on in the movie, we realize that it's not that at all. Cole sees dead people. These ghosts scare him so he finds places where he feels safe. He often goes into the church, which has bright red doors. In the church, he plays by himself and stays there as often as he can. He also steals a small statue of Jesus, who is wearing a red robe. This stands out because the Jesus is the only statue wearing red. He then takes it back to his house, where he has a red fort in his room made out of blankets. Inside the tent, he has many figurines of Jesus and crucifixes. He feels that the fort is his sanctuary from the ghosts.<br/><br/>Dr. Crow, played by Bruce Willis, is a child psychologist who tries to help Cole through his problems. Once a bond is formed between Cole and Dr. Crow, Cole tells him his secret of seeing ghosts. Dr. Crow is skeptical of this, of course, but later finds similarities between Cole and an old patient of his. He finds that not only is Cole telling the truth, but his past patient also had the ""sixth sense"" of seeing the dead. Dr. Crow finds his sanctuary in the basement of his house. In the basement, he holds all this past records of old patients, and does research in order to help Cole. Oddly enough, the door to the basement is all white, but the doorknob is red. This stands out against the white and shows that the basement is where he feels safe and where he can find some answers.<br/><br/>Even though red symbolizes the feeling of being safe, it also shows fear and the first signs of ghosts. Cole doesn't fit in and he realizes this. He dreads going to school everyday. The school is painted red, and shows his fear of not fitting in, and also shows that maybe something happened earlier there. Later on, Cole tells us that the school used to be an old courthouse where they hung people. He knows this because he sees ghosts hanging from the ceiling. Dr. Crow talks to Cole about his problems and asks him if he ever writes upset words. These are words that come randomly that one just writes downs without knowing what they are writing. Cole has done this, and it shows the writings that he did, which are in red ink. Throughout the movie, Anna, Dr. Crow's wife, seems very distant from him. He finds pills in the bathroom that are for depression. He has no idea what is going on, but the pills are red, which can symbolize her inner fear of losing him. Red can either show fear or sanctuary.<br/><br/>The use of red also shows that something happened that the audience isn't aware of. For instance, a young girl visits Cole and wants to tell him to give her father a box. Cole and Dr. Crow went to the girl's funeral to find that the mother of the girl was keeping her sick. When the mother is first shown, she is wearing a bright red dress at a funeral. She stands out against all the black. This shows that there is something going on that the audience doesn't know about.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is a great movie that has plenty of twists and turns that keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene. If you're a person who wants to be able to sit there and think about everything you just saw when the movie is over, then The Sixth Sense is the right movie for you."

This movie, in my humble opinion, is firstly a love story and only secondly a seat-grabber goblin flick. To me this film is a first-rate love story with multi-faceted dimensions. On the top layer, this is about Ivy and Lucius and their love for each other. Lucius and Ivy have always known they were in love without speaking it. Lucius is also in love with ""The Village"", and offers to leave--risking peril of the forest--for medicines for the villagers. Later, Ivy offers to leave--risking the same perils of the forest--for medicines for ailing Lucius.

"captainmarvel1331","8","0","2","12 October 2005"," Another nice Shyalaman title.
","M. Night Shyalaman had always given us good films with nice, sorta obvious, twists at the end but are always pleasing. And unlike some directors, and as some critics might think, his movies aren't exactly the same. Sure, they have some sort of twist at the end and are always super-natural, but think about his past movies. The Sixth Sense was his first; great film by the way, and then came Unbreakable. Which was also good, but strayed away from the horror feeling and had a more mature essence, that implying the torture scene. Then Signs came along to be his best film yet, with a great take on crop circles and their possible meanings. And now, The Village. Joaquin Phoenix makes his second appearance in Shyalaman's collection as the ambitious yet quiet citizen of an out-of-date village in the middle of some forest surrounded by monsters of some kind. But don't count on the commercials to give you accurate information. Two things the commercials don't tell you. One: Phoenix is NOT the main character. He is actually removed from the picture half way through the flick. And two: Bryce Dallas Howard, that red-headed girl, is blind. Yeah, she can't see. Anyway, the film is unique and original and is more of a romance then a Sci-fi movie. But don't think Shyalaman didn't forget about the suspense and horror. The mysterious monsters enter the village many times to give you a fright, but the real horror happens in a specific forest scene where Howard actually encounters the monster first hand. And he certainly didn't forget the twist at the end. And its not so obvious this time. I actually had to see the movie two times before I fully understood it. Please don't not see this movie because you don't like Shyalaman or you think it will be too scary. It's a great movie with above average acting and an intriguing story that keeps you interested. Shyalaman never seems to let us down. Or at least me."

","This movie probably stands out as one of the worst uses of a great cast in the recent history of film. You would think that a film containing performances by Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver  among others  would be watchable and interesting. The great cast, however, can't overcome the been-there-done-that story and the ham-fisted dialog that drags this movie straight down into a deep, dark hole.<br/><br/>The main plot point of this film was lifted straight from an old Twilight Zone episode, and the portion containing the film's climactic tension is really nothing more than the culmination of a Scooby Doo cartoon (and he would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!) I found myself waiting for the Mystery Machine to pick up the heroine, complete with Velma's trademark explanation of ""Jinkies!"" Actually, what does happen is pretty close.<br/><br/>Question: why would a father so concerned with the protection of his blind daughter that he was attempt to start a parallel universe cut off from all contact with the outside world then allow her to go by herself into the woods? Why didn't he send help when the two cowardly teens who were supposed to protect her turned back? Very silly stuff, this.<br/><br/>And, oh, that dialog! Did this American History professor not believe that people used contractions in the past? The whole script contains not a single one! Some of it winds up sounding like it was written by Yoda (Such a great gift, love is! *groan*) Granted, some of the cinematography is quite nice, and those in search of a period piece might enjoy this one until the near the end. Personally, it seems to me like Shyamalan had only a couple of good films in him, and is now turning out heavy-handed dreck like ""The Village"" and ""Signs."" After watching this one, I feel no particular compunction to watch any forthcoming films from him."

","absolutely phenomenal movie to those intelligent enough to understand the window of social concept opened by M. Knight Shymalan. wonderfully creative notions of the extreme personal and social ramifications of creating a sub society. and it was all supported within the film. such as the broadcast in the rangers office that was announcing news about war. and that was the very thing that these people were trying to get away from. it would be interesting to explore how some of these ramifications can be reflected in the sub cultures within our own society. such as the gay population or the white supremacist population, etc. i hope you read this M.

","The Village is a very well-written, well-casted, and well-produced movie. Phoenix is always good, and this man has only one scar on his CV. Ladder49, a extremely boring movie, which should've been 30 min shorter than it is. The sixth sense is very very spooky, and Signs could be a kind of War of the Worlds clone. Which is good! Phoenix is also here good. And he's really nasty in Gladiator. And he's also good in this movie, although he does not have the main role. The trailers and commercials for this film, made the viewer to believe that he did. But it's no big deal, because Bryce Dallas Howard does a stunning job as Ivy Walker. The film is scary, and has a lot of moments where you sit and hug your pal in the seat next to you. The creatures in this movie is more scary than the Aliens in ""Alien"" The only thing that is to complain about, is the ending. Which is so extremely stupid. It seems like M. Night Shyamalan had to write the finish in a hurry, because it's not very thoughtfull, and does not fit the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>But when everything comes everything it's a great movie, which should be in every DVD-collection!"

","As many on IMDb and elsewhere have already noted, ""The Village"" was marketed terribly. I don't know what the people in charge of promoting this movie were thinking. I saw many previews and it looked like The Village would be a creepy and scary movie. It isn't, of course. There are some genuinely creepy scenes in the movie, mostly in the beginning. I have to admit I jumped a bit when the ""monster"" ran underneath the lookout tower. But soon the scary elements of the movie wear off and the real story begins. This movie is a very well done love story, drama, and mystery. Had the movie been marketed this way, I don't think the reaction to it would be so negative. It might have even improved audiences' reactions to The Village. People might have thought, oh looks like Shyamalan is doing something a little different this time, I wonder how it will turn out? <br/><br/>Anyways, taken as a drama, The Village is pretty good. It's certainly not the greatest love story or mystery ever put on film, but it's still quite well done. Bryce Howard does a fine job of playing Ivy. I was most impressed by Adrien Brody's performance. I know that nowadays it's becoming cliché for ""serious actors"" to test their chops by playing mentally handicapped people. Brody does not wallow in this cliché. He plays this character in an engaging and very convincing manner. I did not even realize Noah was being played by Brody until halfway through the movie; Adrien Brody absorbed himself into the character that much."

","This is the one movie out of about 20 that I have commented on that I'm really not what to say about. The idea of the movie (once you've seen the end) is so unrealistic but interesting. It obviously could never happen, and being that it's not a star wars movie, it just doesn't quite work. I'm sure that someone else other than the blind girl would've wondered out of the woods eventually and realized that it was not the 19th century (other than the town council, or whatever they were called). One satisfying scene is seeing the one actor fall to his death in the woods. I do feel badly that he portrays a mentally handicapped individual in the movie, I just don't like him in real life (he was in ""The Jacket"". What the heck is his name?). Oh well, I'm sure I'll think of it later. Anyway, this movie is alright, but a bit disappointing. Oh yeah, It's Adrian Brody!!"
"crossing_lethe","7","0","1","7 August 2005"," An OK Film Afflicted by Bad Marketing - Slight Spoilers
","""The Village"" is a perfect example of why it's dangerous to mis-market a movie. While being handled like a thriller, the audience would have been much better informed about what it actually is if it were handled more as a human interest piece. ""The Village"" becomes much more interesting when watching it as a character study than a horror/suspense movie.<br/><br/>Changing focus on a movie can only take you so far, though. There's still the matter of the plot - does it work? The answer is yes and no. It works when you consider the movie a warning against being ruled by fear - I once heard that M. Night Shyamalan (henceforth MNS) had post 9/11 America in mind when writing the film. In that light, one sees the villagers purposely using fear as a control mechanism and the movie becomes a fairly clever commentary on our times. It doesn't work when you question the plot to much. It's not easy to try to make sense of the choices and actions of the Elders. Superficial answers are all one can get. The final confrontation with a ""creature"" at the end doesn't quite work out as well as it should. For a movie that works best on a psychological level, the action involved seems misplaced. I tend to see it as a built in bathroom break and usually don't watch it through.<br/><br/>The actor's portrayals of their characters are hit and miss. I don't know if it was a purposeful choice of MNS, but portrayal of the Elders don't ring as true as the younger generation. Given the final twists of the movie, maybe the Elders were meant to sound rather clunky with their speech. Regardless, the work of the older generation (with a special mention of William Hurt) largely comes off as rather wooden and uncomfortable. The acting improves greatly with the younger stars. It is mostly the work of the perfectly cast Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix that make the movie bearable at all, although smaller roles such as Judy Greer's and Michael Pitt's definitely add to the film. In my experience, it's general consensus that Bryce and Joaquin's scenes together that are the best in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I think MNS's greatest achievement in this movie is in creating atmosphere and a visually appealing directing style. I think it's time he starts working on scripts with other people - he needs someone to tell him when something doesn't work."

","Normally, I'm impressed with Shyamaln's work. Unbreakable was good and Signs was good. Sixth Sense was pretty good too. But The Village just turned out to be a piece of crap. I mean, come on! How can you have a trailer that good and have something that sucked so bad? For an M. Night Shyamalan film, this was disappointing.<br/><br/>On a brighter note, the plot was creepy and when someone entered the woods, the sound effects and whatnot were very scary. And when you only see that little bit of the monsters, they were also scary. However, when you see the full Monte of them, they look like something taken from Power Rangers. I half expected them to grow gigantic and shoot eye beams at the village. And while the plot was creepy, it was overall weak and in some cases pointless. All in all: not impressive. 4 outta 10."

","Maybe I've seen too many movies like this. I'd worked out what the catch would be very early on and watching the rest of the movie was simply a case of proving I was right and adding some details.<br/><br/>That said, the movie works rather well. Though nothing very much actually happens (until the last 20 minutes or so), the film sustains a pleasurably uncomfortable level of tension for most of its length. In this, it is helped by a splendid performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. The supporting cast, containing such worthies as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, is also excellent. Only Joaquin Phoenix seems strangely disengaged; however, his character barely appears in the last portion of the film, so this doesn't spoil things too much.<br/><br/>The photography was OK and I enjoyed listening to the dialog, framed as it was in the English of the late 19th century. The music, however, was sometimes intrusive; there are times in all movies when music just isn't necessary, a fact the film makers here seemed not to realize.<br/><br/>One to watch nonetheless. Something of a leap of faith is required, but it's worth the trouble.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10."

"cherold","5","0","1","30 July 2005"," unsurprising and slow
","It must be tough being director M. Night Shyamalan. He has built a career off of movies with unexpected turns, and I imagine with each movie it must get harder to come up with something. So while The Village only has two real twists, one of which is surprising but no more so than many other movies by more obscure filmmakers and the other of which I fully expected from the beginning of the film, I have to be fair and say, well, you can't get those great twists every time.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie isn't the lack of twists but the fact that it's just rather dull. The stilted speaking style is sort of interesting but also a bit annoying and the story never grabs me. Judy Greer and Adrien Brody are both quite good and there are a couple of effective scenes of suspense, but for the most part the movie is so measured as to feel static.<br/><br/>I think much of the problem is Shyamalan uses his twists to make the audience forgive him for any film-making faults. Signs wasn't a great movie, and without the surprising finale I would have walked away disappointed, but because it had a strong pay off it made everything alright. If Shyamalan has run out of clever twists then he is going to have to work on making his movies pay off not with a stunning denouement but with engaging and engrossing film making throughout. Hopefully he'll learn to do that, and won't even need the clever tricks that have endeared him to me."

","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this after watching it. I really liked Night's other 3 films, esp. Signs, which I thought was great. But this was dull, too easy to figure out, and not tense or scary. Also the funny lines were missing that were in Signs. This movie moves at too slow a pace. The film is about a village in a remote place where the elders tell everyone not to go beyond the borders because creatures live in the woods. It centers around 3 people: a blind girl Ivy, the guy she likes Lucius, and a mentally retarded man, Noah, who likes Ivy. Events happen that lead Ivy to want to venture to other towns in search of medicines. So even before she leaves, the ""big secret"" is revealed. So half the movie, we already know the plot twist, which makes it much less tense and exciting. And the demise of Noah isn't thrilling either.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I never thought I'd dis a Knight film, but I don't recommend this one. The plot and mystery just don't hold up to his other films."

"trypanophobic34","8","0","1","10 July 2005"," The Village: a lesson in morals and fears (spoiler)
","I think there were two lessons M. Night Shyamalan (cool name, by the way!) was trying to t/preach: People won't know what they don't want to know and look around you at the world today. There were no monsters. Only people. That was what they really feared all along, right? People. Someone pointed out the fact that not all the people in the Village looked young enough to be offspring of the Elders. In reality, I guess they just couldn't find enough actors young enough to look like kids or grandkids of the not-so-old-looking Elders. If you look at it from a philosophical standpoint, which I do, you can explain it like this: Maybe the Elders weren't the only ones to first settle in the Village. They all lost someone, right? The others could have gone through similar experiences as the Elders and made the same decision, to go to the Village. There they maybe, over time, forgot their other lives, and that there was any outside world at all. They didn't want to remember it, at least. Eventually they could even have convinced themselves that the ""creatures in the woods"" were real, as people will believe what they want to believe and can thus delude themselves into solidifying their fears into real, physical form, and a real, substantial reason for keeping inside the Village forever. The later generations would have nothing to say to the contrary of the established beliefs, not remembering any other kind of life. If they're aware of the logic flaws in their little Village, maybe they like to keep them quiet and live in this kind of delusion. They all suffered at the hands of the world, somehow, and they decided they'd rather be completely isolated from it than continue to belong to it. So they built this kind of utopia in the middle of nowhere, unreachable by most of the population, their main goal being to ""preserve innocence,"" as Walker says in his long, corny speech in the movie. And to keep the truth about the creatures quiet. They think the world has become too evil and, WORLDLY in general, and the only way to keep things pure is to go rustic, back to the simple ways of 1897, somehow missing the obvious fact that the world was just as worldly, men just as greedy, back then. Why don't we just go back to the ways of the cavemen, because then we'd be really pure? Also, when M. Night makes his cameo as he always does, as the head park ranger guy reading the newspaper whose reflection you see pretty obviously in the cabinet glass, he's listening to the radio and it's talking about how some people were killed or something, some bomb explosion, and the newspaper says that some other little girl got murdered, etc. It was pretty much staring you in the face, the moral lesson there. Can you be more subtle? <br/><br/>Speaking of that too-long speech, one of the Elders (Noah's father, I think) said that ""heartache is the same everywhere."" He also said to Lucius near the beginning, if you remember, something like, ""Sorrow follows you wherever you go. There's no hiding from it,"" and looked at the box in the corner where they kept their ""dark secrets."" I think he understands that you can never really escape from sadness and that the idea of the Village itself is a sham. And speaking of Noah's father, I think Noah knew all along that the creatures were fake. I think he was the one who killed the dogs, too. If he didn't have much trouble killing Lucius, whom he seemed to have had some fondness for, I don't see that he would have had any problem skinning a few dogs. As a kind of sick prank. Walker said one of the Elders might have done it, but it seems unlikely; they couldn't have gained much by it, and none of them seemed like the dog-murdering type. Also, when the Elders go into the ""quiet room"" and discover he's gone and the floorboards dug up, one of them cries out, ""Oh...the animals!"" And if you remember, Noah always used to laugh at public gatherings, etc., when people thought the creatures were around, as if sharing some sort of funny secret with himself. You thought at first it was just because he was the village idiot and all and didn't understand the implications, when he was laughing delightedly and going, ""They're coming! They're coming!,"" but it was still a bit suspicious. He could have discovered the costume beneath the floorboards or gone into the ""forbidden storage shed"" long ago, and so found it funny that other people were scared of the monsters. Sometimes things just work out that way, that the village idiot knows the truth when all the rest are deluded... Also, it was clear he'd gone into the woods before, to fetch the ""bad-colored"" berries and whatnot, so maybe he made a habit of dancing around in the woods in his creature costume.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is good and rather simple (everything moves in one direction and I felt the message was pretty straightforward), as well as a little thought-provoking. Although there is not much action, it's entertaining enough, and I liked the setting. I also found the monsters to be a little creepy, even though they looked fake and moved clumsily; I can't explain it, exactly, but they are eerie."

","M. Night Shyamalan made an interesting move in this game of chess also known as the movie business. A lot of us did not catch but those select few did. Think about it..you make a stunning ghost thriller to make a great first impression, you make a crippling movie like Unbreakable to continue that reputation but you put an unlikely cast within it to make it unique. Signs..he throws his thoughts and ideas about the fate of the planet (many would say an H.G. Wells knock-off), and most recently he sends us the village, a more softer dramatic side of his spectrum. This movie and all other movies are put in a specific sequence that I think will all come together to build the end all of all M. Night Shyamalan films. I enjoyed the villages even though a lot of my friends did not, in some way I could connect with a good part of the plot. Therefore like a lot of his movies I've had to watch it a number of times to get the entire 'spoonfull', that message. In my humble opinion I think that Shyamalan did a great job on this movie and he also did a great job of widening the spectrum of his film career.

","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The Village is not unlike many other post-millennial films which serve as reflexive cultural statements on top of being brilliant films. As a result it also consequently, and regrettably, alienates a large portion of viewers who simply don't get it. It's usually because they either lack the life experience, analytical skills, appreciation of art and the interplay between images and music, or simply possess an IQ comparable to lower order primates. They also likely haven't seen any of Night's other work, for if they had, they would know that what you see is never what you get with his films, and that we should never expect anything as banal as a simple horror film in the traditional sense from him. I believe that part of the problem in the way this film was, and still is, received, may have had to do with the fact that it was marketed as such, when in reality this film is both a period piece and a character piece. Yes, at times it is suspenseful, but it is primarily an allegory about our own society, and not just ""the village"" per se. People often decry the film as far fetched when the real time period is revealed, but is it really? Humans are born as blank slates and we know only what we learn. We lack the natural instincts of many animals and in turn engineer the architecture of the ""natural"" world and impose it on ourselves. We are a self domesticated and controlled species and if you don't think that the various institutions which control our lives have us believing in 100 or more varieties of ""those we don't speak of"" think again. There is indeed a forest beyond the perimeter of the little society in which we live, and which we are more or less forbidden from venturing into. Public schooling, organized religion, and a commodity driven economy all sustain themselves on it. The Village makes this observation in a more subtle way, however, and the villagers themselves all serve to represent anthropomorphized versions of the day dreams all of us have from time to time about a proverbial ""escape"" to a simpler life. The film taps into that natural human desire, however irrational it may be, and demonstrates that even in such a utopia, people still need to fear and believe in things untrue in order to maintain cohesion. Notwithstanding its cerebral underpinnings, the film contains beautiful images and music and terrific performances by mostly learned stage actors. It is a powerful film at both the aesthetic and psychological levels, and I applaud Night for not selling out to the lowest common denominator and for continuing to make films which defy trends and keep on challenging us. For those who didn't like it because it lacked cool 'splosions, I would suggest wading into the commentary thread for something like 2 Fast 2 Furious. In the meantime, keep your vapid and infantile comments about this film, one you apparently don't understand, to yourselves."

","This film has met loads of negative criticism for one reason: those doing the criticizing simply don't understand the purpose of the film. Most of the people I know that saw The Village went into the theater wanting or expecting a horror movie. I know, the way it was marketed contributed to this, but I have learned never to go into a Shyamalan film without an open mind. Everyone I know who succeeded in this also succeeded in understanding and loving The Village. <br/><br/>Shyamalan's minimalistic style also frustrates some people. Many people want to be told things flat out. Shyamalan lets you know everything you need to, but he is more subtle in how he goes about telling you. For example: you never hear in words that Lucius loves Ivy (at least not until the porch scene). Instead, you are given the knowledge when Lucius says, ""Because he never touches you."" I say, why can't more movies be made like this?<br/><br/>The Village is not a horror movie; it is a love story, told in a way completely unique to all others. One aspect of the story that makes it so appealing (to me, at least) is the fact that it is probably the most innocent love story I have ever seen. Lucius and Ivy are not corrupted in any way: they haven't been with anyone else (like many you see today), and they are completely untouched by sin. They are surrounded by evil -- both real and imagined -- yet they remain pure. Even the cinematography reflects this: when they kiss, you don't watch them making out and slobbering all over each other; instead, the camera easily floats away as their lips meet. I could go on and on concerning this subject. <br/><br/>For anyone who reads this that hates The Village with a passion, as I know many do, try watching it again with a different mindset. That goes for all of Shyamalan's films. Each one has a very definite theme that, when realized by the viewer, is very touching and satisfying, to say the least. This movie is just too good not to enjoy! <br/><br/>spartacus"

","So just when The Village was released, all of us found mixed reviews & stale comments from leading critics. But after I thoroughly analyzed the logical sense, entertainment & drama which the film delivered, I could conclude that M. Night Shyamalan created a perfect-ten flawless master piece.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is simply genius. He creates the mood, ambiance & tension to perfection. He induced us all to be a fan for the Shocking suspense formula from ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"". He induced (which very few were) to relish the realistic approach of a family drama in ""Signs"". Finally, Shyamalan is one of the finest director in Hollwood, as a revolutionist he needs to be respected & applauded.<br/><br/>""The Village"" tells us a story about a small Isolated village in the 16th Century surrounded by Forest. The Villagers are somewhat self-sufficient for their daily needs. There exists a strong bond of love & respect among themselves. The group of Elders have always kept motivated the Youngsters with ethical values & traditions. Anyone watching the movie, to some extent shall get mesmerized with the vintage lifestyle of these Villagers who are intimate with nature. The Artificial Modern Day life of today have deprived us from the real luxury of living in Nature. <br/><br/>This Villagers don't have fear for anything as they are void of monetary needs, ego, greed and over-ambitious desires. But there's one fear stays within them, always. There lives Some Strange Creatures in the Forest which surrounds them. There always was a Peace maintained between the Villagers & the Creatures that none of them shall cross each other's boundaries. The Problem begins when a Young man named Lucius Hunt, tries to cross the Borders for a possible attempt to reach nearby towns for procuring vital medicines. Lucius unlike any young man was courageous and in love with Ivy, a blind Girl and daughter of Chief Senior of the Village, Edward Walker.<br/><br/>The Elders always strongly opposed the Villagers for any attempt to cross the borders and maintained that practice as an oath.<br/><br/>The Drama begins here as Shyamalan creates the Fear. The Direction is laid in a way that we become part of the Village. We start adoring the bond between Lucius & Ivy. Just then Lucius is badly injured by Noah, a mentally weak friend of Ivy who becomes jealous for Ivy's love for Lucius. Here is the need of medicine which can save the life of Lucius. Walker the prime supporter of their oath, had to decide for allowing Ivy to cross the Borders to get medicine. His life was important as Lucius had those leadership qualities who could be the future leader to maintain those rules, custom & traditions which the village always followed. He was the best suitable person to whom the ultimate secret could have been revealed.<br/><br/>The Script is marvelously written and told. It gave full justice to all characters. And of course the Twist at the end is as shocking as The Sixth Sense & Undreakable."

","What a drop from two 10's (Sixth Sense, Signs) and a 9 (Unbreakable) to this lousy excuse for a film. Remember when the Twilight Zone would do this kind of story in a half-hour and do it better? The surprise of there being a modern world outside of the village is no surprise at all. It was all spelled out in big letters: AMISH-LIKE VILLAGE. If you didn't see this coming, well you must have fallen asleep. It's so ludicrous as to be laughable, this wonderful utopia hidden away in a forest and protected by who knows whose tons of money. So much so that they can bribe the FAA to make it a no-fly zone. Yes, that's right, it's utopia built on lies and deceit and the filthy money they so disdain. Oh, of course the outside world is rotten, and they aren't. But within this utopia, we see envy, jealousy, murder. They wanted to get away from it and brought it with them. I doubt this was supposed to be one of the points, it's just serendipity that it's there at all. As for the village setup, logic would say put it in a faraway place where there would be no need for a big fence and security, not in the middle of New York or Pennsylvania. I would give it a 1, but there are some genuinely spooky moments in the beginning, so it gets 2. Here's hoping this will be the only low point of Shyamalan's film career."

We had read Handmaid's Tale over the summer and were apart to read Anthem. Before and while reading Anthem we watched the Village. As we progressed through this unit the similarities between the book Anthem and the Village were very obvious almost as if the script were taken right from the book. With some obvious changes and differences, the books theme is still a main theme in the movie<br/><br/>Realizing before seeing the movie that it wasn't meant for cheap thrills and scares, but was to depict a Utopian society on the verge of destruction at the hand of a curious man and courageous woman allowed me to see this movie for what it was intended to be. <br/><br/>Knowing that this film was not meant to be a horror film allowed me to enjoy it more and didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth as it had for many people when it appeared in theatres."

","The Village is yet another horror, suspenseful film by up-and-coming director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie will keep you thinking and is brilliantly acted and written for a horror film.<br/><br/>Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)is a villager in a small, secluded, 19th-century town and is one of the better folk. The village is located in a valley surrounded by forest, and the villager's aren't allowed to stray from it. The forest is filled with creatures, deadly and vicious and if villagers stray into the forest they'll be killed. <br/><br/>After the death of a villagers son, Lucius sees it ridiculous that they don't try and reach the outside towns for medicine. He is denied but an act of defiance would lead himself and his village into chaos and to the truth. Shyamalan is continuing to prove that he is a top director and an incredible storyteller. Phoenix is a bit wasted but Bryce Dallas Howard makes up for it as his blind and caring girlfriend, Ivy. Adrien Brody, however, is over-the-top brilliant in his role as the mentally-disturbed Noah.<br/><br/>The end will catch you completely off-guard (what a surprise for Shymalan) and is thoughtfully placed. The story is just as good as Signs (2002) and is nearly as good as the Sixth Sense. It's a very good film, nothing special but still a pretty good thriller and horror film. <br/><br/>The Village.

I'll declare myself right now; I LOVED this film.<br/><br/>That doesn't necessarily mean you will, though. This movie demands commitment of its viewing base. There is a lot of symbolism that demands a closer look. There's a couple interesting twists to the plot that add something to the story (though I do wish one had been timed a little better...hence the 9 rating instead of 10). And there's an interesting paradox(related to one of the twists) that one can ponder for hours on. Sort of related to the age old pondery, ""Does the end justify the means?"" If you're ready to commit to a little mental excercise, I predict that you will also enjoy ""The Village.""

And I would caution you to confuse disappointment with surprise.<br/><br/>I personally thought that Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was so brilliant that I was disappointed she was not nominated for it at the Oscars. Her pouring of her emotions--the natural flow and grace of her character. She is a breath of fresh air among what many modern critics consider great acting. No, she wasn't a lost soul caught in the center of a mid-life disaster--she did not love the bottle and she did not love strange men. She was only a girl with a blindness that, rather than incapacitating her, made her stronger. She was bright, charming, and insightful...and alas, you forget it is only an act.<br/><br/>I also thought John Hurt's performance was remarkable, as was Adrien Brody's. Although Brody's role as a mentally retarded young man was subtle and seemingly unimportant to the storyline, his presence is felt throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Tremendous movie, chilling performances.

When I heard ""The Village"" described as a ""Twilight Zone"" movie, that secured the ending for me--- I knew what was coming. <br/><br/>Actually there was a plot hole as big as a barn--- SPOILER ALERT! The picture that William Hurt took out of the box was modern, the clothes worn by the people looked about 1980 fashions. Ivy and Lucius looked to be in their 20's, especially him. Where was their memory of their life before they came to the village? How could the elders have mislead so many people who were old enough to remember ""real life."" Sorry--- I had thought the ending would be a little sharper--- it was like I had expected and seeing the truck was my ah-ha moment. But-- what happened when Ivy got back from town?

"objesguy","10","0","1","19 May 2005"," The Village is Truly A Gem In the Rough
","In theaters everywhere, The Village, directed by M. Night Shyamalan was billed as a horror film. It was to be a tale of suspense and fright that was to be as intense and as riveting as his previous and rather popular semi-horror films The Sixth Sense and Signs. Yet, the movie is nothing like a work of horror, or his former films (except for the twist ending). In fact, it hardly has any elements of horror at all, which is unusual for a Shyamalan film. However, while Shyamalan deprives the audience of a horror flick, he also pulls a surprise from his seemingly never-ending bag of tricks and presents us with a story that deals with complex and engrossing issues as love, trust and courage all in a puritan-looking village. In addition though, the film is about no ordinary ""village"" for the inhabitants are fearful superstitious colonials, who fear one thing in their lives: the creatures that inhabit the ""forbidden woods"". While this seems to set up the right formula for a typical horror film, Shyamalan refuses to follow the rules, and instead presents us with a movie that is far from the typical popcorn suspense flick that audience have gotten too accustomed to.<br/><br/>In addition to the complex story of the ""isolated village"", the acting is a key component of the film that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. While underrated actor Joaquin Phoenix gives another solid performance, the real star of the film is Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives a riveting and sensational inaugural performance as Phoenix's blind love interest, Ivy. Amazingly, the chemistry between the two is amazing, yet Ivy seems to be the one that stands out the most. The emotion that she is able to display through her face and body language is a true characteristic of her professionalism and also a good sign that she is a competent actor that is capable of more roles in the future.<br/><br/>The Village is not a horror film by any standards, and that is mainly why critics everywhere have panned the film and given negative reviews. However, while it may not be a horror film, it is an unbelievable film nonetheless. In its basic essence, it is a movie that is more complex than his previous film Signs, and strikes to the heart much deeper than any of his previous three films ever did. Granted, it takes an open mind and a patient soul to get everything Shyamalan has to offer from this movie, which is something audiences aren't used to doing. However, in this day of popcorn horror and suspense films and boring linear dramas, this is a movie that definitely stands out from the crowd and is worth the price of admission in more ways than one."

","I have seen many bad reviews for this movie and that makes me angry. It is not Shyamalan's best, but I think it's better than Unbreakable. Also compared to any other scary stories we have nowawadays it is great. The tension literally never lets up from the credits which Shyamalan always makes intense, to the end. The love story between Lucius and Ivy is very good and adds even more tension on top. The scariness is all through it as we constantly hear the noises from the creatures and when they finally do enter the Village it is a scary scene that I will not soon forget.

OK, the twist at the end is slightly implausible but I have to confess that I didn't see it coming. As a comment on our current 'post 9/11' fear of the outside world and the enemy at our gates, I thought the film intelligent and thought provoking. The acting and cinematography I found of a high standard (the cast were for me excellent) and the portrayal of a community isolated from the world and the general spooky and unsettling atmosphere I found haunting and very memorable.

Forget the fact that Shyamalan's movies famously have a twist (anyway this has two, albeit one is fairly obvious), otherwise you may be disappointed. You must take this movie on its own merits, not as a Shymalan work, then it has a lot to be commended. The cast is pretty impressive: nice to see William Hurt playing a lead character again, ably supported by Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and others. However the undoubted star is Bryce Dallas Howard. In the early scenes, she doesn't impress very much with her ""blindness"" - she focuses on people too obviously - but this improves as the movie runs. Apart from this however, I think she plays the part beautifully. She is luminous in most shots, and holds your attention constantly. She should be a major star soon on the basis of this performance.<br/><br/>The landscapes are framed and shot as you would expect from this director, with clever use of colour and especially shadow. I didn't spot a single anomaly in the settings, and the soundtrack also fits well.<br/><br/>So what's the implausibility? *** SPOILER FOLLOWS *** A community like this would simply not be possible - OK, we don't know until the last part that we're in the present day, but even one hundred years ago, I'm sure that such a place would have had visitors.<br/><br/>Anyway, you should suspend disbelief and enjoy all the good things; Ms. Howard in particular."

Each of his films is like a puzzle that seems simple once someone shows you the secret. That's why the craftsmanship is so impressive. They all contain lessons about life, as well, especially about the fears we all harbor, and the ways we have been given to confront them.<br/><br/>This film makes Bryce Dallas Walker a star. She shines bright as a heroine few will ever forget. Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" is at his brooding and enigmatic best. And Adrien Brody gives his character, who serves as a counterpoint to the others, a bemusing innocence mixed with the wildness and irrationality of a force of nature.<br/><br/>The film has the feel of a parable or allegory throughout, and a Gothic quality that adds to the power of the denouement.

I have always been a great fan of Joaquin Phonenix since ""Parenthood"" and he did not disappoint. <br/><br/>In regards to the costumes I was glad to see that the creatures from the dark side were made using the traditional techniques (costumes and make-up) as I feel they give the story an amazing timeless quality. <br/><br/>The production design was spectacular with the whole town being built from scratch based in such a remote location. Well done to all of those in the art department, the set dressing was amazing, and I am sure there were many a leaf wrangling. <br/><br/>I believe the score is so in sync with the film allowing it to flow so beautifully, and as the viewer I was totally caught up with the what I was seeing, keeping us in suspense and intrigue and in love without being to obvious. The only other film that I have felt has come close is The Piano. <br/><br/>The cinematography and lighting allowed us to be caught up in the small town, to run into our homes when it called for it, to follow the love story, and to feel anguish when she was in the woods, only a great cinematographer can give you such a front-row seat. <br/><br/>Overall I found this film to be I timeless story that is obviously based in history and tradition which translated so well onto the big screen, in my opinion only due to the fact that M.Night Shymalan, the king of suspense, met the challenge."

When one of the characters is injured a blind girl volunteers to go out and find another town and get the medicine needed to heal the hurt man. Well she then finds out through her father that the creatures are nothing more than a myth used to keep the people of the village from ever leaving. So to me this story is perfect for the kind of person that likes the kind of movies that aren't completely out of the ordinary, like that kid that always says that movies too OUT THERE for me. Well The Village in the beginning half of the movie is OUT THERE but as it gets closer to the end it brings you back down to earth and is really a thriller story that you can say, ""HEY! that could actually happen!"".

I think is underrated as a piece overshadowed by the director's other works,but it should not be. As a stand alone work, it is in my opinion a masterpiece and should be enjoyed as such. Like a lot of SHYAMALAN's films the story has a twist in the tail,because from the outset you believe the setting is back in a previous time,and not until the last quarter do you see that it is in fact set in modern times.The people chose to go and live where they are and how because of previous events that are kept from you until near the end."

","I like to let a movie stand on its own two feet and not compare it to another. With that in mind and the fact that I knew very little about this movie, it was a treat. Unfortunately, I know it had been touted as a horror movie; it is not. So, the horror loving fans will be greatly disappointed. But, for those of us who like surprises and characterizations, this movie delivered.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away, but I will share this. The acting was first rate. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius), Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy), William Hurt (Edward Walker) and an unrecognizable Adrien Brody (Noah) were excellent. If you love good acting, that would be the first reason to see this movie. If you like surprises, that would be second reason to see this movie. And the sweet love story between Lucius and Ivy would be the third reason to see this movie. Don't compare it to other movies, just experience it."

He is a great writer and directer but this was odd.

This mysterious town has a pact. A pact with the ""creatures"" living outside there boarders. The pact is the village people do not enter the woods and the creatures do not enter the villagers land. When Joaquin is seriously injured by Adrien his blind fiancé Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) has to enter the woods to get medical supplies. Which would break the pact and reveal an eerie secret. The village people, all except the elders, believe the creatures, who are attracted to red, are real. The twist reveals a very eerie story.<br/><br/>9 stars *********"

","For all the criticism it has received, there's an undeniable fact that sets this movie apart from all the usual fares we see: it is unique and tries something different. People are upset that the commercials put a different idea of the movie in their heads, then it turns out completely not what they thought they were going to see. what's wrong with that? If you like watching the same thing over and over again, M. NIght Shymalan's films are not for you.<br/><br/>I loved ""The Village"" for every reason we watch movies: entertainment. I didn't know what was going to happen. That's a good thing. You shouldn't be scared of that. The ideas and the notion of this ""amish-like_ society is interesting because I'm sure there are people out there like the elders and have wanted to live in another world. Phoniex and Howard both played this innocent love story so well and showed that love can be pure and simple. This movie also made me jump in some points, and I haven't done that since I saw ""Signs."" Hmm, another Shymalan film, interesting. For all it's detractors, I will stand by his work because it continues to shock and delight at least this movie-goer."

","Excellent fiction with a perfect balance of reality! The breadth of human emotion and psychology in which this movie plays really makes the mind reel of possibilities. The serenity of the village and surrounding scenery adds perfectly to the foreboding feel of the storyline while excellently directed camera angles extend a natural sense of urgency during key scenes. The supporting cast is wonderful and Ms. Howard's performance is truly worthy of an Oscar nomination. I have viewed The Village several times, and the amazing attention to detail that is maintained throughout this movie will keep deep thinkers in contemplation long after the last credits roll.

","This movie was quite good and some bits were scary and I, originally, didn't know that Ivy was blind. My friend sitting next to me said: ""Is she blind or something?"", as he didn't know she was blind, when she was acting blind. It turned out that she WAS blind. I have seen better before, but it was OK. I don't know why they didn't call these creatures/ old fogeys in the woods by their real names. I wonder why they called them: ""Those who must not be named"" or something similar to that. Why did they choose red as the bad colour? Why not black or blue etc? Why was the good colour yellow and not green? Anyway, it was quite good, but I've seen better."
"MichaelMargetis","8","0","1","2 April 2005"," Shyamalan's Fourth Installment of Terror!
","Review (if you haven't seen the film): All I can tell you about M. Night Shamalyadingdong's (I mean Shyamalan's) new film The Village, is it's better than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but not quite as genius as his last movie Signs. In closing this short review all I could tell you is the film (along with Manchurian Candidate) deserved somewhere between 4 and 4 ½ stars, but I gave it the lower number instead because their is always room for improvement. And that's about all I'm going to tell you. Honestly if I reveal anymore it will ruin the tremendous experience for you. You should go into it knowing nothing, I did.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT DON'T READ ANY FURTHER<br/><br/>I found The Village to be the most unexpected thing you'd find of the master of terror M. Night Shyamalan. Although it doesn't attract it's viewers with spine-tingling thrills like M. Night's last installment of fright ""Signs"", it attracts viewers because the character development and emotions are just so dang interesting. Also what reels viewers in is the mystery of it all. Why were these settlers here? Who were this pig-like monkey men in the woods? And why the hell didn't they try to hunt them. All this keeps the audience glued to the screen as long as the film in the projection booth is running.<br/><br/>THE SET-UP<br/><br/>I found the set-up of the settlers in the woods quite interesting. I felt the whole idea about the first settlers their being known as ""elders"" who make all the decisions about the colony's future, kind of borrowed a little bit from other things, but it was still pretty intriguing to watch. I liked most of the characters, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character Lucius. Lucius is kind of like the opposite of the character Phoenix played in Signs, Merril Hess. Lucius is the Arnold Schwarzwenegger of the film, you know the fearless hero, well until he gets stabbed. I loved newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard's character, although she was blind she was still the toughest female in the Village, and in a way she was the hero of the films. Adrien Brody's character Noah Percy, was extremely creepy, while William Hurt's character wasn't very creepy but very god-like (in a way in which he called the shots). Sigourney Weaver's character was very short-lived and simple, she was a lonely single parent desperate for security which only could be provided by a man.<br/><br/>THE CHILLS<br/><br/>I didn't find that the film scared me at all. It only creeped me out once. The part where they first show the ""creature"" up close and personal. That would make for one hell of a Halloween costume.<br/><br/>THE WAY IT WAS SHOT<br/><br/>I loved the camera work in this. LOVED IT. Nice camera tricks, gave a lot of depth to the film (although it really didn't need it, it was a very nice add-on). M. Night Shyamalan showcases his numerous talents once again in this film.<br/><br/>THE ACTING<br/><br/>I thought The Village contained many great performances in it. Joaquin Phoenix was great as always, and Sigourney Weaver did a fine job (as usual). William Hurt gave an undeniably great performance, and I was quite impressed with newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter). However, the real stand-out of the movie was Academy Award Winning Adrien Brody as Noah Percy. He plays his character with such passion and depth it's hard to resist the notion of him getting another Oscar nomination this year. I've seen many people play mentally handicapped individuals (some good, some bad, some great, some horrible), and Adrien Brody's one is up their with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and Sean Penn in I Am Sam. He also adds a creepy and violently disturbed dimension to his characters that terrified me while viewing, yet attracted me to know much more about his character.<br/><br/>THE WAY IT ENDED<br/><br/>I thought the ending was the most clever part of the movie. To end it with the monsters really being real, would have been lazy, and common. But how they had it just being a hoax so that William Hurt could have everyone afraid to leave out into the real modern world (because he was a part of a support group) was BRILLIANT! How he paid for planes not to fly over the area was just ingenious. The best part was when Bryce Dallas Howard's character gets to the outside world, and it's modern day! How great is that! It felt like the ending of a great Twilight Zone episode. A two hour Twilight Zone episode. <br/><br/>In closing to the review, I thought the ending showed that M. Night Shyamalan could make great suspense stories, even if it wasn't supernatural. He showed a whole new side of his work in this, and showed he could be versatile. The critics slammed it because whenever we go into a film by M. Night Shyamalan we expect supernatural stuff to take place. Well, from now on, don't. So before I leave you, I'd like to say  it's way more easy to make a film about monsters, then it is to make a film about people posing to be monsters to keep people restrained from the real world. M. Night caught us off guard in this flick, and I liked that.

And the music is just as beautiful as the movie, and I wish very much that it had won at the Oscars. I bought the soundtrack.

Although there are suspense/thriller qualities, the story is also has some drama and charm.<br/><br/>I watched the movie on an average DVD player and basic 29"" color TV, on which, the movie format was well presented. So I am sure if you have surround sound and a better TV, the experience will be good, too. The cinematography and imagery were well presented, especially the use of colors and lighting. The sound was good, but it's volume fluctuated with the needs of the scenes, so make sure the kids are quiet and the dishwasher is turned off, or have the controller handy. The acting effectively presented the story in the way the director wanted us to perceive the story as it developed ... (I know that sounds odd, but to explain that in better detail would require me to give away some of the story.)<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is excellent, especially if you want something different, well acted, and intelligent."

","I'll give it a 10 because it was an excellent story when I read it when I was a kid. I can't remember the original science fiction author but the stories are almost identical and the only thing I can think is that this is a direct ripoff. <br/><br/>The story I read started the same way... people in a village who couldn't wander outside the borders. In the story I read, a boy and girl go playing one day and the girl gets her foot stuck between some rocks. She makes the boy vow not to tell anyone... takes off her shoe, and she has 6 toes. He promises and takes her home. She makes him vow never to tell anyone because anyone in the village that has a deformity is put to death as being an abomination against god. <br/><br/>To make a long story short, it ends up that outside the borders of the village is a modern civilization that was destroyed by nuclear war and the people who are put to death inside the village are killed so that radiation related birth defects won't spread to the 'protected' villagers.<br/><br/>The stories are so identical in tone and meaning.. the village, the people, the father, the boy and girl, the border, the modern civilization outside the village... there's no way that m. night didn't plaguerize this book or use it to get his ideas from.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but it's a ripoff."
"caschell","9","0","1","29 March 2005"," The Village is about Love, and all that it implies
","This is the second Shamylan film that I have seen. Just as Signs was about ""Faith"", his Village is about ""Love."" <br/><br/>This film shows many facets of Love, which includes forgiveness, honesty, joys, heartache, dreams, future hopes, protecting community and family, kindness, and miracles. Ivy's blindness lets us see the world in a different way, and draws us in to see her character, her courage, her family and her love, which is very appealing. Her father, who helped create the Village along with the elders, loves this community and does everything he can to protect his family and the community from outside contamination. The Elders, for all their good intentions, still meet life with sadness, as well as joy, in this Utopian community. Lucius, in contrast to Ivy, has a different kind of facet to love--protective love, fearless courage and quiet strength, he always wants to improve this community, even if it means bringing outside influences, which is forbidden in their village to do. <br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this film, and I hope to see more films from this writer-director. I love his visual style, intellectual and emotional pondering for his movies."

","Why can't America see her reflexion in the mirror? All over Europe, this movie was well accepted by the critics and the public in general. But in the United States this movie was rejected by all! Why? Because this movie demonstrates the state of America. They (American, most of them) just live for their country, they only breed for they country, they only know about their country!! By the way, Portugal is a little country near Spain, it's a European country and it's not Spain!!! They live in a complete isolated state of utopia,happy with themselves, not knowing that they are a part of the world and not the all world! This film, it's a portrait of this kind of thinking. That Village it's America, and outside the village it's the unknown, the danger, the enemy. But when one of Americans (the blind, can't you see the metaphor?) goes outside and meets the unknown she understand finally the truth: they are not alone, there are friendly people, yes people with feelings, beliefs that are ready to fight for a better world together. So, why we European understand the meaning of this movie? Because it's a hell more easier to see the other then to see ourselves in the mirror! Please see this movie without expecting that switch at the end, this film deserves more than that. Appreciate the symbolism, the music, the dialogs (that one with luscious and the blind girl it's one of the best love dialogs ever), everything on this movie! In Europe it was considered the best movie from this director and one of the best of 2004. It's not too late, please American friend wake up and vote this movie the best of 2005!"

","I remember seeing the trailers for 'The Village' just before it came out and me predicting it to be a horror film. I have heard much disappointment from many but also praise from many others as well. This movie is based on your taste and this film was created to be a 'romance.' A lot of younger viewers went to see this movie expecting thrills, gore, raging beasts, something much like 'The Grudge' perhaps? Mainly because this movie was advertised that way which I did not like, it's a great marketing tool but if you want people to enjoy the movie for itself advertise what it is. This movie is all based on opinion and in mine I believe this movie was wonderful. The music added the missing suspense and added more feeling for the characters. As for the characters they were done wonderfully. The costumes were wonderful as well; Ann Roth is defiantly a artist. I watched DVD features and she would make sure everyone's costume was 'perfect' before shooting.<br/><br/>The dialog might be hard for younger viewers to understand which could be another reason why people did not like it. I loved the dialog, the theme, everything about this movie! To fully enjoy this movie age does not matter, it's all in your taste. If you enjoy a little bit of humor, mystery, some suspense, romance, and beautiful scores of music, then this move is defiantly for you. But if you're looking for a hit thriller story you might want to pass but I do encourage everyone to watch this movie."

Yes, there is an almost surreal element to this film, but it enhances, rather than detracts from it. There is an honesty here, that is refreshing and moving... and an overall message that we have given up too much of our security, human dignity, and innocence in our ever-increasing desire for more so-called sophistication. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, with excellent performances by William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, & Bryce Dallas Howard, and a stellar job by Adrian Brody.<br/><br/>The Village is a movie that stays with you, and makes you ask the question 'what if?'.

This movie is an example of perfection in movie making sense. All the actors excel in their roles. Especially Miss Ron Howard. I am sure director Ron Howard is a very proud father today. As to M.Night, cant thank him enough for making a movie of such caliber. Look forward to the future for more great films from him. The story without giving anything away, will keep you thinking.

Many of the people who went to see it with me thought it was terrible because they went to get scared and were disappointed. It was a psychological thriller just like the rest of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. Only the trailer to this one portrayed the movie as scarier than his other movies and so compelled more people to see it to get scared instead of what the movie was actually about. I enjoyed it because of the information that you find out close to or at the end of the movie. Once the whole story comes together it is a psychological thriller, and not many people were expecting that and thought it was dumb. I didn't and I enjoyed it.

","From the trailers, I thought I was in for a horror film but I was quite surprised to find that that wasn't the case. There are moments but not enough to satisfy those who expected some real frightening movie.<br/><br/>But the director has done it again. The plot is consistent and witty. Everything works together and makes logical sense at the end, sadly not the case for all movies that are coming out recently. A very nice cast, this is the movie to satisfy an audience that likes a nice change from the normal redundant story lines and typical endings.<br/><br/>But be warned, if you come to watch this with the sixth sense expectation, then stop right there. Since you already experience a twist and expect a twist, you're not going to be as impressed with it. Sort of like how most responded to other works of M. Knigt. Be open minded. This movie really is a pretty good one if you don't always tack on all of his other works especially the first one. Sit back and just enjoy another M.

"filmaven","8","0","1","14 March 2005"," Great Film
","I usually agree with Ebert about 98% of the time, but he is dead wrong here. I seem to be out of synch with EVERYONE on M. Night films, which I love, see in theaters and buy as soon as released on DVD - I can't say that for any other modern director. I thought The 6th Sense was his least effective film. I found it very conventional in Hollywood terms in many respects, and I saw through its conceit in minutes. Shyamalan's films have grown progressively stronger since. Many have criticized Shyamalan for an alleged lack of reality in his films, e.g., the ""Achilles heel"" of the alien creatures in signs; but as in this film, I believe those critics have missed the point and architecture of Shyamalan movies. M. Night poses for the viewer an internally consistent set of rules - like in comics, the rules may be (somewhat) implausible in real life, but he does not cheat on them once set (Many of Hitchcock's films require you to suspend disbelief, not to mention the Twilight Zone, Star Trek, most comic books, etc.) The viewer's sense of reality and the set up for the twist arises from the emotional truth of the characters, and therefore depends heavily on the acting abilities of the cast (probably why I was not fooled by The 6th Sense - somehow Bruce Willis tipped his hand to me, perhaps because it was hard for me to buy him as such a passive character - unless there was some physical reason he could not effect change in his life).<br/><br/>I note that everyone seems to acknowledge how scared/creeped out they were by the movie, but then disappointed when the twist was revealed. Does that make the earlier fear any less palpable or real when experienced? Do you still believe in the bogeyman? Or do you deny that you had a night light when you were a tot? CGI does not make the monster any more real - it is all just light pictures on a screen.<br/><br/>I think that as a culture, many are predisposed to reject the innocence of The Village's characters; we have lost so much innocence in our society, that those from a more innocent place seem almost like another species rather than another time or culture - we need others to be as corrupt as we are in order to justify our own corruption. Part of my childhood was spent on a farm in the rural south; and the secrets and lies (incl. religion, to which M. Night alludes but does not state, but in the current political clime wisely sidesteps confronting it) employed by elders to ""protect"" the younger generation and maintain social control rang particularly true for me. Also the theme that even in a utopia, the darker side of human nature will out, even in the most seemingly innocent creatures (Caliban?). The Village is by no means perfect, but there is deep emotional truth in this film. In support thereof, there are also astonishing performances, esp. by the young lady, Bryce Dallas Howard (Saints be praised that Kirsten Dunst was otherwise occupied). I deeply hope M. Night stays true to his vision and continues to make ""horror"" films about the human condition."

And although I hate jumping in my seat as a rule, it worked very well. I just think there should have been more about the life before this town and why they were there. (of course, that would have to come at the end, because it would ruin the suspense at the beginning). <br/><br/>I would like to see a Prequel to this one: what caused the elders to want to hide inside an animal park and pretend it was the 1800s?

","This story has all the components of what absurd lengths parents will go to in order to keep their children safe. The star-studded cast does a magnificent job of portraying the cloistering and perhaps even suffocating effects of rendering these protections. The film also provides many thought provoking themes as well--such as ""those of which we do not speak"" and the ultimate association made with mentally challenged people like Noah Percy (played to the hilt by Adrien Brody).<br/><br/>The part of Ivy Walker also provides a fantastic spring board for the talents of Bryce Howard. Her moving and challenging portrayal of the handicapped young woman motivated by love to extraordinary feats of bravery and wile to aid the one she loves is inspiring even without consideration of the fact that she performed this role in her early twenties."

","When I saw it in the theater last year, I certainly liked it, but haven't come to my positive conclusion until having viewed it the last few days a half-a-dozen times on pay-TV. This is a good admonition that you have to see movies more than once! This is a very finely tuned movie! The ending section with the guard is particularly well done. It's a fable, not so much a horror movie--in this sense it reminded me of the Wizard of Oz or The Night of the Hunter. It's a romantic fable-very romantic with the beautiful blind girl and everything --""who sees the world as others don't"" an allegorical fable--does she represent the quintessense of innocence-- the village was founded by people looking for innocence. Hard heads who want to be wowed by surprise twist endings aren't going to care for it nor those who dislike romantic fables. (after all, they start hinting about the ""twist"" ending quite early in the movie.) Well, is this my thousand words yet?"
"mdawg6448","10","0","1","1 March 2005"," A great love story
","It seems like every comment I've read on the masterpiece was about how well the twist worked or how scary it was. I don't think that's what the movie was about at all. Yes, these elements certainly added to the story, but the center of the film was not philosophy or a cheap thrill, but love. True love, for that matter. It's about two people that are meant to be together, who love each other for all the right reasons. Then, when that love is threatened, the story shows you what true love is made of. It shows sacrifice in the face of fears, both real and imagined. When all else falls away, only love remains. Perhaps M. Night Shyamalan's own words state my case best when his character, Edward Walker, tells his fellow townsmen, ""The world moves for love. It kneels before it in awe."" In conclusion, I loved the acting provided by a stellar cast, the incredible dialog style that only Shyamalan can write, the wonderful music, and the depth of the philosophy and symbolism. However, what left me breathless at the end was a deeply moving love story central to the plot. That's why I think that this is Shyamalan's best film yet and why I can't wait for his next one."

We're all too busy watching mindless violent and utterly stupid movies. Audiences don't understand, this movie is not about creatures in the woods. And if you don't like that, then I am by no means saying you don't have the right to dislike this movie--that's simply your personal view--but to say it ""sucks"" is not fair whatsoever.<br/><br/>While I'll admit this movie was marketed differently than it should have been, we were expecting horror and got drama. We went to see The Village expecting a ""OMG THIS IS Like The MOST AWESOMNESS TWISTY ENDING EVAR"" instead of investing time in the characters and reaching the deep center of The Village.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying The Sixth Sense and Signs are not about ghosts or aliens, just as this is not about 'creatures in the woods'. These are what film enthusiasts refer to as metaphors. The Village is one of the, as well as bravest, most metaphorical films of our time. Whether or not it was 'scary' isn't important now is it. I think it's fine if your disappointed about it not being scary, as matter of fact it's what kept it from getting a 10 from me, but The Village isn't meant to be horror. The 'bad color' clearly represents blood and violence, the villagers traveled to their obscure area to escape this. That is why the 'bad color' is not allowed, it attracts 'those we don't speak of' which represents the people of the towns. That's why they are located in the surrounding woods.<br/><br/>Audiences do not pick up on this anymore because, frankly, we're stupid. We're issued pure crap on a daily basis and come to find it the norm.<br/><br/>Now, about that supposedly so important twist ending. I won't give anything away (like you really care, the rest of the movie means nothing to you, hypocrite) but I would like to state that the twist ending is very clever and while it may not bowl you over, like The Sixth Sense's ending did, it will surprise you and don't lie to yourself and say 'you knew all along'. Look at some of the reviews that say this movie ""SUXXORS The BIG ONE!!11"", all of them are from ignorant twelve-year olds, or ones with the mentality of a twelve-year old, who claim to be such 'movie bufs'. The twist ending only solidifies the rest of the story, which is about something more than a village surrounded by woods infested with monsters.<br/><br/>The movie uses something called symbolism, which is something modern audiences don't get. ""The Bad Color"", ""The Creatures in the Woods"", ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", these are metaphors. The Village is really about innocence. The Villagers were afraid of these monsters because, due to their innocence, they didn't know much about them. Fear and innocence are powerful messages that very few movies express today.<br/><br/>I wonder what would happen if The Village had come out after The Sixth Sense. Would your opinion be different? I grant it would be. Stop comparing different movies with each other because their directed by the same man. When you go see a movie take the time to invest your time in the characters and let the story unfold before your eyes and maybe you'll enjoy more movies and maybe be able to actually say you understand film. If in the end you didn't like The Village , that is your opinion, but to go around saying ""THIS IS Like The WURST MOVI EVAR MADE Like OMG!!!oneoneone"" is simply showing your ignorance.<br/><br/>I wrote this to possibly shed some light on what The Village is really about. I'm not saying you have to like it, but the reason no one liked it is because no one understood it. If you got the innuendos and symbolisms and simply didn't like it, I don't find you a hypocrite. It's those that go around saying ""TEH TWWIST ENDIN IS GAY"" that shouldn't even be allowed to watch movies like this, movies with a point.<br/><br/>Good cinema is rare, but a good audience is an endangered species."

There isn't much blood if you don't like gore. The only thing I think isn't great about it is, until you get to the end it's a little confusing. But it's all figured out.

","If this movie is watched without past reference to Night's earlier films then definitely its a good movie. But the moment you know that its ""The Sixth Sense"" director is at the helm of affairs, you know what you are seeing on the screen could possibly be a misnomer. Thats what precisely happened to me while I watched ""The Village"".<br/><br/>The story set around 1897 is effectively backed up with costumes, set design, language (including grammar) and the rituals. The screenplay is fantastic with the finer nuances portrayed effectively. The usage of colour signifying bad colour and good colour is depicted well. The eerie sounds of the woods truly add depth to the movie.<br/><br/>Phoenix delivers a restrained performance however the star of the movie is Bryce Dallas Howard. She gets into the skin of the character as a blind girl. Adrien Brody proves yet again that he is Oscar material. Pity the character he portrayed didn't have much scope. Signourey Weaver is wasted.<br/><br/>One thing is clearly written on the wall - the director does have what it takes. My only suggestion is that he shift away from Hitchcockian movie in which he is trying to establish his trade-mark."
"jrfranklin01","8","0","1","27 February 2005"," Shown To Believe
","M. Night Shyamalan is well known for his ability to invoke suspense and surprise endings. This film keeps with his other works such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". But much like those films, it is also designed to make you look at things a certain way. The surprise endings that are often unguessable are due to Shyamalan's cleverness in making the audience see things from a staged point of view without even realizing it. This is the very reason none of us knew Bruce Willis was a ghost in ""The Sixth Sense"". ""The Village"" can easily be summarized as a community that is haunted by some darkness in the surrounding woods. The details of such take us to a place that appears remote and colonial. All of this becomes apparent in the natives' dress and their speech. Communication and transportation are primitive and farming represents the town's livelihood. The audience at this point has a very clear sense that they are watching an older, bygone way of life.<br/><br/>Now, about the darkness...there are creatures that lurk in the nearby woods. A relationship exists between the creatures and the townspeople, where the townsfolk stay out of the woods and the creatures leave them be. Not surprising, this ""truce"" is broken and the creatures start to pay little visits. At this point you feel like you are watching an old-world, horror-type film. Good camera work, a good cast (includes Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, and Joaquin Phoenix), and excellent suspense make this an interesting tale. Everything is amplified when one of the community members is stabbed and needs medicine. Then the story begins to involve how the community has sequestered itself from the outside world and is haunted by the forest creatures.<br/><br/>Where things get a bit shaky is in the whole idea for the film. Please do not read on if you don't wish to know the ending. The ending reveals that the ""portrayed town"" we've been watching is actually the creation of a bunch of city goers in today's world that wanted to start their own society. While a most clever idea, retrospect shows that the way the town operated, you would think someone would have found out the truth already. And the town certainly wasn't that old, with the first generation members being William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. How did they manage to move and create a colony and then turn around and invent myths that were law? And the fact that all the town elders were cowards enough to send a blind girl to get medicine was just plain sad. Did they know that if they sent a blind girl, they would remain undiscovered? And to think the whole thing was justified by the injustices they experienced in the modern world. Kudos to William Hurt for his performance in showing how the elders were committing their own injustices. Anybody think the town held together and there'll be a Village 2? 8/10 P.S.: An excellent job is done in the woods scene with Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), where you begin to think the monsters might actually be real."
"Mr_Fawlty","8","0","1","27 February 2005"," As has been said... very underrated
","The problem with this movie is not the movie itself. All the marketing portrayed this to be a 'scary' film - even a 'horror' film on a similar level to 'Cabin Fever'. This couldn't be further from the truth. It is a moving film of family life at the turn of the 20th Century and how a community tries hard to maintain it's innocence despite growing problems and the fear of attack from invading creatures.<br/><br/>If you go into this movie expecting huge shocks, you will be disappointed, as its pace is very slow. There are shocks to be had - in fact there are some moments that are genuinely frightening - but in whole this movie is about the people, not the 'horror' the acting is top notch - a really good portrayal of 'Victorian' life. There are moments where you actually think you are watching an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel or even an episode of 'Little House on the Prairie'. Don't worry, these moments are fleeting, but they do draw into the time period.<br/><br/>As it a Shmayalan film, you have to expect twists, and you may even guess them before they happen, but this does not spoil the movie experience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, just don't expect the wrong type of film."

At least I hope that is what is what was intended because lanterns/flames do not cast light like that.(Natural Gas perhaps?)<br/><br/>The extra ""home movie"" by M.

","I was disappointed of M. Night Shyamalan falling under Mel Gibson's religious fervor and mixing science fiction with Catholicism in 'Signs'. Luckily, my concerns were eased by 'The Village'. M. Night Shyamalan is back, and 'The Village' sits well among his good movies.<br/><br/>A previous commenter observed that two categories of viewers seek M. Night Shyamalan's movies. Those who like horror stories, and those who look for the hidden traps specific to his writing and directing. In my opinion both categories find good stuff here. The horror story thread is very convincing, and the first half of the movie recreates a 1800s American settlers environment mixed with a Gothic horror story thread that was very credible for me. Yes, I was willing to be fooled, but you need to be a willing fool if you want to enjoy horror movies. The explanation of the trap in the second part of the film has logic and morals. One may argue about the approach taken by the characters in their attempt to fly the evils of civilization, but not with the quality of the cinema used to give the story.<br/><br/>Cinematography fits well the twists of the action, with a color code that is well explained and will soon become part of the stony. Acting is superb. Jaochin Phoenix and Adrien Brody give two of their best performances ever, William Hurt is William Hurt, and the fresh face of Bryce Dallas Howard fills in well the screen in her first lead role.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 on my personal scale."

The problem is M Night Shyamalan - because when you know he is the director, and you have seen his other films, you then spend the whole film waiting to see if the twist is the one you guessed it was. Having said this, if you look at the film separated from its pedigree, then it has some very good areas , such as the sense of isolation and community created within the village. It is beautifully filmed, with many moments of real tension. And the performance of the film must be that of Bryce Dallas Howard, a true star in the making. However, the dialogue I found slow, and stilted. William Hurt was operating on cruise control, and Joaquim Phoenix seems to think that every emotion can be conveyed through the use of a blank glassy stare. So, some good points, but not enough to make up for the way I felt cheated at the end of the movie, and glad I saw this on DVD for a third of the price I would have paid at the cinema."

","A highly disappointing effort by America's most overrated filmmaker, M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Set in a sombre 19th century village, the dialogue is ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious. (eg: in this town you'd say ""It is with your person that I must converse"" instead of ""I need to speak with you"" etc.) All the clichés are there in the open, from the village retard to the mysterious blind girl (who incidentally can walk and run faster and straighter than anyone else and always seems to knows who's in the room with her, etc.).<br/><br/>Once you get past everyone trudging around the grimy little town speaking their ridiculous, badly scripted lines, you then sit and wait for the scary moments. And you wait. And you wait.<br/><br/>Oh, and yes. This being a Shyamalan film, you're guaranteed of two things: <br/><br/>1. Shyamalan will make a cameo appearance. And once again, his acting skills will prove to be utterly horrific. <br/><br/>2. Yes, there will be a twist. <br/><br/>At first, I was impressed with the twist. But when it's over, you end up feeling really cheated. Like you were dragged through the mud for nothing.<br/><br/>This film aims for a spooky, chilling feel. And it could have been so much more.

"soymilk","5","0","1","16 February 2005"," A decent story, just badly told
","I suppose it would seem like jumping on the anti-Shyamalan bandwagon if I started by asserting just how thin his whole 'chilling tale with a major twist at the end' routine is wearing. Either way, I'm going to have to agree. It's wearing incredibly thin, so much so that even 'the Village' seems to exhibit signs of self-awareness that whatever shocking big surprise Shyamalan may have up his sleeve on this occasion is all his viewers really came here to see. By now, a twist's to be expected with his films, so that novelty's pretty much done with, and 'the Village' doesn't even try to kid us on that one. It knows full well that we know full well that it's working it's way up to a surprise of some form or other, and tries, unsuccessfully, to stay one step ahead of us by using our expectations to its advantage. And trusting that self-conscious instinct is the single worst mistake this movie makes - its top priority soon becomes to keep on reversing our assumptions as much as possible over whatever form this particular bombshell will take, at the expense of just about everything else needed to bring it together as a movie. All 'the Village' really does is present us with a scenario and suggest so many different possibilities that the whole thing soon spirals into more of an elaborate guessing game than anything else - the story and rather insipid cast of characters are little more than ciphers to this scenario, and it almost willingly sacrifices its chances of being taken seriously as a film very early on in the run.<br/><br/>I don't know about everyone else, but the moment I personally stopped taking 'the Village' seriously was when they suddenly decided to break the eerie tension and give us glimpse of one these things that the villagers themselves 'do not speak of'. Up until then, the ways in which it built up angst in the earlier scenes could actually be very absorbing (also terribly clichéd at times too - red is the 'bad colour'? sigh...). So long as the threatening forces go unseen, we have no idea what the villagers are really dealing with any more than they seemingly do. We share their uncertainty, are kept in the dark as much as they are, which gives us a deeper connection with the characters and makes it all the more effective. Then when one of these monsters actually loams into view, with the villagers all fleeing in terror from it, I honestly couldn't bring myself to view it as anything more than a man dressed up in a silly costume. And, low and behold - a little later on in the film we discover that it really is, in fact, a man dressed up in a silly costume, but by that point the potential chills were long since dead, and the revelation came more as whimsical irony than anything too shocking.<br/><br/>It's from then on that the pacing becomes tiring and off-putting, the diversions feel forced and the screenplay's attempts to frighten us, in context with everything else, seem strangely awkward. To be fair, I didn't actually manage to guess the final revelation, no matter how obvious everyone else tells me it was, so it still came as quite a pleasant little surprise, but the previous 100 minutes or so's worth of build-up was far too lightweight for it to have any proper punch. Characterisation is second banana to these plot devices, which doesn't help things - the residents of this village are generally bland and underdeveloped, and only detract from whatever rewatch-ability value the film might have had. It's particularly strange that the script never really attempts to explain why Noah, the mentally backward kid, should turn into such a malevolent rebel - they just seem to assume that his drooling, laughing at inappropriate moments and stereotypically bad social skills will be explanation enough, which it isn't.<br/><br/>The irony is, through such a vicious onslaught of flaws, 'the Village' does glow with potential, and I have a feeling that if he wasn't so caught up in trying to surprise us and gave those merits a little more elbow-room, Shyamalan might finally have had something on his hands to have rivalled 'the Sixth Sense'. The direction itself shows a lot of flair and promise, the basic storyline is haunting, quirky and intriguing enough to hold the viewer's attention throughout, and, above everything, it does manage to touch upon some potentially very powerful moral issues regarding human nature. As the narrative questions, just how much of our innocence have we really lost in our modern times, when things like hatred and violence have existed all throughout history? This just cries out to be the true focus of the movie and, if it were so, then 'the Village' might have ended up with a lot more depth and meaning than the end result. Too bad then that Shyamalan isn't nearly as interested in the social implications of his film as he is in playing that damned game of 'Guess the Twist Ending'.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","(Many spoilers) I just watched The Village two days ago, with my friend who had already seen it in theaters months before. Even though she told me every secret of the movie before we even started watching it, I was still hoping it would be a little bit interesting. Within the first five minutes of the movie I was already picking apart every little fault, because that's just how horrible it was. The actors were ones no one had ever heard of. My theory was that the crew members working the cameras were given a few lines here and there to say in the movie, which was why you would notice the cameras slowly turning away from the actual scene... because no one was holding them. At times I would see crew members with scripts walking around int he background, and I even noticed one of the light guys standing behind a pole. The plot was interesting, up until you found out it was a bunch of old guys dressed in costumes running around yelling to scare kids. And the blind woman (Ivy)? ""I can see colors, but I'm blind. Oh no! I can't see his color daddy!"" Then they killed the only character that was making the movie interesting, being Noah. Oh, and how did Ivy know where that trap was when she made Noah fall into it? Thought she was blind? It truly was the worst movie of 2004."

","M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted filmmaker who knows how to visually present characters and background. But, as in his previous efforts, he is a poor story teller. At the heart of all his films has been one simple idea - an idea that will always have you asking yourself afterwards - is that all there is? His films are more like episodes of Twilignt Zone; predictable and more suitable for a 25 minute telefilm format. 'The Village' is a beautifully photographed film and well acted but the heart of the story is obvious and you find yourself impatiently waiting for more than an hour to confirm your suspicions if you had not guessed it already from the previews. Or perhaps you recognized the plot line from at least 2 children's books published during the last decade, 'Sang Spell' by Phyllis Reynold's Naylor and 'Running Out of Time' by Margaret Peterson Haddix. In any case, 'The Village' is a disappointment with enough logic plot holes to drive a ... er... plow through. M. Night has a great visual sense. I think he needs to stop doing it all himself and let someone else either write, produce, or direct, while he takes on just one film role. He is not ready to do it all by himself."

"Gafke","10","0","1","5 February 2005"," Shyamalan meets the Brothers Grimm
","This is my favorite film by M. Night Shyamalan, so far.<br/><br/>In an isolated valley somewhere in rural Pennsylvania is a village. Life is simple and the villagers are content...for the most part. Bordering the valley on all sides are the woods, where no one may enter, for it is said that Those We Do Not Speak Of dwell within these woods, and will kill anyone who dares cross over the border. However, when young Lucius Hunt is seriously injured by a disturbed young man, his devoted betrothed Ivy Walker insist that she be allowed to go through the woods and to the towns beyond, where medicines can be purchased for Lucius. However, there are some serious problems to consider. Ivy is blind, the towns are vicious, violent places where no one is safe, and Those We Do Not Speak Of must be considered as well. If Ivy wants to save Lucius, she must learn some of the truths behind The Village, a place founded by her father for the sole purpose of creating a sanctuary for those who have suffered losses in the distant towns.<br/><br/>A lot of people felt ripped off by this film, which turns out to have nothing to do with either horror, monsters or aliens as was the case with Shyamalan's other films. But I was expecting the dramatic final twist, because that is Shyamalan's trademark, and so I was not disappointed when it was revealed. <br/><br/>The Village is a love story set against a Grimms Brothers backdrop. It is very much a fairy tale, complete with true love, rumors of frightening beasts, superstition and brave quests. It is also a story of hope and desperation, and though the village elders perhaps have not made the best decisions, they have made them for the right reasons. <br/><br/>The Village is also a very beautiful film, filled with misty nights, dark woods and green fields. The effect is very calming. The village becomes a place where you wouldn't mind going yourself, and it is this atmosphere of peace and beauty that make the scares all the more effective. <br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is at his best here as the quiet Lucius, a serious young man with a strong streak of compassion. Bryce Dallas Howard is amazing in her first big role, playing the blind Ivy. She is lovely and strong and totally believable. There isn't a single person in this film who does not deliver their very best performance. William Hurt as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver as Lucius's mother, Adrian Brody as the simple minded Noah, Brendan Gleeson, all are wonderful. <br/><br/>If you like old fashioned fairy tales filled with darkness, innocence and love, you'll want to see The Village."

Sure, it has the trademark Shyamalan ""twist"" ending, but even without that aspect of the movie, something very special was created when ""The Village"" was filmed.<br/><br/>If I were to recommend that anyone watch this film in any particular way, I would suggest that they completely forget about the director and his penchant for surprise endings and other filming gimmicks, and instead focus on the characters, dialog, and society being portrayed in The Village. Doing so might prove to be very interesting and possibly quite thought provoking.<br/><br/>Several stereotypes are assumed by the viewer when they see the setting of the film - due to the 1890's setting and how we view the era in our modern time. However, watch closely and listen to what the people actually say - and how they interact with each other. You will suddenly realize that the preconceived stereotypes of the 1800's you might have are hollow, and that this is a distinctly different society from our modern notions of frontier American life. Many of the social interactions and ways of speaking with each other, as well as non-religious overtones of the society being portrayed wind up being distinctly ""out of place"" with the period and intriguingly interesting to view. Within the first 20 or 30 minutes, you know that this is a separatist group that is distinctly different from the rest of 1800's civilization, as the differences and anomalies begin to pile up. Absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is Shyamalan's finest work, with far more depth than any of his previous films (yes - even The Sixth Sense...). The astonishing way in which he has made the village ""come to life"" and take on a coherent yet unusual social ""flavor"" is nothing short of utter brilliance... my bowler hat off to Mr. Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Best wishes, Bawko"

","This movie was interesting....you come in thinking its a horror/thriller, but in reality its more a mystery/character study. The reason I gave it a 5, is because of the plot holes. That, and it was a tad boring....there were some sections that just seemed to drag on....but the best part of this movie is the atmosphere that is provided by the pennsilvania backdrop. the fog, grass, woods etc. made it very relaxing....acting was great too. The young girl, who plays a blind woman is superb. Joquin Pheonix is good as well. There were all stage actors, and it shows. This movie could be a play...a lot of dialogue, but worth seeing if you like different movies. There are some surpises, but unfortunately for me , the plot holes that lead to the surprise annoyed me enough to submit a 5. enjoy!"

","As atmospheric thrillers go, M. Night Shyamalan's ""TheVillage"" is decidedly of the ho-hum variety. In fact, it actually is one of the more annoying films  among those that have a certain pedigree, some hint of promise  of 2004.<br/><br/>Set in 1897 Pennsylvania, we are transported to a time and place of such improbable existence that we are forthwith un-amused by the setting. We learn that the community is isolated to a degree particularly unfathomable as close to the turn of the century as is depicted. The East had been long crisscrossed with roads and commerce; no community in Pennsylvania (perhaps in other parts of Appalachia this may have been the case) was so remote. But for the sake of the film, let's consider that they are that isolated.<br/><br/>What comes to pass is that the town-folk have established a sort of truce with the horrifically-depicted denizens of the surrounding forest. A veritable wall has been built to demarcate the limits of the community; anything outside the line is certainly out-of-bounds. And the Elders have certainly taken great pains to point out that, basically, this is our turf and that is theirs, and as long as we respect that we are alright.<br/><br/>And right here we have to say the most engaging character of the entire film is William Hurt (as Edward Walker, it seems the Senior Elder). He really does capture a soft-spoken self, offers some calm in the storm that the village confronts and seems the only logical one through all the film. What message might be gleaned is channeled through Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy Walker).<br/><br/>The movie really is about those inside confronting the outside world. A swirl of events necessitates this. Rated an incredibly generous 6.5/10 on IMDb and a more appropriate 44% on the Tomatometer, M. Night Shyamalan himself notes in an interview (http://www.cinemaconfidential.com/news.php?id=0407301) that ""I wanted to write a romance, a period romance. I wanted to go back to the1890s where people believed in love. It was hard to write because I had to remove all my sarcasm out of my writing. Today when we say things sarcasm is always there. In that era, when someone said, ""I like you"" it meant they liked you."" And therein lies the problem with ""The Village""  the writer has fallen for the always popular but wrong-headed notion that things were better in the old days. Hokum.<br/><br/>But you would have to watch it for yourself to determine if any of this is plausible; this is not really a film that had to be made. ""The Village"" is sort of Benchley's 1980 ""The Island"" meets Scooby-Doo meets Stephen King. And if any of that attracts your attention, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>Rating: Two Stars."

","The Village was immensely disappointing on many levels for me. Shamalayan does a decent job with the camera. I can't fault his work with the camera too much, but the story he used for this film is anything BUT mysterious. I mean the ending is wildly predictable if you have a brain. Think about it...could there have been any other resolution. No. And so...I knew the ""big"" secret way too early. The film had no punch for me at all. But that aside, the pacing for this film was real slow. Virtually nothing happens in this village. I know the village people(no cop or construction worker here) were meant to seem Amish-like, but something a little more ""meaty"" could have happened. The music gave you a warning that something interesting was going to happen with a thunderous boom...only to see something like a shadow in the grass. The acting isn't bad. It is pretty decent with Ron Howard's daughter Bryce doing a pretty good job in the lead. Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and William Hurt all do workmanlike jobs. Joaquin Phoenix was unimpressive and Adrian Brody as the village idiot was not terribly believable. But like the film...their performances really go nowhere. I will not discuss the plot in any great detail, because the slightest detail given and the ""gig"" is up. All I remember saying after the film was something to the effect that I was very glad I did not pay $7.50 to see this film. The idea the film has, if it had been handled differently, might have been the catalyst for a real good story about...well, I cannot say. But it could have been better. you must take my word."
"barnfife-1","4","0","1","30 January 2005"," A great concept poorly executed
","Having read several reviews of the movie (none of which contained spoilers) before actually seeing it, my expectations were minimal. I decided to watch the movie without reference to the director's previous films so I could simply take it for what it was. Even then, however, I was not particularly impressed. <br/><br/>The concept was clever and interesting, but I don't think M. Night made the best of it. Most of the characters were not very well developed, so I didn't feel much connection with them, and the editing was uneven, as if scenes that would have created greater continuity had been cut out. This left me feeling somewhat annoyed and confused, not by the mystery contained in the story, because that was easy enough to figure out fairly early on, but by the manner in which it was executed.<br/><br/>The cast, of course, was very impressive. Most of the actors are top notch, but none of them -- with the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who played Ivy, the blind girl who was in love with Lucius (Jacquin Phoenix) -- was given enough room to make much of an impact. On top of that, Phoenix looked and felt out of place as Ivy's love interest. In my opinion, he just didn't do a very good job of acting. <br/><br/>Howard, on the other hand, did a fairly good job. The problem with her character was that she was given too much screen time. I understand that Ivy was the central character in the story, but the many scenes of her professing her undying love for Lucius were way too melodramatic and over the top for me. The biggest problem with her character, however, was that in way too many scenes she did not at all look or behave like a blind woman. In this respect, the most unbelievable scene was toward the end, when she was running through the woods to escape the ""monster"" that was pursuing her. I ask you, how can a blind person run through thick woods without once running into a tree or branch? It defies all logic and destroys the believability of the scene. <br/><br/>In sum, the idea behind the movie was compelling, but the director did a poor job of carrying it out. It seems to me that the concept would have been better executed within the confines of half-hour or an hour-long TV episode such as The Twilight Zone. Rod Serling would have skipped the corny dialogue and meandering plot and stuck to the essentials. Sometimes less is more."
"skscott_1","8","0","1","30 January 2005"," Worth a Second Look.
","This movie is definitely worth a second look. It is of a rare breed of films that are vastly better to view the second time around, when all the expectations, hype and surprise of the film are relieved. If the author/director of this film was unknown and no misleading trailer was ever shown, I believe that this would have been rated much higher based on the merits of the film and story itself. This is a well-written, well-acted piece of theater that is best viewed without a preconceived notion of the adventure or outcome.<br/><br/>Upon first viewing, the movie simply did not live up to my expectations. I remember coming out of the theater feeling disappointed at this movie, and rightfully so. It did not live up to expectations of a Sixth-Sense revelation to be sprung on the viewer somewhere close to the end, and upon learning from the trailers that M. Night Shyamalan was doing horror, I was expecting some jaw-tightening tension that was not supported by the viewing.<br/><br/>However, upon seeing this film a second time, the depth of the story, the superior acting and the colorful photography stands out as remarkable."

","This movie was the best one I have seen in years! I usually sit through movies (even really good ones) and end up stating at some point ""That could have been done a little better."" There was not one point throughout this movie that I thought this and I went into it prepared for a scary or bizarre movie.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch the ""deleted scenes"" I usually find at least one that I believe would have added so much to the movie. However, even in this area I ended up nodding my head at the accuracy of his thoughts as to why they were deleted. This includes the final woods scene that I thought had a LOT going for it. He was absolutely on the mark to exclude it when it came to the tone already set by the previous scenes.<br/><br/>I rarely purchase videos or DVDs but this is a MUST for my tiny collection!"
"elenamjones","6","0","1","27 January 2005"," One problem I noticed...(small spoilers)
","I thought this movie was okay, I like movies that make you think, but I noticed a contradiction in the movie. Although they had no contact with the world they had everything they needed to get by in the village. For instance their clothes. Where did all the people in the village get there clothes through the years. They didn't look equipped from what we saw in the film to produce so ,much material. Flour too, I never saw any fields of wheat or a miilery to grind the flour. These are just two very basic things that they seemed to have plenty of without adequate explanation. All the other luxuries like lamps and dishes for example I would assume they are limited to what the first 'settlers' brought with them but in time stuff like that gets broken, or families grow and you need more of them. This would be a problem eventually. Anyway, if anyone can explain the cloth and the flour I'd be grateful."
"ffolkes-4","10","0","1","27 January 2005"," This movie was never given the credit it deserved.
","While in my opinion the acting at times did seem slightly ""strained"", the costume and set design, sound mixing, as well as the overall cinematography were absolutely stunning. With a decent sound system turned up and the lights off, I truly felt as if I were in ""The Village."" This movie gave your mind a sensory mouthful, without the need for any digital effects or fancy action.<br/><br/>If you liked this movie, I recommend you try another M. Night Shyamalan film, ""Signs."" Both movies had a very similar feel, but the selective use of color in ""The Village"" brought it to another level in my opinion.<br/><br/>Rent/buy ""The Village"", make a cup of tea, turn your sound system up to a decent level and press Play. Your senses will become overwhelmed by every delicate snapping twig, every occasional vibrant streak of color, and last not definitely not least, the beautiful score by James Newton Howard."
"GroggyLane","7","0","1","27 January 2005"," Not bad... but sadly, not great..
","It's hard to put a finger on why this film was beaten up so badly. It was actually fairly enjoyable in many ways. The acting was good. The idea was great. The only thing I can think of wrong with this movie was Lucius. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with the role he was cast in, but there was something not quite right about that character. Lucius was a little too creepy. I wasn't buying the idea that the cute young girl was digging him in the beginning. It just didn't add up. It's disappointing when a movie with such potential falls short. I believe that a more charismatic personality, or at least some personality on the Lucius character would have made all the difference in allowing the audience that most basic necessity.. Suspention of disbelief!"
"quantumcat","8","0","1","27 January 2005"," Not the bad movie people make it out to be, but I can understand why they are disappointed
","there may be spoilers up ahead, but I'll try to steer away from them:<br/><br/>I am one of those that appreciate ""the village"" When I started to watch the movie I'd expected a see a second ""Signs"" (which was by it's ridiculous ""man-in-a-suit"" ending a bit disappointing after the tension had been so brilliantly built up)<br/><br/>What I noticed right away was the beautiful cinematography which excels in subtlety. The same can be said about the acting. Greatly scored as well.<br/><br/>Again it had subtle and brilliant built up of tension. Shymalan's trademark. Was it to be a standard Shymalan movie *****sort-of-spoiler:*****<br/><br/>Then at a third of the movie it had a man in a suit moment<br/><br/>Because of the acting, the cinematography I decided to continue watching. Shymalan takes a lot of time introducing his characters, which makes them 3D persons and give the actors the chance to give it their best. It also makes you -the viewer- want to see what happens to them next.<br/><br/>Then the creatures show up again -again my man-in-a-suit-fear became true, was this to be the real horror of this movie?<br/><br/>I felt disappointed -this is not the horror thriller I thought it was.<br/><br/>But then there was this moment -all but silence save the score...""Howard holds out her hand while the creature runs towards her, and Phoenix grabs it and they go foe the trapdoor to the cellar almost like a couple of ballerina's -reminescent of Chinese movies like ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""House of the Flying Daggers""<br/><br/>In all the events following it started to dawn: this movie isn't the horror-thriller I'd expected but a well played =well directed -well scored -well written drama-thriller.<br/><br/>So the more plot becomes clear the more you understand this transformation from apparently horror to psycho-drama-thriller. Though I felt the clue was not entirely unexpected and a bit unbelievable, I was fascinated.<br/><br/>It is in my opinion people think it a bad movie since they expected a horror-thriller and got a psychological-drama-thriller.<br/><br/>So all-in-all I think it's a great movie that disappoints due to expectations that were falsely raised by a misleading PR campaign.<br/><br/>So if you watch this movie with either NO expectations or with the knowledge it's a psychological-thriller-drama you're in for a wonderfully cinematographically styled , ingeniously scored and brilliantly acted show!<br/><br/>Have fun!"

","It is hard to top Isaac's review as he sums it up so well. But from a woman's point of view....<br/><br/>The psychological part of the thriller is wonderful and teasing and even better the second time when a whole new set of shivers go down your spine.<br/><br/>I loved the hints throughout at the background behind the village.<br/><br/>Most of all, I loved the romance. It wasn't blatant, but rather small nuances that brought a pause to your breathing. When Lucius grasps Ivy's hand for the first time, the close up of their hands still brings a tear to my eye. It is all you see but a million things go unsaid in that brief moment, even as fear fills you at the same time.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix can convey more emotion with a single movement than we have seen in many years in an actor or actress. He grows stronger in each role and I only stand in wonder as to what he will do next. I believe he will become one of the greats of our era.<br/><br/>My only regret is not catching this in the theater. I believe the big screen experience would have brought me to screams and tears as this director does each time. As a friend summed it up so well.... ""It is not what you think it is. See it"""

He continues to show what a great actor he is, in The Village. I'm always pleased to see William Hurt. He is a fine actor. The story is a real Night story of course. There is a twist to the story like in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense. You might think this is a horror/thriller movie. But the accurate genre is drama. Yes, the storyline involves creatures living in the forest, and religious like signs painted on doors. But the story is about law and order. We all have laws and rules to guide us in our lives. But who defined these rules and laws, and what happens when we have to break/bend them for the good of 1 person or an entire village."

"kevcowiffle","3","0","2","24 January 2005"," A good director writes a bad movie
","M. Night has made some of the most memorable movies of the past few years, and whether he likes it or not, he is known for his trademark twist. Starting off, ""The Village"" has a lot of potential. It is eerily set in the back woods of Pennsylvania, and the setting alone feeds on the memories we all have of being scared of the woods at night. But this setting cannot carry the movie by itself, and we are left with a sub-par movie on a number of levels.<br/><br/>His first flaw is in the characters. While they are likable, we do not see them enough to get a feel for them. When Luscious is stabbed, we do not know him well enough to feel very bad for him. Ivy, though the foremost character, is never really developed, and we don't get to know her as well as one should know their main character. The dialog is perhaps the worst part of the movie. It is extremely dry, dull, and often drags on for too long. Their old style of speaking often comes off as forced and unrealistic. The plot even seems sluggish, and after an hour of movie you realize only a few events have taken place.<br/><br/>But the worst part of this film is the highly anticipated ending. We have come to expect something wonderful from M. Night's endings. Audiences go to his movies expecting to leave satisfied, and the 'twist' of The Village is extremely disappointing. It almost seems like a cop-out. Even if I had enjoyed different parts of the film, the ending left such a bad taste in my mouth that I wanted and hour and a half of my life back. Hopefully his next effort with be little more worthy than this one."

","I have enjoyed all major releases from this director starting with the 'Sixth Sense' and this film is no exception. It is beautifully shot, the cinematography and camera-work are superb. The pace is excellent with just the hints of unusual at the beginning of the movie, tension and suspense rising steadily throughout, building up to the climax and resolution. The cast is perfectly matched to the roles - William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are perfect for their characters and deliver great performances. Bryce Dallas Howard is mesmerizing at times. The dialog is tight with very little out of place and so is the plot. Everything in the beginning has a meaning later on in the film. This is a film that deals first and foremost with people and human condition and it is cinematographically rich and beautiful experience. For this reason I preferred it much more to 'Sixth Sense' for instance, which follows a more conventional format. I have heard mixed reviews of this movie and a lot of complaints were with the twist at the end. Maybe you'll like the twist maybe not but it is a compelling watch just getting there and it is well worth the time."

I wasn't too huge a fan of the director before this...I now bow in respect. The acting is beyond amazing. I was unaware before viewing that Weaver and Brody were members of the cast.

"fightingamish00","3","0","3","21 January 2005"," By far the worst Shyamalan Movie ever!!!!
","I'm a huge fan of Shyamalan's movies for several reasons: 1) There is normally a twist that no one can figure out and if they claim to have it figured out they are lying 2) There is always a ""creepy"" element 3) His wonderful visual and sound effects 4) Normally a great script with good pace and great acting After seeing this movie, it's hard not to see that he failed miserably in the first 2 categories and really only got half of the 3rd category complete (the visual was magnificent but the sound effects are barely noticeable). The 4th category he only had some great acting performances (Brody, Howard and Phoenix) but the rest of the cast was average at best and the script and pace was terrible!!!! I couldn't believe that this was a movie from the same guy who made 6th Sense and Signs.<br/><br/>So where do I begin? First of all, I actually figured this one out halfway through the movie. Maybe it's b/c I've seen his movies and I knew there would be a twist, but really, you should be ashamed if you couldn't figure this one out after William Hurt shows Howard the Hidden Shack. I'm easily fooled by these things and if I could figure this out, well I gotta believe over half the people that saw this can figure it out halfway through.<br/><br/>Next, there was no ""creepy"" factor in this at all!!!! At no point was I scared or freaked out. The pace of the movie is too slow and the story just takes too long to develop. Which is maybe why I was able to figure this out; I wasn't creeped out or into the movie so I had time to figure out what the big twist was.<br/><br/>As I said before there was some good visual elements to this movie but the sound effects here were barely noticeable. I don't ever remember feeling intensely creeped out at any point and I believe his lack of using good sound effects (e.g. his use of the Wind Chimes in Signs) was the reason. And once again, the slow pace of the movie didn't help along with the fact that there are some uncharacteristically stupid moments throughout the movie (e.g. Why does Brody's character put on the costume when he knows Howard is blind?).<br/><br/>As a person who doesn't really like scary movies, I became a fan of Shyamalan's b/c most of his movies creep you out in original and unusual ways unlike most scary movies. Now I realize, his movies aren't worth a crap if you aren't freaked out, and this movie isn't worth a crap. Sorry, go see one of his other films if you want to be scared.

","After watching the trailer and read the reviews I got the idea that The village was supposed to be this spooky horror movie. Unlike this bimbo run around screaming movies, since I kinda liked Signs and it was the director of signs and everything. Although in the beginning of the film you really get spooked and you start to question yourself, what is in those woods? And you yourself get to use your own imagination which makes it scary. And at that point thats were you get excited and wanna continue watching the movie. But after a while the movie kinda tend to become somewhat more like a drama with personal conflicts and tragedy. So that kinda wears off all the excitement and horror. So if your looking for a spooky horror movie to see I woulden't recommend you to watch The village. But are you you after a surprising movie with an unpredictable twist this is most surly your movie."
"dcobbimdb","3","0","4","14 January 2005"," Okay movie, but the worst of his lot IMO
","Seems like all of Shyamalan's movies tend to start off slow and build until the plot thickens as much as it can before revealing some earth shattering ending. This one was similar in many ways, the acting was good, and the cinema photography was good, the story was so so IMO. However this movie lacked something for me. Yes it was a slow developing & unwinding story (similar to his previous movies), but I guess I just failed to find enough interest in the plot and the characters as well because of that.<br/><br/>Slight Spoilers ahead I found this movie more strange than entertaining. From the first few minutes you know something just isn't right with this town and you think you're watching some Star Trek episode about a pre warp civilization. And then comes the monster talk, the fear these villagers have of them, and the ambiance surrounding them. While it was semi intriguing, I started to loose interest when I found out certain things about the creatures and the main guy meets with an unfortunate circumstance. I didn't yet unravel the reason for much of this, but obviously I knew something was very odd. At this point I keep watching, semi interested in what's going to happen to the girl. I'm glad she killed the village idiot (too much jean mixing I guess) as he was just annoying. Then she finally reaches her destination and the whole plot twist comes spewing out like a drunk on new years eve. At this point I'm really loosing interest and saying to myself ""UmÂ… this is it???"" The fire works I was expecting had been a few sparklers instead. Snap crackle and pop and then nothing. I started off with little interest, then it built up, then just when it was supposed to keep climbing as is my previous experiences with Shyamalan's movies have been, it started dropping off. Not because I couldn't believe what was unfolding or the possibility of it, I just found it stupid and a let down. Kind of like going on a treasure hunt only to find a secret decoder ring. It was at this point where I said, ""Man I watched this thing for 90 minutes just to find out this!?!!<br/><br/>Clearly his worst film that I have seen. Either he's running out of original stories with cool twist endings, or I missed the boat on this one. That being said I wouldn't say it was horrible, and had I only watched the first half of it I might have better things to say about it, but the ending was a big let down for me and pretty much spoiled things leaving a bad taste in my mouth. If you are fans of his other movies, give it a try (when there's nothing better to rent), you might really like it. Then again you might see it like I did."

How many times is said place really as frightening as those who forbid it claim that it is? I admit, that's probably more of a 50/50 chance. How many times is the ending supposed to be a total surprise, and yet is actually totally predictable? Again, probably it is a 50/50. In this case, The Village failed. The ending was very much a predictable outcome: the monsters didn't exist, they were simply a myth. The village is simply a community of those living where the outside world can't reach them, as they are sick of it. The signs, of course, were there along the way: going through the woods for medicines, the group of adults that are hiding something, etc. It's all there, and it's too predictable.

","M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most over-rated directors in Hollywood right now. Not only is he getting paid very good money to make his movies, he more or less makes the same movie again and again. And I for one am getting tired of it.<br/><br/>The Village centers around a lonely little Village in the middle of a forest. Around their village they have a fence that marks the border that no one may pass. There are beings in the woods that will take anyone that crosses the border and exact vengeance on the village for the trespassing. But when something horrible happens, what will they do? Will they dare venture for help? As most of Shyamalans films ""The Village"" starts out fine. He is adept at creating a mysterious and haunting mood and it works here. For a while at least. Because soon the constant speaking in riddles and constant mentioning of ""those we do not speak of"" becomes annoying. Also the pace is terrible. The movie moves onward at a slow crawl and never really picks up pace before the end. Acting is mostly decent but no character really stands out as very interesting.<br/><br/>But ultimately where this movie fails is the script-writing. I think it's time for Shyamalan to stay away from writing for a while, to get some new ideas. Because the formula of ""Movie that drags on forever with a twist in the end"" is becoming more and more dated. And even more trouble when i could see the plot-twist coming a mile away. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a decent thriller, ""Unbreakable"" was excellent. But since then Shyamalan has been going downhill. Which unfortunately makes this a waste of talent and money as well as my time.<br/><br/>I rate it 3/10."

They were referred to practically every minute and showed up, what, two times? This is not to say the village should have been under constant attack, but it made it seem as though there was no enemy. Children play, people get married, it's all very ho hum except for the town gathering and climactic scenes.<br/><br/>Brody's portrayal of the mentally challenged character is passable. I do like how he is tied in to the main story thread at the end. Phoenix also is passable. His portrayal is fine, there's just not much there. It really feels like Night threw this script together quickly.<br/><br/>But there are signs (pardon the pun) of what is to come all throughout this film. It makes the big ""twist ending"" a colossal letdown. And to those who savor this movie for its ""artful exploration of the human mind"" and whatever, that's fine for about 1% of the population.

In the first place I can't understand how can this guy repeat the same argument every time he makes a movie, and some people still don't argue about it. Watching his movies makes me remember Disney films... those that started always exactly the same way (someone dying/losing his parents/any other type of tragedy), with the exact same character profiles (one that's the main character, another following him all the time who is kind of stupid, and many 'nice' characters which are founded on the main character's journey) and of course, the exact same end (besides the antagonist's defeat, the film comes back to the beginning but now the characters have all learned different lessons, which lets you know the story couldn't repeat itself... there is always a sign of hope at the end of Disney movies). Well I think this kind of scripts are acceptable if the public is a 7 year old, which is Disney's target, but I'm afraid not Shyamalan's. Besides the final surprise, the movie has horrible performances, a pathetic script and horrible aesthetic. It seems like his only objective is saying ""jaja, got you!"" at the end of the movie. However I must admit it's a great business strategic. As many of you know, the end of a movie is what gives you the final (and most important) impression of it, and this is shyamalan's only archievement.

","I went all alone yesterday to the movie theatre to watch The Village. I must say that I was drawn by the all star cast and the aesthetically beautiful movie poster. I haven't liked Signs though, I thought it was boiled eggs. To be objective I consider Shyamalan a conceptual director meaning that he has very interesting themes. He's a master in portraying these themes in terms of motifs and symbols visually and verbally throughout the film, but he has two problems with his screen writing techniques and that's due to NOT setting priorities. When I watch his film, I sense at times that he's a very commercial director who plays with sudden/sleazy sound effects just for the thrills, but at other times I see interesting personal themes portrayed. You can't gain both audiences, Shyamalan: the majority and the minority. Honestly, he succeeded in doing so, but he has a potential of being an artistic writer, why care for the bucks? You had them already. To emphasize, he doesn't set the world of the film. Is this film about plot? Character? or Theme? I noticed that plot and theme were fighting, and character was vanishing throughout. As a director, I don't think of him very highly. I think some scenes are like boiled eggs: the use of long useless shots and uninteresting decoupage.<br/><br/>To summarize, he's a potential screenwriter with very interesting personal themes who has to set his priorities.

","In order to keep this short I'll skip the introduction i.e. the synopsis. By now everybody knows the premise, so I'll feel free to just cut to the chase, my thoughts of ""the Village"". Problems with the movie are, as follows: 1) Definitely overlong. Pretty much nothing (scary, that is) happens the first hour through. Who needs an hour long introduction anyway? Maybe M.Night felt forced to 'give everybody room' after he realized that he's got 'too big a cast' - even the town crazy is played by a fresh Academy Award (tm) winner. OR, maybe M.Night realized that this time his (tm) Big Surprise At the End can be guessed too easily on and tried to ""play time"" or divert the viewer from guessing. If that's the case, he failed. 2) The overall feeling is so heavy (not to mention that first half is slllloooowwwww) it almost suffocates the whole movie. Where's the humour? 3) Casting is odd. 4) Music grows annoying (if I hear so much as one more note played with a damn violin this year, I'm going to kill somebody!) <br/><br/>And the good sh*t, as follows. 1) The movie isn't ""bad"". It's ""odd"". 2) Original, if something. But not THAT interesting (at least after that first hour...) 3) Does deliver a reasonable amount of scares. 4) Well photographed. If you want to be a horror- director someday, you should check here how to make plain woods seem scary or use music to stage scenes.<br/><br/>I don't count the 'too easily guessable end surprise' as a demerit, since it shouldn't of have been the point here (good scares should be the point). But it's a pity the movie itself doesn't see it this way and instead uses too much of its potential trying to keep the surprise at the end. And failing in it.

And of course she is lend a helping hand by a nice wildlife guard""Kevin""! Who must be thinking that he just walked into a nutcase escaped from Gothika or something like that but helps her anyway. Its not a bad story nor a bad movie but it don't deliver its promise. the storyline keeps on dragging all the way to the end and then suddenly there is the twist and the plot..........what plot again????

","Well as I walked out of the cinema I wasn't even sure *what* I'd seen.

Bear that in mind before you see it, and I think you'll fare well. It's not a bad movie. It's got a very tight and flowing storyline. Very well written. Very well produced. I got quite wrapped up in it to be honest. The conclusion is very fast, and there seems to be an awful lot going on. I liked the way the director crammed all that in in the concluding parts, without making it seem *too* fast.<br/><br/>If you were going in ""cold"" - ie without knowing a THING about the movie, I think it would have quite an impact.

","First the good news: Bryce Howard is very good in her first starring role . Roger Deakins' photography continues to amaze (how he doesn't have an Oscar on his shelf is a shame).<br/><br/>The rest, I fear, is bad. Very bad. For if this weren't a major studio release by someone of Shyamalan's track record, this is straight-to-video stuff. Ridiculous, dull, pseudo-serious and a major cop-out.<br/><br/>The film would have failed under its own weight regardless, but it is becoming clear that Shyamalan has fallen into a trap of his own making with his now patented 'Twist Ending' mandate. A former master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, once stated that audiences were becoming so keen on spotting Hitchcock's portly figure in his cameos, that they were distracted from paying attention to the film (and therefore, Hitchcock made his appearances sooner and sooner to the start of the film).<br/><br/>And now, I fear, a similar thing is happening to Shyamalan's films. Audiences are so cued into the inevitable 'twist ending' that they are hunting for clues from the start of the film so they can maybe guess what it may be (Is Bryce Howard ""blind"" for a reason? Who was the first to spot the red plants? Why is Adrien Brody grinning all the time? It must all ""mean"" SOMETHING!). It stops the film dead in its tracks. Of course, if it weren't for the fact that the last 3 films' 'twists' all were fairly mundane doesn't help matters. But, the important point is that Shyamalan break away from this repetitious trap and make films that follow a plot and its characters straight to its conclusion - even a (shudder the thought) PREDICTABLE ending! Otherwise, Shyamalan may be in danger of becoming the William Castle of his generation (without Castle's sense of fun)."

"japamo","3","0","1","27 August 2004"," The Ultimate ""C'mon"" movie (Spoilers Below)
","To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think ""The Village"" was an inept melange of ""The Truman Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Prisoner"", and ""Scooby Doo"" (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the ""woods as labyrinthine hell"" metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyalaman's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated,inept and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyalaman should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell"" twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.<br/><br/>One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly pompous, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and ""Ivy, get down in the cellar already?""), the ""monsters"" shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but small compensation for this ""house of cards"" movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyalaman deliberately made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)<br/><br/>Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt ""C'mon"" responses:<br/><br/>1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?<br/><br/>2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.<br/><br/>3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?<br/><br/>4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!<br/><br/>5. To protect the ""idyllic"", ""pristine"" village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed inert.<br/><br/>6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.<br/><br/>7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, ""Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?"" Exactly.<br/><br/>If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a 3/10. Still, in its maladroit way, ""The Village"" stimulates thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!"

I feel that he made a good attempt, had a good story line, and then he just fell short, like he did with Unbreakable and Signs.<br/><br/>The movie started out well, showing us this small ""village"" of simple people content with living their simple lives. With a superb cast, I went in excited to see what this story had in store for us all. As most of his movies go, the story slowly starts to unfold itself. But unlike The Sixth Sense, or even Unbreakable, which i disliked, he gives away the ""surprise"" way too early in the film, leaving me to wonder why i should even care anymore. I already know what the big secret is, so am i supposed to care how it all turns out? It's just too bad that the editing was horrible.

After seeing all of the pre-release promotional pieces on ""The Village,"" I was geared up for another chapter in Shyamalan's book of suspense/horror short stories. I was very disappointed. The performances were bland at best with the exception of Ms. Howard in 3/4 of the film. I understand all of the underlying meanings and subtexts and all that...I always enjoy the thought processes invoked by his storytelling, but in this case, that ""slow creep"" I mentioned was more of a ""long drag!""

","Greetings again from the darkness.  We can always count on director M. Night Shyamalan for two things: a twist and a cameo.  Regretably, ""The Village"" has a much more interesting cameo than twist.  Similar to ""The Sixth Sense"", Night once again flashes his fetish for the color RED.  I must admit the best use of red in the movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's beautiful head of hair.  She has a very unique look, but does a wonderful job of carrying this film.  Shyamalan favorite Joaquin Phoenix (the artist formerly known as Leaf) does a decent job of playing the sensitive guy amongst a bunch of goofy self-imposed castaways.  However, this is no 3 hour tour gone awry. These idiots actually designed the village and the twist will leave you scratching your head as if to say both ""Why?"" and ""Is that it?"".  As usual, some nice camera work, but the dialogue borders on hoakey most of the time. Oscar winner Adrien Brody is downright creepy in his role and I am still not sure what to make of veterans William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  Anyway, not much of a thriller and at times comical, though not purposefully so. Great violin work throughout."

There were two scenes out of the whole movie that had suspense and made me jump a little that's it. I thought there would be more but there was none.

","(Spoilers, of course)<br/><br/>I haven't ""given-up"" on Shyamalan yet.  I really liked ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Unbreakable"" was a decent film too, if not as good as TSS.  ""Signs"" had some great scenes and moments of suspense, even if it had gaping plot holes (aliens killed by WATER???  The essential building block of all life in the universe???)<br/><br/>But ""The Village"" has almost nothing to offer. Besides a few eerie scenes, it can't be considered a ""horror film"" for very long.  And it has a ""big twist"" that, unlike ""6th Sense"" or ""Unbreakable,"" this time I saw coming.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a bizzarely timeless village.  It resembles a village in Colonial America in the 1600's, but then we see a tombstone that states it is the 1890's.  So what is the purpose then, of this outpost?  Why do they act more like colonial pilgrims than people from the turn of the century?  Nobody we meet has much of a defined role, and we know little about how these people live.  Nobody makes a very strong impression (although Adrien Brody really tries to, disappointingly bad after his outstanding performance in ""The Pianist"")<br/><br/>We learn early on about ""those we do not speak of,"" monsters whom the village is at war with, and get a brief glimpse of the creatures shortly afterward.  At about the half-way point we learn that we have been cheated out of the horror-film that we were expecting, and find that those monster-creatures are an illusion to keep the occupants of the village within its boundaries.  I understand that Shyamalan wants to shock us, but couldn't he at least do it by sticking to the same genre?  At that moment, I thought the ""big twist"" was abundantly clear; the adults speak of the ""outside world"" and talk about how important it is that their children not learn of it.  I also caught that the adults seem to drop their way of speaking at this point, too.  They have also mentioned the evils of money and wealth.<br/><br/>As young Ron Howard's daughter makes her way to the outside world, I kept waiting for her to come across a Pepsi-can, or some other hint that would give us the twist.  When it does come, surprise-surprise, with a jeep and a park ranger, some of the theatre was surprised. I expected it to come this way, so obviously I wasn't shocked.<br/><br/>When a writer is in his earliest stages of brainstorming, he often comes up with a concept that he likes.  After thinking more and more about it, he may come across plot-holes or other elements that convince him that the story is not worth writing, and that he should dump the idea and move on to other things.  Shyamalan should have dumped this idea in this stage, because it doesn't work--it's stupid!  When learning of these people's history, we are supposed to believe that this is their backstory for forming some timeless cult in the woods of Pennsylvania?  This idea is dumb and unbelieveable. Why couldn't they just join up with the Amish?  Each adult in the village has an explanation of why they are there, and none of them are genuine--they are all just weak excuses to pull a lame twist on the audience that we would never find believeable in the first place.<br/><br/>Grade: D-"

","I really enjoyed this movie, but that's not what I'm writing about. There seemed to me to be a gaping hole in the premise of this script that I couldn't get off my mind as the story unfolded. This movie portrays a mini-society that is supposed to be totally self-sufficient. People live in their little village, the limits of which are strictly defined. No one goes in, no goes out, and the rest of the world is left to itself. But did you notice this group's standard of living? It would have been a prosperous rural village by late 19th century standards, with quite a few creature comforts -- window glass, china, good fabrics, boots, even some nice architecture in the main building. All of this could be explained away as original to the establishment of the village, I guess, but when we come into the story, at least a generation has passed since that time. Things should have been looking a little threadbare. After all, dishes break, clothes wear out, and so forth. If the villagers had no contact whatsoever with the outside world, how would these things be replaced? Even more so, what about all the consumables these people had? With the facilities available in the village, the people wouldn't have been able to provide themselves with coffee, white flour, kerosene or many other goods we saw.<br/><br/>Has the incongruity of this occurred to anybody else?"

","Contains Spoilers I've just seen it... I have to say, this film has been aggressively over-hyped to the point where most people will walk out the cinema feeling they must have seen trailers for a different film.<br/><br/>M. Night again shows his now established pattern of diminishing returns here - his style of pacing that worked so wonderfully in Sixth Sense, reasonably well in Unbreakable and rather poorly in Signs here is one of the films cardinal flaws. Essentially it takes the film over an hour to actually get to the relevant part - where we discover that, surprise surprise, there are no monsters it was all a big trick.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to think that M. Night's (one should always get worried when a director becomes sufficiently egotistical to prefix a film with his own name) The Village - might as well be called, The Pseudo Amish. I waited the whole film for a buggy... I didn't see one and it would be worth pointing out that this anticipation is about all that kept my eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>One should appreciate that this is not a monster film - despite the advertising which makes you think it is. Really, it doesn't even have that much ""monster"" tension at the start. In fact, the first hour of the film doesn't really seem to achieve anything IMO - one doesn't really get that much of a feel for characters or the like, it's just sixty minutes of boredom... and then it's all explained more or less - then there's some more cheap thrills, the origin of the Village is revealed (if you didn't work it out, then you were either asleep or were thinking about whether giant porcupines would be a real danger.) and its over. I guess the twist at the end was - there was no twist.<br/><br/>Attempting to trick you into thinking the creatures are real when the blind girl is in the woods seems a bit foolish. As it's really not too hard to guess what it really is but that's about the only part of the film where there's any sense of danger or anything interesting going on. Not to mention that you have to question the insight of sending the blind girl to get the medicine - which seems like a pretty unfair choice, the guy saves his son-in-law while other people have died but that's brushed aside for more tedium.<br/><br/>This film is essentially a morality lecture about how our society is so evil, that people are driven to escape it by being a rip-off of the Amish people, enforced by the threat of fictitious monsters, all nicely ringed off and guarded from the outside world somehow. Quite why they didn't just go and join the real Amish or become Mormons or something is beyond me... it would probably have made a more interesting film but then, most things would have.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a monster film, a clever social commentary, something with a twist in the tale, or even a couple of hours entertainment - I humbly suggest you look elsewhere.<br/><br/>All in all, a pretty poor effort, in my opinion - 2 out of 5. Let's hope M. Night decides to quit/take a break/ get his act together before he lays another one on us."

There is not a single scary moment in this film,<br/><br/>absolutely nothing in the way of suspense, character development,<br/><br/>or an interesting plot in the first forty or so minutes of the film, until<br/><br/>a character's contrived serious injury requires the film's female<br/><br/>heroine, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard-director Ron's daughter), to<br/><br/>venture forth into `the towns' to find medicine, at which point the<br/><br/>Shyamalan Shocking Revelation is revealed, which unlike those in<br/><br/>Shyamalan's previous three films, resembles more a massive<br/><br/>scam than it does a plot twist, a scam perpetrated on both the<br/><br/>characters AND the audience, and if you didn't figure out until this <br/><br/>scene that Ivy's blindness was contrived to mesh with this<br/><br/>eventual plot twist, then perhaps you haven't been watching a lot of<br/><br/>Shyamalan films.  Or many films period. <br/><br/>Edward Walker (William Hurt) tells Lucius (Joaquim Phoenix) that<br/><br/>he is fearless in a way that he will never be.  Damn right, Edward. <br/><br/>Most people who suffer from grief eventually get over it.  You and<br/><br/>your fellow rejects, on the other hand, were so cowardly that rather<br/><br/>than face your pain, you not only retreated from society, but<br/><br/>decided to engineer a massive lie to your children to cover up the<br/><br/>truth, when you could very easily have retreated from society and<br/><br/>lived a simpler existence without making the kids believe that they<br/><br/>were living in a past century, complete with silly bogeyman<br/><br/>costumes, and your idiotic insistence on using antiquated<br/><br/>phrases in your speech like `fortnight.' <br/><br/>It is at the point of this `revelation' that the entire movie doesn't<br/><br/>seem at all like a journey in which insight is made in terms of<br/><br/>characters or themes, or the audience is treated to even a<br/><br/>plausible plot (Shyamalan explains that airspace is restricted over<br/><br/>the wildlife preserve in which the village is located, but doesn't<br/><br/>explain how that small group of founders transported all the<br/><br/>building materials necessary to build all those nice-looking<br/><br/>homes and town halls), but just one big practical joke; a pointless<br/><br/>exercise in how to maintain a color-by-numbers format that<br/><br/>Shyamalan seems to insist for all of his films, such as the<br/><br/>obligatory Pennsylvania setting, the use of the color red as a plot<br/><br/>harbinger (as it was in `The Sixth Sense'-in `Unbreakable' and<br/><br/>`Signs' it was water), and of course, Shyamalan's patented<br/><br/>Shoehorned-Into-The-Story appearance, which is thankfully kept to<br/><br/>a minimum, as it takes the form of mostly a voice and a minor<br/><br/>reflection in the glass door of a medicine cabinet.  Hey, Night! <br/><br/>Wanna come up with a new schtick?  It's getting kind of old, ya<br/><br/>know."

","Before I get started on my rant, I'd like to clarify that I love M. Night Shyamalan. I believe he is one of those raw talents who understands, loves, and excels in the art of film-making. I also believe that he is a true genius and adds genuine substance to his movies. The Village, however, I felt, I was a huge failure.<br/><br/>Naturally the cinematography was brilliant and the cast was great.<br/><br/>The acting direction is what suffered the worst, having amazing actors speaking terrible dialogue in very unnatural affectations.<br/><br/>Jake Brody had glimmers of greatness, but overall did not seem to fully understand his role and came off as hokey and unrealistic.<br/><br/>William Hurt played the worst role of his career, and sigourney weaver was absent from the entire film, even in the scenes she was in. The movie's strength, and basis, was its socio political implications, what seemed to me to be his interpretation of Plato's allegory of the cave, and how people choose to live in ignorance in preference to knowing the truth and risking the fear that goes along with it. On the political standpoint it is a metaphor for a society being manipulated through fear of attack, being forced into self censorship and seclusion. However, this was too blatant, and did not form into a cohesive film. I loved the village, save for the cheesy ending, and I think that Unbreakable is one of the most brilliant underrated films in recent history, and don't even get me started on The Sixth Sense. I could not, for the life of me, however recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in anything more than aesthetic virtuosity. Hopefully M. Night's next film will leave this one in the dust. 3/10"

The premise just seemed too unbelievable to make the movie enjoyable. Also, there were things that just were never explained but I won't go into detail so as not to be a spoiler. I loved The Sixth Sense and I even liked Signs but I definitely won't automatically assume other works by M. Night Shyamalan are as good as the previous.

","Before I decided to write about this movie I read what everyone else had to say about the movie. Let me start off by saying that I understand why some people are getting upset at the fact that lots of people are bashing this movie and saying that it is stupid, and has no plot because that is not true. However, the movie does not have a plot that would be visible to someone coming in to the movie expecting something totally different. But thats the problem, the previews to this movie had EVERYONE expecting something totally different. Nobody that saw the previews to this movie can deny that they went to the theater with the intentions on seeing a horror movie, and those people, including myself, were disappointed at the fact that we were actually viewing a movie that went a completely different direction. As someone else said about this movie earlier, maybe if I knew for a fact that M. Night was not attempting to have me jump 20 times during the movie or leave me with the fear of going to sleep that night, maybe i would have enjoyed the film a little more. BUT, because I expected to see a horror movie and did not get that, i was very disappointed. All I can say is that if you plan on seeing this movie, go into it with a open mind, and maybe you'll enjoy it a little more than I did."

","I will do my best to avoid any spoilers, although I can't imagine how anyone who isn't as ""special"" as Adrian Brody's character couldn't see the ending coming after about five minutes. M. Night's dialog has never been more awkward, but at least he sped things up a bit since Signs. But like Signs, this was basically a 30 minute twilight zone episode stretched into a feature film. A solid cast was made to look like a community theater troupe with awkwardly worded dialog and one dimensional characters. The only character that were explored were surrounded with lazy disabilities to mask a lack of development. Bryce Dallas Howard did her best as the blind Ivy Walker to stay in character, despite being asked at points in the film to run in a race and, how do I say this without a spoiler... lets just say you can Imagine Blair Witch if it were one person, and they were blind and you get my drift. Did I mention she was blind? William Hurt's pauses would have make Shatner blush, but perhaps he was simply in shock at how bad the writing was and how little his, or anyone else in the movie was explored. But I guess it would have to be that way, since if you thought about any of them for more that a few seconds about it, the whole movie falls apart. I would say I expect better from M. Night, but really should we? After sixth sense he's demonstrated the ability to stretch 20 minutes of weak ""what if"" into 2 hours of boredom inter cut with cheap ""made you jump"" scenes. It's not a down movie for him, he's just found his level."

I will think twice before seeing his next film. Although The Village manages to generate some dread and suspense, the ending completely negates it. I was hoping for some interesting comment about xenophobia or terrorism but when the beans are spilled, the audience has been jerked around for a couple of hours with nothing to take away from the experience to really justify it.<br/><br/>It's not entertaining or thought-provoking. The ending is unbelievably preposterous. Think Walden Two with some traces of Scooby Doo.

"Indra_1000_Eyes","Null","0","1","31 July 2004"," Stupid People Will Like This Film
","Spoiler Alert Allow me to preface this review by stating I will be discussing the ""plot twist"" upon which this film relied. In other words, there are spoilers.<br/><br/>""The Village"" was awful, and was awful on many levels. A brief synopsis is necessary. A group of individuals suffering from the various tragedies of the late twentieth century decided to retreat into a safely-guarded preserve and develop a commune, financed by the wealthy head of the village. The dates on the tombstone of a boy who dies at the beginning of the film places the Village at the turn of the century. This is blatant misdirection, and one wonders why it was employed besides setting the stage for the ""twist."" Especially since the founders of this little social experiment chose to adopt a lifestyle that was far more akin to the communities of the Amish and Mennonites than it was to the Industrial Age.<br/><br/>For fear their children would wander back into the modern world with its myriad hazards, the elders of the town developed a mythology involving nebulous monsters who skulk in the woods which border the village. The viewer is not let in on the secret shared by the elders until the end of the film, kept in darkness like the young protagonists. Now, on to the suckitude.<br/><br/>Acting/Dialogue: The acting was painfully stilted, employing a wealth of florid prose. The actors struggle with dialogue that Shamylan intended to sound similar to the dialects of the Amish and their ilk, but it sounds incredibly forced. What is especially irritating about this prose is that it serves a purpose germane to the ""twist."" The residents of the village speak with great formality, eschewing contractions such as ""don't, I'm, can't,"" etc. When the character Ivy returns from the ""modern-world"" beyond the forest, she addresses her betrothed by declaring ""I'm back, Lucius."" She has fallen prey to the manner of speech employed in the outside world, symbolic of the imminent changes the elders have been dreading. The problem is that this is hardly worth suffering through the awful dialogue that pollutes the majority of the film. Shamylan made his viewers suffer for a moment of ""cleverness."" It wasn't worth it, trust me.<br/><br/>The Monsters: The monsters look ridiculous. I've read reviews comparing them to the monsters in ""The Dark Crystal,"" but this does those fabulous muppets a grave disservice. I understand that the monsters are fake, but let's keep in mind the founder of this town was wealthy enough to sustain a commune and hire elaborate security to guard it. He could have produced better costumes. Seeing the monsters early in the film, it is apparent that they are merely disguises, ruining one of the ""twists."" <br/><br/>The Pacing: This movie was abysmally slow. The moments of excitement were far and few between and most were achieved through the score rather than the direction. After Ivy has learned the farcical nature of the monsters and is wandering in the forest, a voice-over hints that they may, in fact, be real (having been based on legends that preexisted the village). This seems like M. Night's desperate attempt to resurrect some suspense when Ivy encounters a hooded figure in the course of her journey. Of course, it's just the village idiot in disguise. There is no reward for suffering through this movie...as I'll address next.<br/><br/>The ""Twist"": I've seen only one other of M. Night's movies: The 6th Sense. I had no idea that twists had become his ""trademark,"" so I was not searching for any revelation. Regardless, I guessed what was afoot fairly early on. Not because there were clues, but because I assumed the director would attempt something outlandish to rescue this film. The clues are far and few between and not terribly specific. When the elders allude to their previous lives, they could easily be referring to the misery inherent in any turn-of-the-century city. M. Night seems to forget that violent urban crimes did, in fact, exist prior to 1900.<br/><br/>M. Night wants to be Rod Serling. However, Serling knew something Night does not. The sort of ""twist"" formula that worked so well on the Twilight Zone only works for brief films/shows. During its fourth season, CBS tried to extend the Twilight Zone to an hour-long format, and it failed. Now imagine trying to extend it to a two-hour format. Misdirection cannot be sustained that long; it just doesn't work (The 6th Sense was a rare exception). M. Night may want to bear in mind that Serling wrote other, longer screen-plays...and usually decided to forgo the twist. The Village's fillip is pointless. It may fool stupid people into believing this idiotic film is ""deep."" However, I ask you, would this have been greatly different if it were, in fact, set in 1897? The village was already anachronistic for the time period it was supposedly set in. The more anachronistic, the more shocking? Or worse, the more anachronistic, the more significant? Lord Rod, save us all!<br/><br/>Symbolism: Stupid people will likely try to defend this film as ""thoughtful."" It isn't. Is it a commentary on post 9/11 isolationism? Well, unless the members of the village decide to amass an army and storm the wicked ""towns,"" this film isn't a very good metaphor. The Amish actually live in relative isolation...should we consider their existence metaphor simply because it shares some isolationist qualities with a fearful America? Perhaps this is a political statement: isolation is bad because it keeps us ignorant, backward, stagnant, etc. A nice sentiment. <br/><br/>But please, now. Is an increase in airport security really tantamount to sealing ourselves off as we blithely watch our children (or, gasp, our FREEDOMS) die for the sake of an illusory safety? It's too grandiose of a stretch to produce any emotional impact upon viewers.<br/><br/>Is this about generational tensions? Is it making the wildly bold statement that the old guard is inevitably replaced by the new? Thank you, M. Night, for illustrating (poorly) what history has never ceased to show us. Were it not for ""The Village,"" I may never have realized that nothing lasts forever and that the fleeting nature of things causes distress. Sorry, M. Night, but Buddhism and common sense have already got that one covered. <br/><br/>Maybe M. Night is trying to explore the nature of secrets. After all, secrecy is a recurring motif (the hidden loves of the various characters form a half-baked subplot). Maybe. But what does it say about secrets? That they come back to haunt us? That we can't lock up the past as the elders attempt to do? This is not a terribly original or thought-provoking sentiment. This is not philosophy, but rather a string of clichés. <br/><br/>The color symbolism was gratuitous. Red is Shymalan's signature, fine. So the monsters who run his secret show (he plays the head of security, I guess, on the outside of the village) are adorned in red. Yellow? Are these allusions to levels of alert? If so...who cares? This murky film is too far removed from social commentary for such symbolism to have any significance other than as a gimmick. <br/><br/>So, my motivations for not liking this film was not my inability to ""get it."" There's really nothing to ""get"" once one gives this trainwreck of a movie any real thought. However, I'm sure many will be quite pleased with themselves after they discern the ""depth"" of this movie and M. Night's ""genius."" This is the kind of film dumb people enjoy because it provides them an illusory sense of insight. ""Philosophy/Social Commentary/Allegory for Idiots"" is what ""The Village"" is all about. <br/><br/>The Village was awful. Get the Twilight Zone on DVD instead and enjoy the work of a real genius."

","The Village is another M Night Shamylan movie in ever sense, its another attempt by an over inflated ego to try to ""shock"" us with a surprise ending that fails miserably. I went in to this movie thinking that the commercials and trailers told me the big twist but thought that my guess was too obvious but sadly I was right. I'm not going to ruin this for anyone who hasn't seen it and thinks they may be surprised although I'm not sure preschoolers frequent IMDb to begin with. M Shamylan's movies has gotten progressivley worse as they've come, Sixth Sense was horribly predictable but the acting was good, UnBreakable was UnBearable and Signs was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. The Village doesn't sink quite as low as Signs but that is damning with faint praise to say the least. Like Sixth Sense the story is predictable but the acting isn't nearly as good, Phoenix, Hurt and most of the rest chomp through their lines as if they had gone to the William Shatner school of hyperbole. Bryce Howard is tolerable as Hurt's daughter, she's good but at times not believable as someone who is blind and Adrien Brody is good as the village idiot. <br/><br/>If you really want to see this disaster wait till it comes out on video and hope you can rent it for 99 cents."
"Snoopy1","3","0","2","2 August 2004"," Great concept, boring movie
","I was excited to see ""The Village""...I went into the theater knowing nothing about it except that it was directed by M. Night.  Since I appreciated his previous efforts, especially ""The Sixth Sense"", I was eager to see this film.<br/><br/>I came out of the theater feeling disappointed.  While the idea for the movie was interesting, the actual movie was beyond dull.  The majority of the movie was filled with unrelated filler material.  The Ivy and Lucious affair came out of nowhere.  They seemingly had no relationship, then they began to talk about getting married?  And why did they spend time with the storyline about Lucious and Ivy's sister?  It was completely unrelated. <br/><br/>
I understand that films such as this are building up to SOMETHING...and I find myself getting ansy waiting for the twist.  It's unfortunate that throughout the duration of the movie, I impatiently waited for the twist, as opposed to enjoying every moment of the movie.  When the twist occurred, I wasn't very shocked...I was just thinking, ""Oh.  Okay."" instead of ""OH MY GOD, WOW!""<br/><br/>Another irksome quality of this movie was Ivy's hair.  All of the other women had long hair, tied into braids or buns.  Ivy, on the other hand, had short-ish curly hair and it looked like it had a lot of mousse in it.  It looked wrong for their culture, and especially for a blind girl who wouldn't manicure her own hair in that fashion.  They could have easily taken a little bit of extra time to make her hair more appropriate.<br/><br/>This screenplay could have been shaved of about an hour of its content and made an interesting episode of ""The New Twilight Zone"", or something to that effect.  I didn't think it deserved a spot on the big screen, and the idea certainly did not need to be flushed out to a full length feature film. <br/><br/>
You can analyze anything deeply and come up with astonishing conclusions...however, I don't feel that there was any strong allegory in this film.  It was supposed to be creepy and it did not deliver."

","I was really interested in seeing the village. It broke my heart that the morning of the release the radio movie guy said, ""There is a twist, as expected, but it is really lame."" Though Gene Shalit, Leonard Maltin and those other movie company whores lie, the Radio Movie Guy who makes less than you do rarely does. The twist is utterly pathetic, and I found myself afterward looking for the door so I could find an excuse to leave, since I had waiting so long though excruciatingly poor (Yet apparently historically correct) acting. Sure some of it is scary, but flashy costumes, music and well placed sound effects could make Dumbo scary. Shyamalan has paved his way through some potentially dumb plots and ended them well. I liked Signs (but I'll deny it if anyone asks) and I loved the ending of Sixth Sense. I guess he could have done a lot worse with the Village ending. Maybe in the end it could have been a reality TV show. <br/><br/>For those of you privileged enough to live in the Northwest, wait to see this at a McMenimans for $3.

"BigJeffLebowski","3","0","1","31 July 2004"," A colossal miscalculation of a movie
","M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director, but his films are often ill-conceived in one way or another. Sixth Sense was his strongest and best thought-out, but was dragged down by its Hollywood sheen. Signs was good, but self-defeating. Now we have The Village, which is, quite simply, awful film-making.<br/><br/>There are so many conceptual problems with this film that they're not worth enumerating -- and even beyond that, they couldn't be discussed without giving away the ""surprise"" (which, aside from being quite poor, anticlimactic, and predictable in the worst way, comes little over halfway into the film, leaving you anxious for the picture to end throughout the remainder). There are no scares. There are attempts, mind you, but they all fall shockingly flat.<br/><br/>The only dramatic weight comes from Bryce Dallas Howard. Though she is occasionally unconvincing as a blind girl, her performance is strong -- you wish there was a better movie to support it. Adrien Brody also fares well, but it's time Cherry Jones starts getting bigger roles that are worthy of her talent.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins gives the film a great look and texture, but Shyamalan's shot composition is unusually weak. Unbreakable, though a mediocre film, featured his most accomplished camera-work, reminiscent of Hitchcock in the way he used motion and composition to further the narrative. But here, Shyamalan just seems lazy. Not only in how he sets up his shots, but in his writing, his direction -- pretty much the whole picture.<br/><br/>Somewhere in here there's the potential for a good film, but almost everything in The Village is so poorly conceived or executed, that it's hardly worth speculating. The Village would be an embarrassment for any director, but especially one as prominent and self-promoting as Shyamalan. One can only hope that he gets back on track before he loses all credibility as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>1 1/2 out of 4 stars"

","I'm going to try to do this without any spoilers...but be warned that my critique alone might lead one to conclusions.<br/><br/>My primary gripe about this movie is that it plays like a Lifetime Television For Women flick -- something akin to COLD MOUNTAIN without the budget and WITNESS without the awesome story -- and throw in a little ALIEN for Sigourney's sake.<br/><br/>Keep these things in mind and reflect upon them AFTER you've seen the film. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>1) What was the purpose of the Pilgrim-esquire grammar and manners? Even when Ivy learns the truth from her father, why does he still use that silly, proper, Amishy cadence? And when the elders speak amongst themselves, why do they not revert to normal phrasing? It would have been a cagey hint wouldn't it? Isn't that what plot twists are all about -- the oh-so-subtle hints?<br/><br/>2) Adrien Brody does an annoying job of over-acting. I know it's hard to find a real village idiot who also happens to be an acting coach, but he really should have toned it down. Even an idiot would have known that.<br/><br/>3) Making Ivy blind was a cop-out. The old, ""hysterical blind person stumbling through the lonely woods"" thing is pretty tired. I imagine this was an attempt to offer us a sense of claustrophobia ( something the director did fabulously in SIGNS) but it just doesn't work here.<br/><br/>4) The pay-off, not that there is one, is feeble and forced. By the time Ivy dispatches one of the unspeakables, anyone with a brain has an idea what is going to happen -- but you still wonder if there might be something less overt. I sat there and thought of at least three different twisty, awesome possibilities that might lie ahead to delight us -- but alas, there were none to be found.<br/><br/>If I saw this film on The USA Network or Lifetime, I would have thought it was pretty good, but since I've been seeing trailers for this big-budget, summer blockbuster for nearly a year, I was profoundly frustrated.<br/><br/>Much like the character's life choices in the village of Covington, the whole thing was a noble effort. So, instead of signing off with a nasty poke at the director/writer, I'll politely say, night, Night.<br/><br/>Damien"

","I confess, I am a Shylaman fan.  I watch a LOT of movies and usually guess the endings.  Sixth Sense's ending actually made me gasp!  Then, like many, I wanted to go right back in and see it again.  I wouldn't say that about The Village but I did really like it.  The many little mysteries inside the mystery was just as much fun to contemplate as the movie overall.  Several scenes surprised me as did the ending.  (Possible spoiler)  One ""love scene"" speech caused an audience member to go AWW real loud and caused a giggle across the audience as we were all thinking aww, we just didn't say it out loud.  There were several gasps from the audience during this movie and at least one scream ;).  I couldn't wait to see this movie and I wasn't disappointed - can't wait for the next one either!!!!!!!!!"
"billyzduke","3","0","1","30 July 2004"," Shyamalan is the Most Overrated Director Working Today
","When I first saw the Sixth Sense, my date and I almost walked out because we were so bored.  It was clumsy, not scary, and although partially redeemed by the now famous twist ending, it boggles my mind that it remains so highly regarded, and is often included on ""best of"" lists aside films far more deserving of the superlative.<br/><br/>With his subsequent movies, Shyamalan has done little but prove that he is indeed a one-trick pony (and it's not even his trick, but Rod Serling's). With the failed Unbreakable, he at least attempted to break new ground, but Signs and The Village both seem desperately designed as crowd-pleasing machines, offering up more of the same slow, creepy atmosphere that seemed to appeal to so many who saw his first blockbuster, with increasingly arbitrary plot twists.<br/><br/>This is an unfortunate situation for any director.  The best thing about the Sixth Sense was that it took the audience by surprise, but since it made him so famous, he can never pull off that kind of surprise again.  When the viewers expect surprise, how can they possibly be surprised?  The fact that he has gone for some kind of ""big twist"" every time out is, by the fourth time, simply wearying, and ultimately distracting from the gifts he does possess as a director.<br/><br/>Here, his cast suffers as well from his single-mindedness.  Where his other films focused primarily on a brooding male protagonist (Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson, respectively), The Village plays as more of an ensemble piece, at least in the beginning, and when the focus does narrow, it does so on a young blind girl.  There are a truckload of excellent actors on board, including Ron Howard's talented daughter as the blind Ivy Walker, but the considerable time spent on characterization goes up in smoke the closer we get to the end, which, in Shyamalan's eyes, all things must serve.<br/><br/>I will remember The Village as the only film to which I guessed the ending after seeing only the trailer.  And it was my first guess.  If he's going to keep making movies, Shyamalan literally needs to give up the ghost.  And his self-injected cameos are almost as annoying as Tarantino's.  Mark my words: This will tank quickly after opening weekend."
"caARACER","10","0","1","30 July 2004"," What would you do to protect your children from the violence of the world?
","Many of the previous reviews have given away most of the twists and have stated, for the most part fairly, the plot.  But those who disliked the movie perhaps did so because they 'saw the twists coming', 'didn't find it scary', 'saw it as lame', etc.  The scariness of the movie was not<br/><br/>what was in or not in the forest but why The Village exists in the first place.  This is a movie that deserves to be spoken about, to be debated about.  It should cause us to wonder what lengths we would go to to<br/><br/>protect our children from all of the 'bad' in the world.  Nothing is scarier then that which can't be seen."
"youdontsmellbad","7","0","1","30 July 2004"," because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.
","The trouble with The Village, as I suspected would be the case is that it's being sold as a horror movie starring Joaquin Phoenix.  Didn't the bro population realize when tiffany didn't jump terrified onto their crotches during Signs that the sixth sense guy doesn't really make horror movies?  He makes M. Night Shyamalan movies, which are a different thing.<br/><br/>Now the movie was good.  That said, I think you're all going to hate it.<br/><br/>Yes it's centered around a huge plot twist AGAIN, like you're hoping.  And yes, I like the twist.  What I like about it is that it prompts discussion afterward, and because it makes you go back and reprocess everything, and because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.  <br/><br/>Again an important note is there's a brief maybe ten minutes of the film where you think the twist has happened and there seems to be no point in watching the movie.  In order to survive this part I'll tell you in advance (no spoilers) that the movie flounders (At the point where Michael Pitt chickens out), but sort of recovers when it explains what the deal is.<br/><br/>But the problem around this point is it really feels like it's being explained.  And not only that but the plot doubles back in time and has totally unnecessary voice-over bits that really give the feeling of a drunk guy telling a story, leaving an important part out and then going `before I tell this next part, I forgot to tell you that'  Then the developments unfold in such a way that the writer's hand is clearly visible, thumping a few really clunky plot devices together and they don't quite fit (for later reference I mean Adrien Brody and what's under the floorboards, for one thing) but when it's over I smile I grin and I walk out of the theater because the twist got me, kind of.<br/><br/>So what you know about the plot is that people in the village are afraid of some kind of creatures in the woods.  Now, knowing what you know you'll probably almost start to guess the plot twist correctly that's why I said it got me kind of.<br/><br/>Of course the other reason it works is because Night is so well-versed in the tricks of the trade.  His moves all give the sense that you're being manipulated in every way imaginable and having a good time at it.  He takes all the tricks, the frustrating camera angles, slow reveals and explosive rack focuses and throws them  all together so that rather than feel cheated you come to enjoy being tricked.  That's the fun of his style.<br/><br/>And once again great casting fills in the space left by some of the plot holes.  After this you'll be saying `Joaquin who?'  yeah he's kind of forgettable in the movie but there's this actress, Bryce Dallas Howard (seeming WAY too old to be Ron Howard's daughter) who absolutely knocks it out the park as his blind love interest.   A stellar blind performance: convincing without being cloying and begging for sympathy, yet strong without being a joke. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody is in it (who knew?) as the village idiot.  He'll knock your socks off until the plot is in more way more control of the character than the actor is.<br/><br/>This is not the best example of what Shyamalan can do, in fact it's his worst so far, but it's valuable because since the plot is so transparent this time around, you can really study how his mind works."
"noizyme","3","0","2","30 July 2004"," What the...?!?!
","Remember this movie has summer hype written all over it.  I didn't originally want to see the film, but friends are persuasive things.<br/><br/>I like the production value of Night's films, but after all the running around and panic is done, you sit around to simply see the credits because there lies only horrible revelations that you wish you never knew.  It's like he tried to get his money's worth out of the actors he hired, so he had them thrown into additional scenes to lengthen and complicate the story, namely Adrian Brody's character around the end.<br/><br/>I loved the score and all of the cast was right on the money with their characters, including the creepy father/village-leader with his psuedo-Amish tinged character.  But when the material to make a movie falls short, you don't stretch the story by its legs to make a good film.  You have to have that to start with, which, unfortunately, was not the case on this one.  Ask for your money back from the customer care center in your local theater after half the film is over!"
"CWessonSpeaks","Null","0","1","30 July 2004"," ""A Very Special Halloween Episode"" of Little House on the Prairie
","No SPOILERS (but truly, you'd have to be brain dead not to figure everything out while watching the movie)<br/><br/>Perhaps the most laughable, implausible, asinine film to grace screens this summer.   This shamefully trashy and reactionary yarn about red cape wearing monsters threatening an idyllic Amish-like village is truly preposterous, interminably dull and its narrative `twists' can be seen a mile away. Imagine the silliest episode of Scooby Doo mixed with a `very special' Halloween episode of Little House on the Prairie.   The outrageous promotion of this world class turkey from this country's most self promoting, arrogant hack M. Night Shyamalan (who inexplicably and egocentrically seems to fancy himself a modern day Hitchcock) is really unforgivable. <br/><br/>
The hype for this thing is a surefire way to make it the big box office winner this weekend and I'm sure there will be plenty of groaning, bored and angry audience members tonight like in my screen who booed and hissed throughout the film's lengthy, incredibly dull duration.   I feel embarrassed for all the actors in the film having to speak the ludicrous dialogue and keep a straight face.  This is one of those incredible all star train wrecks that people will laugh about for years.    I'm still in shock that some of the actors in this film didn't laugh out loud at the screenplay.<br/><br/>While I felt the 6th Sense was strong and well made I have not been much of a fan of M. Night's other films but THIS THING absolutely takes the cake.  I feel battered and robbed of ten dollars.    I can imagine the fat cat cackles of Scott Rudin and company as they howl it up this weekend in the Hamptons watching the box office receipts pile up before word really gets out.  How they'll laugh knowing the joke is on the public.  What a terrible, pointless, waste of time and money for us working stiffs.      <br/><br/>
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.  ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."
"flooz","Null","0","1","30 July 2004"," POSSIBLE SPOILER YOU NEED TO KNOW
","Don't expect a horror movie, consider yourselves warned. An entire theater audience was laughing at the film because they were let down. The trailers make you think this will be another scary movie, but this feels more like the Scarlet Letter. (A book I detest.) <br/><br/>That said, I'm confused. There's no reason why I shouldn't like this movie. Adrian Brody and Joaquim-I-Have-A-Very-Hard-Name-To-Spell Phoinex were excellent in this movie. The cinematography (yes, I know that cinematography only refers to the lighting of a film) was excellent with a stark contrast between the vibrant colors and the dingy woods. Night enjoys the use of the color red as some sort of symbol. I guess I liked it, but I'm not really sure why."
"Sir_Ferdival","3","0","2","30 July 2004"," Predictable and disappointing... it sucks!
","This movie wasn't what I expected at all. It was slow moving and boring for the most part, the camera guy must've been drunk, and the parts that were supposed to be sad or touching were just plain funny. Not to mention that the damn movie had no ending. Half way trough the movie I had already figured out what was the ""secret"" of the village, making the las 30 minutes of the movie a torture. In my opinion... the movie plain sucked. Boring, not scary, and long. Not a good combination.<br/><br/>MPAA: Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations. (Frightening... right! Gremlins is scarier than this sorry flick!)."

","What happened to the director of the Sixth Sense? M. Night just dropped a notch on my list. The twist that Night is know for is weak in this movie. The direction is nothing to brag about and Night doesn't give the cast a good enough chance to show their talent. Why have such a top notch cast if you aren't going to use them properly? Sure some of them had their moments but they were held to a jog instead of a full out run. The movie did not meet the hype and the direction did not meet the standards for a freshman film project. Now wonder why the sci-fi channel had that mockumentary, they used it in order to beef up the interest so that they could get a big opening weekend and collect as much money as they can before everyone finds out what a stinker this is. I hope M. Night is able to bounce back from this one... Good luck Night. Sorry but I give it a 5.5 out of 10"

","After signing a release agreeing not to divulge the ""surprise ending"" of The Village I settled down with a good female friend and was prepared for some scary fun. It never happened. The only thing scary in this movie was the music that kept increasing in intensity, teasing that a something scary was about to happen, but nothing ever materialized. My friend and me left the theater, along with the rest of the promo crowd, shaking our heads and wondering, ""what did we just see?"" Surprise ending or not...the only thing you'll be at the end of this film is disappointed!"
"Jon-san","Null","0","1","23 July 2004"," Bring back the other Village People
","* please note: no spoilers in this review. <br/><br/>A new film by M. Night Shyamalan brings with it two big questions:<br/><br/>1. Is there a twist (again)? 2. (if yes to question 1) Is the twist any good?<br/><br/>The answers are yes, and not really. The main problem with The Village is that after SUCH a slow and ponderous build-up (so slow that 90 minutes felt like three hours), you need a damn good twist to make it all worthwhile. And while the ending this time isn't as bad as in 'Signs' (beating that would be a hell of an achievement) it still isn't satisfying, and you feel cheated rather than rewarded for sitting through the sheer tedium of what's gone before. <br/><br/>Shyamalan is clearly still struggling to escape from the huge shadow cast by his debut, The Sixth Sense, which to be fair to him, was a good movie. But he's obviously got some deluded idea that he's Hollywood's new Master of Suspense. He isn't, and someone needs to grab him by the throat* and shout very loudly: YOU'RE NOT ANOTHER HITCHCOCK! (Remove the 'hitch' and you'd get nearer the mark). <br/><br/>[*not intended literally as an incitement to attack M. Night.]<br/><br/>Somehow he's managed once again to get a truly top-notch ensemble cast to work for him, and it'd be harsh to criticise them as they all do their best as puritan village people to draw you into the story. But like a band who have had one too many bad albums, Shyamalan is moving further and further away from his last genuinely good film, and I'd be surprised if he can keep persuading A-list talent to sign up to his future projects if this really his is only trick.<br/><br/>Perhaps his next film's twist will be that for once he doesn't actually rely on a twist at the end to try to make his story worthwhile. That might be worth watching. But if you're looking for genuine misdirection and mystery, you'd be better off saving your money and, instead, finding a foreign tourist and asking them the best way to get home.<br/><br/>Avoid this Village like the Plague, which co-incidentally also decided to avoid it.<br/><br/>3/10"
