","I seriously enjoyed this film-- it had more gore than Mel Gibson could shake a fist at, some very cute actors, and didn't waste time with excessive back-story and details, and gave me many good laughs.<br/><br/>Its not an intellectually stimulating movie... duh. Its made to a hilariously entertaining popcorn flick with over-the-top action and unrealistic weapons that wouldn't have existed given the 'time period' this movie seems to be set in. So you folks out there giving it bad rap for not meeting your standards, calm down. Its clearly not trying to. :).<br/><br/>This movie's violence reminded me of the Expendables-- but this film never takes itself too seriously like the other film does... I found this much more fun to watch."

","In my opinion this is the type of movie to see if: 1)You love and support Jeremy Renner 2)You're in a mood to see cool but not overly flashy effects 3)Love for dark fairy tales 4)Awesome make up and costumes (the witches were very VERY well put together) 5)Just an all around chill movie with gore violence and cool effects<br/><br/>Don't see it if: 1)you expect high quality acting 2)Over the top graphics and effects 3)Complex plot line 4)Extremely witty script<br/><br/>Because Jeremy Renner was in big time movies, people are over analyzing this one. It's suppose to be fun with a hint of dark, and entertaining. I was very entertained. I also loved how it was only 88 minutes versus the 2-3 hour movies that have been coming out. I appreciated the toughness of Gemma in the film and Famke as head witch was genius. Overall it served it's purpose."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","9","9","1 April 2019"," Kick-a$$ fairy tale which is sharp, edgy, filled with heroics and dirty deeds
","I didn't expect much from this so-called fairy tale story which was first published in 1812. If only the brothers Grimm were alive today to watch this updated story line starring the athletic and attractive Gemma Arterton as Greta, and her tough as nails diabetic brother Hansel played by versatile actor Jeremy Renner, I think they (the brothers Grimm) would be so impressed as to how the writer/director Tommy Wirkola brought their story to life (and death to the many witches).<br/><br/>The supporting cast of stars such as Famke Janssen (witch Muriel), Pihla Viitala (good witch Mina), Peter Stormare (Sheriff Berringer), giant and lovable troll Edward (Derek Mears), and novice witch hunter in training Ben (Thomas Mann) were all extremely well played.<br/><br/>I loved the darkish firey cinematography, the suspenseful battles between the witch hunters and the witches, and the twists and turns in the storylines and the characters. This was a more than impressive introduction which I hope we will soon be followed up by a sequel also starring Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Derak Mears, and their witch hunter in training Thomas Mann.<br/><br/>A pleasantly under appreciated adventure/fantasy/action film worthy of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!"
"sildarmillion","7","146","215","27 January 2013"," The movie knows it's stupid and has fun with it
","This is not a quality film and I don't think they even meant it to be good or memorable. If you watched the trailers and *didn't* expect it to be terrible, I'd be very, very surprised. I would never have paid to see this. I only saw it because I got passes to a free advance screening. And it was just as ridiculous as I expected - and I was pretty entertained. We were laughing pretty hard the whole time.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't trying to have a good plot or a surprise twist. Clocking in at a little over an hour, it could have been season finale of a B-grade TV series of the same premise. I think movie was just trying to be funny, and I think their jokes worked. Like how Hansel has a ""medical condition"" (not spoiling it here). It doesn't work in a physiological sense - but who cares? It was really funny that they even made that connection! <br/><br/>There was an incredible amount of gore in this movie; but I suppose that itself was a joke, given the premise of the movie. Their other jokes relied on anachronisms (weapons, fanboys, crime investigations). But they were careful enough that the anachronisms were funny in the context of the world-building instead of being glaring anomalies.<br/><br/>There might be some people complaining about what an inadequate film this was with respect to plot, but that would be missing the point. Don't watch this expecting to take away anything - it's really only just for the lawls."
"g-bodyl","8","19","24","2 June 2014"," Surpassed My Low Expectations!
","Before viewing this movie, I knew it was not going to be a masterpiece. I already had incredibly low expectations for it and I thought I was going to hate it. After viewing it, I can say it's a pretty bad....ass film. It's not a great film, but it's ridiculously entertaining and even really funny. There's lots of gore here, so people who love endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.<br/><br/>Tommy Wirkola's film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the Grimm Brothers, Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult lives, where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually get the job done, but then there is this witch who believes she is the most powerful of all.<br/><br/>The acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a hard-nosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.<br/><br/>Overall, I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen, but I wasn't in the mood for any in-depth story. I just wanted to see witches die, and I think I can say my wish was fulfilled. This is an action-packed horror film that will take you for a thrilling ride. I rate this film 8/10."
"wlk68","9","67","99","26 January 2013"," Bloody, dark, tongue in cheek fun!
","I wasn't expecting anything deep or insightful or thought provoking when I went to see this. I was expecting a fantasy/horror movie with dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk' aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed the sugar sickness - a.k.a. diabetes - from being forced to eat all that candy as a kid.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the brother/sister vibe between the two. You don't see a great many brother/sister action duos. At least, none come immediately to mind. It's always buddies/cops or soldiers and if there is a male/female pairing it's usually romantic. To have the protagonists be siblings was a refreshing twist. They both knew the other could take care of themselves but were still protective and concerned for each other.<br/><br/>And as for taking care of themselves, hunting witches was never shown as easy. They each got their asses handed to them on numerous occasions and in the scene where we see Hansel shirtless, his body is covered in scars, both old and new.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that it wasn't long enough. It's run time is just short of 90 minutes so they had ample room to expand a few scenes - or even add new ones - to flesh out the character development a little."

She intends to use the children together with a secret ingredient in a Sabbath to make the coven of witches protected against the fire.

The story is very funny and the special effects and make-up are top notch. Gemma Arterton is one of the sexiest actresses and it is good to see her again. If the viewer likes this genre, he or she will certainly enjoy ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"".

"Vartiainen","Null","21","29","2 May 2013"," Mindless fun, for better and for worse
","Lately we have seen a lot of these fairy tale remakes, where they take a basic fairy tale plot, add in a lot of CGI, slightly darker atmosphere and some sex and call it a day. I still prefer the Disney version, thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts. That being said, this particular fairy tale movie was a pleasant surprise. For one, it didn't try to retell the same exact story we have grown up with. Rather it took the story of Hansel and Gretel and asked the question: ""What if they grew up?"" I'm totally on board with that question. It's something we've never seen before and frankly it's a fascinating idea. So yeah, colour me interested.<br/><br/>The film itself ends up being pretty much what anyone would expect. I hesitate to call it a good film, because it has numerous plot holes, nonsensical twists and its characters are somewhat bland and clichéd. On the other hand, it has a good visual style, its action is very pleasing, if a bit gore-filled (not a bad thing in this case), the two main actors are actually pretty good in their roles, and as a whole it's just plain solid fun. Yeah, it's stupid most of the time, but it's fun kind of stupid. The kind where you're just able to sit back, enjoy the scenery and laugh at the jokes.<br/><br/>It also needs to be remembered that this was Tommy Wirkola's first big budget film. And for a debut film, this shows a lot of promise. The style is definitely there, as is the atmosphere. The story-telling and the character development need some work, but even big name directors struggle with those every now and then. I'm looking forward to what this guy will bring us next.<br/><br/>And that's this film. Yeah, it's one of those so bad it's good films, but I'd still recommend this. The idea alone is worth checking out."
"moviexclusive","6","97","159","24 January 2013"," Leave the kids at home for this one – this revisionist take on the classic fairy tale is an entertaining blend of horror and humour that is as gory as it is vulgar
","What you may or may not remember about the Brothers Grimm' story is over and done with in the first ten minutes of writer-director Tommy Wirkola's revisionist treatment of the classic tale, which basically imagines what happens after the happily ever after. And so Wirkola fast- forwards the story many years later, where he would like us to believe that Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) have found their calling as witch hunters, travelling around from village to village killing the evil ones who kidnap children and rescuing their abductees in the process.<br/><br/>One particular such mission brings them to the town of Augsburg, where a beautiful blonde-haired woman named Mina (Pihla Viitala) is due to be drowned in front of an angry crowd by the shifty Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare). The Mayor (Rainer Bock) is not so fast to pronounce judgment on her for the spate of disappearances, and has hired Hansel and Gretel to get to the bottom of it. Seeing no visible signs of sorcery on her, Hansel and Gretel free her, inadvertently setting themselves on a collision course with the Sheriff.<br/><br/>But the bitter Sheriff and his band of hunters are the least of their problems – indeed, their most pressing concern is the Grandmother Witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) and her hench-women, who have been keeping the children they have kidnapped locked up in wait for a much more sinister plot to make them even more powerful. Of course, as narrative dictates, Muriel's plan would have something to do with Hansel and Gretel's own past, as well as their extraordinary ability to be immune from the spells of witches.<br/><br/>Savvy viewers will be able to spot the connection once the clues are laid, so don't expect a revelatory surprise at the end. That doesn't mean however that this reimagination is predictable; instead, Wirkola keeps you riveted with a surprisingly effective blend of horror and hilarity often within the very same scene. Case in point? Just before she forces someone to turn a shotgun on himself and splatter his brains onto the wall, Muriel comments how the room they are in looks somehow drab and could do with some colour.<br/><br/>That same irreverence pervades the entire movie, which shouldn't come as a surprise if you paid attention to the opening credits and spotted Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers of the movie. Their brand of rude cheeky humour is very much alive in Wirkola's first English-language feature, who had demonstrated through his debut movie lampooning Quentin Tarantino – Kill Buljo – that he is perfectly in tune with their sensibilities. But Wirkola also brings his eye for gore – seen in his sophomore film 'Dead Snow' – to this movie, so be prepared for exploding flesh, crushed skulls and some particularly nasty decapitations that is good reason why this grown-up version of Hansel and Gretel does not carry a kid-friendly rating.<br/><br/>Amidst the gore and adult humour, Renner and Arterton unfortunately are left with paper-thin characters. While Renner pretty much looks dour throughout the movie, Arterton seems determined to have fun with her ass-kicking female heroine of a role, and her portrayal of Gretel resembles a Lara Croft for the medieval ages. The scene-stealer however is Janssen, the former Bond villain once again relishing the opportunity to play against type as the villain and putting in a deliciously over- the-top performance as Muriel. Other supporting actors don't make much of an impression – including Thomas Mann, a firm Hansel and Gretel devotee who gets some laughs from his fanboy behaviour and eventually sees his wish come true to be a witch hunter like his heroes.<br/><br/>And we suspect, how much you will end up enjoying this new twist to the classic fairy tale will also depend on your expectations. Compared to the recent spate of fairytale-inspired Hollywood movies like 'Red Riding Hood' or 'Snow White and the Huntsman', it veers most far off from its source material to tell an entirely different story. The result of that novelty is something bloody all right, that can also prove to be bloody good fun if you're looking for an adult-oriented blend of action, adventure, fantasy, horror and comedy. It might not sound intuitive, but this fairy tale is best enjoyed without the kids.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"3xHCCH","8","112","191","24 January 2013"," Renner and Arterton: Killer Combination!
","I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the poster for ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters"" because it actually puts together my two favorite current movie stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton! I liked Gothic interpretations of fairy tales like ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". And I also liked the ""supernaturalization"" of historical figures like ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" a lot. This film seems to be a cross of those two types, and so is one film I made sure I would watch this once it opened.<br/><br/>Hansel and Gretel starts as we all know them from the fairy tale, children left by their parents in the woods. They were lured by a house made of candy, and was captured by the wicked witch who lived inside. We all know how the tale ends, when Hansel and Gretel push the witch into the oven. But that was just the beginning of the movie, for that was when this brother-sister team launch their career as mercenary witch hunters. When a mysterious series of missing children terrorizes a small town, its mayor hires Hansel and Gretel to look for the witches responsible and kill them.<br/><br/>That was one shallow story line I know, but I really enjoyed myself while watching this movie. Yes, the gore factor was really high, but everything appeared to be done with tongue strictly in cheek. The actors Renner and Arteron are unquestionable bad-ass! They fit the titular roles very well. You will meet a new, more interesting ""Edward"" here. The CG and production design were quite good and imaginative. It was fun to spot traditional witch lore in the scenes, even as they took liberties to invent their own lore.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the film does not shy from bloody violence, as the envelope is pushed to graphically show various mechanisms of death, from crushing to exploding - close-up! There was a brief scene of a nude village beauty Mina (Pihla Viitala) as she seduces Hansel. There were even unexpected modern-day swear words during the witch battles. With all of these scenes, I do not really know how it got a PG-13 rating in this country! Anyway, despite and maybe because of all these surprises, I found the whole film a lot of grown-up fun, a very entertaining one and half hours.<br/><br/>After the movie, I found out that the director was Tommy Wirkola, the same guy who directed the Norwegian Nazi zombies in the snow movie ""Dead Snow."" So that is why his strange Tarantino-esque sense of humor is all over this film. I am a fan! I will be awaiting his next project. However, for all the fun I had watching this film though, I think they should be happy with what they have now. I think a H&G sequel would already be pushing their luck."

","It seems critics nowadays just want serious movies that last hours on end, they don't want action or 3D, they just want to listen to dialogue driven movies that frankly don't go anywhere heart pumping or exciting. It's a real shame when critics can't enjoy watching two of the coolest, freshest actors totally ripping the guts out of evil witches in spectacularly gory style. We need more movies like this, films that don't take themselves seriously and just aim for all out entertainment. Fast paced, sharp and ferociously violent, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is hands down the most fun and wildly over the top adventure of 2013, it will be hard to beat. The story is played out fast and loose, just like the 3D and special effects which are insanely brilliant, the action is explosive but the best feature is the acting. Jeremy Renner is very entertaining, his humour is very blunt and deadpan and it's a change from his roles in Avengers, Bourne & Mission Impossible. Gemma Arterton is very cool, she takes a whole lot of punches and she fights back with brute force, and most of the bad-ass one liners come from her, ""Let the girl go, or I'm gonna blow you sheriff brains all over these hillbillies"". It has to be said though, that Famke Janssen is the best, you can tell she is having a blast playing the evil witch Muriel, whenever she comes on screen you can't help but smile, and there's a sense of unpredictability with her character, who knows what she will do next?! It's repeat viewing material and a heck of a blast and there is never a dull moment, just all out action, fun twists and a whole lot of laughter."
"DICK STEEL","8","83","146","26 January 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters
","It's a little strange why this film wasn't given advanced press previews in the US, and for territories like ours there was a review embargo to comply with, signalling the lack of confidence the filmmakers and distributors have on this film update of the Hansel and Gretel storyline. Perhaps they're taking a leaf out of recent updates to fairy tales such as the two Snow White movies, and Red Riding Hood, that they want to be a bit deaf to criticisms, and to allow audiences to judge instead. But Hansel and Gretel as witch hunters followed the mold of Blade, and proved to be quite the mass market entertainer, with no pretences in wanting to be more.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Norwegian Tommy Wirkola, this story had all the right ingredients for the kind of film it wanted to be, taking the familiar folk lore, and putting a creative, not necessarily new, spin on it. We see how the two kids get brought out to the woods, only this time there isn't a trail of crumbs to follow home. The iconic house of bread and sweets, and the wicked witch who wants to fatten Hansel as food later on are all included, as do their defeat of the witch by burning her alive in the stove. This forms the prologue, and the What If scenario that Hansel and Gretel were to build on their initial success, and form a career out of hunting, and destroying witches anywhere, bounty hunter style.<br/><br/>As you would already have seen in the trailer, this is but one of their adventures shown in helping a village deal with the menace of the witch Muriel (Famke Janssen), who together with her posse of like-minded witches have kidnapped children in preparation of a ritual to be performed under the blood moon. And there's no other better for the job than for Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), engaged by the mayor thanks to the widespread news of their successful witch hunting exploits played over the opening credits. The rest of the story is nothing but set action piece after set action piece, paced frantically without any pause longer than necessary, with a story that ties it all in to their origins, and going full circle.<br/><br/>clocking in at just under 90 minutes, the movie has two surprise acts and characters best kept under wraps, one to reverse the mantra that the witch hunters adopt to their methods, and the other a fine character introduced that shed clues to their origin story. Jeremy Renner continues in his sharing of the limelight in roles he had chosen of late, preferring to be the team player from the Impossible Mission Force to the Avengers, and continues as one half of the brother-sister team. Gemma Arterton is perhaps best known for her role as the Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, with her dramatic roles having never made it here. And having another Bond girl in Famke Janssen in yet another villainous role also helped, although every character in this film is pretty one dimensional.<br/><br/>But this is an action-adventure taking a well known fairy tale and giving it a license to thrill with blood and gore. While most of the effects are CG laden, it doesn't flinch from wanting to showcase burning at the stakes and various forms of dismemberment and beheadings that increases its body count in very gory terms. It's a story about witch hunting in a fantasy setting, and it exploits this setting perfectly. A definite recommend for any action junkie."
"helmutty","7","51","89","29 January 2013"," Good straight-forward entertainment packed with action.
","It is a pretty straight-forward action flick. With the short runtime of 1 hour and 28 minutes, you can expect this to move briskly and to be packed with a lot of action.<br/><br/>The story: The movie starts with the young Hansel and Gretel losing their parents. They are shortly picked by a witch to be food. They manage to escape and burn the witch alive and that's how they become witch hunter. Cue to the opening credit. The next scene shows them saving an innocent woman whom is accused of being a witch. And from there, the action keeps going. There are some slight twists about the innocent woman and Hansel and Gretel's parents. Other than that, it is purely straight-forward for a good thing. The action scenes are not bad but they are more gritty than fantastical. Music wise is quite alright with Han Zimmer acting as the music supervisor.<br/><br/>3D: It is okay. As many of the scenes take place at night, the 3D effect dampens. It becomes more like harder to see. But when it comes to explosions, blood splatters and action, it is gimmicky with objects flying to your face. Other than that, the 3D is not really recommended unless you have some spare money.<br/><br/>Overall: It is not bad for the month of January. Sure, there is a great potential that the movie never reach but Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters won't disappoint if you want a good entertainment packed with action. Next fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer in Feb."

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013) <br/><br/>** (out of 4)<br/><br/>R-rated, gory horror-adventure has brother and sisters Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretal (Gemma Arterton) called to a small town to try and locate some children that have been kidnapped by some witches. Soon they realize that a Queen witch (Famke Janssen) has bigger plans that could have a major change on the world. HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be but there's no question that the entire film just has an uneasy mix of genres that never fully come together and in the end the film just came off as something that didn't know what it wanted to be or do. At times there's some campy comedy moments but these aren't good enough to save the picture. At other times we're given a fairly interesting look at two people hunting witches but the film doesn't do too much with this. We're also given a picture with some extremely graphic gore that comes out of nowhere. I really liked the fact that they went for a R-rating and didn't hold back for a smaller rating but at the same time if you took this away there really wouldn't be much to the movie. The film manages to be slightly entertaining because of this type of gore but at the same time I can see how it might not sit well with some more sensitive viewers. Another thing I liked was the actual look of the witches. The CGI effects were actually quite believable whenever the witches changed form in their faces. The look of the major witch was also quite nice and benefited from the strong and fun performance by Janssen who managed to bring a certain sexy nature to the role. Both Renner and Arterton are good in their parts but the screenplay really makes both characters quite boring and uninteresting. The supporting players here are usually much better and the movie probably would have benefited having them in it more. This includes an obsessed fan of the duo as well as an evil sheriff. Another problem with the film is that you just never really get involved with anything going on. It looks nice and some of the action scenes are put together nicely but there's just no real energy that brings you into the film."
"gregeichelberger","2","107","210","25 January 2013"," A truly grim fairy tale ...
","Take a ridiculous premise – based loosely on a Grimm fairy tale – so-so special effects and deplorable acting and add non-existent direction, as well as a confusing time-line and substandard 3D effects, and then sprinkle in few unnecessary ""F"" bombs and what do you get? A profoundly pathetic and pointless effort entitled ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,"" a motion picture so bad in its design, development and execution that a Roget's Thesaurus is needed just to accurately describe how horrible and with as much variety as possible the experience of watching it was.<br/><br/>Written with a crayon and directed with a circus mallet by Tony Wirkola (""Dead Snow""), this film tries to be a ""Red Riding Hood"" meets ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" meets ""The Brothers Grimm"" meets the Evil Dead trilogy, but succeeds only in overlapping itself in a most embarrassing bog of amateurish inanity despite a most merciful running time of just 88 minutes (and you thought ""The Hobbit"" seemed long-winded).<br/><br/>Everyone has obviously read (or has been read) the story of how the wicked stepmother forced the meek father to take young Hansel and Gretel into the woods where they discovered a life-size gingerbread house and the evil witch that lived there. The crone then tried to eat the boy, but the kids outwit her and she ends up baked to a crisp in her own oven.<br/><br/>This film begins with pretty much the same tale, only we're now told (through a series of what looks like medieval newspaper clippings) that the siblings have grown up and have become bounty hunters, taking on – and totally destroying – witch after cackling witch. Now, years later, they show up at a town where 11 children have been suddenly taken away.<br/><br/>A diabetic (yep, all that candy, he has the ""sugar disease"") Hansel, played by Jeremy Renner (""The Bourne Legacy,"" ""The Avengers"") and a wise-cracking Gretel (Gemma Arterton, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time""), are hired by the milquetoast mayor (Rainer Bock), but detested by Ausberg's sheriff (Peter Stormare, ""The Last Stand"" and the only character with any real sense), and manage to save an accused sorceress, Mina (Pihla Viitala, a series of Finnish films and TV series no one has heard of), and do a little detective work - very little.<br/><br/>They soon discover that there is a bad moon rising – actually a ""blood moon"" – that can make witches inflammable (although since they are dispatched here in other various ways, it's not much of a defense). This event evidently takes place once every few years or so and causes the witches to gather together in what looks like a low-rent Comic-Con.<br/><br/>In the course of their investigations, Hans and sis are also easily able to destroy the ugly supernatural entities with little or no effort, thanks to superior weapons and clever patter that will not exist for at least another 700 years.<br/><br/>Shotguns, automatic pistols, hand grenades, Gattling guns and a crossbow that fires hundreds of arrows per minute - and in all directions - seemingly came from nowhere while characters use words like ""hillbilly,"" ""weird,"" ""awesome"" and the aforementioned ""F"" bombs.<br/><br/>The dialogue was obviously stolen from another Middle Age dud from a few years back, ""Your Highness,"" although I NEVER thought I would miss the subtle and nuanced acting abilities of Danny McBride. Compared to this script (""The only good witch is a dead witch""), that movie seems like Shakespeare.<br/><br/>And, if Hansel and Gretel are not bad enough, they are ""ably"" assisted by Ben (Thomas Mann, who appears as if he failed an audition to be the fifth member of the ""Big Bang Theory"" gang), as well as a giant troll who looks like a cross between Andre the Giant and Luis Guzman. They seem invincible (despite the inclusion of Thomas Mann). However, the group soon runs into a ""super"" witch, Muriel (Famke Janssen, ""Taken 2""), and the tables are suddenly turned.<br/><br/>Is there really a point in my continuing to describe the plot of this pointless endeavor? Do we care that Hansel's hatred of witches borders on the sociopathic and makes him look like an Old World version of a red-necked Southern bigot during the Civil Rights era? Do we care that Gretel discovers a terrible secret about her own mother as well as herself? Do we care that Hansel isn't a very good swimmer? Do we care about ANY of this ludicrous nonsense? The answer is a resounding and unequivocal ""no,"" my friends. <br/><br/>Had any of the basic elements of filmcraft (acting, direction, story) been even slightly evident here, I could dismiss this movie's faults as just a terribly mediocre January release and been done with it. There are so many glaringly awful things about this motion picture, however, that my obligation as a critic – and a human being - behooves me to warn the paying public to avoid this travesty at all costs.<br/><br/>Then, with an extra $3 to $5 being charged for viewing in 3D, the general public is being taken for a ride in this department, too, considering this technology adds nothing to the experience because mainly the movie is so dark, drab and depressing no one can tell what is going on, anyway.<br/><br/>This is especially proved by the concluding battle, which is a confusing, obscured mish-mosh of people and things being tossed about with little or no audience comprehension or even the slightest concern for anyone or anything by that point.<br/><br/>After a very successful film run, including a pair of Academy Award-nominated performances, it may have been time for Renner to suffer a slight career letdown - it's just a shame all of us had to witness it."

","I can understand the movies poor reception and reviews however its one of those movies which you can't help but enjoy anyway. Its extremely fast, witty and has an unprecedented amount of gore. The action is plenty full and it has a simple storyline that plays on a classic fairytale. Although it has a serious tone it doesn't take itself seriously. Instead we get a fun, gruesome and entertaining action/horror movie. Arterton and Renner are strong in there roles and the witches are imaginative but familiar. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter makes good use of its cast, creates some bloody mess all in a really fantasied and exacerbated 19th century."

","Mini-Review: Last night we watched 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'. I found it to be a fun movie for the most part. It reminded me very much of the '2004' film 'Van Helsing'. If you liked that, you might like this also. They had the same sort of fantastic weapons as Van Helsing did, seemingly impossible for the time periods depicted. There were more witches in this movie than you can shake a broomstick at . Most were appropriately scary or weird looking. The acting was good and there was plenty of action. There was some gore, not too excessive, enough to earn its R-rating I suppose. Occasionally the language seemed a bit out of place, just like the weapons were, for the time. For instance when under-stress our two heroes liked to use the F word. No big deal, just that it somehow seemed out of place, and too contemporary for the surrounding mood. The ending left the door open for a sequel or two if it was a success at the box-office. I did like the friendship that developed between Gretel and an unlikely character in the story. There was also a love story with Hansel. Both side stories added some ""charm"". I don't want to say more and reveal too much."

The only two valid reasons for seeing this dung heap, at least they were to me, were Famke Janssen and Gemma Arterton....and that's it I got nothing else! Going in I thought this will be one of those early new-year releases which movie studios always dump quickly and without great fanfare...its almost like an embarrassment dump slash quick cash grab...but ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is too slimy and its stench to powerful for something like that! And boy, does it stink!!! One of the crummier movies I've seen in a while and more wasted time than I would have cared to!

","Witches beware because hell hath no fury like a pair of siblings out for some supernatural blood. Now, everyone pretty much knew the story of two kids who escape the wrath of a cannibal witch living in a candy house in the middle of the woods, but what happens after that is revealed in this movie: Hansel and Gretel become witch hunters. Heh, as if Red Riding Hood meeting werewolves wasn't crazy enough.<br/><br/>So the plot goes that after years of hunting witches, the title characters come across a town and get hired by the local mayor to take of a strange matter of witches, led by the wicked grand witch Muriel, kidnapping children for a sinister purpose. As Hansel and Gretel soon learn that this is no ordinary case of a witch infestation, can a dark secret from their past prove to be their salvation or their undoing?<br/><br/>Right from the start, the two protagonists are likable as well as very tough. They actually do act like brother and sister, having a good time while having the occasional disagreement. The weapons they use are insane and the action scenes are a load of fun, fast-paced and lots if gore and destruction. The music fits very well too, complementing a lot of the action that goes on. The witch Muriel is actually a good villain, enjoying every little evil deed she pulls off and seriously messing with our heroes. Throw in a little humor, a couple of nice twists, and excellent special effects (from the CG to the monstrous design of the witches) and you have one fun fairy tale roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the better reinterpretations of classic fairy tales out there that I have seen and worth a watch, so check it out!

","It has been some time since I was exposed to how these things work. A clever writer can start with anything and extend it toward a known formula so that it animates that formula with a new disguise. In this world, the writers are witches.<br/><br/>So, one can well imagine the challenge here: target the currently popular formula: brash small group battles (with fists and old fashioned weapons) an organized army of evil. Anchor it in something known that already connects with dreams and inner fears. Implement it with noise and bravado.<br/><br/>The only thing of interest here is how clever were the writers.<br/><br/>Good witch with red hair and nudity, and who falls (but not permanently) with the guy hero?

","I have to confess I didn't actually see this movie. That was the only reason I gave it a 3. Yes, I did pay for a ticket, bought popcorn and sat through the trailers. I did watch the introduction and the opening titles. I did witness Hansel and Gretel's first hunt in the village whatever and their first clues about the witches' plans. I did witness Jean Grey tear a man apart with tree branches, and then cause another one to explode after he ate a gazillion worms. I left the theater then and there. If I had stayed any longer, I would've probably thrown up. In the 20 minutes I lasted, more or less, I was able to discover many faults in this movie. I didn't come in expecting a nominee for next year's Oscars. I was aware that this was a ridiculous take on a (pretty gory and horrifying on its own) fairy tale with pointless action and semi-attractive actors trying to make a profit. And who doesn't enjoy these two elements a nice long weekend? I knew it was going to be bad, just not ""if I don't storm out now I'll vomit and not eat for the next two days"" bad. The effects were sloppy, the script poor and full of anachronisms (hillbillies?), and the make-up effects seemed like they were done by complete amateurs. It all mounted up to a creepy, pointless and extremely disgusting image.I have a high tolerance for bad movies,so I can honestly say that this was the WORST movie I have seen, and leaving the theater was one of the smartest decisions I have made in my life.

","I don't know what people went in expecting. But my expectations were above average and I got more than I had hoped for. it's not a perfect film by any means but delivers on what the title promises. it's a fun, gory, silly fantasy horror flick. The film centers on the classic story of Hansel and Gretel and picks up after that tale as they are now a brother and sister team of bad ass witch hunters. They are hired by a town because children have been taken and come upon a devilish plot that is surprisingly unique. I'm not sure what all the bad buzz is about there is a fare amount of development for a film of this kind. And most of all it's just fun. It's a quick flick at 88 mins. So it doesn't over stay it's welcomes Jeremy Renner and Gemma Armeton (better than she's ever been) have a decent amount of chemistry and deliver raunchy but fun dialogue with a sarcastic pizazz. Famke Janseen hams it up as the grand witch in her best role in a while, The fight scenes are well choreographed and the direction is promising from Tommy Wirkola of the awesomely fun Dead Snow. Sure it could have been a bit more fleshed out and there is a bit too much reliance on the f bomb as a joke but it works. Most of all the film possesses a dark kinetic energy that doesn't shy away from the gooey dark stuff which is really commendable from a major studio considering how much genre films have become annoyingly censored. All in all a great time and leaves it open for sequels of which I hope they will make. 3.5/5"

","Recently, we've become accustomed to seeing two types of fantasy romps – the darker ones such as 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and the less- serious, genre-mashup, particularly Timur Bembakatov's 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. Consequently, it's unsurprisingly that Hansel and Gretel would make it to the big-screen once more, however, with this film, they can't be said to fall into either category, but conversely, both. It's just unfortunate that the movie doesn't really work as either.<br/><br/>Diluted down to its basics, the story is something that would intrinsically appeal to a younger audience, due to its fairytale roots, but here it has been given a more 'grown-up' treatment which means brash swearing, nudity and of course, violence. Subsequently, this graphic content is done in too childish a manner to make the film an 'adult' one. At the same time, it attempts to maintain a dark and grim atmosphere to possibly scare viewers, which fails, incidentally. Then, on top of this, there are scenes intended to be ones of genuine emotion to make you empathise with the characters and also scenes that strive to parody the fantasy genre. All of these elements are things that might just work together, but here feel rather disjointed. Also, it's been said that to properly make a parody of something you need to truly love it, but here, such scenes feel quite crass.<br/><br/>I'm aware that this movie is not supposed to be a high-brow work of art, it's supposed to be a slice of enjoyable fantasy adventure, and don't get me wrong, I love a good fantasy romp as much as the next man (I even have a soft spot for 2004's 'Van Helsing') and often relish a nice dollop of violent (and somewhat silly) action, having thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's adaptation of '300'. Yet, I'd struggle to relate this film to being anything remotely close to enjoyable; I frequently tried to enjoy this movie, but couldn't find any cause to, with my interest consistently drifting off.<br/><br/>The action scenes are remarkably unremarkable, with editing that mightn't be out of place in a Michael Bay actioner and overstuffed with flimsy CGI. The characters themselves are unengaging, with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arteton striding around with American accents that just confounded me, as other players such as Peter Stormare (who can do much better than this) have thick European accents. The creature make-up and design was nothing special and the ogre look unbelievably cheap. If you want to properly do fantasy creatures, just look at someone like Guillermo del Toro. But most significantly, the film was deathly dull, boring, and frankly, forgettable."

","I wasn't expecting anything when I watched this movie in theater. Here is my advice for any person who's looking on IMDb if it is worth to be seen : run run run!!!!!!!!. I know ""Hansel and Gretel"" might not be the worst movie of all time, but it is definitely one of them. The acting is shallow (I suspect the actors weren't convinced themself of the scenario), the medieval contemporary / atmosphere is a mess ( ""Van Helsing"" replica but much worse ), and god all I can remember really about the movie is that tons of of ketchup and strawberry jam spammed at every single minute of the movie, looking to put any sense in this glorious mess ""Hansel and Gretel"" - Witch Hunter...<br/><br/>I struggled to not leave during the movie, having some hope for a potential sparkling in the scenario, which will save the day... but really everything is predictable. Even my husband passed out on the first quarter of the movie. You will not see any memorable speech/scene/atmosphere in this popcorn movie. The dark tale of ""Hansel and Gretel"" that I read once when I was young has nothing to do with this thing. I put one star, for the make-up artist of the witches ( can't put 0 anyway )."
"TheUnknown837-1","6","11","21","25 January 2013"," ""Hansel & Gretel"" is a pretty dopey movie, and the 3D just makes it dopier
","The nicest thing about ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is the casting of its two leads. Jeremy Renner, one of the most worthy of rising stars in Hollywood today, has an uncanny ability to slide into any role thrown his way by doing little more than just playing off his own personality. He's got a rugged quality reminiscent of Steve McQueen. Opposite him is Gemma Arterton, who also has a charismatic, easygoing appeal when placed in front of a motion picture camera, and who seems to have built most of her success by appearing in violent medieval-set movies such as this. Had she been a bigger name fifteen years ago, she would have probably wound up somewhere in Peter Jackson's lavish ""Lord of the Rings"" films, and it's kind of funny she wasn't in last year's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" And both Mr. Renner and Miss Arterton can, as they demonstrate at one point in the movie, bond on-screen. The highlight of the movie consists of them reuniting in a remote cabin in the woods, embracing each other. They really do seem to love and care about one another.<br/><br/>It's a shame that's the only time they are allowed to show any sense of sibling bondage, as they spend the rest of the movie falling out of trees, getting the tar beaten out of them, and being plastered with exploding body parts. ""Hansel & Gretel"" follows in the tradition of many contemporary medieval, blood-soaked epics: it's completely overproduced. The dialogue is overwritten and punctuated with about two dozen too many swear words, a lot of the make-up meant to make blood-thirsty witches look intimidating comes across, by contrast, as rather corny. The witches hiss and grunt like comic-book critters. And the movie is more concerned about making silly jokes (a villager popping like a balloon and plastering a pub with his insides while the local fan-boy remarks, ""That was awesome!"") than creating a sense of adventure. There's a lot of computer-enhanced tweaking to the picture, to make the witches look even uglier, and it too pushes the film's visual presentation overboard. Maybe the filmmakers of the 1970s and 80s medieval pictures would have wallowed in this computer technology if it were available at the time, but their advantage was, oddly enough, not having it in their possession. For it forced them to use their ingenuity and utilize the genuine magic of practical effects such as full-fledged make-up and props. I personally have always been more intimidating by a movie-monster when I realize it's actually there with the actors, not painted in with a computer four months after production ended. The one exception is a big friendly troll named Edward who forms a sort of ""King Kong""-esque friendship with Miss Arterton. What the computer artists do with the character's eyes, in particular, is really effective, and I found myself caring a whole lot more about this ten-foot-tall critter than any of the little kids the witches were planning to devour.<br/><br/>Next to the actors, the stuff I liked best consisted of the alternate-reality gadgets. Director Tommy Wirkola has set his story—his first one produced in the United States—in the sort of world that James Whale made popular with ""Frankenstein"" in the 1930s. He combines technology/life styles into a blend between ancient times and today. Hansel and Gretel hunt witches using crossbows as well as every variety of firearm known to modern-day man. Machine guns, included. If they only had an H-bomb on their hands, they would have really had it made. But that was also part of the fun, showing me a blend of two different worlds. At one point in the film, a temporary sidekick picks up one of their gadgets—a sort of old-fashioned taser gun—uses it to subdue a witch, and remarks, ""I like your toys!"" I concur.<br/><br/>Even though Hans Zimmer is credited only as the executive producer for the soundtrack and Alti Orvarsson for actually writing the music we hear, one can sense Mr. Zimmer's influence. His scores for Christopher Nolan's three Batman movies can even be heard poking their thump-thumpthump-thump-thump! motifs at certain points. This is not a detractor, as the music, no matter how much it shows its influence, is very good.<br/><br/>I would like to see Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton team up in another, better movie with a better sense of adventure. Yes, a ""Hansel & Gretel: Part II"" would be welcomed by me, if it improves upon its source. There are many definitions to a good adventure-movie, but the one I utilize is this: how much disbelief can I suspend? Most of these movies raise lots of logistics questions, but if it works on its own terms, I won't ask those questions until the movie's over. But if my interest becomes lost, those questions will start firing away like a machine gun. And they were firing away during ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters."" If Mr. Renner needs to inject a medicine into his leg every few hours and he spends most of his life in the wilderness, how does he replenish his supply? Does he ever run out? Why does it take one person a few hours to walk between a town and remote spot in the woods, and yet it takes the experienced Hansel and Gretel until nightfall to get to a cabin about halfway? I'm aware these sorts of questions are not welcomed—and I would have preferred not to ask them during the screening—but my attention span was constantly sputtering.<br/><br/>And I guess I might as well address the 3D. Not being a fan of the process, this go-around also failed to impress me. Even with globs of blood, fiery debris, and bullets launching from the screen. See the film in 2D, for nothing is really going to seem to be missing. ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a pretty dopey movie, and the 3D just makes it dopier."

","Unlike the music industry, films and increasingly games are released with very little accurate representation about the product. We buy the product relatively unseen, and as such film and game producers regularly produce tripe and expect us to swallow it, and why not, the old adage 'you'll never go poor pandering to the lowest Lowest common denominator' has never being more true. This is an attempt by the producers to make as much money as possible before word gets out how truly awful it is. I watched the trailer and like most, wasn't expecting anything thought provoking, more like 90 minutes of eye candy, and it is just that. However it is obvious from the first 10 minutes that there was absolutely no care, passion or personal investment in this film by anyone remotely involved in it's creation. I can easily believe that every scene is the first take of every performance the actors gave and the script was likewise unhindered by minor issues like editing and rewrites.<br/><br/>When the film came out I read very poor reviews almost immediately. but always try to make my own mind up. This said I wasn't about to pay to see it given the average low scores it was getting, and ended up waiting several months before a watchable copy appeared on the web. Which brings up an interesting point. Films, albums and games that are well made, tend to appear on the net instantly, possibly because the companies making them know that they will sell themselves and continue to make money over time because the product has value and consumers can see that and will invest in it because of that. Where as poor films, games and albums leave a bad taste and we don't feel compelled to reward the work of those involved in its creation, after all if they didn't care why should we. Of course everything is open to personal taste and perspective but more and more the issue of piracy is brought up as the demon of the web, when in fact in certain circumstances, it can help to uncover shady business practises and reveal the true intentions of unscrupulous corporations. So why shouldn't the public get a heads up before paying for something that we might not like. Unlike buying a game or album the cinema experience never suffers from people asking for their money back because the film was so bad, and why not?"

","Whenever I manage to predict more than three lines of dialogue right before the characters say it on screen, it's a sign that the movie isn't going too well for me.<br/><br/>Still for the better part of the movie, what annoyed me most was how utterly weak and beat up- able the two protagonists were in contrast with their portrayals from the trailer. Gemma Arterton's Gretel has the uncanny yet wonderful covetable ability to take incredible amounts of hits, slaps, punches, elbows, and outright diver-hammer blows--mostly in her face--without sustaining any visible mark that lasted more than two scenes. For a tough, burly witch hunter guy who didn't take prisoners, Jeremy Renner's Hansel has a poorly explained and even more careless paid off medical condition that requires a completely unexplained yet miraculous cure- -the situation and stakes of which he outright explains the to a woman who was inexplicably two thousand times more attractive than her fellow town folks, who later, after Gretel proclaims his inability to swim, finds it incredibly appropriate to take off her clothes and lead him into a neck-high pond. Oh but he saved her life at the beginning of the story, so it all made sense.<br/><br/>Which leads to another complaint I wish to make. This is an R-rated movie that markets gore, monster make-up and good cleavage, but except for some exploding human bodies and witches being deconstructed through various ways and means, I found it hard to hook on to more than a couple of minutes' worth of adrenaline rushes. Said rushes, unfortunately, was all I came to see and was willing to spend time on. The witches were definitely not bewitching to look at, and we get a beautiful shot of aforementioned lady's back--best part of the entire movie hands down--but it just kinda ends there. <br/><br/>Looking beyond the identity crisis of the two protagonists which seems to sway unpredictably from hero to anti-hero to childhood abuse victims and then to sex symbols (where they belong), the very viewer-friendly plot that allows its audience to gain about 50 minutes' head start 5 minutes into the movie, and the wonderfully anachronistic gadgets they were able to collect along their journey to adulthood, you will find--well basically you will find the ending credits."

","Tommy Wirkola's bizarre fantasy remake of Grimms' Hansel and Gretel story has a less than encouraging start. By minute three it's clear Wirkola has drawn his audience into a dark fantasy universe, though which one is unclear. Hansel and Gretel's entrance into the candy cottage feels too much like falling down the rabbit hole, while the witch resembles a goblin that could have come straight out of The Lord of the Rings, making clicking noises curiously similar to that of Alien's monster. <br/><br/>Admittedly, the filmmakers do try to hook us with a dramatisation of the canonical witch's fatal moment. For our heroes Hansel and Gretel (played as adults by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton respectively) the fiery climax of Grimms' story was simply the beginning of Wirkola's. Brother and sister, now famous witch hunters, must thwart a cult of witches in their plan to become resistant to fire. But you don't watch movies like this for the plot, so I won't harp on about those kinds of howlers.<br/><br/>Except there's little to praise elsewhere. It's predictably predictable, boringly shot, with some shameful exposition and cartoonish conflict. The score is uninspired - its similarity to rock music is particularly grating. Convincing and at times rather delightful seventeenth century sets are ruined by embarrassing Americanisms that make the rare attempts at a Germanic accent absurd: ""Set her a$$ on fire"", ""that Gretel b*tch"", and (my personal favourite), ""f*ckin' hillbillies!"". It's lazy dialogue at its extreme; Wirkola, director and writer, substitutes adding real meaning with a swear word or two. Hansel's lover bleeds in his arms, and all the dying beauty can say is, ""Kill the f*cking b*tch.""<br/><br/>Lazy writing, lazy characters. Renner, brilliant though he is, can't do anything with his role; Hansel is only interested in hunting women and, well, shagging them, and solves all his problems by using people as punching bags. The audience is taunted with the possibility of a powerful female lead, one of whose first acts is to headbutt the sheriff right in the face. It's pleasantly surprising that the director doesn't give all the fighting to the action-savvy, Bourne and Hawkeye star. However, the script soon degenerates into making good use of Arterton's boobs in a painfully unnecessary cleavage-cleaning exchange. <br/><br/>The duo's gender roles work no better together. Hansel is out getting laid, sadly off screen, while Gretel is the strong yet subdued damsel in distress who's almost raped by a second-tier villain. Gretel ends up being saved throughout: by Hansel, by the teenage fanboy who touched her boobs, even by a deus ex machina troll and then, imaginatively, by the troll again. <br/><br/>Secondary characters that at set-up seemed important are dispensed with in slapstick fashion - a brave Game of Thrones tactic, you might think, but it only highlights how superfluous these characters were from the get-go, born to end up as a screenplay mess brushed under the carpet midway through the film. <br/><br/>Well, maybe you won't watch it for the characters. ""Dark fantasy action horror comedy,"" reads the wiki page, without a single comma to conceal its ambitious and confusing genre. With ill-timed jokes and botched tension, comedy and horror are off the table, but you may as well see it for the action, right?<br/><br/>Wrong. Even primarily as a mindless, one-time action movie Hansel and Gretel fails. The fight scenes are occasionally inventive, always predictable, and mostly comprised of middle aged, costumed Halloweeners tumbling in roly-polies on the floor. The special effects are unbelievable at best, comedic at worst. Cranberry juice blood is squirted all over set as an entire man explodes like a balloon, a meal of children soup is served, and a henchman is dismembered and decapitated all in the same move. With its archetypal characters and cloying one-liners butting in on all the cheap 15-rated gore, the film straddles the awkward position between child's fairy tale and teenage action flick, and a bad one at that. <br/><br/>It would be harsh to say the film wasn't made entirely without thought, though. A shiny red apple alludes to Snow White, the ""not too cold, not too hot"" porridge is a cameo of Goldilocks, yet quite what purpose these references serve is more unclear. The anachronisms of this early modern landscape are baffling too. The hunters' weapons would look more at home in The Avengers - Renner's leather get-up is laughably reminiscent, but don't worry, Arterton sports the high tech crossbow to make it less obvious. But when Hansel rolls into the wood-and-hut village with his machine gun, I lost it.<br/><br/>Sadly the film escalates not in meaning or intensity but in kills-per-second, with a kind of video game attitude that clings to the mantra 'gore is more'. Gretel's conspicuously absent from most of the violent denouement, since she is finishing up the only meaningful plot of the movie: the romance between her and her deus ex machina troll (perhaps an intelligent nod to Beauty and the Beast, but the debate's still out).<br/><br/>When it becomes more fun to write about a film's blunders than it is to watch the film itself, it should probably be consigned to the 'never speak of again' pile of high budget movies with high class actors that just couldn't make the effort. Still, it's not beyond me that the film turned some $200 million profit, with Snow White and the Huntsman pulling more or less the same the previous year. Perhaps there is something compelling about realising our fairy tales in film, though hopefully Hansel and Gretel is the one-too-many that makes us rethink fantasy cinema. Who knows, it might just be worth it for that topless scene of Renner, but there's always a GIF or two from Bourne to make up for that."

","When someone claims to re-imagine something in Hollywood, it's a sure sign the person has no imagination. If you can't come up with something of your own, you may as well ruin someone else's stuff.<br/><br/>This movie is a boring, meandering, poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly choreographed, poorly filmed, poorly costumed, poorly arted (is that a word) crap fest. It would be OK if it was funny or fun, but it's neither of those.<br/><br/>For half the movie, guns and other weapons work on the witches. Then, suddenly, they become impervious to guns and other weapons. The witches' big plot is to make themselves impervious to fire. They need the top white witch's heart to do that. But that doesn't matter because the good guys find a book that lets them bless weapons, so the weapons again work on the witches (like the weapons worked in the first half of the movie).<br/><br/>There's a back story about H and G's mom being a good witch who wouldn't run last time the evil witches tried to become impervious to fire. Oh yeah, their original plan was to have the towns folk burn H and G's mom, which would have destroyed her heart. The witches wouldn't have been able to use the heart to make them impervious to fire.<br/><br/>Ah, the story makes no sense."

","After the first 10 minutes I switched off. The story was just so ridiculous but that was not the thing that turned me off. The ""technology"" in the film was so far ahead of the era the story takes place in that one starts wondering if they are even on EARTH! Gatling guns didn't appear until the 1800's - 500 years later! They never even had bullets in those days. Only steel balls, one shot, one reload, at a time. So where did that massive belt of bullets for the Gatling gun come from? Half way through the film I was waiting for the nuclear weapons and the infra red scopes to make an appearance as the story progressed, or perhaps a Stealth bomber to land somewhere and take them away. Just ridiculous.<br/><br/>This is not a family film. It has swearing which is offensive and unnecessary rather than appropriate or realistic to the era of the story telling. Why did they do that? To offend? Obviously. And there is the blood and guts, NOT suitable for children. Overall a nasty little film, and a perversion of the original story, designed to insult your intelligence and take your money. For the producers and the studio this film is merely a thinly-disguised ""get rich quick scheme."" It sure ain't a good movie!"

","I hate to say I walked into this the theater showing this film with low expectations. The promotional material made me think of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead but there were few laughs if any in this film and Jeremy Renner is no Ash Williams. Hansel and Gretel's parents are murdered by witches and the duo find themselves at the house made of candy after wandering the Bavarian forest for a time. The owner of the house turns out to be a witch who tries to fatten up Hansel and makes Gretel a slave. They get the better of her and push the witch into an oven, establishing that fire is the greatest weakness of witches. They grow up killing witches in various towns for bounties using explosives, piano wire, firearms, and other violent ways. In the town of Augsburg, they encounter the biggest and baddest of them all, Muriel (Famke Janssen), who has a plan to strengthen the witches' magic against their old weakness through the abduction and sacrifice of a dozen town children. <br/><br/>The funniest moment of this movie is the initial encounter between Hansel and Gretel and the imbecilic Sheriff Berringer. Other than that it's all violence and a few lame one liners. Jeremy Rennner doesn't have Bruce Campbell's self-deprecating charisma and Gemma Arterton is a lovely woman but seems trouble showing any emotion beyond surprise. I found myself fighting to stay awake at times. This movie was a chore to watch and the cost of 3d for this kind of movie is a waste."

I know that it wasn't the point of the film to be historically accurate. I get it. They wanted to make an action film, but the action was just awful, too. <br/><br/>I used to really enjoy Jeremy Renner. I like him when he plays roles where he doesn't let his inner asshole loose. He does that in this movie, and I really don't like it. Gemma Arterton is totally flat. Actually, nobody has any dimension in this garbage flick.<br/><br/>Action movies are some of my favorite things to watch when the action is believable and not too over-the-top. The violence is really stupid, and it's kind of surprising that Hansel and Gretel can even kill witches, because it always seems that they are getting their asses handed to them. <br/><br/>Just wait until it's at Redbox.

","The best thing this movie has is that only runs for 88 minutes so there is no chance to get bored.<br/><br/>But this is also its weakness, because if its duration is 88 minutes and those minutes are full of action, there is no way you can go deep on the characters. They are completely flat. Hansel only sees thing black and white, but when life starts showing him the grey areas of things, he don't have any trouble accepting them. Gretel is the one with almost emotions, because she thinks of her mother and father, but there is no big deal about it. And when she learn some truth about their past, she just go with it, no trouble with that either.<br/><br/>The problem with character without emotions is that they cannot connect with the audience. And if the audience doesn't connect with your protagonist, they won't care whether they live or die on action. I have no sympathy with any of them so I didn't care if anyone dies.<br/><br/>The story isn't so powerful either. They have a life; they kill witches for a living. Why are these witches so important? They are not. This is just another job, one job that will make them learn some truth about themselves, but as I said, they didn't care about that either, so no big deal, just, let's kill some witches.<br/><br/>What is really good is the action. All sequences are great and entertaining, which I think is the most important thing. Production values are awesome, the special effects, the settings, make up, everything is cool. And the best thing is the R rating. Is blood everywhere, which makes sense because if you're telling a story about two hunters whom kill their prey by cutting the head and turning them in fire, the less you can do is show some blood and head exploding. That is great, a lot of heads exploding, blood everywhere. It's an action movie and a bloody way to kill the victims so it makes sense that the movie becomes that gory.<br/><br/>But what I couldn't stand was the guns. This a medieval or something like it movie. Why the hell there are guns, shotguns and even a machine gun maxim. People lives in huts, ride on horse and use arrows, but when thing get messy they use a shotgun and some 50 caliber bullets. It doesn't make sense and I hate when filmmakers can't adapt themselves to the period they are setting them own story.<br/><br/>I would suggest you to wait for the DVD and see it in your sofa with some popcorn. But there are always people who likes going to the movies and see this kind of movie. But I can guarantee that there is nothing special about this one and when you see it you will only remember it for 24 hours."

I'm all in favour of updated 'takes' of traditional tales and spinning out alternative story lines on classics - but creatively; otherwise it's just a disservice to a tale which teaches children about self-empowerment in terrible circumstances (courtesy of the extensive work of Bruno Bettelheim, we have an understanding now of the importance of traditional fairy tales, even those which are traditionally gruesomebut FOR A REASON!) and when they have NO weaponry, with only their wits to defend themwhat a travesty of THAT teaching, this is.the only 'redeeming' aspects are the contributions of the Art Department, otherwise the lowest review I've given any movie, ever, and to which I'll add a resounding UGH!!!"
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","7","14","13 March 2013"," The first pleasant surprise of 2013.
","With Oscar season fast approaching and all hopefuls well and truly into their theatrical release all over the world, it's time for the pseudo-intellectuals to step back and let films for the everyman once again take centre stage. Among the first out of the blocks in 2013 is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, following the dark-spin-on-dated-fable footsteps of Red Riding Hood and Snow White and the Huntsman. <br/><br/>On paper, the film looks like self-serving garbage, platitudinous in tone and one that may struggle to hold even the attention of its assumedly pre-teen target audience. What it actually is is a veritable goldmine of rip-roaring popcorn entertainment, so outrageous in execution yet so disciplined in pacing that it becomes increasingly easier to immerse oneself with each passing second.<br/><br/>The film opens with a minimalist retelling of the classic fairytale, as a young Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) outsmart their first witch, burning her alive and escaping her candied fortress with limbs and brain intact. Fast forward two decades and the pair have become national celebrities, selling their bounty hunting services to concerned civilians. <br/><br/>Packed with creative and beautifully choreographed action and with some gleaming profanity scattered in for good measure, Hansel and Gretel is a welcome stray from the labours of 'historically accurate' storytelling, as the sheer audacity of the project permits- if not, encourages- the audience to quickly ignore the siblings' modern American accents and mounds of firepower at a time where light bulbs remain closer to witchery than reality.<br/><br/>Excessive amounts of blood and gore punctuate every action sequence, giving the film Tarantino-esque levels of violence, while it takes itself about as seriously as any QT film in the process. The script is banal at best, but it refuses the temptation to drown its audience in cringe-worthy one-liners. Instead, it accommodates the plot neatly; one that is surprisingly well structured, with its fair share of novel twists to boot. At 88 minutes, the film lacks pretension and bloatedness- a nice touch amidst growing studio opinions that 'the longer the better.'<br/><br/>Nitpicking a little further reveals some disruptive gaps in editing, but the tangibles definitely play second fiddle to the overriding emphasis on visceral, fleeting fun. Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","7","15","7 February 2013"," Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton in leather! Now that I've got your attention...
","Don't listen to the critics. Do they know how to have fun? Unlikely. And that's exactly who this film is for - those who wanna have fun (and not just girls either). I haven't seen Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (which seems to keep getting mentioned in the same breath as this movie), but instead of Honest Abe in his funny hat killing vampires, this film has Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton playing kick-arse siblings Hansel & Gretel, who dispatch witches and look good doing it. For that reason alone, it has the edge. I quite enjoyed it, to be honest. There were plenty of funny moments/lines, as well as a good bit of violence.<br/><br/>Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters may sound silly to some, but like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you have to be a certain type of person to appreciate the irony in the film's title. I for one appreciated seeing the untold story of what happened after the young Hansel & Gretel's encounter with the witch and gingerbread house. It actually makes *sense* that they grew up to be bad-arse witch hunters. Afterall, who can blame them for holding a grudge against those of the broomstick-flying kind after what they were put through as kids? It certainly left a lasting impression on them. Hansel's a diabetic (a result of being force-fed candy by the witch as a child) and Gretel's having bizarre dreams about her mother. Not to mention both think they had the worst parents EVER, after their father dumped them in the middle of a creepy woodsy woods. Of course, there's more to the story than is first let on.<br/><br/>Gemma Arterton is really good in the role of Gretel. And it can't be said enough: she looks damn fine in leather. She probably gets the best one-liners of the film, including but not limited to her opening line and then the bit at the very end, where they're off somewhere killing a witch, and after they've shot her, we get the witch's POV looking up at Gemma, who says something about fearing it won't be an open casket and then it cuts to the end credits. Loved her last line in the movie. Some might complain about Gretel getting kidnapped towards the end, and her brother having to rescue her...except she's proved all movie that she can more than handle herself. Whether it be getting splattered by an exploding guy or taking a beating from several guys and then giving as good as she gets. Gemma plays Gretel as awesome, but vulnerable. Best of all? She gets to deliver the final blow to grand witch Muriel. I liked the sibling banter/dynamic. They clearly care about each other first and foremost, and it shows. The actors have an easy-going chemistry and bounce off one another perfectly. They were quite believable as brother and sister. <br/><br/>Speaking of Jeremy Renner, he was pretty good too. Although he's somewhat of a 'witchophobe', he and his sister save suspected witch, Mina (Pihla Viitala) and a bit of a thing begins between the two. She's mysterious, and what we see of their burgeoning relationship is quite good. It doesn't end up where you might think, though. Gretel also has a 'love interest' of sorts (though not in the traditional sense) in the form of Edward the troll (Hansel's line, after hearing his name for the first time, is amusing). The look of the troll is interesting, much more human-like than the average troll. He has a soft side to him and saves Gretel. What sets him apart from other creatures is his animatronic head. Also helping Hansel & Gretel out is Ben (Thomas Mann). While he starts off as merely their fanboy, and tries to cop a feel with Gretel, by the end he proves his worth and they learn to appreciate him/his assistance.<br/><br/>There's a fair bit of CGI, but make-up plays a vital part in the film. Former Bond bad-girl & Jean Grey from the X-Men movies, Famke Janssen, playing head witch, Muriel, is an example of this. She and her fellow witches come in all different shapes and sizes, but one thing they have in common? They're all FUGLY. Except, of course, when Famke's looking like her normal self - then she is anything but. She isn't afraid to camp it up, and if you can forgive her wandering accent, then she makes for quite a good villain. Peter Stormare, on the other hand, goes over-the-top...and not in a good way (much like his role in that other fairytale-based film, The Brothers Grimm). Everybody else seems almost dead serious in comparison to his horrible character, who gets what he deserves. <br/><br/>Cussing in the movie is used sparingly, and is the better for it. When it happens, it's unexpected, and therefore more effective. Another plus? The movie's only about an hour and a half, so it won't give you a headache. In this day and age of overlong movies that are unnecessarily drawn-out, this film was a breath of fresh air. It felt like it was an appropriate length and didn't overstay its welcome. I also liked the opening credits, with the paper cut-outs/newspapers/old style drawings explaining the Hansel & Gretel story after they'd escaped from the witch's house.<br/><br/>By the end, brother and sister have learned that not all witches are 'bad' (so Glinda from The Wizard of Oz is safe. The Wicked Witch of the West? Not so much). If only Hansel & Gretel had been around in modern times, they could've turned their attention towards the Charmed sisters and spared us that affront to good television. Speaking of, since this movie sadly probably won't get a sequel (though it definitely deserves one), they should at least do a TV show spin-off (though they'd be hard-pressed to beat Renner and Arterton in the roles). It might not win any awards, but it's destined to become a cult hit."

If you're not looking for something in the same category as ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" (or perhaps the first Kill Bill movie) then you probably won't like this movie. <br/><br/>In fact, Hansel & Gretel has exactly the vibe that I expected from Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Van Helsing (and which those movies failed to deliver). It's ridiculous, absurd, over the top, and really fun to watch. <br/><br/>The biggest flaw was the poor set design in some scenes, as other reviewers have pointed out. I found it to be particularly noticeable in the climactic fight scene, where for a bit it looked like something out of an awful TV show. I'm not sure what they were thinking for that scene (you'll know it when you see it). <br/><br/>The script also has some distracting rough spots, but I thought that the actors did an excellent job with it. <br/><br/>Overall, if you like the trailer, you'll probably love the movie -- as long as you don't go in expecting Citizen Kane."

Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton aren't the best of actors and although they play siblings here there is an underline sexuality to their relationship. Nothing will take you by surprise with this rather trite storyline. The language is very modern and so doesn't sound anything like the way it should sound based on the character's surroundings. The blood spurting is bit excessive and exaggerative. This movie barely utilizes it's R rating, with about 5 'F' word uses and one tantalizingly brief nude shot of a supporting character, leaving me to believe that it would have been a better story with a PG 13 rating. Then perhaps they could have focused more on story rather than 3-D blood shots.<br/><br/>Nothing about the poster or trailer to this movie leaves you thinking that this will be a movie for the ages and so you don't jump into this with high hopes nor are you brutally disappointed by the flat fallen end result. It is everything you expect it to be. <br/><br/>This movie isn't all bad. It's corny, short and at some points stupid, but when you want an action movie to laugh at or to not think about then put this on and in an hour and a half you'll feel refreshed. 5/10"

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action hero movie set in the dark ages.

The special effects are top- notch, the sets very immersive, the camera moves just right, and the soundtrack solid.<br/><br/>However, the story is weak, the suspense even more so, the dialogs are no more than minimalist, and the characters very shallow, but well acted.<br/><br/>All of that being said, it's still excellent entertainment, especially on a large screen.

I saw trailers and was betting that this should be fun... indeed I was right!<br/><br/>The storyline was quite well written and left no plot holes as it was written by the same director, taking the original fairytale of Hansel & Gretel and further expanding it as if they had grew up and became hunters saving the world from witches! A few good twists and surprises are in store throughout but it knows it doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The acting from Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are great as always, they get a fair amount of screen time together they can show they're action chops and reel in their character into reality. The supporting cast was great as well, but it's Famke Janssen that does a top job as the villain of this story!<br/><br/>Visual Fx's are really well presentable and don't look so cheesy at all, the gory moments made me laugh heaps throughout the film. The creative weaponry shown here is really creative, it reminds me something out of Van Helsing world!<br/><br/>Overall, it's a solid action / comedy / horror that's made for adults and is a must watch for fans of Army of Darkness, Van Helsing and possibly the Underworld series!

","In 2009, Quentin Tarantino spiced up the holocaust with Inglourious Basterds. Last year, they tried spicing up Abraham Lincoln in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and it didn't work. Now they are turning Hansel and Gretel into witch hunters in, you guessed it, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. It's a step up from Abe Lincoln, which I thought was a big letdown because I loved the book. But this movie suffers from nearly everything that that movie did.<br/><br/>It's amazing that they got talents like Famke Janssen(What?), Peter Stormare (WHAT?), Gemma Arterton (WHAT?!), and Jeremy Renner (WTF!!!)in this contraption. I'm disappointed that all of you stooped to this low of a level. Not just you four but the rest of America, because you gave it money. For everyone, it is just a quest for cash. Renner is bored, hence why he is even here in the first place.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the hands of someone like Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton this might have worked. H&G is a movie that is trying to be other movies but it just isn't. There's nothing memorably funny about this, or anything memorable at all for that matter. <br/><br/>It's sort of interesting but I really couldn't help but scratch my head. 80 minutes feels like two hours. The acting is somewhat bland, and nobody gets anything to work with here. I guarantee that the thought process of this movie involved a guy playing a video game for a few hours. Because that is what watching this feels like. All this thing needs is a better script to get this cooking. Oh well, maybe in the sequel.<br/><br/>C"
"BernardGT","4","8","19","23 January 2013"," Not bad for this round of witch hunt!
","When Hansel and Gretel were young, they have seen a lot. Abandoned by their parents, nearly died from the past encounter with the evil witch and surviving the terrors are just part of their growing up process. Many years later, the sibling (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) who has earned plenty of remarks for their witch bounty-hunting, is back in the German town of Augsburg. The mayor of the town recruits them to investigate recent high witch activities in the area. Their investigation leads them to uncover the evil witch Muriel's (Famke Janssen) plan of sacrificing the local children for the ""Blood Moon"" ritual. Racing against in time, the sibling must save the children or the evil wizard will gain a step closer to immortality.<br/><br/>Directed by Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow), this twisted folklore is basically a letdown. With the help of the movie trailer, we have already seen how cheesy this movie is going to be. And the trailer is dead spot-on in regards to this issue. I am not sure if this movie is an attempt to incarnate previous failed legendary fairytale (read Red Riding Hood, Hoodwinked II, Van Helsing and The Wolfman) or this is something to laugh about in the next few weeks. But on the surface, this movie looks like a fast-paced ridiculous action flick that should do well by keeping its pace timely-well and minimizing the bumpy parts. Of course, I love this sort of ""enthusiastic"" action at times. In fact, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters delivers a pure goofy yet throughout entertaining popcorn flick.<br/><br/>While the action sequences involving punching, kicking and shooting arrow are genuinely intimidating, the movie possesses a lot of trouble of trying to avoid the aforementioned bumpy parts. The plot, written by The Harpers and Wirkola, is not doing a serviceable job of setting things into a good clock-motion. It does not justify the need to provide these characters with essential and believable background to build the character later, leaving a paper-thin characterization to follow. Another flaw in this movie is the plot inconsistencies which also lead to some plot holes. For an example, I was particularly baffled by the fact that the evil witch sort of announcing that her name is not worthy to be mentioned by everyone, yet I lost track of when the other characters happily called her name out – how ironic.<br/><br/>Even with the hollow writing to feel in, Wirkola has proved himself a capable man to stop this movie from going spiral downward even further. Also noted is the positive side of the movie where he does some commendable job of delivering enough blood and splatter, dark sense of comedic relief and fashionable action.<br/><br/>Dark, twisted and contemporary take of the popular Grimm's folklore, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is essentially a not bad fast-paced popcorn flick filled with inconsistencies, poor characterization, hollow writing but not without some decent fight scenes, splatter fiesta and mediocre entertaining bounty hunting."

Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton really took me away with their acting! Even though the story takes place at a village and woods, it still has a modern vibe to it, probably because of the high tech look of the weapons and the way Hansel and Gretel are dressed. Even though I'm not that impressed with Mina's (Pihla Viitala) acting, the cast is purely great. I actually had my friends over for Friday and we were all watching it (Note: it was probably the 8th time I saw this movie).

The gore isn't overdone and as i'm not a fan of ""horror"" it fell right into the 'almost comical' category. The right characters get their heads mushed, if you know what i'm saying. i'm confused by the bad reviews. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. The storyline flows, you'll root for the proper characters, it's not going to be nominated for an Oscar but hot damn, i will never regret pushing 'watch now'.

Hansel and Gretal was much better than I thought. The CGI was great and the storyline was good as well. My only complaint on the movie was it's short running time, 90mins I think. The movie would have easily been better as a two hour or more movie which would allow the story to expand in some areas and better tell some details that certain scenes needed. While the film itself was great and the story fit the running time, I felt that as I was really getting into the movie there wasn't much movie left.

","Now, why was I under the impression that this would be another of those teenage lovefest movies? It couldn't have been further from the truth. Perhaps that impression came from such movies such as ""Twilight"" and ""Red Riding Hood"".<br/><br/>But ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" turned out to be somewhat of a bloody and gory action / horror movie. And it was actually a great combination that worked out quite well. A very different and interesting take on a famous fairytale.<br/><br/>The story is about young Hansel and Gretel who are left in the woods, where they come upon a house made of candy. They are captured by the witch inside and fed candy to fatten them up. But they end up shoving the witch into the oven and killing her. Right, we all know (or should know) this fairytale. However, this movie deals with the siblings after they grew up and became deadly witch hunters.<br/><br/>Right from the very beginning there was adrenaline and action in the movie, and I will say that it actually never slowed down. The movie just kept going on straight ahead like a rampant freight train.<br/><br/>What really impressed me in the movie was the effects and the make-up. That was just off the charts. The witches had so many interesting and nice details that the movie should be watched more than once to take it all in. There was just something profoundly dark and ghastly about them, and it worked out so well. It was a thrill and a pleasure to witness the make-up and effects of the movie.<br/><br/>However, the movie wasn't all about the effects and make-up. The effort and details in the costumes and props as well was just mind-boggling. The whole village really looked real and seemed like something right out of the middle ages.<br/><br/>Well, ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" isn't all just great stuff, there were parts which I didn't really fathom or could fully wrap my head around. First of all, the particular time in which the movie is set, I don't really think that the F-word was around, but oddly enough it was being thrown around quite a lot, and that really brought down the dialogue in the movie a notch. It was inappropriate and quite unnecessary with all that vulgarity and profanity. The usage of the F-word and the MF-word was really inappropriate.<br/><br/>Secondly, I was a bit at a loss about the costume worn by Hansel. It seemed a bit out of the age in which the movie was set as well. It was just a bit overdone and seemed like they had found it lying around discarded on a ""Matrix"" set. It did look great though, it just wasn't fully appropriate or matching to the age of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, the weaponry - well, don't get me wrong, because it was interesting and spectacular to look at. But it seemed a little bit too advanced for the age. Yeah, I know, this is a fantasy movie, but still... Why would the weaponry technology have progressed that much, but the rest of the world was still stuck in the middle ages? It was a little bit strange. The weapons were cool to look at and were great in use on the screen, but just a tad out of place.<br/><br/>As for the cast in the movie, then I will say that they had put together a good ensemble of people. But it was without a doubt Famke Janssen (playing Muriel) who stole the show and totally carried the movie.<br/><br/>""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is an action-packed and adrenaline-filled action / horror movie, and it was a real treat to watch, both story-wise and effects-wise.<br/><br/>And on a final note, then this movie confirmed my suspicion, Edward is a troll!"

","This is additional to the story we all know from our childhood. Only instead of the traditional ending we witness Hansel and Gretel become steampunk mercenaries. For those who don't know, steampunk is genre of fantasy that features steam-powered machinery or inventions far ahead of their time. At any moment I thought for sure Hansel would whip out a hand powered cell phone and call his sister. This action packed romp is not for the kids, but geared for the adult action junkies. The acting is over the top, but that is part of its charm. Not my top pick for a movie but this could have been done a lot worse. Definitively a ""guy film"" with naked babes, tight leather, explosions, and dismemberment. There wasn't any surprises or big reveals, the plot is straight forward. Overall it would have been better to have just developed an original story than linking this to the Hansel and Gretel story.

","HANSEL & Gretel: Witch Hunters is on the surface a rip-off of The Expendables 2. The dialogue is just functional, risible and crude, and the action -- not to mention the abundance of blood splatter, and crushed and decapitated heads -- dominates most of the film.<br/><br/>The film certainly doesn't mince its action; in fact, it'll make director Quentin Tarantino blush.<br/><br/>Norwegian writer-director Tommy Wirkola, in his English-language debut, uses the Brothers Grimm's tale of child abandonment as a springboard to display his aptitude with medieval fantasy, tight leather clothes, face-changing witches and an arsenal of heavy weapons for the most enlightened of bounty hunters.<br/><br/>Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) dig deep into their souls to get rid of witches.Beneath the river of blood that permeates this film, however, lies the simple fact that two orphaned siblings are on a quest to find out what had become of their parents and why they were abandoned, in short, a search for their identities.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to get to that point, viewers will have to sit through an avalanche of violence. As one sibling says: ""Unleash hell.""<br/><br/>The film opens with Hansel and Gretel being carted into the woods by their father. He never comes back. Brother and sister walk into a home made of cake and dispose of the witch in it, thanks to their immunity from spells.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, diabetic Hansel (Jeremy Renner of The Avengers, The Bourne Legacy) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton of Quantum of Solace) are witch hunters.<br/><br/>The mayor of the small German town of Augsburg (in a nod to the tale's German roots) hires them to kill witches who have been abducting children for a sacrificial ceremony.<br/><br/>For a while, it's fun to see the male and female siblings working together to eliminate witches.<br/><br/>Both have equal strength and are well-equipped to deal with any event that arises, especially as they have weapons that emit arrows. That fun quickly disappears as their witch hunts involve only a huge amount of carnage.<br/><br/>Hansel says: ""Killing innocent women won't bring back the missing children."" He'll get to skinny dip with pretty Mina (Pihla Viitala), initially wrongfully accused of being a witch. <br/><br/>Mina later gets to spray bullets with a machine gun in a scene similar to that in The Last Stand.<br/><br/>Gretel finds an unlikely romance with a troll, Edward (Derek Mears), who's the Beast to her Beauty.

"EmmaDinkins","3","8","20","28 January 2013"," Chix Chat on Film Review: The Hansel and Gretel story continues.
","The movie industry is leaving vampires behind for a while and has started to focus on fairy tales. With two recent takes on Snow White, an upcoming Jack and the Beanstalk tale and now Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. This film is the continuation of their story and how their lives have evolved after their fateful defeat of the witch in the cottage made of candy. From what I had seen in the trailer my expectation was that the special effects would be amazing and in actuality they were. I saw the film in 3D and was satisfied that they met the quota with things flying off screen directly at me, mostly splintered wood but I did flinch a few times. The acting was not bad either, both Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) were portrayed straight and focused on the task at hand, nothing too over the top and the same goes for their primary nemesis Muriel (Famke Janssen). The problem with the story was that there was this major issue with incongruences. The weaponry used to snare witches was too advanced, even if you have to wind up a stun gun, it's still a stun gun. The era was tied to the time that witches were being burned at the stake, which in Salem was the late 1600s and the first gatling gun was not invented until around 1860. Congruence matters, I know this is as I stated originally an updated fairy tale, but I'm just saying. Had the story been truly updated and told during modern times it might have made more sense that they used automatic weaponry, I had less of an issue with the flying around on brooms since that is a witch staple. Then there was the whole Gretel being lost in the woods moment and then magically she is in a cottage. The story wasn't entirely awful, because it did make these familiar characters from a child hood fairy tale richer. It was entertaining and I liked that Gretel was a tough girl, but some things could have been done differently that would have me like it more than I did. This film would not lose anything if viewed on the Syfy channel in the comfort of your own home, in fact it would fit in nicely and be a slight step up because of the special effects. I give it a red light."
"caseymoviemania","3","17","52","23 January 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS (2013)
","Originally scheduled for March 2012 release, HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS was ultimately delayed for nearly a year. According to an interview, director Tommy Wirkola has stated that the main reason of the delayed release is the studio's (Paramount Pictures) decision to wait on Jeremy Renner to become a bigger name. Back then, he was only known for his breakout role in 2009's THE HURT LOCKER and considered not bankable enough for mainstream audiences in the US. Plus, he was cast in this movie before MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL, THE AVENGERS and THE BOURNE LEGACY. Now that the movie is finally arrived, I was expecting Wirkola's go-for-broke filmmaking style he had once displayed with such enthusiastic flair in 2009's DEAD SNOW. The good news is, Wirkola's US debut in HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is a hard-hitting, R-rated gorefest -- with plenty of hardcore violence, dark humor, goofy undertone and playful energy in a compact 88 minutes. The bad news is, this movie is terribly skimpy and just about everything here is done for the wrong reason.<br/><br/>When Hansel (Cedric Eich) and Gretel (Alea Sophia Boudodimos) are just kids, they wander around the deep forest after being left by their father (Thomas Scharff) and eventually ends up at the Gingerbread House. Well, as in this classic fairy tale, you should know how the story ends except that this movie offers a new twist: These two siblings manage to defeat and burn the witch where they are being held captive inside the Gingerbread House. Many years later, they grow up (now played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) and become professional witch hunters ever since.<br/><br/>They arrive in the German town of Augsburg, just in time to save the beautiful Mina (Pihla Viitala) from being wrongly executed as a witch by the arrogant Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare). Apparently these siblings are hired by the mayor (Rainer Bock) to hunt down an evil sorceress who has been kidnapping the town's children. They subsequently discovers that the missing children involves a Grand Witch Muriel (Famke Janssen), who is apparently has a bigger agenda of her own.<br/><br/>From the surface, it's actually interesting to see Wirkola is game enough to twist a classic fairy tale into a gun-toting gorefest. But his screenplay with D.W. Harper is sadly paper-thin and everything here seems to be executed like a failed TV pilot episode. Even the romantic subplot involving Hansel and Mina feels more like a gratuitous filler (not to mention an excuse to showcase a nude Pihla Vittala). While Wirkola's direction is fast and furious, his penchant to shoot the action scene up close with lots of rapid zooms and harsh editing is rather frustrating to watch for.<br/><br/>Despite being blessed with a decent $60 million budget, the movie looks surprisingly cheap. The forest setting looks as if they are executed for a stage production, while all the makeup effects and the costumes are more akin of some elaborate Halloween party. As for the cast, most of them are instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>The remaining saving graces here are two energetic performances from Jeremy Renner and especially Gemma Arterton. Wirkola's gleeful excess of over-the-top violence, as well as his F-bomb anachronisms has its certain entertainment values. Too bad that's not nearly enough to warrant this movie as a satisfying guilty-pleasure outing. It's a huge waste of opportunity, and a far cry from what Wirkola has done so well in DEAD SNOW.<br/><br/>www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"

I just came back from the movie theater and I have to say I'm impressed with such great technology this movie has. Special effects are awesome-- which should be expected, since it has a $50.000.000 budget. Filmmakers make a parallel with the original Hansel & Gretel story, adapting this version to an older audience. In fact, this movie is indicated for all ages, except young children who are easily afraid with monsters-- makeup department (or special effects department?) makes the witches very ugly. 88 minutes is enough time to develop the story, entertain and thrill spectator and end up with a corny dialog, something we could easily expect from this sort of movie. All in all, ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a great popcorn flick to enjoy some special effects and nice fighting scenes, but doesn't innovate that much.

Watching actors pretend to vomit on screen doesn't usually concern me much, but when the young guy throws up towards the end, even that is repulsive.<br/><br/>And then there's the stupidity. During the blatantly obvious and pathetic setup for a sequel, the Hansel character says something like ""they will know our powers. And know that we are coming to get them."" Powers? What powers? Hansel and Gretel appear to be the most incompetent, powerless, clueless dorks roaming the landscape, who spend the entire film getting their asses kicked by whoever wants to kick them.<br/><br/>And don't even think about the guns.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner was probably the only actor here with some claim to credibility, although ""The Bourne Legacy"" didn't do him any favours in that regard. But with this film, he seems to have set himself on the path to career destruction.<br/><br/>I give the film 1 star only because 0 stars doesn't seem to be an option. An excruciatingly bad film."

","Interesting concept, but poor execution. It's another movie where they've taken good actors/actresses and subjected them to a poorly written script and even worse direction (a la Natalie Portman in any of the new Star Wars movies).<br/><br/>The good: action sequences, pace of the movie (after the first 10 minutes), costumes, and sets.<br/><br/>The bad: script, dialog, acting, excessive oddly placed 'F' bombs, gratuitous gore, no back story in the beginning to set up the action. I could go on, but if you've seen it you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is a good actor and it's readily apparent that they signed him to what should be a B movie so that he could hopefully garner the producers some respectable box office returns or at least help to break even on the film. However, his acting skills as well as those of others in the film are overshadowed by the poorly written script and the lousy direction. Famke Janssen is another good performer, but as soon as she transforms into a witch her acting seems to transform, as well, and not for the better. Finally, Peter Stormare, who was great in Fargo and in Constantine, really lacks credibility in this movie. It almost seems as if some of the actors' cues are off.<br/><br/>The script of this film assumes that everyone knows the back story of Hansel and Gretel. While most people do, a voice-over lead-in at the beginning of the film would have helped the story along greatly and it would have set up the action a lot better. Other problems with the script, possibly plot holes, include whether or not Muriel was the same witch as the one at the beginning of the film (the dialog seems to hint at this) and the question of what happens with the wand that Gretel picks up later in the film. Perhaps some scenes were edited out that would have answered this, but, if so, why not edit out the scenes that raise the questions in the first place? Bottom line: not horrendous but not good either. Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, and Famke Janssen carry this movie, but despite their combined talents it still falls short."
"silverbillings","8","6","14","25 January 2013"," Great Spin of Horrible Child's Tale
","First of all let me say up front that I do not like the tale of Hansel and Gretel, not the Grimm's version or the sugar coated version we were told as children. However I was pleased with thee tale told in this movie. I am a pagan who has done plenty of research of the ""witch burning"" era in time, and found the movie's version to be pretty accurate on the rumors and such spread about. As far the as the makeup goes I wasn't too pleased with the makeup and costuming of the witches, though original and catching, I found the costumes clashing with the witches. Of course they were black, to show evil and darkness, and their makeup (not prosthetic but the actual makeup) was dark. The only witch's looks I liked was the main black witch, the other two ""main"" ones, the ones that are with her in capturing the children, I was not too impressed with. But that's my only real complaint with the movie, I'm a pretty good guesser on how movies are going to turn out - and love to try and tell the ending before the end comes along - and SOME things I just didn't see. I wish I could write more but the ending just made me smile. I'd recommend it, however keep in mind how bloody it is (I was shunned for laughing at some gory scenes by my fellow movie goers) and it has some strong language."

","This movie needed more story meat on it's plot bones. I sort of appreciated the concept but the film lacks character development and flow... They had the bad-ass that is Peter Stormare but failed us with him. With regard to the other actors: I personally find Renner to be a bore in everything and it was no different this time; at least Gemma ROCKED Gretel and Famke = fantastic. The effects were, overall, well done to me. One thing that irritated me quite a bit was Hansel and Gretel's fan boy, that kid would have been put down for being a legally retarded gooch in those times. All things considered, I'd say I expected less than what I got. I would say this is a matinÃ©e at best."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It's not without flaws and it certainly isn't going to be on any Oscar lists but it was genuinely good fun as long as you go into it knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>The story is pretty flimsy - Hansel and Gretel grow up and become witch hunters and have to stop an evil witch plot... that's pretty much it, really. A romance thrown in and an attempt at ""troubled pasts"" aside, the biggest criticism I have is that there ARE absolutely NO surprises along the way. <br/><br/>If anything, go and see this for the visuals. The effects are great and some real imagination went into all the different witch designs. The costumes are excellent and the set designs are pretty good too. This is a movie that does very well at creating a dark fantasy environment so if that's your thing then this is well worth a look.<br/><br/>Arterton and Renner are both enjoyable to watch(and both look good in leather touting crossbows!) and most of the minor roles are well played.<br/><br/>I'd say if you liked movies like the 2004 Van Helsing you will like this; I actually think this is a better film but it's that same slightly camp dark fantasy that relies on good looking leads and violence without ever taking itself too seriously."

"Leofwine_draca","5","2","3","11 June 2014"," Entirely unwieldy
","HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an entirely unwieldy comic book-style movie that sees the fairy-tale characters reinvented as VAN HELSING-style ass-kickers who hunt down and kill witches in various gory ways. The film has the same bright, fantastic look as the likes of other recent fare such as RED RIDING HOOD and it proves to be an entirely superficial adventure, and also one that's completely unwieldy.<br/><br/>First of all, the story is all over the place. Our heroes are smart asses throughout, happy dishing out one liners but struggling when they're required to provide anything more than that. The sub-plot involving their back story is a non-starter, as is the whole 'witch conspiracy' thing. Attempts to tie the story in to real-life witch cases like the infamous Salem trials are negated by the whole steampunk technology vibe going on; realistic this ain't.<br/><br/>So, what does the film have to recommend it? A ton of CGI-heavy action, that's what, which is neither here nor there really. A lot of it is over choreographed and it's occasionally a chore to sit through, particularly in that overlong and repetitive final fight scene. I hated how characters seem to be randomly indestructible, like Jeremy Renner who's stabbed twice in the stomach at one point only never to mention it again! Gemma Arterton is advertised as a tough ass-kicking heroine but turns out to be a mere damsel in distress, requiring rescue over and over again. The less said about Famke Janssen's villain, the better. I don't know who gives the worst performance as a witch in 2013; it's either her or Emma Thompson in BEAUTIFUL CREATURES.<br/><br/>The one thing the film has going for it is the bloodshed; this is R-rated produce so we get to see various characters killed in various bloody ways. There seems to be an emphasis on people exploding which is always good fun, and the introduction of a giant troll character into the storyline is an intriguing one. Hints at an incestuous sub-plot between the siblings are interesting even though they eventually go nowhere, and the film ends up petering out completely at the end. HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is a mess, yes, but one that's not totally without merit for those who love their B-movies."

The action is fast moving and exhilarating, lots of attention has been paid to the setting and scenery.<br/><br/>The plot however is very choppy. People stroll into the story then wander out, or pop up in the middle of swamps and spill their hearts out to the characters to move the scene along or plug a gaping plot hole.<br/><br/>The reason the plot is so sporadic is the film weighs in under the 90 minute mark which is a massive feat for a modern movie.<br/><br/>The women are attractive, the medieval James Bond weaponry is clever, the different breeds of witches exotic and interesting.<br/><br/>The violence is gratuitous but not graphic, peoples heads explode into red mist or get there arms torn off but in a very comic book manner. A woman gets punched in the face about every 7 minutes but they are always straight back on their feet with perfect hair and make-up.<br/><br/>A bit of a silly, Buffyesque romp, I enjoyed it."

","Overall, the story isn't very great and is pretty predictable, but it's very entertaining. Basically, it's a cool movie that has a lot of cool kills, and weaponry with a no better than decent story. Plus, watching Gemma Arterton (and according to my female friends, Jeremy Renner) make the movie more enjoyable as well . It's quite violent and pretty gory, but if you're like me (a young adult who's pretty sensitive to blood and gore), you'll be fine. There are only a few parts that are cringe-worthy. Has a nice amount of rewatchability to it and is definitely a fun one to watch. If you're looking for a good story, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you're looking for something entertaining and fun to watch, it's a good one to watch."
"Vivekmaru45","7","2","3","14 August 2013"," Guillermo Del Toro is a shoe-in for this sort of films...
","But this film is not quite as good as Hellboy. Of course any child or grown-up knows the classic tale of Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm. It is about a brother and sister(Hansel and Gretel) abandoned deep within the woods by their father who follows every command of their newly acquired evil stepmother. Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles during the trip.<br/><br/>After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then they follow the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's horror. Once again provisions become scarce, and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there to die. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the doors locked and find it impossible to escape from their parents' house.<br/><br/>The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs to follow home. However, after they are once again abandoned, the children find that birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods.<br/><br/>The children try to find a way out, but stumble across a witches hut made out of every sort of sweet things imaginable: cakes, cookies, sugar candy, chocolate, cream etc., etc. The children begin to consume parts of the house when the door to the house opens and out pops an old woman who invites them in and sets before them a scrumptious feast. She is actually an evil witch who uses the house to lure unsuspecting children on whom she feasts.<br/><br/>Her plan was to fatten Hansel and then to eat him. So after the children have eaten, she immediately puts Hansel in cage and locks it. She then orders Gretel to do all sorts of chores in the house, of which the most important was to feed Hansel. As the days passed the witch asked Hansel to stick out his finger which she feels to see if he is fat enough to be cooked and eaten. But Hansel cleverly offers a bone he found in the cage (presumably a bone from the witch's previous captive) and the witch feels it, thinking it is his finger. Due to her blindness, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, ""be he fat or lean."" She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to open the oven and prods her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what she means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the witch into the oven and slams and bolts the door shut, leaving ""The ungodly witch to be burned to ashes"", with the witch screaming in pain until she dies. Gretel frees Hansel from the cage, and the pair discover a vase full of treasure and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife died from unknown causes. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Okay on to THIS FILM: After destroying the witch, Hansel and Gretel become famed bounty hunters dedicated to mercilessly eradicating witches, slaying over six hundred of them. Their work is relatively easy because, for an unknown reason, they are immune to spells and curses. Hansel, however, is diabetic as a result of his ordeal and needs to take a regular shot of insulin every few hours.<br/><br/>One day, in the town of Augsburg, Hansel and Gretel prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing Mina, a young woman accused of witchcraft. Mayor Englemann has hired the siblings to find and rescue several children abducted by witches.<br/><br/>Watch this film to find out what happens next! This film is fasted paced with graphic action scenes and gore and has some nudity. Therefor I wouldn't recommend this film for children under 13 years.<br/><br/>Notable Stars: Famke Jannsen(Deep Rising,X-Men Trilogy, Goldeneye, Lord Of Illusions), Peter Stormare(Fargo, 8mm, Lockout) and Jeremy Renner (Dahmer(MUST SEE FILM!) The Avengers)). <br/><br/>Similar films: Hocus Pocus (1993), Warlock(1989)."
"leonblackwood","6","2","3","30 June 2013"," Quite Entertaining 6/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this movie which is full of action and a decent storyline. All of the actors play there part well and I liked the chemistry between Hansel and Gretel who were a good choice by the director. There is some good CGI throughout the movie and some of the gadgets that are used were impressive. It does seem a bit short so I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a couple more to come. It isn't a all out classic because there are quite a few witch movies out lately, but it does have something for everyone. I didn't follow all of the hype when the movie first came out, which was why I enjoyed it even more. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Right at this moment, Jeremy Renner should be the biggest thing on the planet because he has played part in some of the biggest franchises. Taking the lead in the Bourne series and starring as Hawkeye in the Avengers franchise, his career seemed very promising, but he is still not a household name. He even starred in the Mission Impossible series but I don't think that he was taken seriously until he starred in the Hurt Locker which was popular in the movie world. The question is, does he have what it takes to become the next Tom Cruise? Directors, obviously think that he does but I am yet to see anything spectacular from him. Gemma Arterton has also been given some top class roles such as the Quatom of Solace and Clash Of The Titans, but she also doesn't really seem to have a big range. Both actors worked well together in this movie, which will make a great franchise if they don't mess it up like Superman.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $226million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there witch hunting movie which are full of action. 6/10"

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a movie I would normally hate. Or pick apart. Or dread seeingÂ…if I was paid to review films.<br/><br/>But, oddly, I had a tad bit fun here. And there's more than a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. Gemma Arterton owned her Gretel role. She was fun, a little more deep than appears on the surface and commanded the screen. <br/><br/>2. Likewise, Famke Janssen was also pretty good. While I've always liked her anyways, she was delicious in her bad girl role. <br/><br/>3. The movie never takes itself too seriously. It never tries to climb above silly, period piece action. <br/><br/>4. While it falls apart in the (anti)climax, it has enough strong and fun scenes to carry it there. <br/><br/>5. Mercifully, it's Rated R. This is NOT a kid's movie and they didn't need to make it both lowbrow and for the Twilight crowd. This could've easily fallen in a trap of PG-13 crap. <br/><br/>6. Jeremy Renner takes his shirt off. Done.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this movie is, in fact, silly. It's NOT to be taken a bit seriously. Its plot and plot holes weren't exactly easy to ignore, but again, let the two female leads carry you through â€“ along with a few good explosions and fun, and you'll have a good time.<br/><br/>I grew up on the fairly basic story of Hansel & Gretel when I was a kid and loved it. And maybe this is why it was Rated RÂ…only adults my age or around my age or greater would've heard of this fairy tale. How could the young, I-Whatever Gen even hear of either Hansel or Gretel?<br/><br/>Anyhoo, after being left alone in the woods as kids by their parents and changing the original story, Team H&G fight off their first witch and never look back. Enter present day, sorta, and a new threat of kidnapping witches brings the duo to save the day.<br/><br/>There will actually be just a few unexpected surprises, though mostly predictable and a lot of CGI blood leading to the finale we all know is coming. One with a suspension of disbelief so great that believing in witchcraft is incredibly minor.<br/><br/>Recommended, but know what you're getting yourself into."

What could be reduced is the swearing. Both Renner and Atterton coming separately upon the original gingerbread house where the baddie has taken refuge and both saying ""You've gotta be kidding"" is funny and doesn't need 'fucking' inserted there.

What looks like an action film on the surface is just an excuse for some dark humor and endless gallons of blood.<br/><br/>My only peeve was the use of CGI, but it was comforting to know that Wirkola fought against the CGI and used practical effects wherever possible. I wish he had gotten a few more traditional methods in there, but I suppose when you have a budget big enough you have to cater to some folks...<br/><br/>I enthusiastically liked this film and hope the sequel is able to match its style and tone."

","This is a horrible idea for a movie. I am condemning it, admittedly sight unseen, because it is a perpetuation of stereotypes that would be better consigned to ""the dustbins of history."" Witches are not evil women that kill and curse, but guardians of the goddess Gaia (Earth herself) and members of an earth-based religion that is as valid as any patriarchal religion. It is time for Hollywood and society as a whole to realize that and make a movie with a witch as (gasp) a hero. Anybody brave enough to do that? It does not matter who the ""stars"" are, what the ""plot"" is, or how much the studio spent on special effects. They are trying to turn back the clock to whip up more frenzy...to what end? The heroes kill ""witches."" Are they going to advocate burning real witches, perhaps as a publicity ploy?"

","'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is a dark re-telling of the popular fairy tale where two siblings are captured by a witch. The twist in this film? Hansel and Gretel are now adults and are professional witch hunters.<br/><br/>The original fairy tale is pretty dark as it is, child abandonment, kidnapping, attempted cannibalism, people being burned alive, this film tries to make it darker simply by splashing blood all over the place and that's about it. The fairy tale has been adapted to tie in very cleverly with their latest mission and it isn't that far-fetched; it makes sense, there's some good plot twists and it isn't too stupid. The stupidity comes in other forms; you've got electricity, gramophones, tasers, and oh yeah, insulin! I still don't understand why it was necessary to include the fact that Hansel has diabetes as a result of the infamous witch feeding him too many sweets as a child. Note that in the flashbacks he wasn't really overweight at all. The insulin we see him inject into himself throughout the film appears to have the same effect on him as spinach had to Popeye. Despite this weird addition, the film is fairly entertaining though it is fairly naff. The fight scenes are graphic but interesting and at some points are pretty funny.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do all that they need to do here but their performances aren't anything memorable. Famke Janssen is probably the best in it but even her performance can be a bit embarrassing at times. Maybe if director Tommy Wirkola sent everyone a memo telling them what accent was necessary it would have been better. There were American accents, English and even German – with Gemma Arterton switching between English and American throughout the film. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is mildly entertaining but it is pretty forgettable. If you just want to watch a film with absolutely no thinking involved and you just want to relax with some popcorn and have a chuckle at heads being squashed, then this is perfect."
"s_campanale","7","3","6","27 February 2013"," B-Movie and proud - An absurd idea played straight enough to just about work as action horror
","Delayed for a year to cash in on the ""Renner"" effect, this movie is finally here (in the UK anyway, later than a lot of countries but that's often the case) <br/><br/>It's hard to know what one can expect of a film like this. Another in the ever growing ""modern spin on the fairy tale"" cycle, this film evades the usual updated psycho-sexual variations of the story that have existed for a long time to go for a simple ""what if?"" future where the siblings become a sort of Van Helsing style professional witch killers, bringing them in on a case that becomes a ""countdown to doom"" scenario as the witches prepare for a once in a generation ceremony that will make them immune to fire (rather like Vampires seeking immunity from sunlight situation) During this case they will also (A) Discover things about themselves and their own past (B) Discover that not all witches are evil, some fight for good (C) Have to confront their own prejudices in light of B (D) Face old nemesis supreme head witch Muriel, connected to their past tragedy (E) Befriend a misunderstood Ogre (F) Patiently tolerate an obsessed fan boy (G) Save some kids marked for death at Muriel's ceremony. Much violence and gore will follow. Anachronistic weapons will be fired, colourful witches will be slaughtered in mass, and warm, lovable, gay spirited people with ""dead meat"" written on their foreheads will naturally die to raise our revenge driven bloodlust as our heroes deal violent justice to the unholy.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, the film doesn't pussy out for a neutered PG13 family friendly rating (a terrible cinema sin that film companies are increasingly going against) but instead heads for ""Evil Dead"" territory, with over the top gore, absurdly violent deaths, nudity and swearing, all in 3D, which is quite well used here, with depth between objects and speed/space during fast action scenes thoroughly planned and set up.<br/><br/>Despite the high budget, this is unashamedly a B-movie in Corman and Troma traditions, and never aims to be more than dumb fun, despite various stabs at genuine emotion and pathos throughout. The film's famed production history attests to its schizophrenic nature. Born as an out and out Gothic comedy from the Ferell-Mackay stable, it apparently pulled up when the similar ""Your Highness"" tanked (understandable given that it was a decently made movie torpedoed by a scattershot improv style that didn't suit it) and was retooled as an ""Evil Dead"" style comedy horror under the direction of Norwegian pulper Tommy Wirkola. As a result, the films tone and approach veer violently from out and out absurdist comedy to serious supernatural horror drama. One moment it's Mel Brooks, the next it's ""Blade"" or ""Van Helsing"", and the seams are quite visible. Kudos to Wirkola and team for playing such an absurd idea straight, giving us an entertaining Saturday night movie rather than a DOA would be comedy, and since its only raison d'etre is some bloody popcorn fun then it succeeds.<br/><br/>Cast wise it features good actors slumming it. Gemma Arterton is back with an American accent (I guess it was either Renner doing British or her doing AmericanShe must have had the better accent) playing her usual ballsy tough chick thing, though this time using actual weapons and violence. Jeremy Renner, not yet a new action star when this rolled, seems rather bored by the whole thing, and his character is highly unlikeable and unsympathetic (I get he's meant to be, but he went FULL asshole here!). Villain duties are pulled by the great Famke Janssen, who was upfront about just doing it to pay off her debts, but she still delivers the goods here. Her Muriel is like X-Men 3's Phoenix but without the conflict and inner turmoil. She's bad, she's ultra-powerful and she's having fun, though the lovely Famke is just her Human disguise, with nasty powder blue zombie being her natural look. Peter Stormare is back again with another in his gallery of over the top villains as the town sheriff who fears Hansel and Gretel more than he does the witches, and gets an extremely unpleasant end. Finnish beauty Pihla Viitala does well as the very red headed good witch Mina (she even colour coordinates her outfits to match her red hair) who becomes a love interest to Hansel and the one who makes him face his prejudices, and her character earns our care as the story progresses.<br/><br/>The special effects are also very good, especially the Witches make up and the animatronic Ogre Edward, which like ""Your Highness"" are mostly practical and physical (Edward seems to come from the same designer who made ""YH""s beautiful animatronic Minotaur) Blood and gore is done via CGI, which makes even lashings of red seem silly and inoffensive. One day horror producers will go back to jam and corn syrup and butcher's offal for real hurl stomach churning vileness, but not here alas.<br/><br/>The film has been a big success in America, and our preview screening was packed, so I guess the gamble paid off. Worth watching if you want to see an adult cartoon in the ""Blade"" mould (though nowhere near as good) that'll add nothing to your life but might give you 90 minutes occasional fun."

But they find out even more about their past, and learn more about themselves than they choose to know.<br/><br/>This was a sweet take on Hansel and Gretel, a beloved grimm fairy tale we all knew as kids. You know the story, two kids were abandoned by their father in the woods. They come upon a house of candy, and a witch lives inside. The witch makes Gretel fatten Hansel up so he could be eaten, but they kill the witch and escape.<br/><br/>But in Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, the story doesn't end there. In fact, the story continues on to say that they become infamous witch hunters, known all across the land for hunting terrible witches and other dark magic. When a mayor of a little town hires them to take control of the search for eleven missing children (said to be taken by witches), their job doesn't get easier.<br/><br/>They kick a lot of ass and take a lot of names, but these are some strong witches. It was one thing I liked about this movie. Hansel and Gretel weren't technical invincible, so they didn't always win. And the witches? They were creepy! The design of these witches was very creative, and I'm sure it was definitely creepy to see in 3D.<br/><br/>I really liked the original take of this classic fairy tale. Renner and Arterton had very good chemistry together on screen. Both characters were very well developed and played out. The script was great as well, the dialogue flowed well and the humor was spot on. Case in point, if you liked movies like Brothers Grimm and Van Helsing, You'll like Hansel and Gretel.

As I wasn't around then I couldn't swear to what language they used but I am pretty sure that 'awesome' wasn't around. I have picked this word as it was the most irritating but the film was full of them. At one point Hansel also appears to use some type of revolver that also appears to be totally out of context with rest of the film, they also seem to have some type of automatic cannon or Gatling gun. I could have ignored all of this if it had been an enjoyable rollick/romp but it wasn't, it was tepid and boring and the writer seemed to believe that he could make up for it's lack of story or dialogue with gore (of which there is plenty).

The big bad was deliciously played by Famke Janssen who has played a villain well in past films (Golden Eye & X-men: Last Stand). The witches' movement and combat will certainly remind you of The Army of Darkness with Bruce Campbell. So, the best way I can sum this up is that this is indeed a popcorn movie with a few ""oh yes!"" moments. Don't take it seriously, because they obviously don't intend you to.

","I don't understand as to why this film wasn't preview so much for its release in January but never mind to that. Hansel&Gretel: witch hunters takes on a modern twist to the Grimm Brothers story. The film starts off to when Hansel and Gretel are taken into a forest late at night by their father who refuses to reveal anything to them under their plea as to what is going on. Lost in the forest the two find a house made of candy and begin to eat off of it before embarking into the house. Little did they know they would meet an evil witch who threatens to kill them. But the two ended up stuffing her in fire for she to die and that typically explains as to why they became witch hunters. For the duration of the film to only last 88 minutes its easily forgettable. The action comes in at the right moments during the film but what really lacked was character development since the movie moved that fast. I felt i didn't get to know the characters all that well so that makes me not care for any of the characters weather they live or die. But i give credit to the 3D effects as it was spot on.

Anachronistic in approach, tone all over the place, direction labored, style, execution and delivery flat. Derivative describes this best: Its 300, LOTR, Snow White and The Huntsman, Van Helsing and yes even Bourne Legacy. A situation arose and I wanted to shout ""Get that man his chems!"" At 87 minutes Hansel/Gretel does not know what it wants to be. Is it action adventure? Is it a supernatural comedy? Is it a romance with horrific undertones? A few chuckles could be heard but nothing that would merit enjoyment. Lines that should have been delivered with a light touch - would have made the film a guilty pleasure and one would walk about saying them! The cast was nondescript. And what of Renner? His line delivery was tight and he appeared most uncomfortable almost unsure of himself. The romance failed to resonate.<br/><br/>Renner seems to be the kind of actor who if comfortable with the director can deliver entertaining performances- where you can see the joy in his face and gratefulness.<br/><br/>Perhaps he took the role to try doing something different- he doesn't fail altogether; its simply a misstep.<br/><br/>Perhaps his next role will be something to remember."

","Yep, it's ANOTHER old childhood favourite that Hollywood has updated for a 'modern audience'. Whoever said they were short of ideas?! Sooo... after Hansel and Gretel pushed that nasty old crone in the cauldron at the end of the fairytale, they became world renowned witch hunters. Sure, I can buy that. They develop a huge range of weaponry to assist them with this quest, including guns that fire multiple crossbow bolts at once and more swords than you'd find in an armoury. Er... a little outlandish, but still possible.<br/><br/>Then, we discover Hansel is a diabetic (from being forced to eat all that candy in the house as a kid), a disorder for which he's invented the first regular injection (about 500 years before it came on the market). Plus, the REAL reason their parents abandoned them in the forest was their mother was a witch herself (a WHITE witch that is, which means GOOD), and she knew her daughter had inherited the talent. It was to protect her, ya see. From all the bible bashers, and their evil magic using counterparts. Yeah. That's when I realised... they've perhaps revised the story a little too much...<br/><br/>It runs exactly as you'd expect... with ugly, green old ladies on broomsticks being torn asunder in a variety of grisly ways. We also meet an ogre, who may not be the bad guy he first appears , an obsessive fanboy of the central duo who nevertheless proves useful in their escapades, and a mysterious woman who they save from being executed by religious zealots. AANNDD don't forget the Big Bad, here portrayed by Famke Janssen as the nastiest witch of them all. You know she's tough, because it looks like she dies about six times... only for her to survive each one. More comebacks than Rocky, this one.<br/><br/>It does the job, has some humorous moments and never takes itself TOO seriously... which is essential to it's success. I mean, with so many anarchisms and over-the-top violence, any attempt to play this straight would probably have been doomed to failure. Flaws include some rather stiff acting, and the overuse of our old friend... deus ex machina. But if you're looking for a splodgy horror where the blood cascades rather than dribbles, and you don't mind your memories of mum reading to you forever corrupted by soulless men in suits, then give it a go. 6/10"
"MaximumMadness","7","2","4","17 January 2014"," This film is stupid, stupid, STUPID... and so much fun! ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is big, loud fun at it's finest that (thankfully) doesn't take itself too seriously.
","There's something of a trend going on today in cinema. And that is gritty, violent reboots and re-tellings of old stories, whether they be fictional fairy-tales or real-world figures. Yes, over the past couple of years, audiences have been given odd reboots of old stories. Everything from dark takes on classics like ""Snow White"", to even silly ""What If's?"" featuring the likes of Abraham Lincoln... fighting vampires. (Which ended up producing quite a fun, quirky little action film, but I digress)<br/><br/>So I wasn't too surprised to learn that Hollywood was planning on unleashing a new take on the classic fable of ""Hansel & Gretel"", this time telling the story of how after escaping the witch who tried to kill them, the siblings went on a lifelong conquest to hunt other witches for profit. What I was surprised about was how much fun that film is. Yes, it's time to take a look at ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", a goofy, loud and very stupid action movie that is loaded floor-to-ceiling with rampant entertainment value, thankfully because it never takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>We begin with a brief re-telling of the classic, with some alterations. After a young Hansel and Gretel are lead out to the woods by their father, and survive a struggle against a cruel witch inside of the infamous gingerbread-house, they are unable to find their way home, or figure out what happened to their parents. Now grown up, having assumed the roles of bounty-hunters who kill witches for payment, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) find themselves in the town of Augsburg, which is being terrorized by witches that have been abducting local children. They are hired to figure out what is happening, return the children and slay the witches responsible. However, they soon realize the true threat, a witch named Muriel (Famke Janssen), may be a bigger threat than any they have ever faced, and that their journey may hold the keys to solving the leftover mysteries of their past.<br/><br/>The acting is a tad mixed, I will admit. Renner is a lot of fun as Hansel, but is a tad wooden on screen. Almost as if he is unsure what to do with his limited development as a character. Arterton is great, however, giving Gretel a fairy fun, complex personality and enriching her role quite a bit. Janssen is a one-dimensional villain for sure, but she seems to be having a lot of fun hamming it up during her scenes. And supporting roles by the likes of Thomas Mann and Peter Stormare are decently played.<br/><br/>The script by writer/director Tommy Wirkola is quite fun, albeit flawed. I cannot tell if it's the fault of the script of over-eager editing, but the film does move way too fast at times. At only 88 minutes, it really feels like the film could have used a bit more footage to give it a more organic flow. Characters are also under- written and the storyline is very predictable. However, there is a lot of fun to be had in the quirky, not-taking-itself-too- seriously tone, and the over-the-top style. (When our heroes casually toss around ""f-bombs"" while lopping off the heads of witches in gloriously gory sequences, you know the film is aiming to entertain first and is not taking itself too serious) There's also a surprising amount of humor here that works quite well, and gave me some good belly-laughs. (Which is somewhat unsurprising upon learning that funny-man Will Ferrell and his frequent collaborator Adam McKay are producers here.)<br/><br/>Wirkola's direction is a lot better than his writing, though. The film is dripping with style, giving us some very cool action sequences, a lot of great visual touches and a fantastic eye for design. (This film for me has the most iconic ""Gingerbread House"" I've seen in any adaptation of the story.)<br/><br/>And it's mainly that kinetic, stylized, over-the-top style of the film that makes it work so well. Something about this flick just clicks, despite the under-written characters and rushed pace. That fact it doesn't take itself too serious, and is full of such fun direction really makes up for the other faults, and makes this an enjoyable sit for audiences.<br/><br/>It's pure dumb-fun fluff at its finest. All style, jokes and action. And I appreciate films like that from time to time.<br/><br/>And because it is such a fun time, I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10."

","I have to admit, that the movie never felt like it was dragging. The running time seems to be perfect, though I only have watched the theatrical version up to this point. I was a bit surprised that we got a bit of nudity in the movie, because Hollywood Blockbusters tend to avoid that sort of thing. Don't get too excited though (unless the extended cut offers more of that, that is).<br/><br/>But the movie does live off the performances. Not only the lead characters, but also the supporting cast. A twist towards the end of the movie is predictable, but still fun to watch. It's sort of roller-coaster ride. Short and fast, some will like it and some will hate it, because they might feel sick afterwords (good effects)."

","I guess that this is quite a good film. A more sinister 'fairy tale' with plenty blood and gore moments.<br/><br/>I do however, have a few issues: I usually quite like Gemma Arteton but the one thing that really lets this down is the appallingly bad American accent; it's quite tiresome.<br/><br/>Another thing is the annoying 'yet another witch breaks free only to be caught again' moments, or the real terrible aim of the so-called 'witch hunter!.<br/><br/>However, if you can ignore all of this, then the film itself is quite alright.<br/><br/>It has some good special effects and is comical in places (not sure if it's meant to if if i just found them bad/funny!).<br/><br/>A film to enjoy on an evening when you have nothing better to watch!"

","I went into this movie having low expectations, primarily because of the harsh reviews seen on IMDb by Users. Perhaps this is why it was so shocking to be so intriguing! <br/><br/>Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was the best adaptation/transformation of a fairy tale I have seen. The gore didn't worry me, but I can see why some were shocked. But this shouldn't be why it is receiving the 2-4/10 ratings! <br/><br/>I would usually last half a fairytale movie without picking up my phone, but this one kept me watching the whole film!

","Having survived a Witch's prison when they were children, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) become Witch Hunters as adults. In turn, they hire themselves out to towns where children have been abducted by Witches, who need the children to perform a blood-moon ceremony that will ultimately keep Witches safe from fire. <br/><br/>There is something wrong with Hollywood when it thinks it knows that we all out here want to see Horror movies with Zombies, Vampires, and now Witches who want to do one thing: kill, kill , kill with blood spurting every which way, heads exploding and being lopped off. Yes, the CGI and special stunts are very good. It's the killings that are becoming tedious, tiresome and, yes: unhealthy. There are just too many of these types of stories and there doesn't seem to be any slowing down of them. They just go on and on and on..<br/><br/>When the killing action sequences go on forever, I tend to go to La La Land, sleep for a half hour, wake up and see that the killing action is still going on; and the process repeats when the next killing sequence comes around and they come around rather quickly. So if all you want to see are these killing action scenes, then this is for you. As for me, I am out.<br/><br/>So what's next? The Three Little Pigs as Hit men? (3/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

","Even with no expectation this still didn't quite live up to anything at all. None the less it is still mildly entertaining and pretty well made. Good for the boring afternoon that you have nothing to watch.<br/><br/>This is the retelling of the children classic book Hansel and Gretel and makes it darker for the adult viewer. I must say the story is pretty decent and not at all complicated. There is a good enough background story with loads of action sequences. <br/><br/>Well that got to be the best part of this movie because action is almost non-stop and the fact that it is rated ""R"" killing and slaying is delivered all the time. <br/><br/>The casting of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bond's girl Gemma Arterton is probably the smartest move. I suppose this really drawn in many viewers (including myself) - Gemma Arterton really looks good here. <br/><br/>The set is very small but they did a good job here (thought many scene look very setup). Overall the movie is good for the first time viewer. It is not all bad. Worth a try out."
"rachelandfilms","8","2","4","29 May 2013"," Interesting take on a classic yet neglected fairytale
","Fairy-tale stories and the fables that we remember from our childhood are popular subjects for film and television right now, you only need to look at programmes such as Once Upon a Time and the 2011 flop-film Red Riding Hood to see that. Why is that, I wonder to myself? Is it because Twilight opened up the gates for a reinterpretation of traditional stereotypes – the vampire who is good Or maybe because Hollywood has run out of original ideas? Or is it, just maybe, because everyone enjoys revisiting a familiar tale The interesting thing about this tale is, though we remember it vaguely, it was never something brought to screen (not to my knowledge, anyway) for our childhood innocence to enjoy, meaning this film right here can do pretty much anything it wants – which is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>Rather than rehash a familiar tale writer and director Tommy Wirkola has transported the audience into the future, taking us on a journey set after the brave Hansel and Gretel defeat the terrible child-eating witch, and puts a unique spin on the story. The fact that Wirkola has made our childhood heroes adult is very important to the plot, because let me tell you right now, this film is NOT for kids. As our protagonists grow and their lifestyles morph into bloodthirsty witch hunters with a passion for slicing and dicing, so do theirlanguage. Innocence and precociousness take a back seat to the ""F#!*cks"" and ""Sh*#s"" that come (in a hilarious nature might I add) from our protagonists mouths. Not to mention the odd dash of sex they add from time to time. As I said, not for kids. This places the film in a unique position and could very well have been the one thing that ruined it, though happily it didn't if the plans for a sequel are anything to go by, because it very much isolates the audience and relies on sentimentality for the childhood tale to draw cinema-goers in. If my opinion is anything to go by, then it is very much worth the purchase. Which brings me on to the cast and film portion<br/><br/>If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this film then visit this site (filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk)"
"dimoulas-466-176153","6","2","4","4 March 2013"," A great over the top action/horror flick
","Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a movie where the main characters, instead of killing the witches while they are down, decide to pose majestically with their weapons as the witches get away. The good news is that the movie pretty much sets up this over the top formula right off the bat, and if you go in expecting that, you will have a great time watching this movie.<br/><br/>There are some great story aspects in the film, but it seems as if they were just ideas that were never fully developed unfortunately. The fight scenes can get a little repetitive at times. There's only so many times Jeremy Renner can get the crap beaten out of him, but he seems to have a good system of grunting and wiping himself off after being throw at a tree and crashing through the floor of a ginger bread house. Hansel and Gretel fight the witches, they get thrown down, the witch attacks, Hansel and Gretel counter with some outrageous solution, and the tables are turned on the witch. This pretty much happens during every fight. The visual effects get the job done. The witches themselves aren't very scary or very smart for that matter. But who really cares?<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretending to be anything. It is what it is and it is entertaining and fun. There are a far share of sappy moments that might leave you rolling your eyes, but there will soon be some 3D gore to cheer you up. I don't think this is on the level of a Evil Dead or Dead Alive in terms of the over the top comedy/horror flicks, but Hansel and Gretel has it's moments. And I would suggest it to everyone I know."
"will51224","8","2","4","2 March 2013"," Brilliant ""Where Are They Now"" of Fairy Tale Characters
","There's a recent trend in Hollywood of films that have to do with hunters and slayers, starting with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter coming out last summer and Jack the Giant Slayer coming out on March 1st. The current addition to this ""killing mythological characters"" craze comes in the form of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this because Jeremy Renner, who plays Hansel, is a great actor, and I thought it was a cool idea to have a ""where are they now"" of fairy tale characters. I also wanted to see it because I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. They both have over-the-top violence, but Hansel and Gretel makes Abe Lincoln look like one of those lame PG-13 horror remakes that have come out in recent years. The gore is gratuitous and the action is aplenty. In fact, some pussies in the audience were so squeamish that they had to look away during some parts.<br/><br/>The film opens with a brief retelling of the classic story, with Hansel and Gretel's father leaving them in the woods, and subsequently they are lured into the witch's candy house, where they shove her into an oven and ultimately burn her alive. Fast forward 15 years later (although it looks more like 25 in the case of 40-year-old Renner), and we find the sibling duo living the life of hunters who slaughter witches and helping rescue children whom the witches abducted. Gretel is played by the gorgeous Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of Jennifer Garner, except even hotter.<br/><br/>The witches were very frightening. Children who have parents dumb enough to bring them to see this will be freaked out by the witches, not to mention scarred by the blood and guts. I liked how, aside from the traditional witch in the opening sequence, the rest of the witches were unique-looking, such as one with spiky hair that looked like horns. The towering and beautiful Famke Janssen is perfectly cast as the head witch, Muriel. Having played villains before in films such as Goldeneye, The Faculty, and parts of the X-Men franchise, she exudes the right amount of evil and sexiness.<br/><br/>I also loved the contradiction between the modern-day guns and bows and arrows, and fighting sequences, taking place in a setting of 300 years ago. It was even more bizarre hearing fairy tale characters say modern-day swear words. Look out for some witty one liners from Renner.<br/><br/>Both Abe Lincoln and Hansel and Gretel involve a mash up of genres. They differ in that the serious tone and more subtle humor found in Abe Lincoln is appropriate for a history/horror film, while more straightforward comedy of Hansel and Gretel suits a fairy tale/horror film. As I previously mentioned in that movie's review, Abe Lincoln would not work as a comedy.<br/><br/>As was the case with Abraham Lincoln, Hansel and Gretel received scathing reviews from critics who were expecting it to be something it's not, and what it is, is a B-movie fantasy/action flick whose job is to be bloody ridiculous. They refuse to give it credit for succeeding at what it set out to do. They also don't get the sense of humor. For example, Hansel is a diabetic as a result of eating the candy house as a child, and he has to give himself an insulin injection, centuries before it even existed in real life. Anyone who can't see the humor in that seriously needs to get a life.<br/><br/>Some reviewers questioned why a respected actor like Renner would take on a role like this. Sure, he's a two-time Oscar nominee, but there's nothing wrong with him doing a fun film every now and then. His career is currently much more on track than many Oscar winners. Anyone remember Cuba Gooding, Jr.? Exactly. Plus, this movie was originally supposed to come out last March, but the studio pushed back the release date in order to allow time for Renner to film a couple of more blockbusters while he rose to become an A-list star. This was a wise decision, because Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters debuted at number one at the domestic box office, and it's been making a boatload of money around the world. So forget the haters."
"haela","5","2","4","24 February 2013"," What can I say? You get what you paid for.
","The bad news: it's a shallow, outrageous, horror/comedy/fantasy mashup.<br/><br/>The good news: You get exactly what you paid for.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are Hansel and Gretel, a young brother and sister who are abandoned by their father in a woods, only to stumble upon a witch living in a house made of candy. Ganging up on her, the youngsters shove her into an oven, and thus defeat her. After this youthful encounter, they devoted their lives to tracking down and killing witches. If a village had a 'witch problem', the standard solution would be to hire Hansel and Gretel...basically, they are supernatural bounty hunters. <br/><br/>It doesn't take long to see that this movie isn't serious (for instance, when Gretel threatens to shoot somebody and ""blow his brains all over you f****** hillbillies""), and it doesn't get much better. Blood, guts, and brains are the preferred special effects, corny jokes and stylized poses and fights are in every other scene. One scene where a mildly wounded Hansel is coaxed into 'healing waters' by a good witch amounts to an excuse to see Jeremy Renner naked.<br/><br/>It's violent, irreverent, thoughtless, and yet I enjoyed it. If you're expecting a fairy tale, don't watch it. If you're expecting any kind of depth, don't watch it. If you're squeamish, don't watch it. But if all you're looking for is a couple hours of entertainment from a popcorn flick and you don't have anything better to do, this is an acceptable option."

That does not mean that you can't enjoy good food, even that you are acknowledged of the art of the best cuisine, but neither that every ""happy meal"" is by definition ""scrap"". <br/><br/>This is an entertaining movie: well manufactured, mostly pretty well directed and constructed in a very simple, coherent and ""easy to tell"" story that does not intend to be a classic children's tale, or a state of the art piece of the immortal cinematography.<br/><br/>Grimms' tale is just a starting point of a new story, addressed with a lot of fantasy, which keeps you interested as the time goes by, showing a resourcefulness variety of creative fighting scenes, funny situations, and great art and character design, among others worthy to watch things.<br/><br/>Indeed, like any ""commercial"" movie, has some weakness in acting, very unintelligent dialogues, and clichés, however, they are just a few. <br/><br/>Finally, for those who wrote that there is plenty of ""gore"" in the movie, I have to say that blood is keep within decent parameters, far away from Anime, zombies, Spartans and recent Stallone's features.

The chemistry between the two characters is good but I think it could be explored more. They were convincingly enough to be a great witch hunter. Now about the movie, the storyline is pretty usual. But the approach is quite different. It was darker and more real. Of course there are plot holes but they can be ignored. The witches are frighteningly real. The actions are bloody and fun to watch. I watch this film in 2D Cinema, but I think it will look better in 3D. A lot of scenes were made with 3D in mind. So I recommend to watch this film in 3D. All in all, this film is worth your money."

","What a way to bring one of my favorite German fairy tales to life. It was superbly executed and right from the beginning had my interest with the forest narrative, and its heavy leanings on its German origin, made it that much more authentic. The support staff, mostly from Middle Europe were wonderful, and lent authenticity to the whole story play. The weapons were outrageous for the time period, but possessed enough home-made effect for it to be somewhat believable. The insulin shot taking Hans was a great message to Americans to cut their sugar. Overall the action was spot on, and everything about the movie screamed quality. The actors didn't really stand out in the movie but moved like integral parts and in harmony. No one really stole the show here, but that just allowed the whole movie to be a great experience of harmony. The all German technical production of this movie shines with sweet special effects, and the music gels well with the movie. I'm not sure if it was Hans Zimmer on this movie, as i saw a host of other musicians too listed along with him. I'm sure they coordinated to bring a very seamless music production/ score to arouse our passions at appropriate moments, and it was beautifully done. The setting of a German forest was very appropriate, and I saw this movie in IMAX, and I urge everyone else to do the same. Unforgettable!"

","I've always been a fan of the Grimm Fairy Tales being done exactly how they were supposed to be done: dark, foreboding, action packed, not cutsie. As with the others, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" delivers. The action itself is fast paced, starting from the demise of the very first witch to the destruction of the coven and future witches, an actual thrill a minute. Of course the 3D effects were also great, adding to the overall feel of the movie.<br/><br/>However the downside was that the movie lacked character development. Yes, we saw the real reason why they were left in the woods. And it did sort of explain their ""hidden assets"" which made them good hunters, but I actually found myself rooting for Muriel (head witch played by the Famke Janssen) half of the time. But then again that could be my warped mind...<br/><br/>In the end I gave this movie a 7/10. I'd watch it again, just not in the theater again."
"blott2319-1","8","0","0","20 April 2020"," Mindless fun done the right way
","I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, because it looked like a ridiculous concept used as an excuse for another over-the-top action film. It absolutely was everything I expected, and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. This movie is fully embracing the silliness of its concept, and doing it in all the right ways. Logic is out the window as the film seems to take place in olden times, but the heroes have an arsenal of modern weapons, a full concept of diabetes and insulin, plus they use some modern slang and profanity. They do nothing to hide this anachronistic feel either, and have so much fun blowing away witches with everything from a shotgun to a modern Gatling-style gun while dropping several F-bombs. The film also fully embraces the existence of witches with dangerous powers, and uses that to make them a formidable threat to our heroes who could seem indestructible. Every aspect of this film is crazy, and I could totally see if someone thought it was dumb, but I loved how writer/director Tommy Wirkola understands where to draw the line between camp and crap. This is the kind of movie that I can justify telling people to ""turn off your brain and enjoy it.""<br/><br/>There is a solid plot at the heart of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, that has personal elements for our heroes, which increases the stakes. Most of the plot points are predictable, but this isn't the kind of movie with a complex story that is supposed to puzzle or surprise the viewer. I particularly liked how they handled the reveals of Hansel & Gretel's history, because it was not dragged out too long since we knew what was coming. I think the only story point that was dragged out too much was the way they explored whether all witches were evil. The cast of witches, led by Famke Janssen are delightfully evil in all the stereotypical ways, and the makeup effects on them were perfectly repulsive. Jeremy Renner is basically playing Hansel as another version of Hawkeye, and I didn't mind, because that fits the tone of this film perfectly. I love what Gemma Arterton brings as Gretel, because she is tough and dangerous. I will say, I wish she had spent less time being a damsel in distress and had kicked more butt, particularly in the finale. Otherwise, despite some minor complaints, I found Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters to be a total blast. This is the kind of movie I will watch when I feel like a crazy action spectacle that doesn't require much brainpower to enjoy."

","Cinema is the art of adopting points of view and this one is unrelentingly poor in that way. Actors walk onto a figurative stage, mouthing off crucial lines about where we are in the plot, everything wooden. The story is trivial anyhow, the characters of the fairytale have grown up to be witch hunters in the vein of the action hero where they sling guns over shoulders and sashay in leather pants.<br/><br/>Which means that it's exactly what it looks like it was going to be from the cover, an action movie adopting the skin of dark fantasy, much like Van Helsing, with medieval backdrops and gnarly monsters.<br/><br/>Choppy so long as there's a plot where we must pretend that characters are facing odds that have some nailbiting significance, they're not really, even when shot or abducted. All that carries about as much gravity and surprise as watching someone pour cookie dough in a mold, biting our nails about whether or not a baked cookie is going to come out on the other end.<br/><br/>On the upside it moves fast and leaves a trail of splatter. When we no longer have to bother with plot, we get a nice showdown up in the woods where a coven of witches is about to perform the climactic ceremony that night. The witches look rotten and ugly and there's a variety of them, the heroes plow and mow through them with guns and knives."

","Having turned themselves into formidable bounty-hunters, the brother-and-sister duo find themselves summoned to a village beset by child kidnappings and witch activity and uncover the mystical connection between them and the strange activity in town.<br/><br/>This one was quite the exciting and enjoyable variant on the story with a lot to like. What turns it on the most is the fact that there's a rather large sampling here of action that proves their worthiness and capabilities at their goal, which sets them up as skilled professionals accomplished at their job rather than being told they're great because that's the way the story is supposed to unfold. Being given access to their kind of weaponry and defensive tactics, from spreading razor-wire between trees most identifiable as escape routes, whips, knives and spells as well as their physical brawling, there's a lot to like here about this which is set through the film's rather fun pace here. This one tends to go through a rather large amount of time here battling the witches and the different helpers along the way, making for the fun of their first forest encounter after being hired where they beat off the lone witch, the spectacular assault on the town where the witches bombard the village and homes with explosive fireballs, the chaos and panic hides the brawling quite well and there's the rescue attempts that come up rather fun as well providing this with a great scene that's really filled with action. There's also the massive forest encounter here, from the lead-up to the mountain-top hideout where they hold the big gathering for the other witches there, the huge gunfight that wipes out most of them and then the big hand-to-hand battles that lead into the forest escape into the final brawl back in the cottage which makes for quite an action-packed time here. All of these are rather enjoyable with lots of spectacle, great make-up for the different witches and their powers that come off rather nicely and plenty of bloody kills here to make for an even better time here with these all combining together to give this one a lot to like. There's not a whole lot here that doesn't really work, as all that does come up seems to be the fact that this one never really pays off much in terms of connecting them to the fairytale beyond the opening sequence in the candy-house which is played off nicely, but seems to be more of an after-thought here in terms of how they're supposed to be the same people. This causes the middle of the film to turn into a rather irritating series of scenes where they're completely at odds with everyone around them constantly worrying about each other if they're out of the others' line-of-sight, keeping these scenes rather clichÃ©d and familiar due to the constant repetition of these scenes. Still, this one was overall quite fun.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children- in-jeopardy."

It isn't exactly a modern take on the famous German fairy tale, but there are one or two anachronisms here and there, their weapons in particular.<br/><br/>There isn't that much of a plot to it, suffice it to say that a particularly evil and powerful grand witch has some dastardly plans afoot including child sacrifice, but with the help of a white witch, an autograph hunter and a friendly troll, the fearless siblings might just defeat the forces of darkness.<br/><br/>This film has some half decent special effects, as well as witches who ride on broomsticks and kick like Bruce Lee.

","After being abandoned in a large forest by their father, two children by the name of ""Hansel"" (Jeremy Renner) and ""Gretel"" (Gemma Arterton) stumble upon a house made of candy. Venturing inside they are captured by a witch who plans to kill them and use their hearts to conjure up a horrific spell. Fortunately, they escape and kill the evil witch in the process. It's at this time that they realize that they have a unique skill and decide to sell their services to villages beset by witchcraft. Some years later they travel to one particular town which has had eleven children recently abducted discover that the local sheriff is about to burn a young woman named ""Mina"" (Pihla Viitala) for being a witch. Although Hansel rescues the comely young maiden he also earns the enmity of the local sheriff as well. But that is the least of his problems. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this turned out to be an enjoyable action movie for the most part with a couple of surprising twists here and there. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Gemma Arterton and Pihla Viitala certainly didn't hurt either. Slightly above average."

","Yes, Jeremy Renner can make crappy movie too. But if you come because Gemma Artenton's cleavage, as in the poster suggests, the movie will keep you quite entertained. The most notable flaw is the uncertain direction it's supposed to take, frankly it's hinged between tasteless horror action or misguided parody like a broom between a witch's crack, and neither is done that well. Also, the concept of gritty version of fairy tale characters as mercenaries is a blatant excuse of luring audiences hooked on fantasy theme, but ultimately ends up delivering little to none pleasure, even the guilty one. Okay, maybe the guilty one.<br/><br/>Hansel and Gretel are big kids now, traumatized and vengeful towards witches' prowl. They take arms in spite and exude pain to all the witch they greet. In a twisted of fate they run across a town in need of help, many of the children have been kidnapped. If you've seen the beginning of Van Helsing, you'll get the idea, they share about the same outfit and weapons too.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D and while I knew the commitment this type of movies has for throwing stuff to your face, but I still stunned to see it here, as if the movie goes to a terrible length to hurl splinters, debris, and chunks of meat into the sanctity of your eyes. If there were a category in cinema awards for ""Most Stuff Thrown Effectively to Audience"", this will be a serious contender.<br/><br/>The actors do some adequate performance, Jeremy Renner is a solid lead, he's charismatic and brings some humor. Famke Jensen is decent as the villain, Muriel, she has a cold air about her and it fits as a demotion from Phoenix role. However, the whole material is a downright mess. There is plenty of gore, even some dark moments, yet they are passed off as semi jokes, occasionally back-to-back with another black humor. I'm not sure if a witch laughing while driving her broom in reverse before getting punched repeatedly in her face while she screams is meant to be funny<br/><br/>Aside from that, it has excessive profanity. I don't really mind, but it has to be done in the right freaking time. The characters just mutter them needlessly, making them awkward, more than anything. Pacing is quite puzzling as well, for most it follows a straight relatively slow pace, only to find some characters appear suddenly for convenience' sake. Few scenes are cut short or sped up in this way.<br/><br/>If you, for some reason, want to see Jeremy Renner goes Rambo on old ladies while traumatized innocent children watch in horror, you might as well go for the brief gratuitous shots, for Hansel and Gretel aren't good for much else."

","I'm going to echo the positive opinions posted on IMDb. The film is ridiculous, granted, but doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed it, possibly because of the original (to me) concept, effects and gore, but just to put it into perspective, here's what I really thought of it:<br/><br/>Imagine a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as a practising black witch where you've got to capture the heart of a white witch, a total of 12 children - one born in each month of the year, all at the same time during the 'blood moon'. It's very difficult and requires a lot of patience and planning, but after much endeavour you manage to DO IT. Get all the kids and white witches and organise an enormous witch-moot, or whatever they call it, up in the hills and attended by hundreds of black witches from all over the country. The culmination is a sort of supreme power that will give black witches the ability to live forever/be invincible (or whatever it is). So, considering the importance, you'd expect some sort of security or just plain common sense to ward off intruders. Oh no, NONE of that. Get a white witch with a mini-gun entrenched at an overlooking alcove who machine-guns the hell out of everyone and it's pretty much game over. 1-0 the good guys.<br/><br/>That's it. The black witches are annihilated and good prevails. Probably the worst ending in movie-making history, not far off the cavemen in harrier jump jets in Battlefield Earth, it's really quite bad.<br/><br/>But I enjoyed the spectacle and had a good time. It's a beautiful film with pretty good acting, nice effects, lots of marvellously evil witches and heaps and heaps of gore. Make of it what you will though."

If that is what you are looking for in a movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for violence, gore, over-the-top weapons, and even some humor, this is a good movie for you.

","Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a slightly over the top fun and light-hearted movie. Now, if you've watched Van Helsing and happened to love it, you're guaranteed to love this one as well as its based on a somewhat similar theme. However, in this case, as the title suggests, its witch-hunting. Whats more, it features the fantastic Jeremy Renner and the famous bond-girl Gemma Arterton.<br/><br/>Now, Hansel and Gretel are orphan siblings well-known for their witch-hunting skills and this movie is about them investigating a case of 11 children which went missing from a tiny village. So, obviously there is apt action, which is surprisingly well-directed and the characters seem realistic as they're not taking blow after blow and still kicking the bad guys' asses as if its nothing, like in Die Hard movies. Needless to say, Jeremy and Ms Arterton were fantastic in their roles and do justice to the movie. I kind of expected more action from Hansel's character being played by Jeremy and all, but I'm glad that there wasn't so that the movie could stay true to itself. Gemma was smoking hot (and I don't mean in a bad way) as well as beautiful. This movie was good for a change, for me and I really loved it. My two cents- this movie is recommended.

January would begin and he would hunt everywhere and every week for any film that brought with it a feeling of elation and worth rather than a nagging sensation of despair and dread. But, alas, he would have to wait until September or October before movie theaters would be showing award-worthy efforts. Sadly, there was no happily-ever-after until fall arrived.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the first official film of 2013, a small turd of a film stinking up theaters this month entitled Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters would be wholeheartedly endorsed by Mr. LaPierre and his rowdy bunch at the NRA. Every villager has a right to bear arms, be they pitchforks, torches, or semiautomatic artillery in this formulaic movie. Most of the film's imagination seems to be aimed at the film's anachronistic state-of-the-art arsenal of weaponry with its super non-loading cross-bows and stylized guns a-blazing. These firearms would rival anything found in today's gun shows and make any proud gun-toter green with envy. It's shoot-em-up time! Let the blood spurt and the body count begin! God bless that Second Amendment!<br/><br/>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters wants moviegoers to believe that it is hip and clever in its revisionist spin of this classic children's tale. ( Okay, granted it's a nice touch with the missing children labels on the milk bottles! ) The look of the film is 13th century chic with its medieval themed village and appropriately dressed town-folk inappropriately mixing with today's gangsta vibe. After all, there are witches everywhere in this small generic Octoberfest of a town. Children have gone missing and the mayor has hired two bounty hunters by the name of Hansel and Gretel to clean-up this mess.<br/><br/>Hansel is played by leading man Jeremy Renner, who is slumming here and misusing his talents, and the questionably talented Gemma Arterton, who hasn't made a good film since she played Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace, and that seems like forever, is Gretel. The actors offer bland facsimiles of their strictly cardboard stock characters and do not remotely show any dimensions, but this leather clad brother and sister duo are dressed to kill in style. Renner plays him character with tough guy dim-wittedness and Arterton is a tough cookie with a potty mouth and more cahones that her sibling. Famke Janssen plays the evil witch Muriel and, at least, brings some real menace to her role.<br/><br/>With its mercilessly short running time of 88 minutes, director Tommy Wirkola keeps the story moving, but doesn't know how to establish characters or skillfully show off the well staged stunts. The camera remains too close to its actors and the kinetic editing and its onslaught of flash-cuts and CGI upstages all of the action. It's hard to watch all of the witch hunting when you're wondering which is hunting who.<br/><br/>Legend has it that there are good witches and bad witches, although the bad usually outnumber the good 666 to 1. Legend also has it that movies of this ilk outnumber the good in about the same ratio whenever the new movie season begins in January.

","The movie starts promising and ends disappointing. The movie is meant to be a cross between action, horror and comedy but forget the last two (horror and comedy) because the jokes are just flying over your head and the horror scenes will make you yawn. My main problem with the movie is the cursing (which were few, mind you), before any of the lead characters uses the f-word, there was a pause and the camera focuses on the face and the f-word will be given a grand entrance, as if the word is holy. My final take is that this movie is just a saddle stick for a sequel and it is just borderline crap.<br/><br/>The summary of the plot which adds a new spin to the fairy tale has Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton respectively) as bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the place. At a town children are being taken by witches, and the duo is called to investigate. They came across a plot by the witches, a plot which involves the Blood Moon and the siblings face an evil that holds the secret to their past.<br/><br/>The movie is written and directed by Tommy Wirkola (a Norwegian) who makes a living making action horror flicks and this crap-piece is his first big budget film, he is noted to have said that he was surprised (and so am I) that the big Hollywood studios went for the movie calling his script a ""rock n' roll script"". The script is rock n' roll alright rolling down to the gutter with a script that made me want to puke, bad continuity from one scene to the other it is just topsy-turvy, with nothing going straight. It seems like you the viewer is left wondering why some things are happening, and forget the twist, the movie is predictable.<br/><br/>I have seen better movies in my life and if this was a B-movie it would have been best, I can't imagine the cost the CGI must have taken from the huge 50 million budget of this movie. The CGI and stunts are cool but everything else will make you want to smash the screen.<br/><br/>What I advice any movie watcher to do is to not bother seeing this movie, try and watch something else, there is no surprises, no wow moment, no story depth nothing. just a bunch of guys running around feeling cool killing witches.<br/><br/>The sad thing I have to say is that, bad guys narrating their entire evil plot to the hero instead of just killing them straight away, is kind of an out dated practice, so I was surprise to see it here.

","Considering a witch nearly baked them in an oven and ate them, it makes sense that Hansel and Gretel would grow up to be witch hunters. OK, maybe not quite, but it's at least more reasonable than Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter.<br/><br/>With that perspective, there's a bit more logic in place backing ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"" but the film might as well be ""Barack Obama: Dragon Slayer"" based on how director and co- writer Tommy Wirkola fails to take advantage of this workable premise.<br/><br/>Wirkola, the Norwegian filmmaker who made the Nazi zombie horror film ""Dead Snow,"" tries to utilize the same irreverence and unserious tone that earned that film some critical recognition, but the sheer absurdity of undead Nazis translates better than some ambiguously 19th Century supernatural witch hunt.<br/><br/>After their parents abandoned them in the woods as children, Hansel and Gretel escaped the clutches of a witch and presumably (we don't see the epiphany happen) dedicate their lives to being witch-hunting orphans who travel all over the world killing and burning the ugly hags. When they're hired to investigate a series of nearly a dozen child kidnappings, they uncover some secrets about their past.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell if Wirkola and co-writer D.W. Harper were trying at all to make ""Hansel & Gretel"" a slick, cool action movie or if they wanted it to play as an exercise in absurdity. Either way, talented stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton look completely out of place in the title roles. It's uncomfortable to see them acting this poorly, to the point where the film might actually have been better if two no-names from one of those straight-to-DVD blockbuster knockoffs had been cast instead.<br/><br/>Wirkola clearly strives to make the movie gleefully violent and hilarious, but that tone and approach only works when you can buy into the more fundamental parts of a film and ""Hansel & Gretel"" is a sloppy smorgasbord of action, '80s fantasy, gore and steampunk tied together by the thinnest of story lines.<br/><br/>Every element of the plot gets the most basic, glossed-over treatment based on the assumption that the audience will find witch-hunting sufficiently entertaining. The combat sequences themselves have an amusing edge, with Hansel and Gretel chasing after feral witches and using all manner of weaponry to blow them out of the sky, but it purports to be much cooler than it actually is with gratuitous swearing and denigrating one-liners. Hansel and Gretel, for example, make jokes at the expense of other characters, but in actuality they're just as culpable.<br/><br/>It starts with how completely one-dimensional our heroes are. Hansel and Gretel possess no qualities other than badass and snide. Hansel is a diabetic thanks to the witch who force-fed him candy as a child, but while that's clever, it doesn't count for character, and neither do Gretel's nightmares about what really happened to them as children. Both amount to insignificant plot devices. There's no exploration of the brother-sister dynamic or any kind of internal or interpersonal conflict. These are not the hallmarks of ""serious"" films, but rather essentials to storytelling, so the movie is not being avante-garde by scrapping them.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen plays Muriel, the evil witch with the grand plan. She's supposed be formidable and feisty, which she is in a physical sense, but her character's sole motivation is her plan — to make witches impervious to fire — so Janssen is left with nothing to do except ham it up in every scene. You can imagine that doesn't leave much for veteran Peter Stormare as the town sheriff or Thomas Mann as an obsessed fan of Hansel and Gretel's.<br/><br/>Then there's Edward. Edward is an ogre who looks like a cross between and Richard Kind and the dad from the '90s TV show ""Dinosaurs,"" who fits into the story the same exact way Sloth factors into ""Goonies."" He's either embodies the best or the worst the movie, depending on how you feel about the rest of it.<br/><br/>""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is carnal, surface filmmaking — a cake made entirely of frosting. Sure, it might be decent frosting, but unless you're a frosting junkie it's essentially inedible. People who like that kind of glitzy display might spoon it up in all its artificiality and appreciate its flippant attitude, but most audiences will be too self-respecting to indulge.<br/><br/>Peppered throughout this attempt at carefree supernatural action-adventure are clichés at every level from the dialogue to the use of narration and the score. It's clear the movie is trying to follow a formula and utilize techniques that have proved successful in the past, but you just can't ignore the essentials like ""Hansel & Gretel,"" as doing so completely exposes the film for the action-packed genre film fraud that it is when it attempts to employ those techniques but falls flat.<br/><br/>If somehow you can fall under ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'"" spell, you might just be enchanted enough to enjoy the film in its short run time given how it sticks to its guns, but don't count on being so easily beguiled.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"
"KineticSeoul","4","3","9","1 February 2013"," Worth seeing it at the theaters just because of the 3D and that is about it
","This is one of those movies that probably should have been a straight to DVD movie but since it has a well known actor or actress with a bit more budget so makes it into theaters. If you seen the trailer you know exactly which direction it's going to go and can predict just about everything that is going to happen. And if your a movie buff that has seen these types of movies before can guess and be right about it. There is few subplot characters that doesn't really add much to the story at all. Except one for one violent scene and the other for a sexy nude scene. But I guess that somewhat adds to something to a movie like this but very very slightly. There is quite a bit of 3D in this movie where things fly at the audiences and stuff which might be the only reason to see this movie in the theaters. Some reviewers and critics seem to compare this to ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" but seemed more like ""Van Helsing"" with Hugh Jackman. It's alright seeing it once but nothing really stands out about this movie including the action. I give it a 4 though since it rips off of one of Terry Gilliam's film ""The Brothers Grimm"" too much.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I had low expectations going into see ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters."" While I can't say that the film was horrible, my expectations of a mediocre movie were still met.<br/><br/>During the admittedly creative and artistic opening credits, one will notice something strange. This movie was co-produced by Will Ferrel and Adam McKay, founders of the famous website:"" Funny or Die"" and writers as such films as Step Brothers and Ricky Bobby. Other producers involve Kevin Messik, Beau Flynn, Christoph Fisser, and co-writer of ""The Other Guys,"" Chris Henchy. Now I know many people think that producers have very little impact on the final product, but as someone who worked as an extra on an indie film, I can say that producers can definitely affect how the film is made.<br/><br/>""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is an action/horror fantasy, but it also has an overall silly tone. This is evidenced by the over-the-top gross-out scares, the anachronisms, and the curse-laden dialogue. It definitely feels like the producers had a hand in adding silliness to the overall action/horror aspect of the film. Sometimes I even noticed characters speaking silly dialogue in a loud way similar to how WIll Ferrel delivers his lines. I wouldn't have been surprised if Will Ferrel made a cameo.<br/><br/>As for the main crew members, this film is directed and mainly written by Tommy Wirkola, the writer/director of the 2009 cult nazi-zombie film: ""Dead Snow."" At many times in this film, the aforementioned silliness was clumsily mixed in with bloody violence. Limbs are torn off, heads are crushed, and people are cut in half. The movie is about witches, but it definitely feels more like a zombie movie with its bursts of bloody action. It just didn't fit in with the fantasy elements and it even contributed to one of the film's main problem.<br/><br/>Since the movie focuses so much on brute-force fight scenes, the mostly likable characters take a back seat and are stuck with flat backstories. (SPOILER ALERT) For example, Hansel and Gretel (played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton respectively) are told by the antagonist witch Muriel (played by Famke Janssen, see picture below) that the reason their parents left them is because their mother was a good witch and the evil witches wanted Gretel's heart. Her heart was meant to be used in a potion that would give the evil witches immunity to fire, their main weakness. So what all of this contrived mess boils down to is this: Gretel's heart is a MacGuffin that the witches want to use as a potion.<br/><br/>Apparently, her heart is like some kind of witch-treasure. So why then does Muriel throw Gretel out the window in the middle of a fight scene to fight another character and allow her to escape? Some villain, huh?<br/><br/>Speaking of Gretel, Gemma Arterton felt so miscast in this role, and delivered her lines in a monotone, nasally way. It reminded me of Megan Fox, though to be fair it was MUCH more convincing than anything Ms. Fox acted in.<br/><br/>However, Jeremy Renner did the best he could, and if it's any consolation, it's not the worst movie he ever did. The weapons were pretty creative too with the exception of the taser, which didn't even exist in the 19th century (this movie's setting). Also, the fight scenes were decent enough to keep my attention, but they were still choppy and not very memorable aside from the gory moments.<br/><br/>I'm going to end this review by saying the following: less demanding viewers may get a kick out of this film, but I personally thought it was just another bad early-year movie that people will have the most viewers on Netflix's streaming."
"judywalker2","5","3","9","27 January 2013"," predictable, but the troll was good
","Saw this movie because my daughter wanted to. I like the two lead characters but from the moment the movie started I knew where it was going. The story is dull and predictable with more profanity than I think would have been the case for the period. Some wisecracking is okay but really, this is modern dialog in a setting of 15th century. Everything in this movie is over the top from the witches to the weapons used by Hansel and Gretel; with a little too modern science thrown in. This movie stole from so many other more successful films that weren't even in the same genre. I guessed most of the story before the ending. All of the actors did the best they could with this mess. On one positive note I think the Troll design was great, better than the stupid trolls in the Hobbit."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The movie begins with a tip of the cap to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and then spins off into what would be just another episode of TV's ""Once Upon a Time"", were it a cable rather than a network show.<br/><br/>The original fairy tale is a nightmare for most kids (probably explains why it's one of my favorites). Hansel and Gretel are deserted in the forest by their parents, and end up at a scrumptious house of candy owned by a witch who eats children. The movie puts an interesting spin on why the parents got rid of the kids, but mostly this story begins after Hansel and Gretel outsmart the candy house witch. This leads them into a joint career of bounty-hunting for witches.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Avengers) plays Hansel and Gemma Arterton (Tamara Drewe, Bond Girl in Casino Royale) plays Gretel. They have some pretty nifty weapons given that it's the middle ages. Mostly they take turns getting the stuffing kicked out of them by witches and jealous sheriffs.<br/><br/>There is a good witch and bad witch element as well as a discovery of their childhood roots. That said, the plot and story are secondary thanks to writer/director Tommy Wickola who seems to find the most joy in exploding witch heads and bodies. The 3D seems pretty sloppy and forced with no added benefit. A couple of humorous additions involve Hansel's struggle with diabetes (thanks to the candy house), the missing kid notices on milk bottles, and the multi-dimensional troll Edward ... he's no Shrek, but it doesn't take much personality to stand out here.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are listed as producers and that explains the attempts at humor throughout. It's too bad the overkill on gore and profanity prevent this from being an intelligent spin off from one of the best ever fairy tales."

Oh and how Famke Janssen is 47 years old I'll never know, even she manages to look the part on the odd occasion she's not in witch guise.<br/><br/>I found myself thoroughly enjoying the film.

","With its sprinkle of Burton and dash of Raimi, 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' could've been dumb fun, only it isn't. That's because the whole film feels like a rough draft. A first rehearsal. The cast are all game, and there are some clever ideas and good decisions—the best being its use of practical F/X. But its all under-thought. Its primary assets are its brevity and the lovely ladies of its cast, but that does not a good film make... unless we're talking about ""Adult"" cinema. <br/><br/>With just a bit more effort, 'Hansel & Gretel' might've been a modern day 'Army of Darkness'.

","When I first saw the trailer I thought: Wow, this could be fun. And it was... The movie keeps the promises made by the trailer. There's action, cool lines, a killer-cast and (surprise, surprise) strong violence. This is why it works:<br/><br/>1. The cast. 2 strong female leads (Janssen & Arterton) who were totally believable in their roles. Renner as the cutest tough-guy actor Hollywood has to offer at the moment. And Stormare who is always a nice addition to the cast. <br/><br/>2. The story. Straightforward, simple and uncompromising. (I don't need clever plot twists all the time. Sometimes I just wanna be entertained.)This movie reminded me of Deep Rising. It was the same kind of ""this-is-our-story-deal-with-it"" movie.<br/><br/>3. The Action. I loved that the movie wasn't softened all the way down to PG-13. The action is fierce and absolutely fun to watch.<br/><br/>This is it. I've got nothing to criticize about the movie.<br/><br/>Just one thing: I find it hilarious when people watch the movie and then complain about the distorted portrayal of witches. (One reviewer seemed to be pretty angry about that.) You people amuse me! That's what trailers are for! The trailer made it absolutely clear, what the movie was going to be like. So, if it's not for you... avoid it. But please don't rant about how bad the movie was when it's your own fault you went to see it in the first place!<br/><br/>In other words: You don't like chocolate?

"Thomasdinnegan75","7","2","5","4 March 2013"," An enjoyable, action packed movie, not for the kiddies!
","Okay, so Hansel and Gretel turned witch hunters ? I wasn't sure. However after getting a free pass to watch this film, I couldn't have turned it down and I'm glad I didn't! After reading many negative reviews about this movie, I was completely surprised after watching 88 action packed minutes, filled with excellently shot fighting scenes. <br/><br/>In truth, I'm not a massive fan of 3D. In this movie however, I found it worked brilliantly! and the visual effects were superb. For a film jam packed with high speed fighting scenes, I thought the 3D effects were amazing, not to fast and perfectly used. From arrows flying at you at top speed, right up to seeing Pihla Viitala's (mina) ass up close, the use of 3D in this movie is absolutely brilliant. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the visual effects in this film. <br/><br/>However, there are a few negatives about this film. Often times you find yourself watching explosive fighting scenes, which I loved, but it does take away from the plot. I found that the film wasn't explored enough, in other words, 88 minutes wasn't enough time. I felt during some parts of the film that there was missing scenes. Things happened at a rush and it seemed like the movie didn't link up at times. An example of this is how little Hansel and Gretel talk about their pasted and then suddenly we are excelled into a scene where they're at their old house and find out about their pasted, it all happens so quickly and will leave you feeling that the movie was rushed and how it could have been a lot better, even though as it was,it was good.<br/><br/>The use of humour in this film worked well at times , but in other places felt over used and also made it difficult to take the character's seriously when we were excelled into a serious, emotion filled scene, 30 seconds after a comical one and once again I was left feeling as if it was rushed and that i missed a 5 minute scene in between. I must admit though, I found the twilight spoof/parody hilarious! calling the lovable Troll ""Edward"", the gentle beast who saves Gretel :P<br/><br/>The actors in this movie gave solid performances and I thought that Renner and Arterton were brilliant together! I could really sense the brother and sisterly love Hansel and Gretel had for each other while they were also very good at delivering comical lines together. The make up artists and costume designers deserve credit also as the witches were terrifying! Its evident that a lot of time went into designing each and every witch.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't anything amazingly special but at the same time I never once found myself bored! As I said the 3D effects were awesome and the fighting scenes really brought the movie to life. All the guys will enjoy Miss Artenton's ass in those leather pants as well ;). I'd definitely say this movie is worth a watch, in fact i'd happily watch it again :) The way in which the movie finishes also makes it clear to all that there will most definitely be a ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch hunters 2"" and hey, I'll be the first in line to see it :)"

","I saw this on a Sunday afternoon with a group of mates. To be honest, I was expecting a piece of crap movie. You know the type, full of trite dialogue, bad acting and copious amounts of special effects. In a way, I was right; this was an accurate way of viewing the movie: The acting was quite bad, despite the fact that some B-grade actors of moderate note starred, the dialogue was riddled with awful one-liners and the special effects were incredibly gory. However, in viewing the movie in that way, I have sort of missed the point. This movie was, despite its conventional flaws, was enjoyable. The special effects were very good, and in a way, this film was exactly what I wanted to see on Sunday afternoon; a light, enjoyable movie. If you are a film school student who views every film as a sort of analytical algorithm, then I doubt you will enjoy this film. However, if you want to see a movie with intense action and some neat special effects, you should not think twice about buying a ticket for this film."

Children are missing and witches are suspected. The film is smart enough to poke fun at itself, but serious enough to scare the hell out of you. The witches are ugly, powerful, intelligent, merciless, and dark. The film is a gem in its cinematography, casting, cast, acting, and story. I was expecting less and got a lot more for my money. Don't believe any negative reviews. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton star in this film that's definitely NOT for children.

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action packed film. Based on the popular fairy tale, the director (Tommy Wirkola) brought it to life. Starring Jeremy Renner as Hansel, and Gemma Arterton as Gretel. This brother and sister duo goes from innocent little kids to kick-ass bounty hunters. They travel from village to village killing every witch in their path. As easy as that sounds, their biggest mission lies ahead in the village of Augsburg, a town that has ""witch"" written all over it. And just because this is a fairy tale, doesn't mean its for kids, it's actually for a mature audience. After you see this 88 minute non stop action thriller you wont look at the fairy tale the same."

Hansel and Gretel is a fun,dumb theme park ride,nothing more,nothing less. The film is telling the traumatic after affects of the ""Ginger Bread House Incident"" and to be honest,I kinda like the way they went with this. The film has some very unique things to it like the whole diabetes thing (if you have seen the film,you now what I am talking about),and the whole thing with the Trolls was kind of cool for me. Essentially the film is like a bloody Van Helsing meets Army of Darkness and it is really proud of it to. The acting is bad and so is the dialog but you know what,it is supposed to be, and you have to go into this film with the right attitude. See this flick if your looking for a senseless action flick.

I saw it in 3D and the 3D graphics were very good.<br/><br/>I liked that couldn't predict what you were led to think. The whole time i thought Mina(the pretty strawberry-blonde that always appeared to help Hansel) was going to double cross Hansel and was the long haired witch that was working with Muriel(the most powerful witch in the whole movie). And I though Muriel was going to turn out to be their mother because both Muriel and Hansel and Gretel's mother looked very similar.<br/><br/>The only things that i didn't like was the unnecessary F bombs(they just felt forced and only one line made sense with it), all the bad one liners(they made it comical though) and Edward the troll wasn't true to being a troll. His character was necessary but he shouldn't have been classified as a troll. Also his animation was clear and it was like listening to Bane speak. I couldn't understand what he was saying at all."

","The old story that our grandmothers used to tell us before sleep is now presented as an upgraded version called Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters following the same formula used in similar movies like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter: lots of action, blood and some funny moments. <br/><br/>After killing the witch that trapped them inside the famous ""house made of candies"", Hansel and Gretel grow up and develop an interesting occupation: witch hunters. Then, they are called to a village where children are being kidnapped by witched. Later, it is discovered that a powerful witch has diabolical plans - she wants to use the children and a white witch's heart in a ritual that will make her and other witches powerful forever. The adventure is set and joining Hansel and Gretel there is a young aspiring witch hunter and a Troll who has a good heart.<br/><br/>The story seems a bit silly, but the action sequences made the difference here - it is in a particular way ""thrilling"". There is however a lot of blood - obvious it's not like the ""Saw Series"" or a Tarantino movie, but a decapitation scene for a little children may be a bit strong. The film was probably made aimed to more grown up kids - 12 and over - teenagers and adults.<br/><br/>Overall, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is worth watching if you want to have a relaxing time at the movies.

","Red Riding Hood was probably one of the worst films ever...and, it was so bad that it was actually fun to make fun of it simply because it was trying to be serious and didn't realize how ridiculous it was. Where this film was just predictable and dumb, attempting to be clever and funny but failing at both, and so utterly unbelievable it became a pointless effort of this film even existing. You truly begin to wonder ""Who actually gave this writer/director money to make this rotten diaper heap?"" It's a completely modern story with the ""look"" of a fairy tale world...and that's it. There is absolutely nothing else to ground it in the fairy tale world other than the costumes, scenery, and the title. Marrying the two worlds is not only ridiculous, off-putting, but a total disaster. Hansel and Gretel might as well be walking around today's streets of New York hunting witches because they talk and act modern, they use weapons that weren't even around for over 100 years later, and Gretel's father...excuse me, I mean brother, is the same age when they're children but when they grow up he's easily 15-20 years older than her. Seriously, you have a man in his 40s running around pretending he's some 25-yr-old guy. Literally, this film will stoop to any level of complete ridiculous and disbelief. And if the director put so little thought or care into creating this world, why should we care? I never thought this movie would be good because even the trailer looked terrible and ridiculous, but since it was free on Netflix I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt that it might actually be some fun action movie. Wrong. The movie is just as terrible as the trailer except for the fact that it drags out these pointless, predictable scenes that make it even worse than the trailer. This is literally one of those terrible, late night films you see on Sy-Fy channel that somehow managed to get a $50,000,000 budget instead of $3,000,000. You really have to wonder who the director had to sleep with to get Jeremy Renner and a major release for this crap. Red Riding Hood was actually better because at least we had a good time making fun of that movie where I couldn't even sit through more than 20 minutes of this, and even that was pushing it. I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes, but I again, gave it the benefit of the doubt it didn't deserve.<br/><br/>Anyone who gave this a 9 or 10 star is making money off of this film in some way (or trying to), 'cause this isn't even good brainless fun, it's just so poorly written there is literally nothing to it other than Jeremy Renner and his ""sister"" attempting to be funny and tough on occasions. And their whole story is their parents put them in the woods one night, left them, and then they stumbled upon the witch, and they never found their parents again? Why? Were they a sacrifice to the witch and the parents left? Obviously, the writer/director didn't know either and just needed to find a way to dump them in the woods and make them orphans. Also, were there actually newspapers back then? I'm pretty sure printing was very limited back then and only for the wealthy. Not to mention, I don't think many people from that time period were even literate. I'm pretty sure if you check the writer/director's IQ it's dangling around 95, 'cause even if he wrote this crap in 3 nights you would think he could still come up with some better explanations for what he did in this script.<br/><br/>This film is literally as bad as that crap heap Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Solomon, who is another director you seriously had to wonder what producer was dumb enough to give him a budget. If you want to watch dumb fun, just watch Evil Dead again or find something better. This film is a complete waste of anyone's time."

I have to confess I was under warning, I had watched ""Dead Snow"" and, despite the fact of being a Norwegian film, which it seems to give some points to people for their reviews, I didn't enjoy it. But, as I've already said, B-movies with crazy plot may be welcomeor not.<br/><br/>Let's get into the movie. The intro: After a thousand stereotyped production for this kind of works (pseudo-gothic American way adaptation form an European, mostly, tale) I must say it wasn't bad, though it's ruined by the last line which I don't want to remember. Also, seeing MTV as producer it's a very bad sign telling us this won't improve. Plot: Absurd, but I repeat, this is b-movie, no one would search logic here. But makers could have avoid anachronism which could embarrassed even apes. Kung-fu witches, ""Wild Wild West"" style weapons, annoying kid friend, Hansel and Gretel as the center of witchcraft, chosen heroes not by working class (sorry John).<br/><br/>Casting: It has bothered me, particularly Stormare's character which is totally out of place. Janssen as karate diva is too weird, doesn't work for me. Renner is too old for being the same age brother of Arterton, hot as hell with her leather catsuit, by the way, there is no chemistry between them, even there is more between Gretel and the Giant, most funny and interesting character of all.<br/><br/>In short, the director has gotten a bigger budget to develop all the stupid action set-pieces, for example coven's shooting, something to be ashamed.

Was it that there was really terrible acting, or was the screenplay just too awful for the actors to do anything with it? Even the kitchy make- up was a total face.

Yet, the makers rejoice in their own mistakes. The lead sister-brother pair, who never seem to exhaust in stamina or strength, find themselves saving a village's ass from witches. Of course, dim- witted witches.<br/><br/>Superhero movies with such vague plots & screenplay are mounting up in mainstream Hollywood. They lack everything to be even considered. Waste of talent (Hans Zimmer) & money & time. I don't want a sequel.<br/><br/>Women in here love to wobble their chests and reveal their cleavages (or is it their dresses?), while their men succeed acting brainlessly. With a hard try of bringing emotions into the already worn-down plot they end up referencing King Kong; I rate it a merciless 2.4/10.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended. Even if you are a fan of Gemma Arterton, better Google her photos.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO<br/><br/>Profanity: Mild | Nudity: Strong | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Sex: No | Vulgarity: No | Violence: Critical | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mild"

","It would be able to hold your attention for about as long as the movie lasts, and then you're ready for it to be done with. I, personally, thought that it had a ""Little Red Ridding Hood"" (the new one)feel to it with also made it a little cheesy too. But then again, a lot of people like that ""cheesy"" type of film. The type of film would be considered Action, Horror, Comedy. There is some gore in the film during fight scenes, but it's not that bad. All the characters where played well. I just wasn't a big fan of the story line, and how it busts out with something that's like, ""Whaaaaaat, that's not supposed to be in THIS movie is it?"" LOL"
"SocalSam","5","2","6","6 February 2013"," It is either horror movie or a horrible movie
","OK, film violates the 3 rule, that is: do something 3 things and no more. The battle of witches versus Hansel and Gretel, seemed to follow exactly the same process. One would think that H & G would have a little debrief before the next fight and figure out that they would get beat up if they do... whatever they did against the witches in the individual fight.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully shot film and the editing is tight with good make-up, special effects and costume. But...the story was poorly thought out and the speaking parts were confusing.<br/><br/>Key mistakes: Old guy helping out the H&G pair is forced to shoot himself by a witch. This added nothing to the overall story, except it added about a minute of runtime. H&G get absolutely flogged by the bad guys, and then are all fixed up in only a few hours. Really? And where did the insulin come from? Did Hansel have be shown giving himself a shot through his clothes (a great infection vector)? Really, again didn't add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, catch on Netflix when it hits there, you might want to be doing a jigsaw puzzle or something while watching so it doesn't seem like a total waste of time.<br/><br/>Finally, the weapons were really confusing. Why a multiple shot cross bow with a weird shotgun, then cartridge shotgun, then a machine gun. Then the final scene is just mess.<br/><br/>But it is better then ""Ted"". You won't throw up or die watching it."
"martinjberg","5","2","6","5 February 2013"," Something to watch while you are having popcorn.
","To be honest I went and saw this film because there wasn't much else available tonight, and OK it is not the most intelligent film I have seen but it is also a lot better then for e.g ""Last stand"", which is also a easy going action. What I knew about the film before I saw was what I read on the poster. The film takes the old fairytale and spins it, so if you are a Grimm purist I am not sure that you would agree on all the details in the story. There is a lot of blood spill in it. I saw a Malaysian version which may explain some crude cuts (since they happened when someone was about to get naked it seems likely). The environment in the film are nicely put together, especially the scenes in the forest. Both main actors do a good job. If you like films like Van Helsing or Blade I am sure that you like this one as well."
"jaxbubba","5","2","6","4 February 2013"," A tad bit amusing...
","Hopefully this film will put an end to all these Hollywood fairy tale, live action monstrosities. From 'Mirror, Mirror' to 'Snow White and the Huntsman' from 'Grimm' to 'Once Upon A Time' it's really almost comical how every other studio in Hollywood will initiate similar projects once one studio decides to ""greenlight"" a certain genre of film. This film is certainty not the worst of the bunch; however, the mish-mash of fantasy, action adventure, shoot 'em up genres with questionable date appropriate weapon usage emphatically left me perplexed while watching this film.<br/><br/>His film stars Jeremy Renner as Hansel; coming off a hugely successful year with 'The Bourne Legacy' and 'The Avengers', I am positive that this film will not add much credibility to his acting body of work. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in an interview at Cannes in 2011with Famke Janssen (the film's nemesis Muriel); she stated that she only took her role as the head witch because she had to pay off her mortgage.<br/><br/>Based on the children's tale in which two children, siblings (brother & sister) are abandoned in the forest by their father and then stumble upon a witch's cottage made totally of candy. Hansel and Gretel's reputation of conquering Witch Hunters is catapulted to legendary status as they successfully annihilate children abducting witches throughout all the lands. It seems that that the two siblings have become immune to witch's hexes, which is somehow associated to their initial witch eradication as children.<br/><br/>This is not an awful film, and I have to admit that I actually enjoyed the incredibly violent, morbidly grotesque, and extremely graphic murder death sequences that this film excelled at generating. From decapitations to drawn and quartering, this film certainly wasted no expense to visually articulating its ghastly tale of the wickedly macabre. If more time could have been taken with regards to plot, script, and CGI effects; this film could have possibly been just a tab bit more palatable. However, with all that said, I am actually going to give a lukewarm recommendation to see that film. Definitely worth the price of renting, this film will easily appease those sick and twisted viewers out there who enjoy nothing more than a good 'tree trunk to the face' head explosion, or better yet, a horde of witches diced into bite size morsels as they are chased into a piano wire mesh entrapment. Again this is not award winning caliber acting; however, it is moderately amusing.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel"""

Bodies, and lots of them, being tossed into and through hard solid objects! Hard objects, and lots of them, shattering, splitting, disintegrating, and generally falling apart when human bodies get thrown through them! Ridiculous make-up effects! Fights! And all of these sights so repetitively done that they stop being interesting as redundant scenery on your train ride to Stupidville. Oh, but you'd still better watch because you'll be rewarded by getting to see a big rubber troll!

"willcundallreview","3","1","2","26 December 2015"," Apparently it has a bit of a cult status.......
","Fairy tales are never usually this gory and yet also so sickly to look at design wise, it looks like an outdoor set made of well not very nice designs. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fantasy horror movie directed and written by Norwegian Tommy Wirkola who is probably before this best known for Zombie film ""Dead Snow"" but really doesn't do too much at all to make this original, well done or even that fun. I'm sure some people have watched this and felt it to be not serious, just a little escapism, which is fine of course but I just felt personally it was not well written, not very well directed and it just felt too much of a bad movie to be even okay.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton lead the cast as the two sibling witch hunters whose experience in the beginning of the film leads them to just want to destroy all witches. They play their roles well but to be fair do nothing to save them from being generic characters in a pretty basic story film, It's not really the case with this that the acting hurts it. Oh but wait, maybe it is the acting (not the main two cast members) because some of those witches, I could not stand it, it seriously felt like acting done in some kind of over the top film that even this movie doesn't feel like. I'm not quite sure why Famke Janssen appears in this movie, it is really not her best role to be fair and I just couldn't bare what goes on with her character for much longer in this.<br/><br/>Hey I mean this movie is really neither horrific nor reaching the heights of being just an average old film, it's just bad but not in a way where it feels unwatchable. The film tries to weave itself the nicest of crazy stories and does honestly try with the stunts and such, but in the end it just feels too rushed and just not well made enough. As for the violence involved well for me it is used for comedic effect of course, the movie apparently doesn't take itself seriously when blatantly (or by accident) it does. Wirkola creates something that is not quite a gore-fest but leaves a bloody mess at certain times; this one isn't exactly for the kids to be honest. I almost forgot, the script, Wirkola's writing creates this kind of comedic world where I'm supposed to laugh at every f-word the characters use, but seriously the script is not that great and the actual story that Wirkola creates is nothing short of predictable.<br/><br/>So really Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a film that should really have been OK, if it had anything original to say that is. It took a bit of a mauling from the critics when it first appeared but since then has gained a cult following, I even watched this thinking ""Maybe I will kind of like this"", I didn't as you can see. It has the right feel to it, even the start of the film I thought to myself maybe this will be some good old fun and 88 minutes where I can experience some decent fighting and a story to boot but really it squanders that opportunity towards its ending where it just doesn't even try and yet again it looks, well yet again not very nice."
"Scarecrow-88","3","1","2","6 August 2015"," Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters
","Well, good ole Hollywood takes another Grimm dark fairy tale and loads with bloated CGI effects and action set pieces. Want to see Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemmer Arterton) using heavy artillery to massacre witches? Here is the perfect entertainment for you. Their parents taken from them violently as a children thanks to those evil witches (headed by a particularly loathsome but still quite attractive Famke Janssen, having too much fun when her pretty face is featured; but most of the time it's a CGI hideous visage), Hansel and Gretel have grown into hunters packing a lot of heat (the kind of machine guns, crossbows, and unfolding shotguns modified to look medieval even if they clash with the period this film is set). Hansel has a ""condition"" thanks to a witch's curse through a ""candy poison"" that requires him to inject a serum to keep him well (if he doesn't, he dies) when a timer on his arm goes off. Meanwhile, a white witch falls head over heels for Hansel, a giant troll defends and protects Gretel when she needs it the most, and Hansel and Gretel's ""biggest fan"" (he has followed their work, and his hero worship is enthusiastic, to say the least) ends up helping them take down their main nemesis as she is riding her broom furiously away from them through the woods (she's quite a driver, missing the branches and trees throughout). There's even a Gatling gun that makes an appearance, with the white witch just firing away at Hansel's urging, ruining a major blood moon Sabbath ritual with Gretel meant to lose her heart to the evil witches, with little chained kids also expected to be sacrificed as well. You even get Matrix stylized ""freeze action"" and lots of CGI bloodshed (the troll wipes out a very nasty group of villagers pummeling Gretel, using its massive fists as bludgeoning tools and a large tree as a weapon also). When witches aren't being blown away, trees endure Predator like destruction. The woods are not safe as long as the hunters and their prey are loose. Thanks to CGI, the witches are all kinds of ugly, their faces and eyes grotesque, as foul as their behavior. I'm surprised the talent involved in this rather disposable medieval action flick that really does take a giant crap on the childhood story written particularly to give us the chills. All the gunplay and martial arts (yes, the witches seem to possess the fighting skills of Jason Bourne) really are absurd. All the money wasted on this; sheesh."
"phd_travel","8","1","2","5 August 2013"," Exciting funny story with lost of action
","The story is quite a humorously written action version of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. The original fairytale gets covered quickly with the house made of candy and the witch. Fast forward to the pair of adult witch slayers. Liked the modern dialog thrown in eg the fan stuff. Also the weapons were inventive with the version of modern guns. The explanation of the parents story is clever and the troll and good witches complete the plot well.<br/><br/>The violence makes this one for only older teens upwards. It has lost of killings and lots of fighting - maybe too much punching and kicking and exploding bodies. Still not as graphically violent as a Quentin movie. The witches are a refreshing villain - we have had too many zombies and vampires. Their powers seemed way too strong though.<br/><br/>I always thought Famke Janssen is more suited to the villain role and she is well cast here as the evil witch. Gemma is quite suited to her tomboyish role. Jeremy Renner is a strange pick. Someone a bit more leading man looking would have been a better choice.<br/><br/>Overall worth a watch for more mature audiences."

","I will be honest and say that I didn't think that Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters would be any good. Though it does star one of my favorite actors. I will also be honest and say that I'm not sure that it is worth owning. There were no bloopers or any kind of features. This movie is now on DVD and Blu-ray. Spending only a dollar, I rented this movie from Redbox. It was worth all hundred pennies.<br/><br/>Hansel (Jeremy Renner, ""Avengers"") and Gretel (Gemma Arterton, ""Prince of Persia"") are orphans (brother and sister obviously) that go from being helpless in the forest to the number one people you want to ask for when someone cries ""WITCH"". The movie starts out with the two as kids (obviously) and they are left alone in the forest by their dad. Audiences will see by the end of the movie why the movie starts the way it does (and for good reason). The kids fight off a witch (as in the folktale our parents read to us) after eating candy and once the witch is dead, become obsessed with it.<br/><br/>The siblings travel to a town that is heard to have kids missing. Long story short, you find out that Jean Gray is the bad guy or well Famke Janssen plays the bad witch. However, by the end of the movie you learn of bad witches like Famke Janssen's character Muriel but there are also good witches like Pihla Viitala (European actress so no known movies to me) who plays the white witch Mina.<br/><br/>http://ladycomplainerblog.wordpress.com/moviereviews"

Sure it's lowbrow entertainment I suppose, but I just accepted that the time period made absolutely no sense in terms of weapons they were using, or costumes they were wearing, or dialogue for that matter, and I had a blast watching it. I thought it was cheesy, funny, over the top violent and pretty cool. Famke Janssen was awesome as the grand dark/wicked witch Muriel. Great rental for a no- brainer movie night. I could see it being a cult classic. I know I'll definitely watch it again. Maybe I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater, but I think it's worth every penny as a rental. Definitely not for kids though. Forget what the critics or I say, check it out and see for yourself."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","12 June 2013"," A surprisingly fun action gore-fest
","I didn't honestly think I would enjoy Hansel and Gretel. The trailers somehow just didn't appeal to me and I still have trouble accepting Jeremy Renner as a lead star. Even when I started the movie I still wasn't sure but by the end I was definitely sure...it was a blast. Silly at times? Absolutely. And I think entirely on purpose. An absolute R Rated gore-fest splatter-house that I was not expecting at all. I wasn't sure it fit the tone of the film or that it was necessary but you know sometimes its just plain fun to have a just for adults movie that is a guilty pleasure like this one. It was like a Disney Fairytale completely corrupted and torn apart, and I mean that positively. The special effects were decent although sometimes a little over the top but then again everything about this movie was excessive and over the top. The weapons were huge and ridiculous, the characters (especially the witches) were almost campy at times but I swear it was all on purpose. I read a review on here that actually compared this film to Evil Dead and I completely see that!! I mean, the budget is 50 times that of Evil Dead but the campy fun and exaggerated characters and special effects...it was simply fun.<br/><br/>I don't dislike Jeremy Renner as an actor. However, I think the guy has struggles to be the leading man. I'm not sure he has the charisma on screen to be THEE guy. He's a good supporting actor (Ghost Protocol, Avengers etc) but I'm not a huge fan yet. However...that being said this was a step in the right direction. His fast talking, quick witted, sarcastic Hansel was fun and a strong character. He still wasn't the best of the twosome. Gemma Arterton was a kick butt heroine. She was like Xena, Buffy, and She-Ra all rolled into one. She showed an intensity and charisma on screen that made her shine in every scene. Pihla Viitala plays Renner's love interest and a mysterious girl that comes to their aid. She does alright in the role but I felt like her role was entirely unnecessary. She was strictly there for a romance and for an obligatory R Rated nude scene. Her performance felt unwarranted. Famke Janssen plays the witch leader and is a great over the top villain. She is not someone who normally plays the villain and she nails it while being completely campy at times but in all the best ways. The multi-talented Zoe Bell also deserves honourable mention as one of the main witches. She looks great and does a decent job without a lot of depth to her character.<br/><br/>Bucking the rule of thumb that states a writer who directs his own movie does an awful job Tommy Wirkola crafts an incredibly entertaining experience. While I have not seen Dead Snow I've heard that it is an excellent film and he clearly has a handle on how to craft a funny, dark, twisted fairy tale with a ton of action. He uses the fairly large budget (50 Milllion) to the best of his ability and it works. I can see that this film wouldn't be for everyone. A peer of mine stated that they thought the acting in the film was just awful but I didn't get that at all. I think it all breaks down to how purposely campy the film was designed to be. I think a sequel would be great to watch but at the same time I don't think they could capture what they did here. Is it a brilliant movie? No not brilliant but entirely entertaining and sometimes there is nothing wrong with that. If you're looking for a good R Rated fun night in then this one should fulfil those expectations thoroughly. 8.5/10"

It's thought that witches are responsible. Just as the eager town's Sheriff is about to lynch an accused witch, Hansel & Gretel show up and release the girl after confirming she's not a witch. They've been hired by the mayor to find the witch who's abducting all the kids.<br/><br/>And they do find a bunch of witches who aren't related to the abductions. Meanwhile the Sheriff and his gang run into the main evil witch. It takes a while but H&G eventually discover that the witch has to abduct 12 kids for some ritual. She's got only one kid to go. When they confront her, they realize that they are no match for her, she's too powerful. But they eventually figure out how to stop her on the night of the ritual. We also learn more about their past and their parents.<br/><br/>At first I wasn't particularly thrilled with Hansel & Gretel. Too much takes place at night, I'm getting tired of tiny, dirty medieval cardboard towns, and their townspeople. But it eventually won me over. It's got a great cast in Renner, Stormare, the beautiful Arterton, and Janssen. The effect are great, the action is fun; and there's plenty of gore. Particularly cool was a giant gnome who works for the evil witch. The plot features nothing new and could have really benefited from some original idea, probably another writer should have been added to help. Wirkola is an excellent director and the whole movie is just so competently done. It could have easily been goofy, silly, if not cheap, but it's the opposite.

","What, there's a new movie about Hansel & Gretel, wow I would like to see that! After about twenty minutes into the movie: what, they are going to hunt witches all the time, this is the movie? Well, yes, the movie is called Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, it stands to reason that they would spend most of the time in the movie hunting down witches (and burning them, mmm crispy). Yet another one of those ""what if"" or ""spin on a classic tale"" movies that has come out in the recent years, but oddly enough I really liked this one. I mean, as much as you can like a movie like this, it's really great for the first viewing and the replay value due to the awesome visual effects is also big, but still, it's missing that key element, that undefinable thing that some movies just have whether it's the mood of the movie, actors, conditions of the shoot or something else that would make this a cult classic. In case you are wondering is there any violence at all in this movie and why should I see it, check out the rant after the summary.<br/><br/>You all know the classic tale of Hansel & Gretel, so you are somewhat prepared for the surprise that is coming (well, fully prepared considering the title of the movie). Movie picks up years after they slaughtered the witch, and features Hansel and Gretel all grown up (especially Gretel, yummy), who are now witch hunters. Blessed by some magic, they impervious to witches spells making them the ultimate killing machines, especially with the huge arsenal that they have at their disposal (Gretels shotgun and Hansels cannon :). They are hired by the mayor of the small town of Augsburg to find out who is taking children and are they alive. A suspected usual witchcraft gig will soon turn into something much more serious and threatening and two siblings will have to battle one of the most powerful witches in the world and her many followers...<br/><br/>Dismemberment, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and all the other fun acts of violence that you wouldn't expect to see in a ""kiddie"" movie are here. There's even a nude scene, granted it's quite short, but still enough to raise a few eyebrows (or other things). And to all those puritans who are now screaming oh my gosh, that is a children's book, please go online and read the original stories that are filled with murder, mayhem and mutilation, not to mention some sick and perverse ideas. So this is a full blown fun ride with cool ""steampunked"" weapons and phenomenal special effects. This all would be for nothing if the director didn't know what he's doing, but luckily for us he does. Tommy Wirkola is the man! After Dead Snow, also a great movie, he strikes again! Camera work, action sequences, chases and everything else is done very professionally. To me, the style seemed like an homage to the Evil Dead franchise. And the witches are really scary, wet your pants scary, better call Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (if you can afford them of course, maybe they have some sort of payment plan or something, who knows...)

","Hansel and Gretel, those two fairy tale children forced to fatten themselves up for dinner, are now older with a lucrative occupation described in the title – although there's a lot more killing than hunting going on.<br/><br/>Beginning with a quick reintroduction to the sibling's famous back story against the candy house witch (more hyperactive than menacing), we cut to an opening credit montage of newspaper clippings with our heroes in action, fighting witches throughout the dark forest countryside.<br/><br/>The initial villains – before Famke Janssen's sinister Muriel takes over – are the hillbilly townspeople ala religious fanatics that burn maidens without a proper trial, introducing the love interest: a blond-haired lass quickly warming up to Jeremy Renner's tough-as-nails Hansel. This also intentionally (and way too obviously) separates our heroes from those infamous knee-jerk scoundrels who gave witch hunting a bad name.<br/><br/>Loaded with machine guns and other modern weaponry, the Hansel and Gretel duo take down broom-riding aggressors in scenes so fast-paced and close-up, you might have to close your eyes to await each dizzying conclusion. Noisy and boisterous, the witches are hardly distinguished from each other, making all the fights seem repetitive and ultimately tiresome.<br/><br/>Renner does a decent job as Hansel, spouting tough guy one-liners (""I say burn them all"") and never showing his emotions; while sister Gretel, played by Gemma Arterton... along with a young boy who attempts writing their story... seem too modern for the ancient setting, using words like ""Awesome."" <br/><br/>In the vein of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN which inspired VAN HELSING and all the UNDERWORLD flicks, HANSEL AND GRETEL wields too much action to be as mysterious or, for that matter, engaging as the timeless story that it's based.<br/><br/>But if you're up for a lotta witch whoopin' – especially the climax where a makeshift Gatling gun massacres an entire bloody lot of 'em – this mindless roller coaster is just for you."

I'd say that the potentially incestuous overtones that clearly hung over these 2 bad-ass, witch-hunting superheroes (who had absolutely no superpowers) was pretty obvious (at least to an observant viewer, like myself).<br/><br/>And, with that in mind, I can tell you one thing for certain - It was Gretel, not Hansel, who wore the pants in this family of hateful, blindly-vengeful bounty hunters.<br/><br/>I clearly saw this movie and its title characters as being something of a metaphor depicting the Nazi witch-hunts and extermination of Jews during WW2 in Germany. (or) How about an allegorical statement about Caucasian Americans (as the good ""white"" witches"") and their deep-rooted prejudice towards Blacks (represented as the despised ""black"" witches and their voodoo)? <br/><br/>Well, any way I looked at it, I saw the underlying tone of Hansel & Gretel's story to be that of absolute blind-hatred and the indiscriminate extermination of something, or someone, who one doesn't even want to try to understand. (Yeah. Just unmercifully kill them all and that'll make everything alright for the self-proclaimed and self-righteous good guys & gals) <br/><br/>At this point I'm not going to even get into a full-blown complaint about the out-of-whack, hi-tech weaponry that was made available exclusively to Hansel & Gretel. But, considering the time-frame of this film's story, I'd sure like to know who the hell it was who designed & built this dazzling array of artillery for these 2 roving heroes.<br/><br/>(I think that if the witches finally wised-up and started designing their very own guns, then we'd really see who kicks whose ass!) <br/><br/>As well, I think it's quite pointless for me to angrily point out how often the word ""fukk"" was spoken by either darling Hansel or (especially) Gretel-dearest. I just have to keep in mind that these 2 were just being exactly who they were - A pair of bazooka-toting, Rambo-like bullies.<br/><br/>The one thing that I am in total agreement on in regards to this picture is when people say ""This is a stupid movie that knows it's stupid."" Yes. I do agree with this, but with that I add, ""It may be a stupid movie that knows it's stupid, but it's still smart enough to know that its audience (who choose to applaud that stupidity, which I don't) are about 10x more stupid than it is."" <br/><br/>And, finally - Speaking about the likes of Will Ferrell and him producing this ass-backwards movie (where guns are 20x more effective than the most powerful witchcraft imaginable), I think that it was just like that piece of slimy snot to financially back a turd like this.<br/><br/>P.S. - About the only character in the story who I kinda thought was ""OK"" was Edward, the Troll (who could've easily been a distant cousin of Shrek's). <br/><br/>Of course, Edward wasn't really given enough screen-time, but I'm sure his day is coming soon for his very own feature film, or, at least, a TV spot where, grumpy as can be, he's promoting the likes of personal hygiene products, and such."

","""Me and my sister... we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch. But that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood. Witch blood. And we haven't stopped since.""<br/><br/>Hansel & Gretel is yet another classic fairytale that has been brought to the big screen in an atrocious manner. This new wave of dark fairy tales have been a complete disappointment for me considering I really didn't like Snow White or the Jack the Giant Slayer films either. Despite consisting of a talented cast and a well known story, these movies seem to lack any character development whatsoever and these well known Hollywood actors can't do anything to save them from being a complete failure. The problem may lie on the screenplay considering they take such classic and familiar stories and present ridiculous twists while trying to be much darker. Even when these films try to be funny, the comedy doesn't work either; and despite having some extremely nice visuals the set pieces aren't enough to draw us in and make us care for the characters. Hansel & Gretel is basically one action sequence after another with lots of blood and without any buildup for us to identify with any of the characters. Despite being such well known actors, these characters failed to attract me, and even the villain in this film (played by Famke Janssen) is poorly developed. The movie is less than 90 minutes long, and the action sequences take up almost the entirety of the film making this just a boring and tedious experiment where we see one character who we never really know get his head blown off. The film is directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola following the success of his 2009 local horror film, Dead Snow, involving Nazi zombie soldiers. He was also responsible for the screenplay as well. There is not much positive things I could say about this film, except that I really like the two lead actors and am a little disappointed they chose to play these characters.<br/><br/>The story introduces us to Hansel and Gretel as kids escaping from the candy house after the witch had imprisoned them. Everything from that point on is a reinvention of the fairytale by Wirkola. The two siblings grow up to become witch hunters after their horrific experience. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) travel from town to town collecting bounty fees for killing off the evil witches nearby. At the moment, the Mayor (Rainer Bock) of a small village recruits the siblings' service after 11 children have gone missing. The Sheriff (Peter Stormare) isn't too pleased with the arrival of these two siblings considering they made him look bad in front of the entire town after saving a local village woman named Mina (Pihla Vitala) who he believed to be a witch and wanted to burn her at the stake. The two witch hunters begin to investigate the disappearances of the children and realize that a dangerous witch named Muriel (Famke Janssen) is behind the kidnappings. With the help of a local boy named Ben (Thomas Mann) and Edward the troll (Robin Atkins Downes) they face off against Muriel and her covenant of witches. <br/><br/>There is really no need for me to continue on blabbing about how much I disliked this film. There is nothing going on here plot wise. These fairy tales haven't crossed over too well to the big screen and I'm afraid they might be ruining all these childhood stories I enjoyed reading about. Having seen all these classic fairy tales turned into movies I have to admit that Shyamalan's The Lady in the Water is becoming more and more valuable to me. This genre has resulted rather difficult for me to enjoy, but somehow Lady in the Water which plays out like a fairytale worked a lot better than these films. Shyamalan might be criticized by many people, but he knows how to make movies better than your average director. He has failed recently in his last two big film adaptations (After Earth and The Last Airbender), but he has made so many great films in the past and Lady in the Water is turning into a masterpiece if you compare it to these recent fairytale adaptations that have come out. Hansel & Gretel may just be the worst one in this genre and it is a shame because I really like Jeremy Renner and believe he has made some incredible films. I also like Gemma Arterton, who I loved as a James Bond girl, and despite looking very good here, her talent is wasted in this senseless action film. This is one of the worst films of 2013."

","I actually only seen some previews a long while ago, and finally decided to watch it (June 2014) because it was on my ""to watch"" list. Oh! Was I disappointed! I actually had to force myself not to turn it off.<br/><br/>I imagined a film in some kind of ""Sleepy Hollow"", or ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", or even ""Stardust"". Well, not quite. Instead, it is more like a ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""; the heroes feel out of place, even incoherent with their background, and the witches (there is no spoiler here, it is a witch hunting movie after all) are stereotyped and very much frustrating to watch. If you loved the series ""Heroes"", then you might not understand what I'm talking about. Otherwise, the main characters are like the main characters in ""Heroes; kind of whiny, dull and childish; predictable and shallow.<br/><br/>The story does not let the viewer discover any intrigue, instead it lays out so many clues that once the plots are revealed, there is nothing to learn from the movie any more (and this point happens about 45 minutes before the movie actually ends). Worse! Most of the events are so coincidental that it was impossible for me to immerse myself in the story; I never saw any real threat to the main characters. Without revealing any plot, the main idea behind the story is not so much original, too, if you have seen a few movies before this one. <br/><br/>As for the acting, imagine living in the 15th century, chasing witches with other farmers and townspeople, to see these punks swearing (i.e. f work) and coming about carrying 20th century weapons. Then, chasing witches a la marvel style; being tossed around in ways that it would kill any normal human beings, or at least injure then very badly, etc.<br/><br/>Alright, but I did give it 3 out of 10. Apart from the childish movie intro, this movie is NOT for kids. There is gore and people dying... added some partial nudity and pretty scary faces for children to see. This is not a Disney movie and aims more at teenagers. And, despite my remarks on the main characters, they are not as annoying as all the other movies aimed at teens (i.e. Twilight, The Green Lantern, etc.), as the actors are slightly more mature and, thus, do not act like spoiled teen brats.<br/><br/>A movie to watch if nothing else more interesting."

","With an R-Rating, this movie had been sold to me like an action movie that was gonna have scary moments and some violence. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out that the gore is shown to a great and over the top extent. Not that this was a problem for me, as I think it had a great deal of style to an already showy flick. The performances in the movie fit perfectly with the story and make it a fun ride for the audience. Renner is a badass Hansel who loves to kill witches and party like there's no tomorrow. Gemma Artenton is beautiful as a determined Gretel, who seeks to find the truth about her parents's history. As the villain, Famke Janssen seems to have a great time playing a menacing witch who provokes our heroes in order to succeed in her mission to become basically immortal. Besides the violence, I thought the make-up was terrific as the angry faces of our antagonistic witches not only gave me chills but are enough to make a child have nightmares for weeks. This is strictly an adult movie and any connection to the sweet fairy tale we know is immediately thrown out the window as soon as the heavy violence kicks in.

","Unfortunately, this is another film that not only thinks profanity is entertaining, but it is used extensively throughout the film ... making it, basically, a classless endeavor.<br/><br/>The action is plentiful, but not overdone ... and the special effects are top drawer. Unfortunately, casting was haphazard to the point that I could not really get into the experience. No matter how good the action and special effects are ... poor casting can ruin a film, and it ruins this film (for me, anyway). Frankly, the only good casting was for the part of Muriel ... Famke Janssen was excellent in the part, and basically saves the film from becoming another cheap addition to a grocery store's $ 4.99 for six horror movies on one DVD, well, for the time being anyway. By the way, I also found that good casting was done with one other actress ... Ingrid Bolsø Berdal's role suited her quite well, and I found her rather delightful.<br/><br/>The photography is high quality, as is the lighting, props, and scenery. Couldn't have been better in those departments ... in fact, the movie is worth all the more due to its production quality. I think what I really found disappointing with the film is the casting of Hansel and Gretel ... the teaming is totally off. Their acting is sufficient, but they just don't belong together ... they don't blend at all, and that ruined the film for me. I can't help but wonder how much better the movie might have been if Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had been cast in the title roles?! Of course, they wouldn't have looked like brother and sister either. Oh well ... no classic here!"

The witch design was the coolest part of the movie and I wished during the final witch battle that the director showed off some of the other witches more. Even with these entertaining moments there are some terrible story moments. I am not going to go into details about specifics, but there was more than one groan. The acting was not campy enough for the premise and Renner cannot pull off a Bruce Campbell like character which this movie needs.

","I was looking forward to watching this... but left in disappointment.<br/><br/>This movie starts off with a 5 (or so) minute real-life portrayal of how Hansel & Gretel will look. However in the scene where we meet the witch in the ginger-bread house left me confused. I was expecting to see an old lady with wrinkly skin... whereas the Witch they showed us looked like a demon summoned straight from the deepest fiery pits of hell!<br/><br/>After that, we then fast-forward to the future, where they are both grown up and are professional Witch Hunters.<br/><br/>To start off with, Hansel has to be at least 15 years older than his sister, and they're only meant to be a few years apart (given they were both young children when they were abandoned).<br/><br/>Secondly, H&G is a German story, yet Hansel speaks with a pure American accent. English actress Gemma Arterton, who plays the role of Gretel, and the American accent she uses can easily be picked up as fake, and in the scenes where she's screaming, you can hear her natural English accent come out.<br/><br/>I found a lot of the time, the movie was repeating itself;<br/><br/>*They hunt witches *They engage in a fight *They get separated *The evil witch escapes<br/><br/>Also, considering it's set in the 1800s, Hansel has what appears to be a futuristic shotgun (not only one that wasn't invented then, but one that has not yet been invented today), and Gretel has a crossbow that fires darts as fast as a machine gun fires bullets. Let's not forget that in more than one scene, we see what appears to be a hand-held taser... in the 1800s mind you! Also in one of the final fight scenes, we see the 'good witch' fire what appears to be a mounted heavy machine gun that was used in WW2.<br/><br/>Another scene shows a witch locked up in a jail cell when another witch comes to free her, and can set fire to the building she's captive in by a simple motion of her hand. I mean... why doesn't the Witch locked up just do something to bust herself out?<br/><br/>Better yet, these witches don't need brooms, they can simply jump on old stick and ride away to safety.<br/><br/>And all along... a... well I don't know what the creature was, perhaps a cross between a troll and an ogre, who was on the witches team, turns out to be the biggest game changer of the movie by saving Gretel not once, but twice, from her demise... and let's not forget the virgin boy who tags along with them.<br/><br/>Entertaining at times but I can't recall seeing a movie with so many flaws.<br/><br/>5/10."

Both Jeremy Renner and Gemma Aterton know what this film is and seem to be having fun with it. The tone is fun and frantic not wanting to give you time to think to hard about what is going on or why. The violence is cartoonish and over the top, as the are ridiculous weapons (which do look like left overs from Hugh Jackman's Van Halsing). <br/><br/>I would also like draw attention to the marvelous practical effects used for Edward the Troll. These effects are wonderful to see and hark back to some of the best practical effects committed in children's cinema, such as ""The never ending Story"" or ""The Dark Crystal"". more about the effect in the bad section. <br/><br/>The bad: This never feels like a film that anyone in charge had any faith in. If you want to pull of a convincing fantasy world on screen I believe that the best way to do it is to go all out. through out the film I couldn't shake the feeling that they had wanted to go further but were being pulled back by the studio. <br/><br/>Much of the CGI is used to polish up the practical effects and work well but when the film relies on them, for gore or the magic it looks very cheap. <br/><br/>Overall: I would recommend giving this film a go and enjoy the fun and practical effects, but don't expect too much. The film feels more like an expensive TV show pilot than a Hollywood film. The need to expand the universe as a TV series is confirmed by the early closing credits scene."

","Perhaps the most disappointing movie of last year was Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a totally inept action period piece that had all the potential in the world to be an exciting B-movie style extravaganza. Instead, the film was undone by its complete inability to have an ounce of humor or fun to the proceedings. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, which looked quite similar in style to 'Vampire Hunter', plays out exactly the way that movie should have: a fun, absurd, bloody, and comical adventure that never takes itself too seriously and knows exactly the type of movie it is at all times. Director Tommy Wirkola gives Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters a very specific tone from the first scene, enabling audiences to know exactly the type of film to expect. This important tonal distinction is one that is refreshing in an era full of studio tent-poles filled with tonal inconsistencies that often come across as desperate attempts to hit every potential demographic at the same time. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters makes no attempt to hide what is: an R-rated horror/action pic aimed at people who don't mind if things are goofy or a little dumb. It has decidedly low aspirations, but it achieves what it sets out to do: entertain for 80 minutes with plenty of fights, mayhem, and humorous nods to the original Hansel & Gretel story.The teaming of Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as Hansel & Gretel is the reason that everything works as well as it does. Despite the notable age difference between the two, there is great chemistry between them that elevates the material even when the characters aren't quite as developed as they could have been. Both Renner and Arterton deliver one-liners like pros, taking dialogue that could have been absolutely eye-rollingly bad and making them greatly amusing. It also helps that both are believable as action heroes and luckily the action sequences are devoid of the shaky cam work that is the norm for studio pictures these days. If there's a downside to the action scenes, it's that so much of the movie takes place during the nighttime that occasionally it can be hard to see in key parts, especially the finale which seems rushed. The very last scene leaves the door wide open for a sequel, which has the potential to be even crazier and more out there than this one. Even if it doesn't lead to a franchise Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an entertaining and original stand-alone flick that is one of the better times I've had at the movies in 2013. 8/10"

She dies, they keep fighting the witch, that's it. Also, Hansel has diabetes, or some sugar sickness. The white witch (his lover) mentions she can help him. Nothing happens with that. She should have healed him. Lastly, where are Gretel's powers? Her mom was the great white witch. The evil witches have to sacrifice Gretel because she is the most powerful white witch now that her mother is dead. Correct? So WHERE are her powers?! She is good at fighting and that's great, but come on! Hansel should have powers too. Just my opinion, but I'm pretty big on how a story plays out. Again, I loved the movie. That's my two cents."

The movie itself has a nice plot twist on Hansel and Gretel enough to keep the viewer's interest and guessing. It deviates from the original story drastically, thx God, to make an adventurous, entertaining humerus movie. Renner has some great lines, but the humor does not overpower the action, the movie strikes a good balance between the two. My wife and I laughed hard in a few spots and maintained our interest throughout. If you are in for a mindless romp into Hollywood action adventure/ humor you'll love this movie. btw some pretty explicit violence in here if you are gunshy or blood squeamish I'd back off and pick another.

","Hansel and Gretel, abandoned in the woods as children by their father, were able to triumph over the witch who trapped them in her house made of candy. Now grown, they make their living hunting and exterminating witches, and they are summoned to a town where a number of children have gone missing.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton have fun playing witch hunters who, quite frankly, are complete rubbish, constantly getting their *rses handed to them by a succession of witches throughout the film. It is only when they unleash a host of preposterous weapons of mass destruction (I do love me a mediaeval machine gun, not to mention a taser which doubles as a defibrillator!) that the tide finally turns.<br/><br/>This film tries to go for the straight-faced romp vibe of Van Helsing, but doesn't quite make it, and I'm not sure why. It might be because it is very strong – there is some extremely graphic violence here (heads exploding, people being ripped apart etc.) together with some very ripe language, making this (in my view) an unnecessarily extreme experience, thus reducing the size of its audience. Example: there comes a point when one of the siblings says, ""You've got to be f***ing kidding me!"" in circumstances which make the line funny: several minutes later the other sibling says exactly the same thing, and the repeat is doubly funny. But the line would have been just as funny, both times, without the profanity – I felt a lot of the extremeness was put there because the filmmakers felt it ought to be there, rather than because it added anything.<br/><br/>The production values are high, but something was missing and I'm not sure what it was.<br/><br/>There were time when things came at you, but the 3D was mostly forgettable."

","First and foremost my personal feelings towards this movie was complete satisfaction. I didn't want to be thrown a story of intense proportion, I didn't want to spend 3 hours trying to work out who is what, where is which etc. I wanted ACTION. I wanted an EPIC SOUNDTRACK. I wanted GORE and I wanted to be able to get that little smile I get when you see something and thing quietly ""Holy s***... That right there? That was awesome!"".<br/><br/>Did Hansel and Gretel provide? YES. YES IT DID.<br/><br/>It has the action I expected and then some. It had Jeremy and Gemma portrayed as complete bada** witch hunters. With a soundtrack from Hans Zimmer and Atli Orvarsson how could I complain! <br/><br/>No, it has no epic underlying plot, not many twists BUT the story line is what I wanted, and yes even the little twists here and there were perfect to keep an action oriented movie goer interested. No ""Inception"" style major plot twists and complicated characters. <br/><br/>To put it simply, it was exactly what I expected, and that little more to make it one of those simple action movies that I could watch a thousand times and still be impressed. People need to stop comparing it to drama styled movies and complex character progression oriented films. I'm actually quite disappointed with IMDb. They've turned into the equivalent of IGN. Near nothing has a review of even higher than an 8/10 in their entire current cinema lists, yet users are giving things like this great scores for what it did right in comparison to what was wrong.<br/><br/>TL;DR; Movie was great, story was perfect for what it aimed at accomplishing, soundtrack is awesome, acting was perfect for these parts. <br/><br/>8/10"

","I know that there are a lot of people who hated this movie; I am not one of them. I loved it. It was exactly as I expected it would be: lots of fighting with special effects, some gore, beautiful people with sexy bodies, and some one funny one-liners. <br/><br/>Critics don't like it because it's not cerebral, but it wasn't meant to be. <br/><br/>I think you need to go in with an expectation of just having fun.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Jeremy Renner. I think his style of acting lends itself well to action movies. This was no different. See it in the theatre if you get a chance, it's cool on the big screen.

","I thought that it was a good movie--pretty funny and kind of quirky actually. If you can stand some grotesque violence, ugly witches, and relatively foul-mouthed Hansel and Gretel, then I think that it was worth the watch. Not going to win any academy awards, I don't think, but worth the watch.<br/><br/>There were some great twists (though not too unpredictable) that added to the plot, and I appreciated the wrestling that Hansel had to go through to accept his past and his heritage. Definitely a couple of cute actresses as well. In my opinion, this would have been better as a PG-13 movie with some of the over-the-top violence, the one brief and unnecessary nudity scene, and the slightly excessive though ironically clever f-bombs from Gretel removed."

","Every year there seems to be a theme in theaters where there are a couple of subjects with numerous filmmakers delivering varying films on the same idea. This year one of those themes seems to be re-imagining of fairy tales. The first one to hit the big screen is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The trailers looked a bit cheesy, but at the same time looked as though they may have some fun to deliver. With Hawkeye himself Jeremy Renner at the helm alongside Bond girl Gemma Arterton, X-Men alum Famke Janssen and the director of the awesome zombie film Dead Snow Tommy Wirkola could they deliver something that actually works or will it close the book on this story before it ever gets started? <br/><br/>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters follows the now grown Hansel and Gretel who spend their lives as bounty hunters, tracking and killing witches around the world. While their latest job seems like just another hunt, soon turns out to be much more with the Blood Moon approaching, they soon realize they are up against something more powerful than just your average witch. Let's be clear, this movie is way better than it has any right to be. The premise is a bit silly and could have easily fallen in line with a SyFy Channel movie, which did their own version as well. Thanks to the increased star power of Renner, the high quality fun action and director Tommy Wirkola this film turned out to be surprisingly fun. The first half has its fun moments, but limps along a bit before it really finds its footing, but once it does it is a pretty fun ride. The acting is average at best, with Renner being the most entertaining and Janssen eats up the screen playing a great creepy witch. The biggest issue comes with Arterton who handles the action well, but just plays the character way to stiff. What makes this film really work is the execution of the action sequences. They are pretty out there at times, but are shot and executed really well to deliver the fun you would expect. In addition director Wirkola made sure to bring the gore along with him which took the film away from the silly direction it could have gone and into the R rated territory.<br/><br/>Believe it or not this film works really well to deliver an R rated fantasy adventure the works. Filled with humor, action, creepy witches, great effects, gore, and Derek Mears as the scene stealing troll Edward this is one of those popcorn films that you are sure to enjoy if you just get in on the joke of it all. It seems to have done well enough and sets itself up nicely to a possible franchise and if they can keep the formula intact is one that is welcomed."

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is about how the two famous orphans become witch hunters after killing the witch that took them as hostages.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to this movie for two reasons: 1 was that it looked like what I wanted in an action comedy, and not just the normal boring Hollywood trash that we usually get with action movies. And 2 was that it was written and directed by the Norwegian guy who made Kill Buljo: The Movie and Dead Snow, Tommy Wirkola.<br/><br/>The movie starts off promising and much of what I wanted from it is actually present in the first 20 minutes or so. It's just over-the-top mindless comedy action with overly tough bounty hunters that just own everyone on screen. And then it becomes more of what Hollywood likes.<br/><br/>After the 20 first minutes, the characters apparently develop, and they try to make it a bit more serious. No thanks, I just want mindless comedy action for this one right.<br/><br/>You know, if I were to direct an action movie, I would've made it over-the-top to the point of insanity. Not make any sense at all, just being hilarious as ****. But in the end, we get a piece of what could've been.<br/><br/>It seems like Wirkola was trying to make an action movie that was like the one I described, which shows with the 20 first minutes, but then ran out of silly ideas and started relying on Hollywood clichés. Either that, or the producers demanded him to make it more of a standard movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fun, but nothing special. Maybe Kill Buljo 2 will be better."

It seems an evil powerful witch (Famke Jenssen) has them and is setting up some big ritual that will make her more powerful than any other witch.<br/><br/>The story is kind of vague but this was obviously heavily cut before it was released. There are plot loopholes galore and a creature named Edward appears out of nowhere and is never explained. And Hansel is (for no discernible reason) a diabetic! The horror, humor and drama never mesh together comfortably. Still this isn't a disaster. There's plenty of exciting fights and plenty of way over the top gore--but it's too silly to take seriously. There's also excellent special effects and a great score. Renner is just OK as Hansel but Arterton is excellent as Gretel. Jenssen is pretty bad--she's admitted she did it for the money--and it shows. It's not the disaster I heard it was but it's no great shakes either. I give it a 6."

One little hook is left till the later part of the movie: why did their father take them into the forest to leave them there? Obviously this is part of the plot. And there is a little hint: there are black witches and white witches. But, which witch is which? Apologies for this juvenile jest, but I've now got it off my chest.<br/><br/>All the various ingredients (and there are quite a few) you usually see in similar movies (conspiracy, romance and the rest of them) are here, but the movie makers have managed to effectively assembling them into a serviceable plot, as a platform for sequence after sequence of enjoyable action scenes. Yes, farcical at times but that makes them even more enjoyable. The other function of this plot is of course to showcase the latest intelligent-macho-man icon Jeremy Renner as well as two beautiful women. Gemma Arterton is alluring as ever, pouting lips and all, while Famke Janssen is one classy villain the likes of which I haven't since Charlize Theron in the re-imagined Snow White. And you have to give credit to these two femme fatale for allowing themselves to appear also in an unflattering guise: Janssen as how a black witch really looks like, and Artherton with bloods, cuts and bruises galore in some beaten-up scenes. There is one more beautiful woman, Finland's Phila Viitala in an important support role.<br/><br/>This movie is enjoyable no-brain entertainment, with an ambition to being a pilot of a franchise.

If only...<br/><br/>Despite a solid cast, the special effects were atrocious. (Hint: You're not supposed to tell they're acting in front of a green screen anymore, are you?) When watching an 80's movie, sure, there is some room for forgiveness; but in 2013, there is simply no excuse. And the giant troll-type thing named Edward, though lovable, looked like he just jumped out of The Labrynth or The Dark Crystal (note: another 80's reference). And I swear there was some strange sexual tension between the brother-sister team of Hansel & Gretel. Not sure if dialogue was to blame, or if Renner and his co-star actually had sexual tension, but either way, it was creepy.<br/><br/>On a positive note, Hubby enjoyed this flick a little more than I did.

","Before I say anything I must admit that it is not easy to impress someone who is a great fan of the fantasy-genre like me with a film like this. I didn't have serious expectations with this one though, I only wanted to have some fun-time after a day of working. I wouldn't have been bothered if the story was a little cheesy and the characters not so well-worked-out. It seems this movie deceeded even my low expectations. The extended story of the Grimm brothers' tale, Gretel and Hansel is an unimaginative, trying-to-be-funny piece of work which was not able to hold my attention for more than half an hour. Some pictures and locations shown in the movie were beautiful and the photography was quite enjoyable. The acting was decent and although I would've expected more from these well-known actors, I can imagine they performed these dull and clichéd characters as good as they could. I won't even tire myself with pointing out the endless number of plot holes in the movie as I neither wish to be spoilery nor I want to bore anybody to death. Going into details about the nowhere near authentic weaponry would also be pointless. I keep saying myself that it was meant to be funny but after a time I found the movie's enforced humour very irritating.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this to people who enjoy good fantasy because they will be bitterly disappointed. I don't recommend it to people who enjoy well-thought-out stories with complex characters because this one won't give that to you. Let's see if I have any recommendations. Well, I do. If you are brain-dead after a very hard day of work or exam-period, check this out! Either you'll be even more brain-dead or you'll just laugh your wits out."

Otherwise it is utter and boring crap, that illustrates that American Cinematography has the unique ability to rape and waste any legend or fairy tale it likes. Then it turns it into another generic display of American mediocrity (cultural references, ""sudden twists"", missing children on milk, corrupted cops, lovers dying in hands - - you know your average post 9/11 America BS). I really expect that the Hollywood produces Anal Porn Action Musical based on The Swan Lake Ballet one day.<br/><br/>The worst part is the fact that even when the movie is filled with Action, Girls With Boobs, Deadly Gagdets and Fully Automatic Guns, it is very predictable and boring. You have very good idea about the story after approximately about 10 minutes of watching. No originality here. Not a bit. Not a very tiny slightest grain of anything original and new.<br/><br/>The overall result is horrid. Welcome to world of The Hansel & Gretel Special FBI Investigation Group! These classic heroes play the role of The Good Forces Spetsznaz Group that wages the war with Witches Vietcong style. You know there is no Evil Force that cannot be eliminated by grenade or heavy machine gun. This is no ""dark version of fairy tale"". It is quite regular Gun Porn with better production values, only less fun. As such it is unsuitable both for children and people with any measurable level of intelligence.<br/><br/>As a excuse however I understand that if you are in you ripe teen years, you are on a party and have a lot of beer and weed you can actually enjoy this. But please beware that the shooting fun seems to be less enjoyable in real life than it is in the TV so don't line up the very next day to the enlistment to the Army. You may find that ""we will find you and we will kill you"" is less fun than expected when you end up in Afghanistan or other desert hole (that was the last scene where the the Good Spectsznaz Group was heading). <br/><br/>Oh hell yes.

The common, illogical path to locations named ""the witches layer"" to prevent events that coincide with ""the blood moon ritual"" seem like everything you've ever seen before with the least creative story to bring them to those plot points.<br/><br/>It's a movie that can be associated with the phrase ""left you wanting more"" , except in the literal sense, it's such drab and dry path, you're thankful there isn't ""more"" <br/><br/>I'm not a Renner fan, the mans beard looks like my fathers receding hair line (thankfully he's clean shaven for once) but on this one occasion, even he seemed in a different league than everyone else.

I'll give her some slack, because most of her speaking parts were written terribly and generic, but her acting still turned me off like a Plague rat. <br/><br/>If you ever wondered what a screenplay written over lunch would look like, this film would be it.

There are a lot of foolish scenes and plot holes like, how could human easily chase witch that using a broom and could run so fast, at early scene it showed how great Muriel (Famke Janssen)was but she suddenly got weak at the end with no reason, doesn't she with her power just disappear and kill Hansel easily? Every time Hansel or Gretel had been on crisis situation, they awkwardly had a back up to help them which is so coincidence. <br/><br/>The storyline itself is predictable and boring, the 88 minutes length felt so long and made me wanna finish it as quick as possible. Luckily I didn't see it at cinema when it came out last January. The visual effect is also standard and the make-up for the witch is ridiculous. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton didn't act bad actually, they were just choosing wrong movie this time.

","Following the trend on recreating the original fairy tales with lasts years Snow White remake with Snow White and the Huntsmen, Tommy Wirkola brings out the ugly in the Grimm tale's with Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters; a horrific take on Hansel and Gretel.<br/><br/>Directed by Tommy Wirkola, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters takes a dark, twisted turn on the the classic candy themed house tale. Unaware that she's a witch, Bond girl Gemma Arterton playing Gretel and Hawkeye star Jeremy Renner playing Hansel, grow up becoming famed merciless bounty hunters. After their iconic encounter with the candy housed witch, the dynamic duo are approached with a case involving multiple children being abducted. <br/><br/>The abductions are done by an evil shape shifting witch named Muriel, played by iconic X-men star, Famke Janssen. Intending on making a potion making witches impervious to fire, Muriel, inevitably, is the reason that led the siblings mom, a powerful good witch, and their father to their deaths. The siblings end up brutally killing Muriel by decapitating her with a shovel, and end by collecting their bounty and leaving to start a new journey.<br/><br/>Witches brew, magical showdowns, and even the dashing Renner, the old bread trail was revamped with blood that sparked interest in following Hansel and Gretel into the forest. Wirkola intentions of emphasizing the importance of the dark humor with intense whiplashes of gore and eye gouging cinematics was no doubt achieved. This movie had all the ingredients; a dash of folklore's, a pinch of creativity and a smoldering hot pair of actors to play the part. <br/><br/>The dynamic duo, Renner and Arterton, deliver the classic close, love- hate sibling relationship in the medieval themed setting. Unpredictable, action star Renner does a amazing job going head on into bloody conflicts, while still presenting a sensitive, stern personality. Complementing the brawny no-plan- guy, the brains of the pair, Arterton playing the tough, attractive sister, who's tries to understand first then kill next. Arterton keeps the audience entertained with her energy, which most of the cast lacked. Transforming from a ravishing beauty to a icky old hag, Famke does a great job on making everyone miserable, both Hansel and Gretel and her league of minions. <br/><br/>The music was amazing. Inception sensation Hans Zimmer worked alongside with Wirkola to create a perfect dark and fantasy like theme to compliment the story. Also the Germanic scenery was purely gorgeous, the waterfall, the little cottages and the twilight-like forest.<br/><br/>Though the cast did a amazing on their parts, the story lacked dialogue. To fill in the fast-paced sequence with vulgarity for humor, the story still lacked engaging dialogue such as devoiding the backstories of the witches. Also the story didn't really answer much of the pairs past, why were they good at killing? What's the story on Murial? Why were there shotguns in the pre-colonial era?<br/><br/>The dark humor of Wirkola was excessively emphasized a little too much as well. The tedious and unnecessary use of bloodshed seemed to downgrade the whole movie. It seemed like the story was poorly staged with the repetitive use of blood and violence, it felt like a cartoon. Showcase of burnings at a stake to beheading grew less and less suspensive since it came frequently. The non-stop blood and gore and barely spoken dialogue made Sharkboy and Lavagirl seem like a scary movie. <br/><br/>But overall the movie was great for fans of fantasy and gore. For horror fanatics, action junkies or people who just want to have a good time, this will entertain you."

Or faithful to the Grimm Brothers tale. Or historically or culturally accurate in any way whatsoever. Or logical and realistic. <br/><br/>Wirkola's movie is about monstrous female creatures, ninja fighting, maximum firepower, 3D effects, and showing gory deaths in as many bloody ways as possible. <br/><br/>The gore is not of the toe-curdling kind, but of the cartoonish movie variety. When a head gets squashed, the camera doesn't show the details or linger.<br/><br/>The closest similar movie that comes to mind is Rodriguez's ""From Dusk to Dawn"". The emotional maturity and intellectual depth of ""Hansel and Gretel"" are at about the same levels as ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" or ""Hercules: Legendary Journeys"", only this movie is a lot more violent and vulgar. <br/><br/>Strangely, religion is almost completely absent from this witch movie. I suppose that would only complicate things. <br/><br/>Our heroes have superhuman fighting skills, but this is not explained.<br/><br/>The witches in this movie are theoretically not human women, but they were portrayed as hideous, deformed female humanoids who sort of looked like women, and they were all butchered with abandon and glee. The witches are frightening and have superhuman powers, but it didn't stop them from getting killed by the dozens. <br/><br/>The political incorrectness of this movie was bothering me within the first five minutes. Has anyone else pointed this out already? Thank god they brought out the white witches. And the movie takes a stance against witch-hunts involving the phony witches or the good witches. You see, it's only the EVIL witches who should be burned alive, shot like dogs, or beheaded. This movie is meant to appeal to your lizard brain.<br/><br/>Still it was sort of fun.

One thing i must say, which is the reason i rated this movie a seven, is because viewers only just begin to learn about Gretel's background as a witch, and the movie ends.

","I've recently watched the Korean ""Hansel and Gretel"" movie which was an incredibly imaginative tale with a haunting atmosphere and stunning kid actors. <br/><br/>This Hollywood version rather heads for a public that recently enjoyed movies such as ""The Hunger Games"", ""Snow White And The Huntsman"" or the ""Twilight"" series. This film is addressed to a teenager or young adult public. Younger auditors might find this flick too tough, even though old German fairy tales often head for younger auditors and are generally brutal for education purposes. Older auditors might find the film a little bit lifeless and vapid after all. <br/><br/>It features some mild action scenes, several small gore effects, a few witchcraft elements, the usual love story and the predictable good versus evil story. This is nothing new but the movie is quite entertaining without having any lengths and for one of the rare times, the three dimensional technique is well employed in a movie and worth the money you have to spend on it.<br/><br/>The acting by the main characters is not that spectacular. Gemma Arterton remains surprisingly faceless while Jeremy Renner who was last involved in ""The Bourne Legacy"" seems quite out of place and especially a little bit too old for this kind of movie by now. A great job is though delivered by the absolutely charming Famke Janssen who delivers a reserved but efficient acting and who looks very stylish in this film.<br/><br/>In the end, the good special effects, a few well chosen secondary actors and the fast paced story that never gets boring save this movie and make it watchable for a young but not too young auditory.

"Alise_shenle","8","1","4","1 March 2013"," Really interesting
","I like how recent fairytale adaptations are more darker and violent then we expected, going back to the middle ages. However, there were 2 flaws. 1 is that nothing is really explained to us leaving us to wonder about the whole mythology of witches in their world. Etc if your blood is supposed to be a witch, then you can choose not to be one? Or is it the other way round? 2 is how the movie is too realistic which doesn't feel like fantasy but more like an action movie with a superpowered villain. Other than that, there were great points. 1. Gemma was the perfect Gretel. She was vicious and smart from the beginning, seeing as how she yelled at the witch in the gingerbread house since she was young. She is also kind, seeing as how she cared more about the children's lives than her own, asking Hansel to save them instead. She also cared for Edward despite his ugly appearance. Finally, she was not afraid to get a little dirty during fights. 2. Hansel is more like the shy, quiet brother. He gets distracted easily by women, but at least he fights well with Gemma. 3. I don't see the point of white witches since they can't even protect themselves or others. 4. The witches are ugly, making it easy for you to hate them. Muriel was really powerful and cunning, a worthy opponent. But I am still confused as to what is a grand witch and how to become one? Finally, just watch this movie. It's really exciting, and it trolls Twilight, as in there is literally a troll called Edward and Hansel is like who the **** is Edward?"

In summary this is one of the best action films so far this year (not the highest accolade ever as most of them have been absolute rubbish). A good no brainer. see through plot twists and plot thinner than my 18 month old under wear. <br/><br/>This film reminded me of the classic from dusk till dawn. a few one liners to lighten the mood and lots of needless violence. <br/><br/>If you have some extra pocket change then see this movie. If you only watch really good movies I wouldn't bother its good but not that good. Also there is no reason why this film is in 3D.

","Mindset before movie: I was invited to see this movie last-minute, during my long commute home from work. I was tired and a little flustered by the rush to get to the theatre on time. Being vaguely familiar with the fairy tale and uncertain about my opinions of either lead cast member, the preview looked cool. Honestly, I was expecting a Resdident Evil/ Underworld kind of movie.<br/><br/>Mindset after movie: Pretty much what I expected. Over-the-top, stylish gory action with computer animation sprinkled all over it. Acting was good enough to keep you focused on the plot and it's holes(instead of the terrible acting). The movie was rated 18A(due to the gore, I think), it felt directed towards more of a PG-13 audience. It was full of that cheese that brings out that inner child from the era of Arny and Van Damme and just like when I was a child, I even found myself saying ""Woah! That was cool!"" a couple times out loud. It also had some dark horror undertones with cameos from some familiar monsters and creatures from horror's past. Although the movie had the style of a few fairy tale movies that were recently released, the idea behind the film was a good one; instead of just another Hollywood style fairy tale it's an original Hollywood style sequel to a fairy tale.<br/><br/>If you're like me and have an unexplainable addiction for those ridiculous action movies with style and gore where the director's priorities placed making it look cool over good plot line and the physics, this movie delivers. Just remember, it's a movie. If you want something real, don't look at Hollywood."

They supposed to these bad ass witch hunters who had been in the business for years. And yet they don´t know that witches camouflage, that there are white ones, that they change form o can be pretty. They get their asses beaten for most of the movie and create more damage than good.
They also have zero development or at least a personality. The supporting cast is even more deplorable, no characters just tokens for bad guys, sidekicks, witches and that's it.<br/><br/>The visuals are abysmal! with awful makeup and costume design, obvious green screen and CGI, not to mention the overuse of gore for no reason. <br/><br/>The acting also doesn't help, Gemma Arterton is just bad actress, interestingly I haven't seen her in a ""mayor"" hollywood movie scene. Jansen is on her worst and Renner is here to get a paycheck.<br/><br/>There is also a weird scene where they edit the bad guys beating up the heroine and treating to rape her meanwhile Renner has a awkward sex scene with the sexy witch, she shows her ass (but they don't show his btw) and they make out again for no reason.<br/><br/>Do i forgot to mention the weird ""romance"" between the heroine and the orgeish creature?<br/><br/>But all of that could be forgettable if this was stupid fun but no, it's boring and frustrating bad."

"callanvass","4","1","5","22 August 2013"," Unimaginative, CGI filled nonsense that somehow made a fair amount at the box office!
","As soon as I saw the trailer that aired for this one, I knew what I was getting into when I was going to see it. I avoided it in theaters; it turns out it was exactly what I feared; a passive, money gobbling film that has copious amounts of CGI, which is something teenagers will probably go for. The scary thing is the able cast it has. I'm not saying this is one of the worst movies of all time, but it's mediocre beyond belief, and certainly not as good as the cast may make you to believe. Believe it or not, I kinda dug the premise. The opening was very cool, and I thought I might be in for a pleasantly entertaining film; wrong! It does have a couple of decent action scenes, but with all the lame CGI, and the wire work, it ruined it for me. Jeremy Renner is solid as a rock; it's not his fault he has to work with nothing. His chemistry was decent with Gemma Arterton. Renner is already a big star in Hollywood. He has taken over the Bourne franchise, potentially soon The Mission Impossible franchise; he's been in The Avengers. The Oscar winning Hurt Locker; he's accomplished a lot. But this is one of those films actors end up regretting. Gemma Arterton is a solid newcomer. She's got a bright future ahead of her. She looked great and did what she had to do well. Famke Janssen is a favorite of mine, and not many can play a female villain with intensity like her. She manages to overcome a poorly written villain character that lacks depth with a solid show. The others do fine as well. The acting is not an issue here. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: In today's era; this is something teenagers will go for. This wasn't for me. I thought it was a half-assed attempt personally with little creativity and some mediocre action scenes to pad it all. Not really recommended <br/><br/>4/10"

","This film was stunning. The main thing about this film was the 3D effect of it. Everything comes out to get you unlike half the modern films out now which just display the background as 3D. Don't get me wrong, that's good, but most people pay for 3D to have blades or explosions coming out at you, and this film delivers that. Added to that, is the action to this film. And to be perfectly honest, the trailer doesn't do this film justice. The trailer doesn't show the humor within this film or the attention to detail on blood and gore (however in terms of movies that focus on this, the film is mild on gore etc). The action is thankfully none stop as the story line is not the reason this film gets 10 out of 10 from me. This is one of those films that you want to watch the hell out of.

The good thing about this film are: the design of the clothes and weapons, the violence and the gory, and, and ...

The plot is horrible, it has nothing original or captivating, It looks like a copy of Van Helsing, only worse. The villain in the film has no story, just a cliche motivation just like every villain. It is not possible to differentiate between hansel and gretel if they change bodies, because they are insipid.
This film has no emotion because the characters have no personality, they boil down to this: Bruh I kill witches, Bruh ma sista kill Witche, we kill witches, you still don't understand? WE KILL WITCHES! i, kil, wites, bruh AAAAAAHHH! i just kill witches (crying noises)"
"TheAlmightyFinger","4","0","1","29 March 2019"," Witch Hunters? Uhhhh...
","A fairy tale should get more leeway, sometimes more than it deserves, but there is just so much wrong with this film. And it has nothing to do with genre-mixing or the anachronistic dialogue/weaponry.<br/><br/>Let us recap:<br/><br/>1. Gemma Arterton has two expressions throughout the whole film: neutral (pouting) and smiling (most of the time when she really shouldn't be).<br/><br/>2. The accents are all over the place; for some reason Gemma (a British actress) has an American accent, some townspeople have a slightly Germanic accent, and some have British accents. They are all from the same region! Lazy directing.<br/><br/>3. The witch hunters have an array of advanced weapons and no other notable skills, except maybe some immunity against spells, which is never properly explained. Even their fighting skills are pretty average, which means they get beat up quite a lot, but never take any serious damage to their egos or bodies.<br/><br/>4. They incessantly crack jokes and deliver one-liners when in battle - even when getting their collective a**es kicked. There goes the suspense, or fear for the safety of our heroes.<br/><br/>5. The whole plot of the film revolves around witches trying to get immunity from fire (to become immortal!), but most of them get killed by gunshots or falling objects. So what is the point?<br/><br/>6. Oh, and if you are the most powerful witch in the movie, please try and slug it out with fisticuffs and/or throttle the heroes in the final showdown. Don't use a shred of your magic. And EVERY time you have a real opportunity to kill them, slow down your approach and start smirking, talking and threatening. Just long enough for someone else, to thwart your evil plans.<br/><br/>7. If you are a hero, ALWAYS warn the witch before you attack, by saying the equivalent of ""Hands Up"". Yes, that makes a lot of sense. You burn all witches regardless, but you insist in giving them a chance to surrender?<br/><br/>8. Finally, as a hero, make sure to posture first, before attacking. That makes you look so cool!<br/><br/>There are many, many more flaws to point out. But I am bored by this sloppy movie with its pretty cgi. It was not fun at all. With all the resources at their disposal, the scriptwriter and director turned out to be quite useless.<br/><br/>I will leave you with a final question:
Can Peter Stormare play any character BESIDES Peter Stormare?"

The movie looked like it was shot on the same set of ""Red Riding Hood."" It had medieval gadgetry including a fully automatic spear tip thrower. I felt like this was a Riding Hood companion film, just not as good in spite of Gemma's cleavage.<br/><br/>As famous witch hunters, H&G have their own groupies.They are hired by the mayor because of a rash of child disappearances, which we quickly find out is for a special ceremony. The dialouge was so-so. I couldn't help think of a line from LOTR when Hansel says, ""Evil is upon you if you like it or not.""

Let me just say they picked two people who are believably bad ass, Jeremy renner aka Hawk eye is so awesome, hes got a machine gun wielding girlfriend, an awesome jacket, an awesome gun and hes very funny too. Gemma arteron is one of the most gorgeous actors I've ever seen, and in this movie she is equally bad ass as renner, maybe even a little more, and its not like i care too much, but I'm very happy they didn't make her a Mary sue, where shes some unstoppable death machine, they do show her being hurt, and beaten up a lot,reasonably, but that doesn't stop her from kicking butt through out the entire movie! honestly, the movie is a satire, and cheesy sometimes, for instance both Hansel and Gretel should be in body castes at least by the end. But the atmosphere created with the sets and filmography is beautiful, it leaves me in awe, the practical effects are awesome, the witches look so horrifyingly good and original, their practical makeup must have took hours, special effects are very realistic, the action scenes are breathtaking,the side characters are likable, and the plot is very interesting. However, i could have lived without most of the cuss words, and maybe less gore, i mean its not Tarantino levels, but still.

","With a friend having recently named her new cat Hansel,I decided to search around for a Hansel and Gretel-related movie that she could watch during the Christmas period.Taking a look at IMDb's Horror board,I noticed a post which mentioned a film that had taken a Horror-Fantasy approach to the tale,which led to me getting ready to go hunting for witches. <br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Finding themselves getting left alone in the woods by their dad,Hansel and his sister Gretel spot a house made of gingerbread.Entering the house,Hansel & Gretel are gripped by a witch who holds them hostage.Desperate to escape,they both fight back and kill the witch,via shoving her in the oven (what charmers!)<br/><br/>Years later:<br/><br/>Since having cooked some roast witch,Hansel & Gretel have become witch hunters,with their aim in life being to visit every town,and kill every witch in the area.Entering a small town called Augsburg,Hansel and Gretel discover that the villagers are starting to accusing almost everyone of being a witch. Initially expecting their time in Augsburg to involve a traditional killing,Hansel & Gretel soon discover that the witches have other plans for them.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Showing a real bravery in not taking the easy family friendly route,writer/director Tommy Wirkola and cinematographer Michael Bonvillain cast a splatter-soaked Horror spell across the film,with Hansel & Gretel's rapid-fire action scenes being matched by headless witches and deadly wounds getting splashed on the movie.Along with the exciting action and gleeful horror shocks,Wirkola uses rusting,fading colours to give the title a surprising Steam Punk Fairy Tale atmosphere.<br/><br/>Jumping from the original Brothers Grimm tale within the first 10 minutes,Wirkola gives the characters wonderful added additions,with Hansel's diabetic problems (which the studio sadly got Wirkola to trim down) giving the character a real weakness,and also showing the effects of Hansel's visit to the Brothers Grimm sweet house! Whilst not giving her the delightful off-beat weaknesses of her brother,Wirkola combines Gretel's sharp action chops with an enchanting fairy tale side,which reveals itself as Gretel closes in on their latest target.<br/><br/>Entering the movie in super-tight leather,the ravishing Gemma Arterton (who for some reason puts on (an admittedly good) fake US accent-despite the film being set in Europe!) gives an excellent performance as Gretel,thanks to Arterton looking extremely sexy in the thrilling fight scenes,and also casting a wide smile across Gretel's face,as she beheads one witch after the other.Joining Arterton,Jeremy Reener gives a very good,brisk performance as Hansel,whose action bite Renner connects with a warm,quirky side,as Hansel & Gretel get ready to break every witches spell..and neck."

","Didn't you always wonder what became of Hansel & Gretel after the witch killing covered by the fairy tale? No? OK, but wouldn't it be cool to take that fairy tale and marry it with a Stallone/schwarzenegger 80's action movie? No? OK, just shut off your frontal cortex and stare at the clearly demarcated good / bad guys and the inventive period sets and watch the action. With a name like ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" you get what you pay for, a short, self-conscious, action movie which doesn't worry about placing girls with machine guns in a medieval story without electric lights. Penicillin hasn't been discovered but insulin has luckily in time to save the likable and watchable Jeremy Renner. Only somewhat hiding his disdainful amusement for the proceedings Renner's Hansel drinks and carouses his way along with the innocuous Gemma Arteon who looks good against pretty nice sets for a moderately budgeted film. That budget paid for digital efforts better rendered than some films with 3 times the budget and the fights (and basically this is just a string of hunter vs witch battle royales) are clearly choreographed and follow-able.

"alindsay-al","4","0","1","31 October 2014"," A good idea but the execution is just below average
","Now I really do believe that this film's premise is a really good one and there are some positives but I think overall this is a failure of a project. This sees the fairy tale characters of Hansel and Gretel years after the story as witch hunting bounty hunters attempting to stop an evil plot by the witches. Now Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton play Hansel and Gretel and they both do an okay job, now I like both of them in the stuff they have been in but they are not helped in this film by the script. For all the action and fight scenes they were awesome and really did a good job of being bounty hunters, however, the actual acting is pretty poor but they try their best and it helps a little bit. Now Famke Janssen plays the villain witch and I think she did a good job in her role by being as evil as truly possible and looking like she was enjoying the role. But the rest of the supporting cast is poor and underdeveloped, whether it is Renner's love interest, or the troll who helps Arterton or their town associate they are all lacklustre and a big negative in the film. This is also associated with the story because there are a few story arcs but they give no effort into any of them which is annoying cause there was some potential in some of them. The script is also not impressive with the dialogue not being that creative at all and attempting to sabotage the film quite a bit. The style of the film is great with the surprising amount of violence being a good decision to separate this film from others like it. Overall this film is below average and I wish there was a bit more substance to it as the premise was really cool."
"avzwam","5","0","1","21 October 2014"," Wasted opportunity
","This movie could have been a fun, crazy, humorous, lighthearted, silly movie and during moments it is that. It's for instance got a reference to The matrix and when you see witches riding their brooms through the forest it reminds me an awful lot of the famous scene in Return of the Jedi where the storm troopers are racing through the forest in a similar way. It's got exciting chase scenes of which one has a really cool moment where Hansel runs over a tree trunk in a really cool stunt. It's all silly and fun and it stays away from being too serious.<br/><br/>But it also has a scene where a witch forces a boy to shoot his mother in the stomach with a shotgun in front of his little sister; it's not fun. And that's what I feel the problem is with this movie; when it's dark, it's too dark and when it's serious, it's too serious. In other scenes the violence gets too grisly and nasty where characters are punched with brass knuckles and they get shot in the face... It's like it tries to be two different types of movies at once.<br/><br/>The production design is no less than great. It's shot well and the cast performs just fine. Its director though should have made better decisions in terms of what direction he wanted to take it all. He should have had a clearer vision as now the film is incongruous resulting in a movie which is strange in a bad way.<br/><br/>Which is too bad as I would have enjoyed the properly worked out lighthearted version of this very much indeed. I might even go so far as to say that that might have had the potential to be a classic."

","Hanzel and Gretal: Witch Hunters was alright. It's not a staggering work of genius, but it's not the worst movie I've seen. It's about the brother and sister whose father abandons them in a forest and they end up going to a house made out of candy where a witch tries to eat them, but they get the best of witch, you know the story... OR DO YOU? Eventually they grow up and become professional witch hunters and who get hired by villages to hunt down witches with maximum prejudice. This sounds kinda awesome, but it's not, mainly because it's predictable. The main lessons I got from this movie: Pretty people aren't evil, in one of the opening scene Hanzel and Gretal arrive at a village to find that the villagers are going to burn a supposed witch. Hanzel proceeds to declare that witches have physical deformities (not the exact words) and that this one is totally fine, so he and Gretal make the sheriff of the village let her go. Torture is okay, well maybe, at one point they have a witch in custody and in order to get info out of her they proceed to punch her in the face. Violence is okay, but not affection, of course Hanzel ends up sleeping with the first witch, but even though they don't show any uh... tenderness there's no problem with showing people's heads getting crushed like grapes, which to be be fair was kinda cool. I didn't like the super fake blood, but I bet that's part of the 3Dness. There's a lot of elements that are obviously meant to be seen in 3D, which is lame because it makes the movie look cheesier than it actually is, plus it also reinforces that 3D is still just a gimmick. Good troll though. One of the things I liked the best about this movie is the details to stuff, there's cool weapons and the witches look bad ass and there's lots of variety in them. Also, witch Kung Fu. Witch Fu. I would watch that. Hanzel and Gretal: Witch Hunters is good fodder for watching with someone who appreciate cheesy movies, rest assured that this review would've been much worse if I had actually paid to see this movie."

After the second abandonment the kids were not able to get back home, found the gingerbread and candy house of the blind witch, were captured and fattened so that she could eat them. But she was out-foxed and they were able to throw the witch into the fire and burn her.<br/><br/>This movie begins with that same theme, and we see the witch burned. But most of the movie takes place when the kids had grown up and achieved a reputation as witch hunters. In fact they had destroyed hundreds of them. Jeremy Renner is the adult Hansel and Gemma Arterton is his adult sister Gretel.<br/><br/>But the region is now threatened by a more powerful witch, Famke Janssen as Muriel. With the upcoming blood moon which will attract many witches Hansel and Gretel have their work cut out for them. Fortunately they find Pihla Viitala as the good witch Mina.

","The whole movie was a passable story. Bounty Hunters of the Grim fairy tale Variety. Bounty Hunters come in all shape and sizes. I think Famke Janssen stole the show as the evil witch wow. I was a bit disappointed that Hansel's love interest got rid of at the end, and even more disappointed the lack of remorse Hansel had at this. The only other problem was the guns that they had. where did they find the machinery to make these things. Like the latest Three Musketeers film, the film was thrown into the 21st Century with fighting and modern war fare. If they do a sequel to this movie, I hope the story line is better. The director Wirkola had the new age of action, fast editing, close up action and camera movement to make you dizzy...ho-hum, anything new that our up and coming action directors can do."

","This film is not classified in the ""comedy"" genre, but you can consider it a dark comedy. We learn this early on, when we see glass milk bottles with ads for missing children strapped to them. But this is not a film designed for children.<br/><br/>Once you decide not to take this film too seriously, you can accept the anachronisms (like shotguns) and just enjoy Hansel and Gretel for what it is--a special effects romp that has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. Look for the references to Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, Assassins Creed, and the entire genre that Underworld's Kate Beckinsale has established.<br/><br/>There is not much depth in the story. And no surprises, really. But here is a list of things I liked about this film: <br/><br/>*It's production values. Quality all around.<br/><br/>*The fact that it was not difficult to follow the action, even during the dimly lit scenes.<br/><br/>*The music, which was moody and sometimes drove the action.<br/><br/>If you take this film seriously, then you will not be able to get past the fact that the witches have such tremendous powers that their enemies would have no chance against them.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable aspect of the film is the troll--a masterpiece of design and invention, an enjoyable character.<br/><br/>Sequels are on the way."

","The problem i have with reviewing films that are 'OK' is that there isn't enough to write about to fulfill the 10 line obligation you have to write in order to get your opinions across. So with that in mind it brings me to this offering.Initially i was expecting dross and on that level it sometimes delivers, but overall its quite an entertaining couple of hours viewing. I do have a few gnawing issues with it. Firstly the modern American accents, highlighted, if memory serves me well, with a ""take that bitch"" and a ""wow awesome"" pretty shitty for where the film is supposed to be set. Artertons transatlantic accent was a bit adrift, and finally the troll has to be about the worst piece of CGI/Plastic/Foam/Puppetry to have graced the screen for decades. Large man in a crap outfit immediately springs to mind, though admittedly he had the best scene in the film for me. Finally this penchant for Steampunk style weaponry is way overused, how about more conventional gear, better fight scene/choreography and better/ more authentic accents,i'm sure Renner can offer something up with a Germanic air, ""take zat du biatch"" or ""wow das ist fantastiche"""
"Millyjay94","8","0","1","20 December 2013"," Underestimated and entertaining
","I watched this movie recently and didn't understand the overall negative response to it. Not only is it pure entertainment, there are a few intelligent parts that are never mentioned. Due to the childhood incident with the witch at the beginning of the movie, hansel (played with dryness by Jeremy renner) now has diabetes which is a smart and reasonable aspect that may have resulted by this occurrence. Secondly, there's a delightful and rare use of steampunk (that is basically featuring futuristic aspects in an older more traditional setting). As a lot of people have complained and apparently found plot holes with the new ageism of the guns in this movie as according to the 18th-19th century timeline, they have failed to do their research as this aspect is actually a theme in books and cinema and was used in van helsing and other movies. Gemma arteron and Jeremy renner have a nice chemistry and the supporting cast are solid and do their jobs. I found the film to be utterly entertaining and is a dark but refreshing take to the light and kid friendly fairy tales that people who are giving this film a bad wrap obviously think they're seeing. To conclude, this movie was a smart and creative idea showing a grown up fairytale and features a female just as strong and badass as her male sibling (this fact also seems to be overlooked). As long as you aren't expecting an award winning movie you'll enjoy this turn on a child's fairytale. Don't judge this movie before you see it or understand it, it's a firm 8 for me."

In this movie, all the witches look like something out of Evil Dead rather than an old witch with a big nose and hat. They burn the witch and that starts their legend. Jump ahead and Hansel and Gretel have come back to their hometown to solve the disappearance of 12 children. They learn of a plot by the witches to perform a spell of the blood moon that would make them immune to fire. So the rest of the film is battles with witches, the evil sheriff whom doesn't want anyone else to be the hero, and finding out about white witches.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining action film with good special effects.

","Interesting variation on the old fairy tale. Offspring of a grand good witch and a human Hansel and Gretel are grown ups now and hunt witches for money. They end up returning to their home town. It is under attack by witches stealing the 12 children that are needed for a grand blood moon rite that would make witches immune to fire. The witches also need the heart of a grand white witch which just happens to reside in Gretel. The weapons they dreamed up for this movie were very interesting, from repeating crossbows, rifles (I guess), to a machine gun at the end. Hansel hooks up with a white witch and she is very instrumental in eventually wiping out all the witches that have come from all over the world to be in the rite. Alas she dies. The troll, Edward, is saved by Gretel and helps free the children, kill some witches, and generally help out. He then joins the witch slaying gang after all the attending witches have been eliminated as they continue to hunt the surviving witches. Some humor, a lot of gore, a nice pool scene, all in all watchable."

","Siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) & Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are sent out into the woods. They get taken by a witch, but are able to kill her. They'd grow up to be famous witch hunters.

It's a blood splattering good time if you're so inclined. Renner and Arterton are mostly playing it for serious. This is possibly the major missing piece. It needs comedy to put it over the top.

","Not bad, definitely watchable and entertaining. Only complaint would be that it suffers from what I call Mars Attacks syndrome. Namely that they seem to have a vast range of over the top and ridiculous weapons and technology. A lot of which are only used once.<br/><br/>When the character gets into a sticky situation and then suddenly deploys a hidden doom cannon out of nowhere it removes any sense of suspense or mystery. The viewer doesn't think 'how will they get out of this' and is just left to watch as the over the top gun destroys everything on screen.<br/><br/>It all just seems rather unnecessary and only serves to harm the film. A lot more drama can be had when a character utilises a weapon in an interesting and unique way... not when the weapon suddenly grows fangs and starts ripping people's throats out. If it could do that all along... why would you ever use anything else?"

"engelst","6","0","2","18 August 2013"," Fun to watch, but a huge waste of potential
","Hansel And Gretel has great potential but suffers from bland and clumsy direction. If the director had been top quality, this could have been a surprise hit and one of the top action movies of the year. Hansel and Gretel is full of fresh ideas and irreverently injects the old tale we all know with blood, comedy and sex. Now we're left with a half-baked fusion of genres that doesn't quite cut it.<br/><br/>Sometimes the timing is so bad that the movie almost stops in its tracks. Due to poor shot selection many of the good action scenes are less cool and thrilling.<br/><br/>E.g., the cool weapons do not get the screen time and exposure they deserve. Scenes introducing some of the weapons seem to have been cut. So, surprisingly, you may not see enough of the weapon to totally appreciate what it can do. This may seem trivial, but I'd say the weapons account for about one third of the charm of the movie.<br/><br/>The same goes for the characters, which are often thrown into a scene that doesn't properly connect to the previous one.<br/><br/>The main roles are well cast, which makes up for some of the aforementioned waste of potential. I found Gemma Arterton to be fresh, sexy and fun to watch. Renner is not as good (for which we may also blame the director), but he handles the combination of language, comedy and action well. The entire cast is A movie material and is doing a more than decent job.<br/><br/>If you don't mind a new take on fantasy and fairy tale, you'll have fun."

It has its rare funny moments, and the action and gore, while it is not fantastic, are enough to keep you tuned in (but only because of the movements, which your eyes are forced to follow), and Gemma Arterton as snarky bitch Gretel is fun to watch.

","Really wicked witches have been woefully under-represented in cinema over the years, with only a handful of films genuinely doing the scary old hags justice; Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters sees Norwegian writer/director Tommy Wirkola doing his utmost to raise their profile as movie monsters, offering up more malevolent, wizened, child-eating crones than you can shake a broomstick at.<br/><br/>With his focus clearly on the creation of these nasty witches, and their subsequent destruction by Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), Wirkola offers only the slightest of plots off which to hang the gory deaths, comic-book fighting, CGI effects, and numerous sneaky shots of Arterton's heaving bosom. Fortunately, for the majority of the time, Wirkola's handling of the action is slick enough to compensate for the lack of story, the weak writing only becoming really noticeable whenever there is a rare lull in pace.<br/><br/>It's lead female star's tightly-corseted cleavage aside, the film's most enjoyable aspect is when it occasionally shifts up a gear to OTT, bats**t crazy violence mode, the most entertaining scenes being Hansel's bonkers battle with Siamese-twin witches and troll Edward's gory head-stomping rampage, both of which have energy and imagination to spare.

","HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an hilariously creative film that completely restored my faith in the whole subgenre of horror-comedy-- it's more of the latter, of course. While obviously nothing to be taken too seriously, this film does have a solid, cohesive plot-line with some nice surprises. The Sabbat scene is particularly worthy of mention. Expert filming and settings, makeup, eclectic soundtrack, and intentionally stupid but nonetheless lively script. Great props too--love the automatic crossbows and blunderbusses. While it could have gone a little farther in such areas, it makes some interesting revelations concerning Hansel and Gretel's familiar past, adding some interesting elaborations to the Grimm Bros' original tale as well as the entire mythos regarding ""medieval"" witches. While this film is mostly its own original self, the borrowings and bits of spoof on WIZARD of OZ, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, KING KONG, RED DAWN, and a score of others really add something to the mix."

","I do not normally like gore or too much violence in movies, nor do I tend to ever watch horror films but I took a chance with this one and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I watched it in 3D which I highly recommend. If I had seen it only in 2D I would have probably not ever wanted to watch it again as I don't like gory movies. That said, in 3D it is simply amazing because of the level of detail and beautiful direction. In fact it left me wishing for a sequel, it was that good.<br/><br/>I mostly like watching comedies, sci-fi and fantasy and avoid horror films completely as a general rule. The interesting thing is that the remote location where I'm at limits the availability of 3D movies, so when I saw it I bought it only out of curiosity, not because the idea of a Hansel and Gretel film seemed interesting. I honestly thought it would be something I'd only watch once and discard but it's now one of my favorite 3D films ever because of the amazing detail and direction. Beautiful forest scenes abound throughout the film and once the character of Edward appeared I was absolutely hooked.<br/><br/>Edward the troll was like the bad guy that was really a good guy who you really wanted to root for. I wish there was more of him in the film actually and that's one of the main reasons after watching it I right away thought this thing absolutely deserves a sequel.<br/><br/>The film trends away from the traditional idea of a witch riding a broom stick and uses tree branches instead, which I thought was a novel idea and quite cleverly done. The same goes for avoiding the green faced witch and using crackly zombie like faces instead but also shifting around from beautiful-woman-type-witch to more traditional ugly-type-witch. It's simply amazing all around to watch in 3D. If anyone saw the same thing in 2D I'm sure the beauty of the incredible camera work would be lost.<br/><br/>After a first viewing I had to go back and re-watch the scene in the forest where Gretel is overcome by the sheriff and his men and Edward steps in. That's the point in the movie where I was absolutely hooked by the story. Before that it simply meandered around the notion of killing witches but once Edward ""the good"" turns up it's a whole different story. That is one lovable troll right there despite what he does to the sheriff and his vigilantes.<br/><br/>All in all, for someone who doesn't normally watch gory movies, I highly recommend this one and if you watch it then 3D is by far the way this movie seems meant to be seen. In 2D you lose the beauty of the forest and the depth of the action."

","This is a movie which you watch for the action and the special effects and pretty much nothing else. As such it is a excellent movie. The original story of Hansel & Gretel is essentially only used to boot this movie. The movie itself plays out when Hansel & Gretel are adult witch hunters.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much action all the way. It is fairly violent and goory action at that. It is not a movie for the kids. To me this is an advantage. I do not think I would have liked it as much if they had dumbed it down to a standard PG-rated Hollywood creation. I really enjoyed the hard-ass Hansel & Gretel duo kicking witch ass in so many way.<br/><br/>The special effects are not bad and the medieval yet kind of modern weaponry that Hansel & Gretel swings around are quite cool looking. Not very believable perhaps but then neither are witches so The witches themselves are also fairly cool. Especially the witch-gathering near the end of the movie is indeed a grim (ha ha) collection of freaky creatures.<br/><br/>I was not too thrilled about the idiot law keeper. His utter stupidity bugged me throughout the entire movie. I really wished they would have dragged out the end for him a bit more. Well he did meet a suitable end at least.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you though this was to be ""just"" a Hansel & Gretel movie the you are probably going to be disappointed. I knew more or less what I went for so I was just enjoying myself. I was surprised at the level of gore, exploding heads, troll-squished humans etc but, as I said above, I think it was a good thing that they did let it be done in the way the producer/director obviously intended for it to be made."

Time's Corliss, for example, notes that Edward the Troll saves Gretel because he is impelled to pity humans. Uh..no. Listen to his line, for God's sake. That arch-hack Rex Reed refers several times to multiple gang rapes. As someone who won't go near a film with a rape in it, I can safely assert that he is very off-base. Nothing new there. I will concede one point: wittier dialogue would have been very welcome. Nonetheless. This is precisely as fun in a moderate way as you have the right to expect it to be.

Their is plenty of action, and the story is well-rounded (what is told, and left for mystery throughout the movie, is later revealed towards the end). I'd say there is no loose-ends here, and it is a good thriller/twist on the tale of Hansel and Gretel. However, like most movies or stories, they are not without their imperfections.<br/><br/>The tech used to combat the witches, makes a good twist for the time period this story is told in, I'd say, somewhere in beginnings of the gunpowder age. The automatic cross bow, and the rifle are a perfect fit for a movie such as this, however, I think its safe to say that the .270 caliber rounds that were depicted to be used with Hansel's guns, did not quite fit in very well, and I think something akin to the bullet used in the end to bring the evil witch down should have been more of a proper design for a movie of this caliber.

This period of time there were no electricity.<br/><br/>In their childhood to be abducted and held captive by a witch being forced to consume candy has made Hansel a diabetic with hourly insulin injections pen through clothes. I believe the character Gretel also developed an eating disorder for eating too much candy in her adult years. I was hoping to see incantations recited or grimoires by witches, nevertheless the special effects for flying on brooms and using the forest in her favor were still good. A two person crew has a solid close relationship."

","I enjoyed the movie except for the profanity and overuse of graphic violence. What I look for in a movie is entertainment. I don't complain unless something jumps out at me. I didn't particularly like Gemma Arterton in this role,not sure if it was her acting or the direction she received. All in all for viewers 16 and older. But please do we really need the ""F"" word thrown around so much? Sometimes it seems as if its forced. Does it help the line in any way? I think most lines can stand on their own or by using another non toxic word. Why offend some when not using it offends no-one. The violence seems common place anymore yet the mere suggested act can do just as much."

","You might like this movie if you enjoyed: Snow White: A Tale of Terror (1997), Red Riding Hood (2011), Jack the Giant Slayer (2013)<br/><br/>The story: Hansel and Gretel find themselves left alone in the woods by their father. They discover a gingerbread house, not knowing that an evil witch lives in it who eats children. The witch catches them and locks them in a cage, but luckily, Gretel can outsmart her, and pushes her in her own oven. Many year later the two have become bounty hunters and known as the famous witch hunters Hansel and Gretel. Their latest mission: 11 children have been missing from a village and the mayor wants the siblings to track them down. The two are sure that witches are involved.<br/><br/>Review: Like many fantasy movies in 2013 Hansel and Gretel was not as successful as expected. I remember that it was supposed to be released some time in 2012, but it was postponed. My guess is they didn't want to compete with Snow White and The Huntsman and Mirror Mirror. But they should have, because neither of these two movies was as fast- paced, or held as much action as this one. The movie doesn't have much of a story or great dialogues but that's not important, because it has everything else: Great graphics, over-the top gore – which works in this case-, a sexy cast, creepy villains, and lots and lots of action. It is definitely a trip you don't want to miss, if you need a movie that won't make you fall asleep. <br/><br/>Rating: 6.5/10<br/><br/>For more reviews please check out my blog and like my facebook page! http://www.simonsayswatchthis.wordpress.com http://www.facebook.com/simonsayswatchthis"

","I was expecting a bad maybe terrible movie but this wasn't half bad. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters takes place years after the siblings burned the witch that tried to eat them. They go around the world hunting and killing witches to work out their stress when they come across a town who's children have been disappearing for months. This is a one of a kind film where half the population would love it while the other half would hate it. The film itself is filled with spectacular visual effects and I praise the cast for their memorable acting. Yet the plot still doesn't fit together as it probably borrowed a lot of it's material from 2005's The Brothers Grimm. I give the film credit as it tries to make it an original film based off the original Grimm story of Hansel & Gretel but the film still has weak moments that bring it down just a bit."

The bastard villain of this movie gets it good well before the end of the movie which creates an air of hope during the dark and bleak climax of the film.

"StevePulaski","4","0","3","12 June 2013"," A film that defies all criticism and the reviewing process
","Does a film titled ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" even need a review to correspond with the finished product? Do the fundamentals and guidelines of film criticism/analysis even apply to such a film? This film defies the medium and all it stands for. It exists in that small little blackhole of cinema, where films that are close to ""unreviewable"" lie. Alongside films like this one are parody films, theatrical stand-up comedy releases, and some obscure others.<br/><br/>Is there even a reason to explain the plot of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters? I might as well. The film takes place in Augsburg, where the Mayor of the town hires the brother and sister duo Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) to find and kill any witches they may find. Hansel, armed with his trusty shotgun and his syringes for his insulin shots, and Gretel, with her wits and bow-and-arrow, along with this hideous troll monster, they set out to find and eliminate the witches from the forests of the city.<br/><br/>One of the first things noticeable about this tepid reworking of the classic fairytale is how grim and dingy the entire event is. I think the problem lies in the fact that the material is taken in a serious manner, rather than being campier and more alive than it should be. The same direction was taken for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a picture that was almost relentless in its bleakness and charmless ways.<br/><br/>Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, however, doesn't have two or three good scenes that buoy the entire project like the aforementioned film did. Instead, this is one depressing slog due to the material not being that interesting and the entire setup not being that creative. The set designs are probably the most impressive thing to look at here. They're a cross between Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, with more emphasis on Gothic undertones. It's too bad that the sets aren't used as much but scenic backdrops, and Hansel and Gretel are left mainly with their wits and their artillery. There is little room for improvisation, even when you're being hunted by obscure beasts. There's also little room for personality, as the title characters are nothing more than sulky, faceless characters we root for because we are expected to. They offer nothing in the way of emotion or character; they might as well have cutouts around their face that say ""Insert Face Here."" This is certainly not my kind of film. I think predominately because I see something like this as an obligation on part of the crew rather than a serious movie. Jeremy Renner, who has been on a role with Hollywood films, seemingly needs to keep doing these kinds of films so every once in a while he can take a risk like he did with The Hurt Locker. A few years prior to this film, writer/director Tommy Wirkola made a film about Nazi-zombies called Dead Snow, which was more fun to explain than to actually watch. Regardless, I'd rather see a goofy little surprise like that film more often than one about classic fairytale characters acting like two archetypal action heroes.<br/><br/>I'm constantly told that I look at films too deeply and, instead of being cynical and expect a masterpiece every time I see a film, I should look at a film as a piece of entertainment. To much surprise, I actually do. What I find entertaining and worthy of my money and what I look for in a film is drastically different from what a lot of others will look for. Rather than guttural smugness from an action film, I'd appreciate character and excitement. Rather than haphazard plot-developments, I'd prefer explanations and detail. And rather than senseless camaraderie, Id' like clarity and vision.<br/><br/>That's about as far as I'll go in my analysis. Was the film good? Does it need to have a star rating? Who knows? I'm giving it two stars, as that's halfway between good and dreadful. You should already know if you're in the target audience to see this kind of a picture. However, there was not much of a justification for seeing the film in theaters, or paying its ludicrous surcharge for the plastic 3D glasses that dim the picture and make the high-quality camera used to shoot the film look like it has dirty plastic wrap over the lens.<br/><br/>Starring: Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, and Peter Stormare. Directed by: Tommy Wirkola."

It doesn't take itself too seriously and I'm pretty sure that's what throws the majority people off. It's not meant to be an Oscar contender or even a summer blockbuster movie; it's a fun parody of an old tale. <br/><br/>Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner are pretty great to watch too as they get their butts kicked all over the place, which I really appreciate as most leads only get a few hits and then appear completely fine the next shot. Not so here.

","OK then, I just finished Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Fun film! Famke Janssen...sheesh! She did a lot of damage in that X-Men flick, but here, she's deliciously wicked and flat-out vicious as hell. I like this film because it doesn't take itself too seriously, the effects are top shelf and the overall pacing is well executed. The action sequences are nothing shy of a maniacal romp, very energetic and engaging. Them broads are hell on a broomstick! Make no mistake about it, this is not a children's movie and for some, the splatter violence may be a little over-the-top, but nonetheless lends very well to the story and those that dig splattery horror will appreciate the wet stuff here. I thought before I saw the film the casting of Jeremy Renner might be somewhat of a quirky choice. I see him as more of a dramatic actor, as anyone who's seen Dahmer or Hurt Locker might testify. He has strength in that area. So hat's off to that guy for a decent Hansel in this film. Derek Mears (Friday the 13th re-boot) has an interesting and mildly dynamic character role. I won't reveal any of the film, but I can tell you this - you will not recognize Mears. This is a target audience, formulated adventure. There is nothing new here. On the same coin, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The title is Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters - and that's exactly what you get. Recommended for a fun, non-serious romp."

","'HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Another 'hip' modern take on a classic fairy tale 'with a twist'; this one has a grown up Hansel and Gretel as bounty hunters hunting down and exterminating witches around the world. It stars Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner in the two lead roles and was written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola. Wirkola also helmed the cult classic 2009 Norwegian Nazi zombie flick 'DEAD SNOW'. This is his big budget American film debut. It's just a hell of a lot of fun if you're looking for action and good bloody gore. Also is you grew up on these dark and twisted Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and don't mind a little creative liberty taken with them, the movie's a blast as well! <br/><br/>As kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) we're abandoned by their father in the woods and kidnapped by a witch living inside a gingerbread house (they went exploring to). Planning to eat the two the witch makes Hansel stuff himself with candy while she forces Gretel to tend to an oven (which she plans to cook them in). The two kids get the better of the witch though and force her into the oven, killing her. They then grow up dedicating themselves to hunting down and killing witches. They have a special gift for this calling due to the fact that they're now immune to the spells and curses of witches (Hansel is a diabetic though, due to the fact he was forced to eat so much candy). As adult bounty hunters they're hired by the Mayor (Rainer Bock) of a town called Augsburg to rescue several children abducted by witches there. They learn that a powerful witch, by the name of Muriel (Famke Janssen), stole the children in order to sacrifice them for the ritual of Blood Moon. It's up to Hansel and Gretel to stop Muriel and her army of witches and rescue the children.<br/><br/>As you might have expected the movie is full of dark humor and plays out a little like a spoof but not entirely. The film is actually full of graphic gratuitous gore and is surprisingly action packed. When Hansel and Gretel are kicking witch ass the movie is at it's most fun. The film's sense of humor never gets in the way of it being a very well executed, slick and cool action film and the gore and creature elements of the film will please any die-hard horror fan. The movie did get mostly poor reviews from critics and disappointed at the American box-office (barely making it's budget back) but it made a huge profit overseas and got awesome reviews from horror critics and fans (as well as action lovers). The film has some CGI but also uses classic old school monster movie effects. Derek Mears (of 'Jason Voorhees' and 'Predator' fame, in the latest franchise installments) makes a cool appearance as a troll named Edward, Arterton is gorgeous and makes a cool kick-ass action heroine and Wirkola's directing is extremely stylized and viscerally cool. The movie is just a lot of fun (like I said) and sure to please most die-hard genre fans.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVxCgCFIf8"

The only thing that doesn't make sense, is the contradiction to the script including the swearing. It almost feels the time and date of the events displayed in the movie did not match what was being verbalized when they were to use profanities.

The choice o actors was really well thought-out and they had the one guy from Avengers, the bow and arrow guy, I forgot his name but he was a really cool character in this movie and I thought that he did a superb job.

"TheSquiss","6","0","2","16 March 2013"," A fun, bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods.
","In 2005, Terry Gilliam suffered a rare blip in his mesmerising career when he served up The Brothers Grimm. Presumably, what he was aiming for was something along the lines of this loose adaptation-cum-extension of one of the brother's best-loved tales. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters picks up the abandoned siblings' story many years later, far more streetwise (um, forestwise?) and with an insatiable desire for witch obliteration; removal of the head is fun but nothing beats a good burning, apparently.<br/><br/>As silly as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and just as much fun, this is a bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods that doesn't pretend to be anything other than disposable, claret-splattering entertainment. It's a fast, violent gore-fest that doesn't take itself remotely seriously but still delivers enough quality punches to be satisfying.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters has 'franchise' written all over it with Gemma Arterton challenging Kate Beckinsale for the 'vamp with guns' crown from but, whereas Selene pouts and kicks ass with an undercurrent of darkness and the hope we'll take her seriously in the Underworld chronicles, Gretel is just out to have fun and kill as many evil bitches along the way as possible. In a duel, my money would still be on Selene but the new, Gretel-shaped, killing machine in town might just take over at the box office and she's a lot more fun to watch.<br/><br/>Gore splattered after the messy demise of another hex victim, Gretel expels an exasperated thought to no one in particular: ""The curse of hunger for crawling things! I f*****g hate that one!"" It's a moment to relish in a delightfully messy film that refuses to shy away from the blood splatter and gore.<br/><br/>Thumbs up to writer/director Tommy Wirkola who deals with the awkward backstory (for those who somehow missed out on fairy tales in childhood) pre-titles and brings us up to date via newspaper clippings as the titles are splashed across the screen. This feels like a boyhood dream project of his that's finally come to fruition and is littered with subtle comedic moments as he melds the modern approach with period setting; milk bottles have 'missing child' posters hung around their necks and later Hansel (Jeremy Renner) laments his diabetes, the result of being force fed candy by their childhood witch. Get that: the moralistic side of slaughter! Although this should be a double act vehicle, Renner seems a little lost in the events. Certainly he has his moments in the sun but this feels like Arterton's film with Renner there to make her and arch villainess, Muriel (Famke Janssen) look good. Hansel's awkwardness with the is she/isn't she witch suspect, Mina (Pihla Vitala), is weak and the evolving relationship is stilted and superficial so as to be almost irrelevant.<br/><br/>Janssen clearly has a ball chewing scenery and generally being nasty in fancy dress, perhaps doing her damndest to shake off her dreary, constricting character of last year's Taken 2. She succeeds admirably with just the right amount of melodrama to make it amusing without being laughable.<br/><br/>The other supporting characters, Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare) chief amongst them, are simply there as cannon fodder and the inclusion of Hansel & Gretel's own groupie and a disillusioned troll are plonked in to fill some gaps with a view to filling out their characters in the inevitable sequel. It's not a problem but with a little more attention to the peripheral characters, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters might have been a fuller experience instead of just disposable entertainment.<br/><br/>As with Dredd last year, 2D screenings are in short supply and so I was forced to suffer another jarring, juddering display in the third dimension with gimmickry the order of the day instead of depth of field and a more exquisite canvas à la Hugo. It's a horrible experience, it detracts from the fun and it's painful to watch at times, but still the money-grabbing Hollywood execs foist it upon us. Bah! If you can find a 2D print of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, go for it. If you can't, wait for the DVD and watch it on a HUGE TV with a couple of beers and a friend who enjoys splatter and gore as much as you.<br/><br/>Don't take it seriously, watch it once, enjoy it, move on.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Writer-director Tommy Wirkola hit the nail on the head with this sequel to the original fairytale, armed with some awesome weapons, this violent spin was amusing to watch. 15 years after their ordeal as children where Hansel and Gretal burned the witch in the fire, they have turned into kick-ass witch murderers saving young children from ruthless witches.<br/><br/>The film shows us exactly what it promises an absurd horror where many witches are slaughtered, they are burned, punched and shot. Gemma Arterton plays the tempestuous Gretal who's mixture of precision fighting and use of weaponry excites the watcher especially any young men that like watching a fiery young women abolish evil witches. Jeremy Renner plays the distant but alluring Hansel, different from his sister he keeps his distance from people as much as he can. Apart from a scene were he skinny dips with a white witch, this could be classed as a bit of eye candy for any women watching.<br/><br/>Besides all the blood and gore there are some heartfelt moments, however I think this is mainly to slow down the accelerated pace of the brawling scenes. The film also has a comic edge to it with its cheesy one liners, I also personally like the first scene were we are properly introduced to Gretal. The sheriff of the town is about to burn an innocent women at the stake accusing her of witchcraft, but when Hansel and Gretal tell him she's not a witch he starts to become brash so Gretal headbutts him.<br/><br/>The film also lives up to its creepy classification because the witches are vile and grotesque but brilliant. The main witch played by Famke Janssen is black-hearted, dark and mysterious, she plays the character really well. This film is definitely not like the original fairytale as it's not for children because the witches are scary, their special effects are fantastic.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have of the film is that its very predictable, it is obvious what is going to happen but still worth watching. From the end of the film, I get the impression a sequel may arise in the future, so we will see. I will definitely be watching!!"

","After seeing this great movie a few times here in Cinemas in Munich, this movie is now one of my FAVORITES Movies in 2013!<br/><br/>I'm very impressed, how it changed to his version of the good-old fairy-tale Hänsel&Gretel. And I'm very happy, that it was produced here in Germany too.<br/><br/>This movie has lots of action, many funny moments, nice new ideas, good fight scenes and a good performance from the actor and actresses. The funny scenes and moments are very amusing in the audience in the cinema. Between then, there is a little background-story (yes, a story, u read it right!), and many bloody fights, that has also good and funny moments of that. I Think the balance is very well between Action, Story, Blood, the new Ideas and Fun.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are playing very good their role as Hänsel & Gretel, I'm very impressed.<br/><br/>So, You should see the movie, to make a opinion yourself. Im going with lots of friends, their are also impressed about this ""Other-Fairy-Tale"" Movie :)<br/><br/>By the way, i like always 2D.

","It certainly looks like Hollywood is taking the old fairy tales that we grew up with as kids and turning them into adult action movies. The trend started with Red Riding Hood, which was a werewolf movie, and then we had Snow White and the Huntsman, which was sort of like a fantasy film, and now we have this film, which, I must say, is the best of them so far. Now we have Jack the Giant Slayer to look forward to later on in the year, and I wonder if the trend is going to continue along the same path after that.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous films, which sort of stuck closely to the original story, Hansel & Gretal moves in a different direction, dealing with the two children who were imprisoned in a house made of candy after they escaped and grew up. Basically, they had been orphaned, and after killing one witch, got a taste for witch hunting, so collected an arsenal of exotic weapons (for the period, which I suspect is 18th century Germany) and then travelled around Europe hunting witches.<br/><br/>The concept in an of itself could have simply opened it up to a television series, so when we approach this film we wonder if it is simply an episode in the life of these siblings, and in a way it seems as such. We hear of some of their exploits beforehand (through newspaper articles and some followers), but the movie really focuses on one particular episode in their lives, which in the end turns out to be interconnected with their lives from when they were kids.<br/><br/>The period is set during the time in Europe when women were hunted and burnt at the stake for being witches. Hansel pretty much does not care whether a woman is a witch or not. He seems to have this particular hatred and distrust of humanity, and if it looks bad, then he will kill it. As such, Gretal is the brains of the outfit, having learned to determine a normal person from a witch (being a witch tends to create a rot so that if you do practice witchcraft, and surprisingly only women are witches in this film, it begins to have an affect upon you).<br/><br/>I do like the fact that they chose a rather average looking person to play the role of Gretal. She is not some drop dead gorgeous Hollywood actress that you would expect to see in such films (take for instance Angelina Jolie, not that I find her all that attractive anyway, nor am I particularly drawn to her films). I do prefer the more average, realistic, woman playing such roles in films, but then again I prefer more average looking realistic women, as opposed to the unrealistic goddesses that seem to dominate our screens and have an adverse effect upon our society (such as guys needing to have a drop dead gorgeous girlfriend from them to be a success as a man, and for a woman to be drop dead gorgeous to be a success as a woman)."

","it is its basic virtue. and it is enough because it is not more than link of chain of fairy tale adaptation passion of some directors. it is correct, charming and without great ambition except fun. it is not a sacrilege against original story and it may be almost credible. and sure, it is a ball of make-up, action, scenes of fight, magic lines, medieval - contemporary atmosphere, glorious victories of good guy and his impressive sister, special effects and not so bad characters. a game with some taste of childhood period. and MTV pieces as mark of identification for new generations. not great but it is not waste of time. if the expectations are not great. and, if the joy to play ancient games survives."
"gstepup","9","0","4","12 February 2013"," Danish director Tommy Wirkola, only 34l, capably directs a fairy tale with an inventive twist; Famke Janssen is perfect femme fatale
","HANSEL AND GRETEL starts just like the 1812 published fairy tale (Grimm Brothers based it on German legends) -- two young siblings being abandoned by their parents, and encountering a gingerbread house owned by an ugly witch. Inventively, the film inserts newspaper clippings (made to look ancient) chronicling what happens after Hansel and Gretel's shocking feat of that first witch and their being fearless witch-hunters, tracking down every last witch and exterminating them from the world. As Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) enter a new town, they encounter an antagonistic sheriff (Peter Stormare), a hapless mayor who has wisely hired the witch-hunters to help rid the town of the terrorist hags, missing children, more frightful and powerful witches... and even a troll. The town's major crisis is the coming Blood Moon, for which the coven needs the heart of 12 children for unimaginable and unlimited powers. The mystery of why Hansel and Gretel's parents abandoned them unravels, as the troll inexplicably saves Gretel from the dastardly Sheriff Berringer and his henchmen. Hansel is also provided a love interest in the young woman (Pihla Viitala) they earlier rescue from charges of being a witch -- or is she? To reveal more would render me an insufferable spoilsport (I've just outlined the key scenes), but suffice it to say that Renner (fresh from the success of the Manila-shot BOURNE LEGACY) and Arterton (still indelibly imprinted in my mind from her film appearances, nymphlike, from PRINCE OF PERSIA and CLASH OF THE TITANS, both 2010) are up to the task, with terrific martial arts/fight scenes, and Famke Janssen (whom everybody knows as Jean Grey) is deliciously luminous as the would-be queen of witches, Muriel. Janssen (my favorite actress after Rebecca de Mornay) is always a delight to watch, and here she relishes every scene she's in, despite the frightful witch makeup that covers her Danish beauty. Even the ""two ugly sisters"" (of Muriel) are no weak ladies, ready to combat Hansel (or Gretel). Atli Örvarsson's moody music, and the atmospheric set pieces of 1800s Germany, well-photographed by Michael Bonvillain, enhance the flashy, well-choreographed direction of Tommy Wirkola (a 34-year-old Norwegian filmmaker who only has three directorial credits before HANSEL!)."
"alucard_castlevania86","9","0","2","12 February 2013"," Great Cast, Great Story, Great Film
","Just came back from Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters and a really great film. Both characters played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arteton did really well and so did Famke Jennson who played the witch<br/><br/>The story itself was very entertaining and had a few laughter's in it. This is one of Renner's best performances so far (2nd to Aaron Cross in my opinion). Gemma Arteton was also great and it was surprising to see her acted Gretel the way she did since I've always considered her more of the damsel in distress kind of girl<br/><br/>Overall, a great film and well worth the wait after its release disappointingly had to be postponed from from being shown last year but I guess they made the right choice"
"letic-ivan","10","0","4","11 February 2013"," Killing witches 101 (My first review ever)
","Well, I had an awesome day and wanted to see something entertaining. Went to cinema and got exactly what I wanted. It almost has nothing to do with original story, it is a pile of very enjoyable effects, violence, some jokes and like many other movies these days just pure nothing when it comes to complex story... but, hell, I wanted an adrenaline shot and I am full of adrenaline now. Also, I can't remember what movie was commercial for before this movie started, but I liked it! I need 2 more lines hmmm... well don't bring your kids to the screening, it contains things that can affect their innocent little minds like blood, and more blood, and fighting, and blood... but when I think about it, kids now days play violent games, TV is full of it too, OK, yeah, they can come too. But don't bring very young kids, that's just not OK, man."
"jaguiar313","6","0","2","1 February 2013"," Amusing fairy tale based flick could have used a bit more fun to make it really click.
","When you go to see a movie called Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters, obviously you don't go in expecting Shakespeare but, I did expect it to have a bit more of the giddy fun that Tommy Wirkola brought to his gory zombie blast, Dead Snow. And while I was amused and entertained by H&G, it actually took itself a little too seriously for a film about fairy tale characters grown up to be vengeful witch hunters. With an outlandish story like this, I can appreciate giving the material some respect and not making a joke out of it but, to really make it work you have to give it a bit more over the top like Wirkola did so well with Dead Snow. H&G has action that is bloody and fast moving but, the film needed a bit more of a sense of humor then a few curse laden quips and breaking the same person's nose, twice. This story of the fairy tale siblings coming up against a very powerful witch (Famke Janssen) with a devious plot to free her kind from the dangers of fire resembles the far more ridiculous Van Helsing to a degree but, could have used a bit of that flick's over the top energy, just not as out of control (though that does make VH a 'so bad it's good' treat). The film is well done and uses a lot more practical effects then expected and the minimal use of CGI was very refreshing. The cast handles their parts very well with Renner and Arterton having a good time as the bad ass witch killers and they played their roles with a serious approach but, not without a quick wink every now and then to let you know they are having a good time. Famke Janssen plays her part as the formidable witch with some over the top relish and that made a nice contrast to her stoic adversaries. Rounding out the cast Peter Stormare isn't given much to do as the town sheriff who is not happy that H&G have come to do his job but, he is more lively here then in The Last Stand. The film looks great. The sets and costumes are really nicely designed as are the various witches and their Troll, Edward (Derek Mears). The cinematography is lush and the locations beautiful. Visually this is a really cool flick. But, as said, Wirkola gives us a fast pace and some nice gory action scenes to entertain us but, he just needed to inject a little more fun in the proceedings to make this a real standout treat. Overall I did enjoy it but, it could have been so much more of a blast if Wirkola wasn't trying a bit too hard to not turn the material into a joke. There is a fine line to making a movie like this and Dead Snow proves he can walk it just fine. So why didn't he? An amusing enough viewing but, kinda forgettable when all is said and done."
